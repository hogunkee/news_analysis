0,LUV,"The stock market liked, but didn't love, news of better-than-expected job growth in February as major stock indexes closed out the week with modest gains.The Nasdaq composite's five-week win streak came to an end, but not by much. The tech-laden index rose 0.4%, but fell nearly 0.2% for the week. The S&P 500's six-week win streak also ended. It gained 0.3% Friday; down 0.4% for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.2%, but lost 0.5% for the week. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in about 10% lower than Thursday. Nasdaq volume ended close to Thursday's level.Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by nearly 2-to-1.Chip names like Lam Research (LRCX), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Broadcom (AVGO) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, with gains of around 2% each.February employment numbers came in better than expected, just like the ADP report earlier in the week. February nonfarm payrolls rose to 235,000, nicely above the consensus estimate of 200,000. The unemployment ticked lower, as expected, to 4.7%.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, April WTI crude oil lost another 1.6% to $48.49 a barrel. For the week, it lost 9%, partly due to a government report earlier in the week that showed an 8.2-million-barrel weekly rise in domestic crude supplies to a record level of 528.4 million barrels.In the stock market today, the airline group held up relatively well despite a big dive by Southwest Airlines (LUV) after the company lowered its unit revenue guidance. Shares recovered nicely off lows but still fell 0.8%. American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) also gave weak forecasts earlier in the week.Southwest is testing support at the 10-week moving average for the second time after a breakout from a cup-shaped base with a 48.10 buy point.In IPO news, IT services provider Presidio (PSDO) had an unspectacular debut after pricing last night at 14, at the low end of  a proposed range of 14-16. Shares were recently trading around 14.25.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Dave & Buster's (PLAY) were solid gainers in the IBD 50. Ulta Beauty reversed higher, rising nearly 5% to 286.42, after the company reported its sixth straight quarter of 20%+ earnings and sales growth. It's still in buy range from a prior 274.09 buy point. Dave & Buster's picked up close to 2% to 59.62. It's still in buy range after reclaiming a 58.35 buy point.In the coming week, a two-day Fed meeting concludes Wednesday with an interest rate hike pretty much a slam dunk at this point. It's also a busy week of economic data with reports on consumer and wholesale inflation, retail sales, housing starts, manufacturing and consumer confidence.The coming week is quiet on the earnings front with only a handful of notable names reporting, including Oracle (ORCL), Jabil Circuit (JBL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Tiffany & Co.

"
1,LUV,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) lowered its first-quarter unit revenue outlook Friday, after Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) trimmed their guidance for the key metric earlier this week.After upbeat forecasts on unit revenue from the industry late last year and early this year, carriers now appear to be dialing back those expectations, amid worries the capacity discipline that lead to improvements over the last few years may be slipping.Southwest now sees Q1 unit revenue falling 2%-3%, down from an earlier prediction for no change to a 1% dip.The discount airline cited a better-than-expected February completion rate, which boosts capacity, and the loss of traffic from heavy rainfall in California.
"
2,LUV,"But Southwest also noted ""unexpected softness in close-in demand"" in the latter part of February, referring to last-minute bookings, though it has rebounded in March.Shares closed down 0.85% to 55.88 on the stock market today, erasing most of its intraday loss. Delta rose 1.4% and American climbed 1.3%, both reversing higher from modest losses. United Airlines (UAL), which kept its Q1 unit revenue view unchanged, fell 0.3%.Meanwhile JetBlue soared 5.1%. The carrier said February traffic rose 0.1% as capacity climbed 0.7%. JetBlue sees first-quarter unit revenue down 4%-5%, citing a big impact from the shift of the Easter holiday to April this year from March.On Thursday, American said it now sees Q1 total unit revenue growing 1.5%-3.5%, down from an earlier forecast for growth of 2.5%-4.5%, citing an improved rate of flight cancellations vs. a year ago that pushed capacity up. American still sees an adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5% in Q1.On Monday, Delta said it sees flat Q1 unit revenue vs. an prior forecast for no change to a 2% increase, sparking a sell-off in airline stocks. It also trimmed its Q1 operating margin forecast to 10%-11% from 11%-13%.The company said unit revenue saw ""a more moderate pace of improvement in February than initially anticipated.""
"
3,LUV,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) dropped on Monday after Delta cut its first-quarter outlook and President Trump signed his second attempt at a travel ban.The new travel restrictions affect six largely Muslim nations — Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — and take hold on March 16. The revised order excludes Iraq, a nation seen as crucial to the fight against ISIS, but blocks travel to the U.S. from the other six nations for 90 days.The order issued Monday said that Iraq presents a ""special case"" and that the nation's relationship with the U.S. and its ""commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq.""The new order also suspends the entry of any refugee for 120 days but does not bar Syrian refugees indefinitely, as the first order did. The order also doesn't bar dual citizens and green-card and visa holders.The administration said the restrictions — both in the new order and the initial one signed on Jan. 27 that has since been left for dead in the federal courts — were necessary for security reasons and would give the U.S. time to make sure its vetting procedures for incoming travelers were sufficient.""This executive order provides a needed pause, so we can carefully review how we scrutinize people coming here from these countries of concern,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday in prepared remarks.The new ban comes the same day as a report from travel research firm ForwardKeys that showed international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5% from Jan. 28 to Feb. 4, the days between when the first travel ban was implemented and then suspended by the Department of Homeland Security.Confusion ensued as agencies tried to figure out how to implement the first travel ban, and protesters flooded airports.The U.S. airlines have no direct flights to the seven countries affected, Cowen said in a note at the end of January, but said alliance partners could be affected.While Cowen said it expected ""minimal"" financial impact from the ban issued in January, the firm expressed concern about the broader impact such restrictions would have on tourism.Meanwhile, the day-to-day focus on airlines' margins, costs and attempts to balance supply and demand continued on Monday. In a conference presentation, Delta cut its first-quarter operating margin forecast to 10%-11% and its outlook for passenger unit revenue to roughly flat. In January, the carrier said it expected 11%-13% operating margin for Q1 and for passenger unit revenue to be flat to up 2%.The company cited higher fuel and labor costs, following the recovery in oil prices and new contracts with employees, as reasons for the weaker outlook.Delta also said first-quarter unit revenue, a key industry metric that measures revenue by way of overall flight capacity, was on pace to come in at the low end of its forecast ""given a more moderate pace of improvement in February than initially anticipated."" Delta reported flat passenger unit revenue for February.However, Delta said unit revenue should improve throughout the year on the back of strong postelection demand and better business-travel trends, among other things. The carrier also stuck with its expectations for first-quarter capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flight coverage — to be flat to down 1%.Delta Air Lines fell 2.55% to 48.65 in the stock market today, tumbling through its 50-day moving average. American Air and United lost 3.2%. Southwest (LUV) retreated 2.2%. Alaska Air Group (ALK) descended 2.4%.Trump's Jan. 27 executive order, which was blocked last month by a U.S. appeals court, indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from coming into the U.S. and placed a roughly four-month ban on all refugees. The order also blocked for three months anyone coming from seven predominantly Muslim nations: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.IBD'S TAKE: While Trump's travel ban has raised concerns about travel demand, he has vowed to roll back regulations for the airline industry, lifting shares of U.S. carriers. He has met with airline executives and, on Friday, his administration halted some Obama-era consumer-protection measures. Bookings from the seven countries affected by the first travel ban plunged 80% over that time and fell 23% from the Middle East and Africa overall, the ForwardKeys report said.Demand recovered after the travel ban was suspended, the report showed, but weakened near the end of last month as the administration signaled it would issue a revised travel ban.RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpBuffett's Berkshire Piles On Shares Of Apple, Airlines, Cuts Wal-MartCan Delta, United, American Declare Mission Accomplished In 2017?

4,LUV,"The Trump administration will review two rules proposed by the Obama administration that would make it easier for customers to compare airfare options and fees — potentially bad news for air travelers but apparently much better news for shares of carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV).In notices dated Thursday, the Department of Transportation suspended the public comment period for both of the Obama-era measures. The suspension, each notice said, ""will allow the President's appointees the opportunity to review and consider this action.""One of the measures, from October, requested details from the industry to examine airlines' marketing methods and the way information related to airfares and flights is displayed — or not displayed — on travel websites.The other measure, a proposal shortly before President Trump's inauguration, would require airlines to show bag fees up front when a potential flyer evaluates ticket prices.Shares of Delta edged up 0.3% on the stock market today. On Thursday, it reported flat passenger unit revenue for February, disappointing analysts and raising questions of whether it can turn the metric positive in Q1. American rose 2.4%, United rallied 3.15%, and Southwest climbed 2.2%.Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the ultra-budget, fee-heavy carrier, added 2.9%, JetBlue (JBLU) gained 1.6% and Alaska Air Group (ALK) rose 2.7%.IBD'S TAKE: While month-to-month concerns persist about airlines' ability to keep their supply of flights in line with demand, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has embraced the industry after long steering clear.While Trump's now-blocked immigration restrictions briefly sank airline stocks amid concerns about the order's impact on travel demand, airline stocks have largely risen since his election.Travel demand has strengthened, and Trump has vowed to cut regulations and modernize infrastructure for the industry.RELATED:How Trump Helped Airline Stocks Reach Skyward Today

5,LUV,"With earnings improving and billions invested by Warren Buffett, the airline industry has been seeing plenty of positive news. While one of the airline leaders is extended, others are within striking distance of buy points, indicating that the overall industry may been in the process of another leg upward. The first leg of the uptrend began in last summer and lasted through…
"
6,LUV,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) has maintained a ""disciplined,"" ""investor-focused"" plan for flight capacity, an analyst said Thursday. United Airlines? Maybe less so.That analyst, Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore ISI, upgraded Delta to outperform, citing the carrier's plans to cap its increase of available seats and flight coverage to 1% until unit revenue turns ""solidly positive.""""Airlines have no control over big inputs like demand, fuel (and weather),"" he wrote in a research note. ""The one variable they do control is capacity. Higher reliability supports more dynamic planning.""He also said Delta had a ""higher sense of urgency on margins"" and more forgiving year-over-year unit-revenue comparisons than rivals for the second half of this year. Delta has said it would likely be able to grow margins during the back half of this year, after recent labor agreements with employees constrained them.Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) is ""abandoning its commitment to shareholders to keep its capacity growth below GDP,"" Pfennigwerth wrote. He downgraded United's stock to in-line from outperform.United Airlines shares fell 0.9% to 67.56 on the stock market today, off session lows of 66.44. Delta Air climbed 0.5%. Both stocks rebounded from four-month lows Wednesday intraday.Southwest Airlines (LUV) fell 0.3% and American Airlines (AAL) rose 0.1%. Southwest is trying to hold above its 50-day line after retaking that support area on Wednesday. American Air rebounded from a 200-day line test on Wednesday.After airlines late last year began to shore up unit revenue, concerns from analysts have resurfaced this year that airlines might try to re-accelerate capacity growth, potentially adding new flights to different areas in attempt to take market share. More flights gives consumers more options, but it means more competition for airlines.""While there may be numerous practical company specific reasons to increase domestic capacity growth plans by 200 b.p. following softer industry revenue trends YTD,"" Pfennigwerth wrote Thursday, ""it appears completely tone deaf to long term investors' primary concerns.""United at a conference Wednesday raised its full-year capacity outlook, hiking domestic capacity to 3.5%-4.5% growth from a range of 1.5%-2.5%. The carrier said it expects global capacity growth of 2.5%-3.5%, up from 1%-2%.United last month said it planned to add service to 31 destinations in the U.S. and Europe over the spring and summer, including by widening its domestic network to include smaller cities. The carrier also plans to add a seasonal flight between San Francisco and Munich starting on May 24.IBD'S TAKE: United has looked toward smaller cities as a way to relieve competitive strain in primary hubs and the market abroad. But over the Atlantic, the big three U.S. carriers have been searching for ways to ward off a newer breed of low-cost, long-haul carrier.The upgrade to Delta and downgrade to United come during a full week for the airline industry. Thousands of cancellations have resulted from Winter Storm Stella in the northeast, sinking shares of U.S. airlines earlier in the week. Then, on Wednesday, some airlines presented at the JPMorgan Aviation, Transportation & Industrials Conference.Later on Wednesday, a federal judge in Hawaii temporarily halted the parts of President Trump's new executive order that barred all refugees from coming into the U.S. and blocked the entry of anyone without a green card or visa from six predominantly Muslim nations deemed a terrorism risk. The order was set to go into effect on Thursday. Analysts have worried such restrictions will hurt travel demand.Trump, during a rally in Nashville on Wednesday evening, vowed to defend the ban, saying the government would take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.""And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place,"" he said.The administration's first attempt at a travel ban in January caused chaos at airports. It died days later after getting as far as a federal appeals court, which upheld a lower court's ruling suspending the immigration restrictions.""The illogic of the Government's contentions is palpable,"" the Wednesday decision said. ""The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.""RELATED:Southwest Joins Delta, American In Cutting Unit Revenue ForecastBuffett's Berkshire Piles On Shares Of Apple, Airlines, Cuts Wal-Mart

7,LUV,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC Monday what he likes about Apple (AAPL) and hinted that his company may not make anymore big purchases in Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).Berkshire's Apple position is now at 133 million shares, more than twice the 61.24 million shares disclosed in Buffett's annual shareholder letter released Saturday.""We bought a lot more Apple after year-end,"" said Buffett in the interview, praising Apple for having a ""sticky"" product that is ""enormously useful"" to people who use it.Notably, Buffett himself isn't an iPhone user. When asked about his technology investments, he whipped out a flip phone from his coat pocket.Berkshire's latest purchase also didn't coincide with a drop in Apple's stock, which has shot up since 2017 began. Berkshire previously bought shares in Q3 and Q4, when Apple was hit by fears of slowing smartphone sales.But Buffett said the new shares were purchased before the company's earnings report, which sparked a 13% rally. ""It's at a price different than I would buy it now,"" Buffett said.Apple shares were up 0.2% at 136.93 in the stock market today. Berkshire Hathaway's B shares edged up 0.2% to 170.59, still in buy range after breaking out earlier this month.Buffett also told CNBC that his stakes in airlines are ""about the same,"" and suggested they wouldn't go up much higher. His purchases of airline stocks in Q3 and Q4, after years of avoiding the sector, sparked speculation that Berkshire might even buy and airline outright.But with positions of more than 7% in Delta, Southwest, United and American, Buffett said he generally prefers to not boost stakes above 10%, saying ""It complicates life for us.""Still, he sounded rather optimistic on the sector, joking that airlines had ""a bad first century.""""They're kind of like the Chicago Cubs. Everybody has a bad century now and then,"" he said. ""And they got that century out of the way, I hope.""Delta Air and Southwest shares fell fractionally while United and American edged higher.RELATED:As Berkshire Buys Apple, Which Stocks Make 'Warren Buffett Screen'?5 Key Points From Warren Buffett's Letter, Berkshire Hathaway Earnings

8,LUV,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett praised ""ambitious"" immigrants' contribution to the ""miraculous"" American story, rejected claims that stock buybacks are ""un-American"" and ripped Wall Street investment fees in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholders on Saturday. Meanwhile, Berkshire reported declining operating profit but big unrealized gains in last year's investments in Apple (AAPL), American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers paying off.The typically optimistic Buffett said that stocks are ""virtually certain"" to rise in years to come. And he hailed America, with an implicit rebuke of anti-immigrant sentiment.""One word sums up our country's achievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago ' a span of time less than triple my days on earth ' Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.""As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people have come close to calling them un-American ' characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors. That simply isn't the case: Both American corporations and private investors are today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I'm not aware of any enticing project that in recent years has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)He pointed out that many companies that Berkshire invests in, including Bank of America (BAC), have been buying back shares. ""We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. ... When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.""Buffett said that wealthy Americans have been suckered out of more than $100 billion over the past decade seeking ""superior investment advice.""""When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients,"" he wrote. ""Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds.""But Buffett had nothing but praise for Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, who popularized ultra-low fee index funds.""If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle,"" Buffett wrote.Buffett didn't offer hints about his possible M&A plan and was mum about Kraft Heinz (KHC), which made a short-lived $143 merger bid for Unilever (UN) this month. Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil's 3G Capital own about 50% of Kraft Heinz.Net income rose 15% to $6.29 billion, boosted by a $1.1 billion gain from investments and derivatives. But operating profit fell 6% to $2,665 per Class A share, below analyst forecasts for $2716.60.Berkshire's equity portfolio was worth $122 billion at year-end vs. $102.5 billion on Sept. 30. Big holdings such as Wells Fargo (WFC) and American Express (AXP) were big year-end winners as financials rallied.Buffett also boosted its stakes in Apple, Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines, United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV).Berkshire acquired 61.2 million shares for $6.75 billion at an average prices of 110.17. That stake has risen by $1.6 billion as of Friday's close at 136.66. Berkshire holds a 44% gain in its Southwest stake, 35% in United and 21% in Delta Air.RELATED:What Would Warren Buffett Do?

12,LUV,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) vastly increased its stake in Apple (AAPL) in the fourth quarter while slashing its positions in Wal-Mart (WMT) and Verizon (VZ), according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.Berkshire boosted its stake in the iPhone maker to 57.4 million shares, up from 15.2 million in the prior quarter. Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also increased its stake in Apple by 11% to more than 5.8 million shares.After long steering clear of the industry, Buffett also continued to load up on shares of airlines, adding 23.8 million to his American Airlines (AAL) stake, 53.7 million to Delta Air Lines (DAL) and 24.4 million to United Airlines (UAL) as well as taking a new, 43.2 million-share stake in Southwest Airlines (LUV).He cut all but 928 shares worth of his stake in Verizon, and cut his stake in Wal-Mart from about 15 million shares to around 1.4 million shares.Apple is the top performing stock on the Dow Jones industrial average in 2017. Verizon is the Dow's worst performer in 2017 and over the last six months. Wal-Mart is the second worst-performer on the Dow in the past six months.Apple edged up 0.2% late, after setting a new all-time high in the stock market today.

13,LUV,"Executives from Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), JetBlue (JBLU), Southwest (LUV) and others met with President Trump at the White House on Thursday.As the meeting began, Trump said he would work to cut ""burdensome regulations"" in their industry and said the current air-traffic control system is obsolete. The president also said he would have an announcement related to taxes in the next few weeks.Gulf-carrier competition, which for years has been a major sore point for the U.S. network carriers, was not discussed, apparently, despite widespread expectations it would be high on Thursday's agenda.When asked by CNBC after the meeting if the subject came up, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the focus of the meeting was ""solely"" on taxes, regulations and the need for infrastructure investments.However, Trump did allude to looming competition from abroad during introductory remarks at the meeting.""I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers — I've been hearing that a little bit,"" he said. ""At the same time, we want to make life good for them also. They come with big investments. In many cases, those investments are made by their governments.""Trump's executive order suspending immigration and refugees from seven largely Muslim nations deemed a security risk was not on the agenda, Bloomberg said. Airline stocks sank after that order was signed, on Jan. 27, amid concerns that it would hurt travel demand. Late Thursday, a U.S. appeals court upheld a lower court's suspension of the ban.Executives from Alaska Air Group (ALK), FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) were also set to attend, Bloomberg said. American Airlines' (AAL) CEO, Doug Parker, did not attend due to an already-scheduled management conference taking place.Delta shares were up 2.6% on the stock market today, while American rose 2.75% and United advanced 1.8%. JetBlue added 3.5%, Southwest rose 3% and Alaska Air rallied 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Norwegian Air International is an Irish subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, whose low-cost trans-Atlantic flights already pose more competition to Delta, American and United. The big three are trying a variety of cheap and expensive seats to compete. Following the meeting, statements from the airlines also notably left out any mention of the Gulf carriers.JetBlue: ""Today we had an extremely encouraging conversation with the president about modernizing our air traffic control system to reduce frustrating flight delays and further improve aviation safety. Everyone agreed we need an infrastructure plan that will once again give the American public an aviation system we can be proud of.""United: ""We share the President's passion for the tremendous opportunity this country has and his commitment to protecting and creating American jobs. We look forward to working together with the President on the many initiatives and issues that will make America better and the U.S. aviation industry the best in the world. This includes modernizing our aviation infrastructure and cutting the red tape that gets in the way of our industry's ability to deliver the best experience for our employees and customers.""Delta: ""We had a positive discussion about many of the major issues facing U.S. travelers, airline employees and the aviation industry, which is a vital economic engine for America.""The big three U.S. airlines have repeatedly complained that three Persian Gulf-region carriers — Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad — benefit from government subsidies that give them more room to expand and compete in the U.S. The Gulf carriers, in turn, have repeatedly denied that claim.The subsidies, the U.S. airlines say, violate the Open Skies agreements that facilitate cross-border service.""If left unchecked we will continue to see the Gulf carriers expand in the U.S. market, causing further harm to hard working Americans,"" CEOs from Delta, American and United said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. ""In fact, for every long-haul route lost or foregone as a result of subsidized Gulf carrier competition, more than 1,500 American jobs are lost.""But a battle could be heating up over those agreements. CEOs of JetBlue, Hawaiian Holdings' (HA) Hawaiian Airlines, FedEx Express and Atlas Air (AAWW), in a letter dated Tuesday, urged Tillerson to reject the big three's demands to clamp down U.S. access to the Gulf carriers. Their letter, which expressed support for maintaining global Open Skies arrangements, said those demands ""would jeopardize Open Skies and reduce competition in an already overly concentrated U.S. airline market.""U.S. carriers also argue that Norwegian Air International's recently approved service to the U.S. would allow the carrier to dodge labor and safety rules, Bloomberg said.Trump also said he wanted travelers ""to have the greatest customer service with an absolute minimum of delays, and with the greatest convenience all at the lowest possible cost.""Those remarks follow the bruising that airline stocks took for much of last year and 2015 after airlines dropped fare prices in some markets to lure passengers. That competition damaged unit revenue, an important industry metric that gauges how much money an airline makes compared to its supply of seats and flights.Meanwhile, American Airlines said earlier Thursday that passenger traffic for January fell 0.3%, while carrying capacity rose 1.2%. American backed its first-quarter forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% increase in unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5%.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticJetBlue Trims Capacity, Delta Upgraded, Ryanair Warns On EuropeAlaska Air Beats Q4 Forecasts; Trump, Carriers To MeetAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back Up

14,LUV,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) on Wednesday topped fourth-quarter estimates and hiked its dividend, reporting for the first time since completing its acquisition of Virgin America.Estimates: Adjusted earnings per share down 4% to $1.40, with overall revenue up 5% to $1.444 billion. The West-Coast-centric carrier, in an investor update last month, said it expected unit revenue to be roughly flat from a year ago.Nonfuel unit costs were also expected to be roughly flat, potentially making the carrier unique in an industry facing higher expenses after striking new agreements with staff, Cowen & Co. noted.Results: Adjusted EPS, excluding costs related to its mid-December Virgin American takeover, rose to $1.56. Revenue climbed 11% to $1.52 billion. Q4 traffic swelled 13% on a 10.3% capacity increase, including Virgin. Unit revenue rose 0.3% but passenger unit revenue fell 0.9%. Operating costs excluding fuel and special item edged up 0.1%.Alaska Air also raised its quarterly dividend to 30 cents from 27.5 cents.Outlook: Q1 non-fuel unit costs to remain flat when factoring in earlier financials from Virgin America.Stock: Shares jumped more than 4% early to new highs but pared gains by the afternoon, closing up 3.3% at 97.19 on the stock market today. Southwest (LUV) fell 0.2%, JetBlue (JBLU) rose 2.3% and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) fell 2.55%.Late Wednesday, United Airlines (UAL) said January traffic rose 4% as capacity climbed 4.7%, though the carrier attributed 3 percentage points of capacity growth to year-ago weather disruptions.It still sees Q1 passenger unit revenue to range from a 1% dip to a 1% increase.IBD'S TAKE: Along with Gulf carriers, Delta, American and United are facing a growing threat over the Atlantic from low-cost, long-haul carriers.On Thursday, President Trump is set to meet with airline CEOs, although it was unclear who would attend. American Airlines (AAL) CEO Doug Parker won't attend due to the company's annual leadership conference.U.S. airlines, especially global carriers Delta Air Lines (DAL), American and United, have urged the government to take a tougher stance against Gulf rivals. U.S.-based airlines allege that those Gulf carriers have had an easier time competing in America because they receive subsidies from their governments.The Gulf carriers have denied that claim. The U.S. carriers say the practice of competing on their government's dime runs afoul of Open Skies agreements, which facilitate cross-border flights.Delta closed down 0.1% while American dipped 0.2% and United Airlines rose 0.6%.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpJetBlue Trims Capacity, Delta Upgraded, Ryanair Warns On Europe

15,LUV,"Last year at this time, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO and billionaire investor Warren Buffett, in his annual letter to shareholders, lamented the ""negative drumbeat"" of the election season, which he said had soured Americans' views of the nation's future. He argued such pessimism was ""dead wrong,"" that babies being born today were ""the luckiest crop in history,"" that GDP per capita had exploded over the past 80-odd years and that ""America's economic magic remains alive and well.""That sentiment, clearly, did not prevail on Election Day. President Trump, whose campaign portrayed a nation infected by porous borders, globalism and rust-belt decay, won. Hillary Clinton, whom Buffett supported, lost.The election seems to be likely topic in Buffett's 2016 letter to shareholders, which is set to be released on Saturday. So does the tectonic shift in the stock market, which has kicked into higher gear on stronger consumer sentiment and a rush toward banks like Goldman Sachs (GS), one of Buffett's holdings, and infrastructure-related plays.Among the beneficiaries of Trump's vowed infrastructure improvements and deregulation are carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV), which Buffett plowed money into last year after long being allergic to the industry. Many will likely be watching for any color Buffett provides on the airlines in the letter as well as his recent investment in Apple (AAPL).Buffett's lengthy annual shareholder letters — part financial statement, part fireside chat, part fiscal-year Thanksgiving — often contain Buffett's take on the state of the economy and the nation. Buffett wasn't shy about defending his tax record after Trump, during the campaign, said the investor ""took a massive deduction."" With other CEOs offering their own two cents about Trump, Buffett's take might resonate a bit more widely with the investment community.If nothing else, with Trump pushing for a modernization of U.S. infrastructure and pressing companies on their commitment to the American worker, Buffett, like others, may have already inadvertently done some Trump-proofing of his own. ""When you hear talk about America's crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they're not talking about Berkshire,"" Buffett said in his shareholder letter last year. ""We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed in the United States.""Berkshire Hathaway this month disclosed a much bigger investment in Apple, which has been among the Dow's leaders this year on stronger iPhone sales and the prospects of the iPhone 7 Plus.The stock had lagged through much of last year, and Berkshire may have seen a bargain in the company. The letter could provide more insight into Buffett's decision to buy into the world's most valuable publicly traded company.Buffett also owns shares of Visa (V) and IBM (IBM), which have also helped push the Dow higher in 2017.Apple rose 0.1% in the stock market today, while Visa climbed 0.3% and IBM dipped 0.2%.In his shareholder letter for 2007, Buffett had this to say about airlines: ""The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, then earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here, a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive since the days of the Wright brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.""Last year, though, Buffett made an enthusiastic re-entry into the airline business, nearly 30 years after an investment in US Airways. Buffett lost nearly all of that investment but later made money on it, CNBC said. Look for any detail on why Buffett has changed his mind on the stocks.Buffett likes investments in companies that have a moat, or high barriers that prevent lots of competitors from entering into a given industry. In recent years, analysts say, the airlines have come to resemble such a high-moat industry.Bloomberg reported that Buffett was encouraged to invest in the airlines after a presentation last year from American Airlines (AAL) CEO Doug Parker, who said then that consolidation into a handful of big carriers had disciplined the industry, which for years has been riddled with bankruptcies.IBD'S TAKE: Airlines began to shore up unit revenue, a key industry metric, in the fourth quarter. But capacity and margins are likely to be concerns this year. Delta fell 2 cents to 50.46 on Friday. American rose 0.4% and United 0.7%. Southwest climbed 2.2%.Buffett's new stakes in the airlines have led to speculation that he could eventually buy a carrier.Morgan Stanley said Southwest would make the most sense, given its ""domestic focus, robust and sustainable (free cash flow), range of growth opportunities, defensible cost structure, and more tenured management team"". The big global network carriers, the firm argued, ""have more complex operations"".Others believe Buffet could be a major factor in shaping 2017 for the airlines.""Every year there is a surprise in the industry,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note this week. ""Last year it was the management change at United Airlines. This year, we believe a surprise may be that a major airline gets acquired, potentially by Berkshire, or goes private on its own.""But are airlines really the best way for a billionaire to spend his or her money?""Airlines are labor intensive and capital intensive, so they don't make the best (leveraged buyout) candidates,"" Becker added, ""but stranger things have happened.""RELATED:Soros Goes For Facebook, Appaloosa Cuts Apple; Airlines PopularDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

16,LUV,"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its peers.The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of the IBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this level, so investors may want to consider locking-in some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car- and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts. Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook (FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this year.Facebook is ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax margin is 60%.Amazon (AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Southwest Airlines (LUV), MercadoLibra (MELI), Morgan Stanley (MS) and FedEx (FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames. It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter. Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1 e-commerce company. It is often referred to as the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names like Apple (AAPL) and MasterCard (MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the 80s and 90s, including Home Depot (HD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99 Comp Rating — the highest possible — and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. Sales shot up 55% last quarter.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

17,LUV,"JetBlue (JBLU) on Monday trimmed its 2017 capacity guidance, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were upgraded on hopes of stronger demand, tighter operations and fewer regulations under the Trump administration.JetBlue now expects its full-year carrying capacity to grow 5.5%-7.5%, a 1-percentage-point cut from prior guidance given just a few weeks ago. But the move, Cowen analysts noted, wasn't a total surprise, as management during last month's fourth-quarter earnings call left open the possibility for leaner capacity.JetBlue also said it expects nonfuel unit costs to rise 1.5%-3.5% in 2017, up from its previous forecast for 1%-3% growth.Investors shrugged off the news. Shares closed flat at 19.50 on the stock market today. JetBlue tanked at the end of last month after the carrier said it expected a sharp drop in unit revenue for January, with Winter Storm Jonas last year and calendar shifts weighing on the metric, Cowen noted last month. The investment firm added that ""significant competitive capacity growth in Florida"" could cut deeper into the airline's margins.Unit revenue tallies revenue in relation to capacity. JetBlue said the metric was likely to improve in February, but March seems likely to be affected by the timing of the Easter holiday, which takes place in April, Cowen said.Meanwhile, Bernstein upgraded Delta to outperform and American to market perform, saying higher fuel and staff costs will help temper airlines' competitive urges, which can weigh on unit revenue and earnings.Bernstein analyst David Vernon cited Delta's ""continued progress in implementing new revenue management strategies"" and potential growth of branded fares, or fares that offer different degrees of amenities. He also said the carrier was among the ""least levered to oil price changes.""For American, Vernon said ""we do not see a negative catalyst in the short term and believe that favorable revenue trends in the medium term can begin to make the 2018 cost opportunity more tangible ... .""Shares of American and others fell hard last month after American hinted that it could re-accelerate its expansion plans following fears that airlines had already overestimated passenger demand through much of 2015 and last year.Delta finished 0.9% higher at 48.26 Monday, while American climbed 2.5% to 45.30. United Airlines (UAL) edged up 0.6% to 73.50. Bernstein also hiked its price targets on the three airlines.Analysts in recent days have expressed concern about the ways President Trump's immigration restrictions, issued last month through executive order, could affect travel demand.A federal judge in Seattle on Friday temporarily halted the order's ban on entry of refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim nations. An appeals court is weighing the government's emergency request for a stay of that judge's order.Bernstein said it was conscious ""of border issues complicating international or domestic travel but hopeful that the industry can manage through these challenges.""The order caused interagency disarray and protests at airports.""The U.S. airlines have no direct exposure to the banned countries, (but) alliance partners could be impacted,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last month. ""We expect there to be limited financial impact in the short term on the U.S. airlines. Long term we are more concerned about how the U.S. is perceived as a tourist destination.""IBD'S TAKE: The big three U.S. carriers faced questions about international travel demand even before Trump's immigration restrictions. New long-haul, low-cost carriers have taken to the Atlantic to give Delta, American and United a run for their money. Elsewhere internationally, Irish discount carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) expressed caution about airfare prices as Europe's economy limps along.""We are cautious into the balance of the year,"" CFO Neil Sorahan told Bloomberg. ""Any other shocks to the market, be it air traffic control strikes or terrorism, if we were to see any major events than clearly all bets would be off.""RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over Atlantic
"
18,LUV,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) passenger unit revenue for January fell 2.5%, the carrier said Thursday, while a slight uptick in carrying capacity outpaced an even slighter uptick in passenger traffic.Delta said the slide in unit revenue, or revenue in relation to an airline's supply of seats and the scope of its flight coverage, was in line with its prior expectations, attributing it to calendar shifts and comparisons from a year ago, when Winter Storm Jonas kept planes on the ground.Last month, Delta said that February and March would likely produce better unit revenue than in January and predicted overall Q1 unit revenue would be would be flat to up 2%, up from Q4's 2.7% decline.Passenger traffic for January rose 0.4%. Capacity rose 0.6%. Load factor dipped to 81.2% from 81.3%.Shares of Delta edged up 0.25% to 47.38 on the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) dipped 0.1%, and United Airlines (UAL) added 0.9%. Southwest (LUV) ticked 0.25% higher, while JetBlue (JBLU) fell 1 cent.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline shares reeled this week on concerns about the travel ban and more capacity, Cowen analysts said the sector's stocks were likely to take a breather regardless.At the end of last year, airlines were enjoying some much more positive investor sentiment after easing two-year-long concerns that they were adding too many flights and cutting fares as cheap oil made it less expensive, and more tempting, to grab market share.Investors were also hopeful that President Trump would offer a lighter hand on regulations and be more aggressive about infrastructure improvement — both of which would benefit airlines.However, last Friday, fresh concerns surfaced that airlines' capacity could creep up again. Then, concerns that Trump's travel ban could hurt demand roiled airline stocks on Monday and Tuesday.RELATED:United Q4 Beats, But Q1 Costs To Surge; CSX Q4 Mixed

Kraft Heinz (KHC) is pursuing a mammoth deal for Unilever (UN). NetEase (NTES), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and NetApp (NTAP) rallied on earnings, while General Motors (GM) may sell its European unit Opel.The Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite rose 1.8% for the week, with the S&P 500 added 1.5%, all hitting new highs during the week. Apple was a key contributor to all the major indexes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June.  Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis.Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984.RELATED:Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after Verizon Communications (VZ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them. Verizon sought an edge over T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) by offering high-definition video as part of unlimited data. T-Mobile quickly changed its offer to include HD video. Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. AT&T (T) opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers.

Here's why Trump's moves may derail the stock market rally, and his tax and infrastructure plans.The move also, Syth noted, suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows some travelers from outside the U.S. to renew a visa without holding an in-person interview with a U.S. Consular officer.""Not only does this make it more cumbersome to obtain a U.S. visa, it sets up the possibility of retaliatory actions on U.S. travelers from these countries,"" Syth said. ""However, it is unclear how many current applicants are able to take advantage of the interview waiver and how many may be discouraged from traveling to the U.S. as a result.""Delta shares fell 4.1% in the stock market today, while American lost 4.4% and United 3.6%. All three global carriers tumbled below their 50-day moving averages.Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU), which have fewer international flights, fell 0.7% and 1.5%, respectively.Trump on Saturday defended the executive order, saying it was ""not a Muslim ban"" and was ""working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over.""But protests, and confusion over the order itself, escalated through Sunday. Trump defended the order again on Monday over Twitter, saying over two tweets:Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,.....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017Delta was not immediately available for comment.The carrier said flights were canceled after its ""essential IT systems"" went down at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday. Those systems were ""restored a few hours later"" and all systems resumed normal operations shortly after midnight on Monday, Delta said.Later Monday morning, the carrier said the outage caused takeoff delays and about 170 flight cancellations on Sunday and roughly 110 on Monday, with more possible.Syth said Delta was the least exposed to any fallout from the interview waiver program's suspension. American was the most exposed, she said, followed by United.The stock slide comes after airline shares fell Friday as American Air hinted that it could start expanding capacity again after appearing show to more restraint in recent months.Investors spent much of 2015 and last year hoping airlines would try to align their overall carrying capacity with passenger demand. Delta, American and United also face more competition from low-cost, long-haul carriers flying over the Atlantic.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticUnited Q4 Beats, But Q1 Costs To Surge; CSX Q4 Mixed

23,LUV,"Stocks powered to record highs again Wednesday to extend their win streak amid bullish economic data and President Trump's ""massive"" tax-cut rhetoric.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, to extend their advance for a seventh straight session. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.5% for a fifth consecutive advance. The small-cap Russell 2000 also added 0.5%. Volume was higher across the board vs. Tuesday, according to preliminary numbers.Strong retail sales and New York manufacturing data sparked early gains that were further fueled by Trump, who told retail executives his ""massive"" tax plan would be coming soon and would simplify the tax code.Generic drug, wood products and airlines were among top gainers in the stock market today, while oil, metal ores miners and fiber optics stocks underperformed.Procter & Gamble (PG) led the Dow with a 4% pop in heavy trade, making its highest level in two years. Shares are still in buy range from an 88.07 cup-with-handle entry. Activist investor Trian Fund Management on Tuesday disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in the personal care products giant. Jefferies boosted its price target to 101 from 99 and maintained a buy rating. Apple (AAPL) pared an early 1% gain to 0.4% despite news that investor Warren Buffett and Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn boosted their stakes in the iPhone maker. Still, the advance marked Apple's second straight all-time high. Buffett upped his stake in the iPhone maker to 57.4 million shares in Q4, from 15.2 million in Q3., while Einhorn raised his stake by 11% to more than 5.8 million shares.Delta Air Lines (DAL) lifted 3% in fast trade as it shapes the right side of a base. A regulatory filing Tuesday showed Buffett in Q4 added to his stakes in American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines and United Continental (UAL), and also took a 43.2 million-share stake in Southwest Airlines (LUV).George Soros took a 40,000-share stake in Delta in Q4 but exited United Continental. Hedge fund Appaloosa Management, meantime, bought a 160,000-share stake in United and doubled its position in Southwest. United and Southwest rose nearly 3% and 4%, respectively. United is near a 17-year high as it approaches a 76.90 entry of a flat base. Southwest is at all-time highs and far extended from an early December breakout and subsequent bounce off its 50-day line. American Airlines climbed 2% to reclaim its 50-day line.IBD 50 stock NetEase (NTES) gained 2% in average volume ahead of its Q4 earnings due after the close.

24,LUV,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen
"
25,LUV,"American Airlines' (AAL) hint that it may increase domestic capacity sent stocks in the industry tumbling Friday, just as signs began appearing that airlines have finally ended a two-year glut in flights and seats that have weighed on earnings.In a research note, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi attributed the stock sell-off to ""commentary from management that it 'wouldn't be shocked if we slightly toned down international and add a little bit to domestic (capacity).'""He added: ""Following similar creep from Southwest yesterday, the messaging to investors is pretty poor (i.e. domestic RASM has finally turned positive - now let's start adding capacity). While we appreciate that perspective and understand it's based on reality given how 2015 played out, we'd be surprised if airlines make the same mistake again.""Early Friday, shares of American briefly rose to 50 on the stock market today, exactly matching a buy point from a handle in a short cup base. But the stock then quickly reversed lower, closing down 5.3% to 46.95 and finishing below its 50-day line for the first time in four months.Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 2.4%, closing at its 50-day. United Airlines (UAL) fell 1.3%, and Southwest (LUV) lost 2.3% after soaring 9% Thursday to a record high. JetBlue (JBLU) sank 6.9% and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) tumbled 4.8%, diving below its 50-day.American's capacity comment overshadowed a generally positive Q4 report, which showed unit revenue turned positive for the first time in two years, beating its rivals to that much-anticipated milestone. The carrier also approved a $2 billion buyback.Earnings per share dropped 54% to 92 cents, in line with analysts' view, while revenue increased 2% to $9.79 billion, above forecasts for $9.74 billion.Traffic slipped 1.3%, capacity edged up 0.4%, and unit revenue rose 1.3%. Earlier this month, the carrier said it expected total unit revenue to be flat to up 2%.""Our product investments are showing up in our unit revenue performance,"" said Chairman and CEO Doug Parker in a statement, referring to Delta's Basic Economy and Premium Economy classes. ""We had the largest improvement in unit revenue among our competitors and as we look forward, we continue to see strong demand for air service, and improving yields.""Unit cost climbed 5.7%. Operating expenses grew 5.4% as salaries and benefits expense jumped 17.4% on new labor agreements.
"
26,LUV,"American also sees Q1 unit revenue up 2.5%-4.5%. Unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, are expected to jump about 9% in Q1, which will be the peak as maintenance and fleet crew pay hikes won't be lapped until the middle of Q3. Capacity is seen growing roughly 1% for 2017.The results come as most airlines improve unit revenue — which measures revenue as it relates to seat-and-flight capacity and is seen as a gauge of an airline's efficiency — aided by rising postelection travel demand and capacity cuts.IBD'S TAKE: Higher fuel prices can help airlines operate more conservatively and pass costs onto consumers, annoying passengers but helping financials. But rising fuel costs, along with pay-raises or other deals struck with staff, are also likely to keep margins thinner this year. Margins could become more of a focus as the year progresses. Delta this month said higher fuel and labor costs would pull at margins for the first half of this year, peaking in the current quarter. United also forecast higher costs.Southwest offered a strong unit-revenue forecast for the first quarter. But JetBlue forecast a January unit-revenue decline of 8%-9% due in part to Winter Storm Jonas. But JetBlue said the months to come look better.RELATED:Why Airline Investors Could See 'Ample Upside'; Delta Lifts ViewsOnly Delta, Southwest Spared From Cowen's Airline Downgrades

Revenue is expected to be essentially flat at $9.034 billion.Results: EPS of $1.78 on revenue of $9.05 billion. Unit revenue down 1.6%, worse than the midpoint of its projection for a 1.25%-1.75% drop.Outlook: Q1 unit revenue down 1% to up 1%. Q1 capacity to grow 1%-2%. Adjusted pre-tax margin 0.5%-2.5%. Q1 unit costs to rise 4.5%-5.5%. Full-year capacity to grow 1%-2%.

Delta Air Lines (DAL), which beat Q4 estimates last week, ended down 1.8% then dipped 0.1% late. American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.9% and was flat late, and Southwest (LUV) dropped 1.8% and eased 0.5% after hours.United has said unit revenue, or revenue as it relates to an airline's available seats on planes and how far they fly, would fall 1.25%-1.75% in Q4, better than prior guidance. As with prior quarters, investors will be zeroing in on whether United can improve Q1 unit revenue, a key metric that has fallen for the past two years as airlines competed for market share.

43,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday hiked its forecast for total fourth-quarter unit revenue, following similar moves by United Airlines (UAL) and other rivals. Meanwhile, the Justice Department reportedly has not discovered any evidence to justify antitrust action after an investigation into whether the four major U.S. carriers colluded to prop up ticket prices.American Airlines said it expected total unit revenue to be flat to up 2% in the fourth quarter, potentially becoming the first of the major U.S. carriers to turn the metric positive. That's better than the carrier's forecast last month for a 1% decline to a 1% gain.The carrier also forecast improving Q4 adjusted pretax margin — 7%-9%, compared to earlier guidance for 6%-8%. Margins could become a bigger focus for investors as unit revenue improves.American cited ""improving yields,"" a measure of an airline's pricing power on airfares, as the primary reason for the more bullish outlook.The forecast comes a day after Southwest (LUV) and United Airlines (UAL) bumped up their outlooks for Q4 unit revenue, which measures an airline's revenue as it pertains to capacity. Last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, also raised its Q4 unit revenue estimates.American closed up 0.3% at 48.64 in the stock market today. United Airlines gained 1.9% in the wake of its late Tuesday news on December traffic and Q4 unit revenue. Southwest Airlines advanced 0.7%. Delta Air added 1%. Capacity control, improving demand and pricing trends, an investment from Warren Buffett and the election of Donald Trump have all lifted airline stocks.IBD'S TAKE: After a run that began around the fall, some analysts expect the sector to take a breather. Cowen & Co. recently downgraded much of the industry, sparing Delta and Southwest. The Justice Department hasn't found evidence that the four major U.S. airlines colluded on pricing and capacity plans, the Wall Street Journal reported. The probe, which began in 2015, hasn't officially concluded, the Journal said. A law professor told the WSJ that the incoming Trump administration seemed unlikely to pursue the investigation.The DOJ probe came under fire from the outset. As the investigation got underway, cheap fuel prompted the airlines to aggressively expand, pushing airfares lower. Unit revenue turned negative at the beginning of 2015 and hasn't been positive since.For the month of December, American said traffic fell 0.8%, while capacity rose 0.5%.RELATED:Can Delta, United, American Declare Mission Accomplished In 2017?

44,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday said it could have difficulty retaining market share in the skies above the Atlantic, adding that it had ""further segmentation to do"" as competition with low-cost carriers escalates.The remarks come as low-cost carriers and international rivals chip away at the major U.S. airlines' dominance of the airspace here and over the Atlantic. Iceland's Wow air, Canada's WestJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle all offer cheap flights across the Atlantic, while Gulf carriers like Emirates and Etihad have stepped up service to the U.S.Delta appears to have settled on so-called segmentation — the seemingly endless dividing-up of a plane's cabin into different fare classes — as the way to compete amid the rise of cheap seats. The carrier hopes to have its ""basic economy"" available across its fleet in 2018.""You look at what Norwegian [offers], they don't have flat beds,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said on a conference call. ""If you look at what a lot of the ultra low-cost carriers — they haven't made that investment in those types of products. And we need to adjust to that new paradigm.""Delta shares closed down 1.1% at 50.89 in the stock market today, but well off intraday lows and still in buy range. United Airlines (UAL), which reports Q4 results on Tuesday, fell 1.4%. American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.1%, and Southwest (LUV) fell 1.3%.Delta management during the call also found a lot to like about the incoming Trump administration, adding that the company has ""already provided some input in to the transition team."" Delta said it was excited about tax reform, the chance to improve airports in a bigger infrastructure overhaul, as well as the potential chance to keep Gulf rivals at bay.""We're very excited to the opportunity to present our case for the Middle Eastern situation, with all the growth that those carriers have brought to this country on a subsidized basis, where we are competing against governments, not ... airlines,"" CEO Ed Bastian said.Delta, American and United have said government funding of some Gulf airlines has allowed them to expand aggressively and more easily compete on airfare, although the Gulf carriers have denied those claims. The big U.S. carriers hope the government will restrict those airlines' U.S. operations.Still, Delta said that consumer confidence was strong and that the outlook for corporate travel spending was the best the company has seen in two years.Earnings per share fell 31% to 82 cents, in line with analyst views. Revenue edged lower to $9.46 billion, slightly above forecasts for $9.41 billion. Unit revenue fell 2.7% vs. a year earlier, better than the initial guidance given in October for a drop of 3%-5%.And the carrier said that, at least in the U.S., rebounding ticket sales from business travel were the ultimately bigger factor in helping to improve unit revenue, which the company said would be flat to up 2% overall in the first quarter — potentially the first time the key metric would turn positive in two years.Higher fuel and labor costs will pressure margins in the first half of 2017, but Delta said improving unit revenue should bring it back to margin expansion starting in the second half. February and March are likely to be better months than January for Q1 unit revenue, the carrier said. Q1 capacity should be flat to down 1%.The carrier said the pressure on margins is ""likely to peak"" in Q1. Delta forecast Q1 operating margin of 11%-13%. The company expects unit costs to rise 5%-7%.""We will remain conservative and keep our capacity growth in check until we see a further firming of these revenue trends in the near-term and longer-term, a return to our 17%-19% operating margin target,"" said Hauenstein in Delta's earnings statement.Earlier in the day, Bastian also said Trump's election had helped fuel demand.""There was no question post the election that we saw an improvement,"" he told CNBC. ""You see in the marketplace. You see it in some optimism with respect to starting to get things done in Washington. We saw it in our results.""IBD'S TAKE: Airlines' unit-revenue forecasts have improved on the prospect of higher fuel costs, capacity discipline, stronger close-in booking trends and postelection consumer confidence. In the quarters to come, margins and costs could become more of a focus following airlines' labor dealsAlso Thursday, JetBlue (JBLU) said December traffic rose 4.5% on a 3.1% capacity increase. Load factor widened to 84.1% from 83%. Shares sank 4.2%.United and American have also rolled out barer-bones, basic economy seating classes to win back customers seeking cheap fares.But as airlines continue to chop up cabin space, Delta was asked on the call if standard coach class was slowly going extinct. Hauenstein said that the main cabin was still where Delta made most of its money.""The death of the main cabin, I think, it's premature to prognosticate on that,"" he said.RELATED:American Lifts Unit Revenue View; DOJ Backs Off Collusion CaseUnited, Southwest Raise Q4 Unit Revenue Views, Joining Delta

45,LUV,"Better unit revenue, but higher costs. That's basically Wall Street's outlook for the airline industry overall in the fourth quarter, and Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports Q4 results on Thursday, is no different.Analysts expect earnings per share to tumble 31% to 82 cents, marking its worst decline since Q4 2012 as oil prices rallied, with revenue slipping 1% to $9.4 billion.Delta last week said it expects Q4 unit revenue to fall 2.5%-3%, an improvement from a decline of around 3% the carrier projected last month. However, Delta said it expects non-fuel unit costs, including profit-sharing, to jump around 10% due to a new contract with pilots.Unit revenue measures an airline's revenue as it relates to its overall supply of seats on planes and flight coverage. Analysts largely expect the key metric to turn positive this year as postelection travel demand firms up and rising fuel and labor expenses force airlines to pull back on their expansion plans and pass more costs onto customers.American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) have also offered stronger unit revenue forecasts, with American indicating that total unit revenue could turn positive in Q4.But as with all the airlines' earnings reports, Delta's forecast on industry trends will probably grab more of the spotlight. Delta has said it expects unit revenue to be flat in the first quarter of this year. As unit revenue improves, investors could turn more of their attention to how airlines manage their margins and costs.""After Delta's latest guidance, we believe the expectation is for unit revenue guidance to move higher,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Monday. ""Despite improving revenue trends, we expect little change to margin guidance as jet fuel continues to rise.""IBD'S TAKE: Delta and Southwest were the only airlines not to be downgraded by Cowen last week. The firm said many of Delta's difficulties were in the past and that it could be among the biggest beneficiaries of improving airfare trends in business travel. Delta and other airline stocks have rallied since the fall as the industry tightens up on capacity growth and as demand strengthens. But the stocks have lost some steam in recent weeks, and analysts expect the sector could take a break from its massive run-up in the coming months.""Airline stocks as a group have outperformed the S&P 500 by 47% since Brexit. Something is priced in,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note last week. ""And while history suggests we could be entering a three, or even six, month cooling off period ... , the 2017 outlook for DAL and this group is more encouraging by the day.""RELATED:Delta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs.

Analysts expect Delta to turn in Q2 EPS of $1.75, according to Zacks Investment Research.As for unit revenue, the much-watched gauge of passenger sales in relation to an airline's flight capacity: Delta kept the forecast for that key metric the same as well. It expects a 4%-5% uptick for the second quarter, on strong demand in both its leisure and business seating options. The company said that demand helped counterbalance a roughly 50% jump in fuel prices.Pretax margins for the second quarter are expected to come in at 13%-14%, Delta said. That's also in line with the forecast the company gave last month.Deutsche Bank cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to $1.75, from $1.95.Delta on Tuesday forecast Q2 capacity, or its overall available seats and flight coverage, to rise around 3.5%.

51,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) on Tuesday launched cheap airfare deals, with select one-way flights costing as little as $49, a biannual offering from the carrier that comes a day after it forecast weaker ticket sales following an accident in April.XThe 72-hour cheap airfare bonanza is good for flights between Aug. 12 and Dec. 12.

53,LUV,"After two brutal quarters, United Airlines (UAL) got a break from Wall Street on Wednesday following an earnings call in which management talked up strong global demand during the first quarter even as higher oil prices test the industry's cost controls.XThose gains came after United's stock crashed in January, when it announced an expansion of its flights over the next three years, and in October, when its outlook on 2018 proved too vague for analysts and investors.Late Tuesday, the carrier beat Q1 estimates and predicted 2018 capacity growth of 4.5%-5.5% vs. January guidance of 4%-6% growth. In a research note, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi called the narrowed plans for expansion a ""surprise,"" and was possibly a result of higher oil prices.Even as jet-fuel prices rise — they surged 26% for United during the quarter — it was the rebound in the energy sector that fueled corporate-travel demand for the carrier, management said Wednesday. Houston, where many top oil and gas companies are headquartered, is also a major United hub.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMeanwhile, the carrier said it could contain costs elsewhere — by tightening up the supply chain for aircraft parts, improving freight and maintenance programs, and purchasing aircraft off-lease.Pricier seats at the front of the flight cabin also helped results internationally, the company said. Performance in the trans-Atlantic market is expected to lead the way for the carrier in the months ahead.As for the rest of the cabin, United said it would begin selling its premium-economy-style Premium Plus seats later this year. The company said it would roll out a jet with Polaris — its business class with lie-flat seats — every 10 days through 2020.And as demand picks up, management said that flight cabins ""probably"" had fewer available basic economy seats — the carrier's low-cost but highly restrictive fare option.United also said that unit revenue was positive in its San Francisco hub, despite competition picking up on the West Coast.Shares took off in the stock market today, jumping 4.8% to 70.58. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported earnings last week, rallied 1.2%.  American Airlines (AAL) surged 4.4%, while and Southwest (LUV) gained 2.9%.That's despite crude futures hitting a new three-year high, rallying 2.9% to $68.47 a barrel on Wednesday.United's results come as the public's attention turns to airline safety. On Tuesday, a Southwest flight heading to Dallas from New York had to make an emergency landing after an engine blowout on a Boeing (BA) 737 broke a window in the aircraft, leaving one passenger dead.

54,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday forecast first-quarter unit revenue at the high end of its expectations, lifted by strong global demand, and held to its earnings forecast. That lifted shares of Delta Air and rival carriers after they tumbled Monday.The company sees Q1 unit revenue, which gauges an airline's efficiency by measuring sales in relation to overall flight capacity, increasing roughly 5%. That compares to expectations last month for an increase of 4% to 5%.Delta Air Lines stock rose 3.4% in the stock market today, reclaiming its 200-day moving average. That's after tumbling 5% on Monday, undercutting its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Shares of other big airlines rallied as well.American Airlines (AAL) rose 3.4%, while United Airlines (UAL) climbed 3.6%. American Air and United Air sank about 4% on Monday.Southwest Airlines (LUV), which cut its first-quarter outlook for unit revenue last month, advanced 3%. Southwest Airlines skidded 5% on Monday.It was not clear why airline stocks fell so hard on Monday. But the moves came amid broader market turmoil and trade-war fears. The S&P 500 index tumbled below its 200-day lines Monday. Wall Street has also been concerned about higher energy costs, too much capacity and a string of harsh winter storms across the Northeast.Delta still sees first-quarter earnings per share of 65 to 75 cents, pretax margin of 6.5% to 7.5%, and a roughly 3% capacity increase. The carrier bumped up its unit cost forecast, to around a 4% increase, from 3%-4%, due to wage hikes, bad weather and accelerated depreciation due to aircraft retirements.For the month of March, Delta said that passenger traffic rose 4.3%, while capacity rose 3%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Just Don't Do It: These 6 Top Stocks Teach Key Lesson In Market CorrectionVirgin Atlantic Follows Delta, United, American With New Economy Class

55,LUV,"JetBlue Airways (JBLU) joined Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) in lifting its forecast for a key revenue metric.JetBlue now sees Q1 unit revenue surging 6.1% year-over-year, above the prior guidance range of 3.5%-5.5%.The carrier attributed the upgraded forecast to stronger demand in March as well as to an increase in cancellations, which reduces capacity and lifts unit revenue, in the final weeks of the month.For the Q1 in total, revenue per available seat mile was positively impacted by approximately 1 point due to increased cancellations. The timing of Easter in March this year lifted unit revenue by 2.5 points. The end of March saw an early spring Nor'Easter that wreaked havoc on flights along the East Coast, forcing thousands of flights to be canceled.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

That's after surging nearly 4% on Tuesday.Last week, Delta said Q1 unit revenue would come in at the upper end of its expectations. On Tuesday, American raised the low end of its unit revenue guidance and now expects a 3%-4% increase, up from an earlier view for a 2%-4% gain.And late Monday, United said it expected a roughly 2.7% gain in Q1 unit revenue, helped, as with Delta, by a pickup in international travel demand, near the upper end of earlier expectations for an increase of 1%-3%.Meanwhile, JetBlue said March traffic increased 7.3% to 4.38 billion revenue passenger miles, on a capacity increase of 3.3%. Load factor, a gauge of seats filled on flights, grew 3.3 percentage points from a year ago to 89%.Calendar shifts will continue to affect unit revenue in Q2. JetBlue continues to expect a 2.5-point headwind from holiday calendar placement in Q2. It also expects a 1.25-point headwind from completion factor and co-brand incentive payments.The figures came after Southwest Airlines on Friday reported passenger traffic that outpaced its flight capacity in March.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Southwest Airlines Traffic Caps Wild Week For Delta Air, Other Airline Stocks Boeing Pounces On Lion Air Deal, Stock Soars On China's Xi Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

The competition could lead to fare cuts, eroding profits, Zacks added.Competition from United forced Southwest to cut its Q1 unit revenue target, some analysts argued. Unit revenue measures sales from passengers in relation to an airline's overall available seats and flights.United Airlines has announced plans to expand, via its airport hubs, into smaller cities where they can charge more for tickets. But that has raised fears that other airlines might respond accordingly.Airlines will also report first-quarter earnings in the next few weeks.

59,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) forecast improved fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue Wednesday, helped by strong December demand, and Cowen & Co. said the carrier was its top pick, arguing that many of the issues the company faced last year were behind it.Cowen said that while demand and business airfares have strengthened since the election, higher labor and fuel costs would likely deflate the industry's margins this year. But the firm offered reasons to be optimistic about Delta and maintained an outperform rating on it.""We believe investors will look to own shares that underperformed in 2016 given certain company-specific issues,"" analyst Helane Becker said in a research note out Wednesday. ""Both Delta and Southwest (LUV) had headwinds from technology outages in 3Q16, which provide for easier comps than their peers.""She also said that if business yields improve, Delta ""will be one of, if not the, largest beneficiaries of improving yields.""Meanwhile, Cowen kept its outperform rating on Southwest but downgraded the rest of the sector — including American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Alaska Air Group (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU) and budget carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) — to market perform from outperform.""We believe with the recent positive trend in the shares and subsequent upward multiple moves the group is due for a break,"" Becker wrote.Shares of Delta rose 2.5% to close at 50.70 on the stock market today, still within buy range. American rose 0.9%, United edged up 0.4% and Southwest climbed 2.6%, now above buy range. Alaska rose 1.3%, JetBlue 1.2% and Spirit 1.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As airline stocks show more bullish signs, Barclays also says that many carriers could bring ""ample upside for patient investors.""Delta expects Q4 unit revenue to decline 2.5% to 3%, better than the carrier's forecast last month for a roughly 3% dip, and has said it sees the metric going flat in Q1.For December, unit revenue was flat, as traffic growth of 2.6% outpaced a capacity increase of 1.5%. The carrier credited strong demand and better close-in domestic yields — or how much an airline can get passengers to pay for flights booked closer to departure time — for the results, as well as revenue management and more restrained capacity.The flat passenger unit revenue also came ""despite the tougher comparison resulting from the holiday timing,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth noted. Analysts had expressed concern that the calendar timing of certain holidays could put a dent in airlines' December and fourth-quarter results.With unit revenue improving, Cowen said Wall Street could turn its attention to the airline industry's margins in Q2.""The issue we see with the group is that unit revenue is clearly on the road to being positive (year over year) and sooner rather than later,"" Becker noted. ""We expect investors will look for the next issue to nitpick. We believe that issue will be margin compression due to higher jet fuel and labor costs.""Meanwhile, Ryanair (RYAAY), the Irish budget carrier that says its low fares will push rivals out of markets, reported a December traffic increase of 20%.

60,LUV,"Talk about hot! Imagine if quarterback Tom Brady were as good at playing defense as he is at leading the New England Patriots offense. That would be impressive, right? Well, that two-way talent is what fund manager Craig Hodges displayed in 2016.Hodges is a quarterback of the $15.9 million Hodges Pure Contrarian Fund (HDPCX), whose 71% gain through Dec. 29 outperformed all other U.S. diversified stock funds regardless of size. Contrarian is a small-cap value strategy. At the same time, he's also lead signal-caller for the $411.5 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), whose 40.47% gain made it 2016's third-best performing growth fund.Value. And growth. Two very different strategies. And outperformers both.Hodges Fund, the larger of the two portfolios, has been driven by leaders like Southwest Airlines (LUV), which climbed 16% in 2016 and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92; construction and industrial leasor United Rentals (URI), which jumped 46% for the year and also sports a 92 Comp Rating; and construction materials maker Eagle Materials (EXP), up 63% in 2016 and boasting a 90 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Hodges Fund co-manager Eric Marshall recently told IBD why he and Craig Hodges like stocks such as Horizon Pharma, Facebook and Texas Pacific Land Trust.Hodges is also CEO and chief investment officer of Hodges Capital Management and the son of Donald Hodges, founder of Hodges Capital's parent company. Craig Hodges, 53 years old, talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Dallas.IBD: What should investors do with their portfolios in 2017?Hodges: We're optimistic about some niches in retail, some selected companies. J.C. Penney (JCP) is one. Some low-hanging fruit. The old (company management) regime almost wrecked the company. The new regime is turning the company around, making it profitable.We don't like retail as a whole, but we like some selected names like Duluth Holdings (DLTH) and G-III Apparel (GIII), which have significant upside.And there are some names in consumer discretionary. Adidas (ADDYY) has taken market share from Under Armour (UAA) and Nike (NKE). There are some names we feel good about.IBD: Which existing holdings got a boost from the Trump election?Hodges: We owned a good position in U.S. Concrete (USCR) as well as Eagle Materials and U.S. Steel (X). Those could benefit if the new administration acts on its interest in investing in infrastructure.We already had quite a bit of exposure to energy, and we added to some like Diamondback Energy (FANG), RSP Permian (RSPP) and Matador Resources (MTDR). Those are our three favorite Permian Basin plays. Hillary Clinton was viewed as anti-fracking, so a lot of those stocks went up. Long term, we think those companies are as well situated as any we know in energy.Volaris Avia (VLRS), a Mexican airline, dropped from about 20 to about 14 or 15. It was on concerns that trade with Mexico would be affected. But we think that fear is political rhetoric. In fact, we think trade with Mexico will be a big part of what (the U.S. does).IBD: Have you bought any stocks that looked poised to benefit from the Trump election?Hodges: Yes, one is Forterra (FRTA). They're in the water infrastructure industry. They provide cast cement piping, precast products for a wide range of water-related infrastructure, even drainage. If you build a road or bridge, drainage is essential. And they have a good management team. They had an IPO right before the election. That was not a good time for an IPO, so we got it at a favorable time.About Nov. 11 (as its share price climbed) we started buying a larger stake. We bought quite a bit in the 17-18 range. It ran up above 20, pulled back, then we added to it. Now it's trading near a 52-week high (around 22).We bought some (Mexico-based) Cemex (CX) ADRs. Thirty percent of their business is in the U.S. They got hit hard by the election results. We think the stock has a good chance to go back to where it was before the election.IBD: Am I right in thinking that Contrarian and Hodges funds are about as different as funds can be?Hodges: Contrarian is just that. It buys the most out-of-favor, unloved name we can come across. About 80% of its stocks would never cross over into Hodges Fund.IBD: Freeport McMoRan (FCX) posted eight straight quarters of EPS slowdown before finally notching a gain. Why do you still like this mining company?Hodges: Our assessment is that they will survive. They're doing things necessary to survive. They're selling off Gulf oil properties, getting their balance sheet squared away, fixing their short-term ills. Our cost is under 6 per share. (It's trading around 13.50). They're not out of the woods, but their asset sales will get them out of the woods.IBD: Facebook (FB) said last month that its advertising-revenue growth rate would slow, which hurt its share price. Do you still like the stock?Hodges: We think it's the ultimate social media company. They're the ones that continue to gain market share. They're diversified. They own Instagram. They're the ones hurting Twitter (TWTR). They're rock solid in my mind.For us, it's a way to participate in what's going on in social media without paying a crazy multiple. It's not inexpensive, but relative to their number of users and how fast it's growing, it's inexpensive.The stock hasn't done much for a quarter and a half. Maybe people who bought it in the 130s are selling and taking losses. But the stock will do well next year.IBD: Southwest Airlines posted a 1% decline in earnings per share growth in the third quarter and it expects a revenue decline in Q4. Do you still like the airline?Hodges: The days of wild fluctuations in earnings for airlines are gone. The competitive landscape is more friendly. They've gone from eight main carriers to three, and Southwest is the fourth.There are barriers to entry. It's expensive to buy the fuel-efficient planes that you need to compete. Meanwhile, Southwest is paying down debt. You've seen a decrease in airlines' earnings estimates, but most are up 30% to 40% (in share prices) for the year. All are buying back their stock. I imagine Delta (DAL) (which Hodges Fund also owns) will continue to raise its dividend. Others might pay more, once they pay back debt. Southwest is buying back a lot.IBD: Match Group (MTCH) aims to help people get an education and get a spouse. It's somewhat new to Hodges Fund. What's your thesis?Hodges: They are like the Facebook of online dating. They own several different dating sites. Their biggest is Match.com, but they also own OKCupid, PlentyOfFish and BlackPeopleMeet. They have 45 dating brands. In the education space, they own PrincetonReview.com.They make money from advertising and membership fees. They don't have a great growth rate, but they own such a good(-size) part of the business that it creates a barrier to entry.IBD: United States Steel's earnings per share grew 61% and 157% the past two quarters after slowing for five quarters in a row. What's the driver?Hodges: The main thing is, people don't understand how hard it is to get into the business, even after there have been so many bankruptcies and so much consolidation. And China has been dumping steel into the U.S. for years. Now there's a president who not only will refine trade agreements but push to get a level playing field for companies like U.S. Steel.There just isn't a lot of (U.S.) competition, but U.S. Steel has tremendous earnings power. Shares trade in the mid-30s. Shares traded near 200 in 2008 on $17 per share in earnings. They're not going near that. But this company could earn $4 to $5 a share in two to three years. On that, the stock could trade back into the 60s or 70s. With a more robust economy, you could see some real multiple expansion.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewTop-Notch Investor's Bets On Likely Trump-Era Stock LeadersFranklin DynaTech's Matthew Moberg Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWarren Buffett Liked Airlines So Much That He Bought Several

It planned to build 20 in 2017.The superjumbo jet is a good fit for Middle Eastern carriers with routes to densely populated Asian cities and it offers space for upscale amenities like private rooms. But overall demand for large jets has been slowing worldwide.Also Tuesday, Delta said it would cancel an order for 18 widebody 787s that it accepted as part of its merger with Northwest Airlines. The carrier will still take delivery of new 737-900ER jets through 2019.""This business decision is consistent with Delta's fleet strategy to prudently address our widebody aircraft needs,"" said Greg May, Delta's senior vice president for supply chain management and fleet, in a statement.Airbus' U.S.-listed shares were down 1.2% at 16.21 on the stock market today.

62,LUV,"The airline industry's declines in unit revenue — and a nearly two-year fixation on the key metric — appear likely to end next year, but investor attention could shift to margins and attempts to counter low-cost carriers.Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) have all forecast improvements in Q4 unit revenue, with American indicating it could be positive by the end of 2016.""Even at West Palm Beach, which is normally an airport where I can get there 20 minutes before my plane is due to take off and get right through security ... there was a long line even at the TSA PreCheck,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said. ""So we're definitely seeing an increase in traffic. We're definitely seeing an uptick in pricing.""Airline stocks have taken off too. IBD's Transportation-Airline industry group has jumped more than 40% from a June low, helped by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) bet on the sector.So ... ""mission accomplished,"" right?To be sure, maintaining positive unit revenue will still be important next year. But analysts say the recovery could draw more attention to the health of the airlines' margins as they contend with more expensive fuel as well as richer pay and benefits for their employees.""Investors are expecting margin compression in most cases — the focus here is on if the magnitude can be better than feared,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said over email.Meanwhile, competition for leisure travelers from budget carriers, in the U.S. and over the Atlantic Ocean, will continue to make life difficult for the United, Delta and American.Ultra-low-cost but heavy-fee carriers, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), could comprise 10% of the U.S. market by 2020, according Becker. That would be a big jump from today. A recent Barclays note estimated the sector's share of U.S. revenue at 3% in Q2 this year.But the big three U.S. network carriers have rolled out or plan to roll out barer-bones, ""basic economy"" seating classes to win back customers seeking cheap fares.Research indicates an opening for them. A recent Morning Consult survey found that 44% said they prefer to fly with a full-service carrier, while 28% said they preferred a budget one that breaks out extra costs.Becker said bargain-seeking travelers could gravitate to the basic economy seats offered by Delta, United and American, if their ticket prices are close to what's offered by budget rivals, as the on-time performance of carriers like Spirit has largely lagged.""I think there are a lot of the ultra-low-cost carriers that kind of think of it as being, 'Well, we're within an hour of our posted departure time, we're doing a good job,' "" she told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: As airline stocks show more bullish signs, Barclays also says that many carriers could bring ""ample upside for patient investors.""Despite the challenge from the no-frills airlines, the barriers to entry in the airline sector are high, and the last decade's consolidation wave has left Delta, United, American and Southwest (LUV) with inherent advantages. Those four controlled 86% of the revenue in the U.S. market in Q2, Barclays estimated.Industry watchers say that edge was part of the reason Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently bought those stocks after the billionaire investor once called the industry a ""death trap"" for investors.""Buffett likes a moat,"" said Frank Holmes, CEO of U.S. Global Investors, which launched the airline-tracking U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) in 2015. ""And he said in business, 'I look for economic castles protected by an unbreachable moat.' ""Also, the prospect of tax reform, fewer regulations and more infrastructure development under the incoming Trump administration could help air travel and the industry.But amid the changes headed for airlines next year, there's still one metric that rises above the rest.""I would expect that even if/after unit revenue turns positive next year, that will remain the most focused-on metric as investors see it as the best way of determining pricing power in the industry and it's the most significant driver of EPS (outside of big swings in oil prices),"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said over email.RELATED:United: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'United, Southwest See Stronger Ticket Demand During Holidays

79,LUV,"Management from United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) essentially urged Wall Street to relax Tuesday, arguing that massive stock sell-offs from the past year reflected a misunderstanding of how the industry works today.X Still, United, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) managed to give airline investors some of what they typically want from the industry on Tuesday, with all three raising their unit revenue forecasts for the first quarter.The remarks from United and American, along with the new forecast from Delta, came at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference. They also follow several months in which shares of those carriers were jolted downward over concerns that the industry might relapse into their old habits of overexpanding and cutting prices too aggressively — things that wear on airlines' profits and have forced many of them to go bankrupt in years past.United's shares sustained double-digit drops in October, after the carrier appeared unprepared to answer questions about 2018, and again in January, after its plans to add flights to smaller cities raised fears of another fare war.United expects to boost its total flight capacity, or an airline's overall available seats and flight coverage, by around 4%-6% this year and at a similar rate next year and 2020. The move, United said in January, would help it strengthen flight connectivity to smaller cities where passengers are likelier to pay more to fly. But management sought to clarify that on Tuesday.""All capacity is not created equal,"" Kirby said. ""Growing in a hub and growing connectivity in a hub is dramatically different than point-to-point growth.""United raised its Q1 unit-revenue forecast to a 1%-3% gain, up from flat to up 2%, as the carrier draws more money from passengers buying tickets closer to flight departures in the U.S. and sees ""healthy bookings"" for flights over the Atlantic. Results in the Pacific have gotten better, helped by United's premium fare classes, and the carrier sees ""positive trends"" in Latin America.Ultracheap Basic Economy flight tickets will be available in Latin America and on flights over the Atlantic later this year, with a premium economy fare class expected in the fourth quarter internationally. Kirby said United is also ""working on ways"" to add new premium economy service on domestic flights.United also sees Q1 capacity coming in up 3.5%-4%, trimmed from an earlier outlook for 3.5%-4.5%.""If there is even a hint about United reducing their 2018 capacity growth, it would be a key positive driver for the stocks,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note before the conference.Shares closed up 0.8% at 72.60 in the stock market today.CEO Doug Parker displayed a chart that showed a series of hits the carrier's stock has been dealt since earlier last year, due to pricing concerns, bad news out of rivals' earnings calls, and United's new plans to grow, announced in January.""Every one of these times, to us, felt like overreaction,"" he said.Instead, investors ought to worry about things like expanding to new markets that didn't touch one of the carrier's airport hubs, adding new hubs, and large orders for aircraft that weren't primarily for replacement.""These things aren't going to happen again,"" Parker said.Shares edged down 0.5% at 56.23 but remain in a buy zone.Delta raised its Q1 unit-revenue forecast to a 4%-5% increase, up from an earlier forecast of 2.5%-4.5%, with leisure and business travel improving. But the high end of Delta's earnings-per-share and margin forecasts got cut due to accounting changes. The carrier kept its expected capacity growth at around 3%.The company also sees a 3%-4% unit-cost increase in Q1, potentially more than the 2%-4% forecast in January, due in part to ""weather-related expenses."" Delta in recent weeks has had to cancel scores of flights due to winter storms on the East Coast. Shares rose 0.8%.Hawaiian shares gapped up 3.3% after the carrier hiked its Q1 outlook for unit revenue. The carrier sees the metric rising 3%-5%, an improvement from its original forecast of down 0.5% to up 2.5%.Southwest (LUV) stock rose 1%, and JetBlue (JBLU) gained 1.4%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Virgin Atlantic Follows Delta, United, American With New Economy ClassAirline Industry News And Stocks To WatchGE Snags Huge SpiceJet Deal As India Delivers Blow To United Tech's Jet Unit

""We will be reaching out to work groups across the company, and the changes we make will better reflect your feedback.""The conflict began out in the open last week, after the Chicago Business Journal reported that United was eliminating the performance bonuses eligible employees had been receiving each quarter and replacing them with a program called core4 Score Rewards.Every quarter, that new program would offer a single grand prize of $100,000 to a single employee, along with 10 Mercedes C-Class sedans, big vacation packages and cash bonuses of between $2,000 and $5,000.""Awful idea,"" ""insulting,"" ""not cool"" were among the reactions from United employees — part of some 500 comments posted to United's employee website that were reviewed by Inc.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

In order to qualify for the lottery, employees had to have perfect attendance during the quarter.""I can't imagine driving the Mercedes into the employee lot while everyone around me that worked just as hard, or harder got nothing,"" one employee said, according to Inc. ""I would feel like such a jerk. It's quite telling about the people who thought this up. I bet they would be gloating happily if they won.""United's decision on the program on Monday comes after the carrier over the past twelve months has angered both passengers and investors.In October, investors punished the carrier after it offered only a vague outlook for 2018. In January, United shares tanked after the carrier said it would expand flight coverage over the next few years – a move intended to help the carrier regain relevance in small cities but which raised fears of a new airfare war.After a passenger was dragged from a United Express flight in April, the incident led to a settlement, congressional scrutiny and a debate about airlines' boarding practices.Meanwhile, as the East Coast battled a winter storm carrying some harsh winds, a United flight on Friday traveling to Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia from Charlottesville, Va., also went through severe turbulence that also upset passengers.""Pretty much everyone on the plane threw up,"" according to a pilot's report.

82,LUV,"The U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal could pose a ""material risk"" to profits at airlines, while Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) could see more demand for newer, more fuel-efficient jets, according to an analyst.XMajor U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) already face rising fuel costs, as prices rebound from the oil crash in 2014. Delta's fuel costs jumped 20% in the first quarter. For American, they rose 26% over that time.In a research note on Tuesday, Canaccord Genuity's Ken Herbert said that if crude prices rise too fast airlines could spend less on ""older aircraft (negative for the aftermarket) and be positive for the demand for new, fuel efficient aircraft, unless the overall impact on airline profitability was substantial.""Fuel and labor are the airlines' two biggest costs. Withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposing of sanctions, announced by President Trump on Tuesday, will likely constrain Iran's oil exports, tweaking global oil prices higher.On Wednesday, U.S. crude prices jumped 3.1% to $71.17 a barrel, and Brent crude surged 3% to $77.12, with both hitting the highest levels since November 2014.Delta fell 1.4% in the stock market today, as shares make their way through a consolidation. United dropped 2.8%, and American lost 3.5%, continuing to sink further below its 50-day line, a key measure of investor support.

He said the return of tougher sanctions would not have a ""material negative impact"" on Boeing's backlog.""The risk for Boeing and Airbus is if fuel prices rise too fast, or too much, that it materially impacts airline profitability, which could be a natural headwind for order activity or backlog strength,"" he added. ""But generally rising fuel prices, within a range, are positive for the demand for new aircraft.""Boeing rallied 1.8%, while Airbus dipped 0.8%.Meanwhile, American and Allegiant Air (ALGT) face stiffer scrutiny from regulators over their maintenance practices.The Department of Transportation's Office of the Inspector General on Wednesday said it was examining the Federal Aviation Administration's process for ""investigating allegations of improper maintenance"" at Allegiant and American.

84,LUV,"JetBlue (JBLU) outlined plans Tuesday to be a more efficient airline for the years to come, a day after the carrier forecast stronger fourth-quarter unit revenue.Late Monday, JetBlue said it expects unit revenue, or sales per available seats and miles those seats are flown, to fall between 1%-2% in Q4, better than the 3.5% dip in Q3.Last week, American Airlines (AAL) said it expects total unit revenue for Q4 to range from a 1% dip to a 1% gain, an improvement from an earlier forecast for a 0.5%-2.5% drop, and United Airlines (UAL) forecast a 3%-4% Q4 unit revenue decline compared with a prior view for a 4%-6% drop. Delta Air Lines (DAL) in October predicted that metric would fall 3%-5% in Q4, an improvement from Q3's 6.8% drop.JetBlue shares rose 4.2% to 22.53 on the stock market today, hitting the highest level since February. American edged up 0.5%, United dipped 0.9%. Delta sank 0.6%, still just above a buy point. Southwest (LUV), which broke out from a long cup base this month, rose 0.4%, also in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Investors have become more bullish on airlines after the industry has shown greater potential for cutting back on the capacity expansion and fare discounts that have worried investors through this year and last year. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recent investments in the industry have also driven some airline stocks higher.In an investor presentation on Tuesday, JetBlue also said it expects flight capacity growth of 6.5%-8.5% next year, largely a pullback from the double-digit growth seen in this year's first half.The carrier is targeting $250 million-$300 million in structural savings by 2020, aided in part by customer self-service at airports and other digital initiatives.

85,LUV,"Boeing (BA) said late Monday that it will increase its quarterly dividend by 30% to $1.42 a share and replace its stock repurchase program with a new $14 billion buyback, while key uncertainties linger over the longer term.The aerospace giant enjoys a backlog of more than 5,600 commercial aircraft order as airlines scrambled to recapitalize their fleets in recent years, and Boeing is ramping up production of planes to meet demand, providing a steady source of cash for the company.""As our team delivers on our large and diverse order backlog, and drives greater efficiency across our business, Boeing is well positioned to generate increasing cash flows and meet our commitment to provide competitive returns to our shareholders,"" said Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg in a statement.Shares were up 1.6% at 159.70 in late trading on the stock market today, after closing 0.4% higher in the regular session at 157.16. The after-hours action suggests that Boeing may top its February 2015 peak of 158.83 on Tuesday.But Boeing has seen United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) delay hefty orders this year as carriers look to cut costs or invest money elsewhere. United even said it may add more used jets to its fleet.Cheap fuel costs have allowed airlines to fly older, less efficient models since the oil bust. While OPEC and non-OPEC members just reached a deal to trim production and prop up prices, increased output from U.S. shale companies could keep downward pressure on oil, and doubts remain about the credibility of the deal.Meanwhile, Boeing also said earlier this year there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane as well as a longer version of its 737 Max, after losing market share to rival Airbus' (EADSY) A321 neo.While that sounds like a major drain on cash, Boeing's Muilenburg assured analysts at a conference that the company could do both without ""changing our R&D and capex profile"" in the next five years, according to Bloomberg.The incoming Trump administration also represents another source of uncertainty, as he has taken to Twitter (TWTR) to signal displeasure with costs for programs like Boeing's Air Force One replacement and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.And Boeing's $16.6 billion, 80-jet deal with Iran, which was made possible by Tehran's nuclear deal with the U.S. and other western powers in January, is at risk as President-elect Donald Trump has harshly criticized the nuclear agreement and threatened to tear it up.Boeing late Monday also said it would cut its 777 production to five a month from seven, starting next August.

86,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Friday said it could see, at long last, that rarest of things for the industry beginning in the fourth quarter: an actual increase in unit revenue.The outlook would make American the first U.S. network carrier to push the key metric into positive territory after two years of expansion, fare cuts and a stronger dollar dragged it lower, and would outpace Delta Air Lines (DAL), which had sought to be the first but recently tamed expectations on when it might pull that off.American's forecast is the latest good news for the airline industry, which in recent weeks has signaled greater operational discipline as fuel costs, which combined with labor make up an airline's biggest expenses, trend higher. A possible uptick in travel after the election, the prospect that President-elect Trump could roll back regulations on businesses, and investments from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) haven't hurt either. American said it expects total unit revenue for Q4 to range from a 1% dip to a 1% gain, an improvement from an earlier forecast for a 0.5%-2.5% drop, and now sees adjusted pretax margin of 6%-8%, up from prior guidance for 5%-7%. The carrier hiked its forecasts due to improving yields — a measure of an airline's ability to charge travelers more for flights.Unit revenue measures sales in relation to an airline's overall flight capacity and is seen as a purer gauge of how efficiently an airline does business.""American will likely lead the industry in unit revenue performance in 2017 given the annualization of the credit card agreement (announced in 3Q16),"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Friday.American's shares climbed 3.3% to 49.64 on the stock market today, after rising as much as 5.4% earlier. Delta also pared gains sharply and settled 0.8% higher. United Airlines (UAL) added 3.3% after the carrier late Thursday also gave a more upbeat forecast on fourth-quarter unit revenue and reported strong November results. Southwest (LUV) rose 0.4%.Delta and Southwest shares are in buy range from this week's breakouts after briefly moving out of the 5% chase zone intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump, in his election victory speech, said he would work to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. That could be good for airlines, and it could also be good for building stocks like NCI Building Systems. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly, in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, also cited an uptick in booking trends, adding: ""I think we are all feeling a little bit more spring in our step.""American Airlines said that traffic for November fell 0.2%, while capacity rose 0.1% and load factor, a measure of an airline's ability to fill seats on planes, fell 0.3 percentage points. Investors have wanted the airlines to keep capacity growth more even with passenger demand and move away from lowering airfare.Still, the International Air Transport Association forecast that the airline industry's profits would fall next year as oil prices rise and that, overall, capacity would still exceed demand in 2017. Recent labor deals are also likely to drive up expenses for airlines.RELATED:United: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Air France's New Budget Carrier May Squeeze Delta, United, AmericanRyanair Sees Its Low Fares Forcing Rivals Out Of Some Markets

87,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) offered upbeat views Thursday on ticket demand for the holiday season, while an industry group said profitability will drop next year from this year's projected record high.United late Thursday gave a better outlook for its fourth-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue, forecasting a 3%-4% decline compared to a prior view for a 4%-6% drop, mainly due to ""stronger than expected bookings during the second half of the quarter.""Meanwhile, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told Bloomberg there has been an increase in booking activity since the election.""We had a record load factor for November,"" he said. ""It's not that it was remarkably better, but it was better and we had a really strong month. And bookings for December look a little better. Does that translate into anything different? Not necessarily, except I think we are all feeling a little bit more spring in our step.""Shares of Southwest edged down 0.5% to close at 49.60, still in buy range after breaking out Wednesday. United finished 0.4% higher at 72.74 then rose another 1.65% after hours. Delta Air Lines (DAL) reversed higher to rise 0.5% to 51.35 on the stock market today, also still in buy range after breaking out from a cup-with-handle base on Wednesday. American Airlines (AAL) fell 1.2% to 48.05. Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) jumped 4% to 56.45, edging further above buying territory.United also said that November traffic rose 1.7%, roughly in line with 1.6% capacity growth, and November had the fewest cancellations of any month in its history.After a contract with technicians was ratified on Monday, United now expects a 4%-4.5% increase in Q4 unit costs, which it said was ""better than original expectations,"" and sees Q4 pretax margin of 7.5%-8.5%. (Delta projected a 10% jump in Q4 unit costs following a similar deal with its pilots.)IBD'S TAKE: Airline stocks have jumped in recent weeks, in part because Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed new stakes in the major U.S. airlines — after shunning the industry for years.But as the cheap-oil windfall that began in 2014 recedes, the International Air Transport Association said early Thursday the global airline industry's profits will fall and capacity growth will slow next year to 5.6% from 6.2% expected this year, while traffic growth is expected to slow to 5.1% from 5.9%.That means expansion of capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and the distance they carry passengers — will continue to exceed the expansion in passenger traffic. Investors over the past two years have worried about industry overexpansion and have wanted airlines to curb supply to bring it closer to actual demand.The IATA also sees 2017 airline profits falling 16% to $29.8 billion, and the trade group cut its 2016 profit forecast to $35.6 billion from an outlook in June to $39.4 billion, citing higher costs and slowing global GDP growth. Still, 2016 is expected to be a record year for airline profits.Profitability next year was expected to be driven by North American airlines, the IATA said. And the group stressed that the dip in profitability next year would represent a ""soft landing"" for the industry.""These three years are the best performance in the industry's history — irrespective of the many uncertainties we face,"" IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a release. ""Indeed, risks are abundant — political, economic and security among them. And controlling costs is still a constant battle in our hypercompetitive industry.""RELATED:Delta's Costs Spike But Yields Improving; Southwest, Hawaiian Flirt With BuysUnited: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Delta, American, United Price Targets Hiked; FireEye Downgraded

88,LUV,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) on Wednesday reported November traffic that outpaced capacity growth, but the carrier stuck with its Q4 unit revenue outlook that disappointed investors when it reported third-quarter results.Passenger traffic jumped 7.2% in November, while carrying capacity rose 4.9%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, rose to 85.1%, a 1.8 percentage point increase from a year ago.Southwest said it continues to expect fourth-quarter operating unit revenue to fall 4% to 5%, based on November's results and current conditions. Unit revenue measures sales in relation to an airline's available seats and flight coverage, and is seen as a gauge of an airline's operating efficiency.Shares rose 4.55% to 49.85 in the stock market today above a 48.10 buy point of a long cup base. Delta Air Lines (DAL) climbed 2.2% to 50.53, moving above a 49.51 buy point from cup-with-handle base. But Southwest and Delta stocks rose in flat or below-average volume. Investors should look for stocks breaking out in strong trade, indicating mutual funds and other big institutional investors are adding to positionsHawaiian Holdings (HA), parent of Hawaii Airlines, rose 2% to 54.20, now slightly extended from a 51.63 buy point.Southwest's fourth-quarter unit revenue guidance makes it an outlier among the four big U.S. airlines. Delta Air, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) in October all forecast stronger unit revenue for Q4; Southwest didn't. (Hawaiian Holdings raised its unit revenue target on Monday.)IBD'S TAKE: After airline stocks crumbled for much of the year on fears they were being overaggressively competitive, they've seen an end-of-the-year rebound. Delta, Southwest and Hawaiian Airlines are all in buy points. IBD discussed how several airline stocks were near buy points. Unit revenue has fallen for the past two years as airlines expanded and cut fares amid a cheap-fuel windfall. Wall Street has wanted the airlines to curb that growth and find ways to raise fares in order to improve unit revenue.As for November, Delta held to its Q4 unit revenue outlook and reported decent underlying fundamentals despite an anticipated spike in costs following a new contract with its pilots. Analysts have also worried that the timing of certain holidays during the quarter might adversely affect airlines' financials, a trend cited by Southwest in its Q4 unit revenue forecast.American Air shares climbed 4.8%, while United advanced 2.1%.RELATED: Ryanair Sees Its Low Fares Forcing Rivals Out Of Some MarketsUnited: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'

89,LUV,"The main indexes extended gains in late trading Wednesday, with some hitting record levels.The S&P 500 jumped 1% and reached a record high. The Dow Jones industrial average also hit an all-time high, adding 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 made a record high of its own, adding 0.6%.Dow component Home Depot (HD) rose 2.5% and is drawing near the 132.23 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. IBM (IBM), another of the Dow 30 stocks, rose 2% and is back above the 161.96 entry of a cup with handle.IBM, the tech services and Big Data computing giant, could also be viewed as forming an additional handle over the prior six sessions, furnishing a slightly higher yet relevant entry of 164.76.The Nasdaq climbed 0.9%, as a rout in pharmaceuticals and some health care stocks failed to spread to other sectors. The composite still has some recovery to do before topping prior highs.Volume was tracking higher across the board. That was a good sign on a day when indexes hit new highs, as was the day's breadth: Winning stocks led losers by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.Technology and financial stocks were the best performing in the IBD 50. But the index was indicated 0.3% higher, a lagging performance that was curious, to say the least, in the context of today's strong market.An eclectic mix of metal, consumer, technology and transportation stocks led the broad market today. Airlines were active on the upside.Southwest Airlines (LUV) rose 3.5%, making its best move above a 48.10 buy point so far. But volume was running well below Southwest's usual levels, which made the breakout suspect. The airline reported November traffic that outpaced capacity growth. Southwest also kept its Q4 unit revenue outlook, which had disappointed investors. Delta Air Lines (DAL) jumped 2.7% to 50.85 and surged past a 49.51 buy point of a large cup-with-handle pattern. Shares are still in proper buying range. Yet volume also was tracking roughly 19% below normal levels with an hour left in Wednesday's session.Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose more than 2.3% and is barely out of proper buy range from a 51.63 buy point it cleared a couple of weeks ago.In the IBD 50, Middleby (MIDD) made a new high and is adding a bit of cushion above the 139.34 buy point of a cup-with-handle pattern. Middleby makes commercial cooking and baking equipment, making it a key supplier to the restaurant industry.Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR) deepened losses. The stock slid as much as 5% in heavy trading, falling deeper below the 50-day moving average.

90,LUV,"As president-elect, Donald Trump is pro-business and a champion of corporate tax cuts — not to mention, anti-free trade and a big-company bully.That's a disorienting mix for chief executive officers trying to suss out whether Trump in the White House will be a blessing or bad luck. Planning ahead is no easy task when the next commander in chief is a guy with a hair-trigger Twitter finger who touts policies that could both help and hurt U.S. companies. Many said in interviews that they're cautiously optimistic — and a tad nervous.""I've got a great deal of confidence with the new administration coming in,"" Manny Chirico, CEO of apparel giant PVH Corp., said on Bloomberg Television, adding in the next breath, ""You have to be concerned about some of the talk and the rhetoric on trade.""The challenge is anticipating what Trump will do once in office. Will he crack down on immigration, dealing a blow to labor markets for restaurants, retail and construction? Hike tariffs on foreign-made goods and exit trade deals, which would be a hit to companies from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE)? Push to slash tax rates and ease regulations, things business tends to like?""I don't think anyone has any idea what to expect,"" said David Yermack, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""Companies have to make educated guesses about what may happen when, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty.""Prepping for Trump's four years has added a new plank to public-relations strategy and the assessment of reputational risk. At PR firm Weber Shandwick, Liz Cohen, an executive vice president for financial communications, said she's advising clients to perform vulnerability analyses just as they would for outspoken activist investors.""Clearly, in this environment, it's important companies take a look at what parts of the business could be criticized,"" Cohen said.Such is the power of the Trump Twitter feed, with its 17.3 million followers. He's been using it to harass companies just as he did Hillary Clinton and his GOP primary rivals. A CEO can be thrust into the news cycle with no warning.""That's a little bit unnerving,"" said Southwest Airlines' (LUV) Gary Kelly. ""There is some volatility there. We just don't know where the bully pulpit is going to come from.""Lockheed Martin (LMT) was a recent target, slammed in a tweet for what the president-elect said were out-of-control costs for the F-35 fighter jet. The immediate fallout was painful, with the tweet sending the stock down 2.5% and erasing almost $2 billion in market value.In fact, Trump's gripe with Lockheed caused drops in other defense contractors, which had been rallying in anticipation his administration would boost defense spending, considering he said when he was campaigning that he wanted to beef up the number of U.S. troops, ships and warplanes.Whatever the industry, ""a lot of guys are thinking, 'Oh man, I don't want him tweeting about me and my company,""' said Ken Lowe, chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI), which owns lifestyle-oriented websites and cable-television channels. And there's no telling who Trump will assail next.""A lot of us also think, 'That's one day. What's he on to tomorrow?'"" said Lowe.General Electric's (GE) Jeffrey Immelt said many chief executives would gladly accept fleeting bad publicity in exchange for the tax reform and job creation the next president may bring. Immelt said he's not worried about getting in the man's cross hairs — and that he keeps a sharp eye on @realDonaldTrump.""Sure,"" he said with a laugh during an exchange last week with reporters in New York. ""Who doesn't?""Bosses should totally get what Trump's doing when he calls a company on the carpet, because it's what so many of them do within their own operations. He's acting just like a CEO, Lowe said, by publicly asking, ""Why are you spending so much money?""In the corporate world, ""it's been an effective strategy,"" said Davia Temin, founder of the crisis-management company Temin & Co. ""It will be a fascinating experience to see how things that have worked inside global organizations translate to the political arena.""For all that, the victim of a Twitter pounce must be careful, she said.""Never start a press war with someone who can outgun you,"" Temin said. ""A CEO could choose to have a battle of the titans and fight back. That is a strategy, but not one I'd recommend.""Boeing (BA), another recent mark, certainly didn't take that road. In fact, according to people familiar with the matter, Boeing executives reached out to transition-team members to tell them the Air Force One price tag Trump had complained about could be lowered — if the government reduced the requirements. The company said CEO Dennis Muilenburg had spoken with Trump and was committed to keeping the project as affordable as possible.That's the kind of outcome, squishy as it is, that Trump can trumpet as a victory. There was a similar result after he hammered United Technologies (UTX) during the campaign for its plan to move some U.S. jobs to Mexico in its Carrier unit. Postelection, Carrier made a deal to keep an Indiana factory open with more than 1,000 employees in exchange for tax incentives provided by the state — whose governor is Vice President-elect Mike Pence — while still sending jobs to Mexico.Some executives profess not to be sweating it all.""We're not big enough to be on that radar screen,"" said Wendy's (WEN) CEO Todd Penegor. Maybe, but Trump has gone small too, even badgering a local union representative in Indiana.Asked if presidential unpredictability will make it harder to run a business, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) CEO Lauren Potdevin said only time will tell. The company generates about 70% of its revenue in the U.S. But as Potdevin took pains to point out, it's based in Vancouver, British Columbia, in a country not ruled from the White House.""Being a Canadian brand is awesome,"" he said. ""Everyone loves Canada.""

91,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Friday cut its fourth-quarter operating margin forecast and hiked its expected unit costs due to a newly ratified contract with its pilots, but the carrier reported encouraging November results.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) reported traffic that outpaced carrying capacity growth.The news pushed Delta shares up 1.1% to 48.31 on the stock market today, closer to a 50.60 buy point. Southwest (LUV) climbed 1.8% to 47.91, just below a 48.10 buy point after topping that level intraday. American Airlines (AAL) added 0.8%, and United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.2%. Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose 1.6% to 51.20, but is back below a 51.63 entry point after rising as high as 51.95 earlier.Delta now expects its nonfuel unit costs, including profit sharing, to spike around 10%, well up from the 1%-2% increase forecast when the company reported third-quarter results in October. The carrier expects operating margin of 9.5%-10.5%, down from a forecast of 14%-16% given in October.The earlier outlook, Delta noted then, did not factor in costs from any deal struck with pilots. On Friday, Delta said its new pilot contract included a retroactive adjustment that would be accrued in Q4 for a total cost of $475 million. Excluding the labor deal, operating margin would be at the higher end of the forecast the carrier gave in October, Delta said.Still, the carrier held to its forecast for a 3%-5% drop in passenger unit revenue, a measure of how much money airlines make on passengers compared to available seats and distance traveled. The company said it still expects Q4 capacity to be up around 1%.In November, unit revenue, or sales as they relate to an airline's overall carrying capacity, fell 1%. Capacity dipped 0.7%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, rose 0.9 percentage points to 85%.The carrier said it ""continued to see stabilization"" of close-in domestic yields, or its ability to make more money on tickets booked closer to a flight's departure time. Positive unit revenue in Latin America also helped, Delta said.Alaska Air Group shares rose 2.4% to 84.83 climbing further above buy range, after the carrier said passenger traffic rose 7% in November, while capacity rose 2.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As low-cost carriers outside the U.S. offer cheaper trans-Atlantic flights, the big U.S. network carriers have tried to find ways to compete. Airlines like Delta, American and United have leaned more toward cheaper fare classes, as opposed to dedicated low-cost airlines of their own.After punishing airlines through much of the year on concerns of overexpansion, Wall Street has taken a more sympathetic approach to the industry. With oil prices rising, investors have been more hopeful that airlines will pare back growth and, in turn, shore up unit revenue. Warren Buffett's recent investments in the big carriers has also helped.RELATED:Ryanair Sees Its Low Fares Forcing Rivals Out Of Some MarketsAir France's New Budget Carrier May Squeeze Delta, United, AmericanDelta, American, United Price Targets Hiked; FireEye DowngradedDelta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs.

93,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Thursday cut its full-year profit forecast due to higher jet-fuel costs, while Southwest Airlines (LUV) served up a weak sales outlook following an engine blowout on a flight this month that left one passenger dead.Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) reported first-quarter earnings per share that beat analyst expectations. But revenue came up short.Even as higher fuel costs threaten industry profits, travel demand for American and rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) has remained solid. American on Thursday said it expects second-quarter 2018 unit revenue to rise 1.5%-3.5% year over year, citing ""expected continued strength in demand for both business and leisure travel.""However, due to higher fuel prices, the carrier lowered its adjusted full-year earnings-per-share forecast to $5-$6 a share, lower than an earlier outlook for $5.50-$6.50. Analysts had expected $5.74.Shares were down 6.4% at 42.37 in the stock market today but tumbled as much as 10.2% earlier. Delta and United lost 2.8%.For the first quarter, American said unit revenue, or an airline's sales when looked at in relation to its overall flight capacity, rose 3.5%, hitting the midpoint of its own forecasts for a 3%-4% gain. American saw the key industry metric pick up across all its regions, singling out Latin America as a particular area of strength.Earnings surged 23% to 75 cents per share in Q1, beating estimates by a penny, as revenue climbed 6% to $10.4 billion, compared to views for $10.412 billion. But American said that fuel costs jumped 26% during the quarter.Southwest said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to fall 1%-3%, adding that roughly ""one to two points of this estimated decrease is attributable to recent softness in bookings following the Flight 1380 accident.""That accident occurred on April 17 when the left engine of a Boeing (BA) 737 — the workhorse jets that make up Southwest's fleet — ripped open on a flight en route to Dallas from New York. Shrapnel from the explosion shattered a window on the plane, partially pulling a passenger out of the plane. The passenger, Jennifer Riordan, was later pronounced dead at a hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.The National Transportation Safety Board said the engine, made by a General Electric (GE) joint venture, had shown signs of metal fatigue after a fan blade had broken off from it. The carrier canceled some 40 flights on Sunday for inspections.""It remains a somber time for the Southwest Family following the Flight 1380 accident, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the Riordan family, and all of our customers on the flight,"" CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement today.""We continue to cooperate with the National Transportation Safety Board's thorough investigation to understand the cause of the accident,"" the statement continued.But the carrier, which has built its reputation on low fares, could face more scrutiny from analysts and investigators in the wake of the accident. The accident also follows a ""60 Minutes"" report that raised questions about Allegiant Air's (ALGT) safety record.The accident's effect on Southwest's booked flights was harsher than some analysts anticipated.""Our initial thought would be that the 1-2 pts is much more of an impact than we would have expected particularly in the context of Allegiant, whose bookings returned to normal after several days,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.Southwest's first-quarter earnings per share rose 23% to 75 cents, matching Zacks estimates, although other consensus forecasts came in at 74 cents. Revenue rose nearly 2% to $4.94 billion, just shy of estimates for $5.018 billion.Shares tumbled 1% to 53.30 on Thursday.Southwest last month lowered its first-quarter unit revenue forecast, citing in part, ""the competitive fare environment that continues to pressure passenger revenue yields"". Cowen analysts said they thought the pressure could have been a result of United's planned expansion into smaller cities over the next three years.Meanwhile, ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines' EPS slipped to 44 cents, beating views by a cent, while revenue climbed 19% to $704.14 million, missing estimates for $705 million.Shares tumbled 5.9% to 35.40.Earlier this month, Delta and United sailed through their first-quarter earnings calls, with both companies lifting industry stocks on solid global demand, helped by pricier seats at the front of the cabin. However, as oil costs rise, Delta noted that fuel would be a ""wild card"" in its 2018 profit forecast.But after two earnings calls in which United's plans — or apparent lack thereof — alarmed investors, the carrier last week focused on its bullish global revenue outlook. Analysts suggested the investor goodwill toward United was as much about what it didn't say during the call as what it said.""For good reasons many were nervous about UAL's call, but it was solid and measured,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note on Friday. ""UAL mainly talked about itself and not others, which is what good companies do, and gave people no reasons to panic about the space.""Similarly, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a note last week, said United had benefited from a ""lack of controversy"" and a ""lack of aggressive pricing commentary.""Wall Street has been worried that United's plans to expand its flight coverage in the U.S. would prompt other carriers to expand as well, starting a fare-matching war that would damage profits. United's willingness to match discount carriers on their own lower ticket prices has also dismayed investors.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Southwest Airlines Traffic Caps Wild Week For Delta Air, Other Airline StocksUnited Airlines, American To Wall Street: You Don't Get What We're DoingAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

94,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) said Thursday that fuel costs, which jumped 20% in the first quarter, are a source of earnings uncertainty. But it remained bullish on international demand, and said that it planned to add a lot of premium, higher-priced seats to flights this year — a move that could shore up profits as costs rise.Q1 earnings fell 4% to 74 cents a share, beating Zacks Investment Research views by a penny, while revenue climbed 8% to $9.76 billion, missing forecasts for $9.88 billion. Unit revenue grew 5%, in line with Delta's own view.For Q2, Delta predicts EPS of $1.80-$2, in line with Zacks consensus for $1.92, with unit revenue up 3%-5% and capacity up 3%-4%.When asked during a conference call with analysts if Delta is still on target for its 2018 EPS guidance of $6.70, CEO Ed Bastian said it was, but that fuel will be the ""wild card.""Oil prices in the $70-per-barrel range were still manageable and could create more disciplined operations elsewhere, Delta said, adding that non-fuel unit costs are also seeing an ""unacceptably high"" rate of growth.More premium seats are a part of Delta's ""backbone"" for growth, President Glen Hauenstein said, adding that the carrier would be adding a lot more of those seats to flights this year.""We will have double digit increases throughout the year in terms of premium seats in the marketplace,"" he said during the call.The premiums on those higher-end fare classes, he said, ranged from 10% to as much as double the average coach fare, depending on the type.""So that's really a key driver for us, and I think I think one of the reasons we were able to post what I would consider superior revenue numbers for the first quarter,"" he said.Delta shares were up 2.9% at 52.98 in the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) rose 2.6%, United Airlines (UAL), which reports results next week, added 1.9%, and Southwest (LUV) gained 2.7%.

Such a move could strengthen a rival to the U.S. carriers on the international stage.IAG said it had taken a 4.61% stake in Norwegian. That investment, IAG said, ""is intended to establish a position from which to initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility of a full offer for Norwegian.""

95,LUV,"As Delta Air Lines (DAL) coasts into first-quarter earnings season on brisk international demand, investors remain anxious about what United Airlines' (UAL) expansion into smaller U.S. cities means for the industry in the months ahead.XStrong demand globally helped lift the forecast and also likely pushed American Airlines (AAL) and United to ratchet up their own forecasts Tuesday and late Monday, respectively.But American is leading a sell-off in the sector Tuesday after giving Q1 guidance that was less bullish than its peers and seeing its earnings forecast cut by Wall Street.Last week, Delta Air Lines briefly gave airline stocks some relief from Wall Street's trade-war agita when the carrier said that Q1 unit revenue, a much-fixated-upon gauge of an airline's efficiency, would come in at the upper end of its expectations.Analysts expect Delta's earnings per share to fall 5% to 73 cents. Revenue is expected to increase 8% to $9.88 billion. Delta expects unit revenue to increase around 5%.""Unfortunately for Delta, we expect any optimism to be somewhat muted given the fears of a trade war between the world's two largest economies,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Tuesday, but added that the U.S.-China tension shouldn't affect near-term travel.The earnings will also follow a string of nasty winter storms that prompted flight cancellations in the northeast. The airline industry is also battling rising jet-fuel costs.Cowen analysts, however, note that United's plans to add more connecting flights between its airport hubs and smaller cities, where it can charge more, begins ""in earnest"" in Q2. Those additions, which will take place over this year, next year and 2020, are part of United's efforts to reclaim what it has called its ""natural"" market share.But Wall Street worries that any such expansion will bring retaliation from rivals. And they worry the retaliation will force airlines to slash fares in order to draw travelers. That kind of competition threatens profits and usually drives airline stocks lower.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The pricing environment remains top of mind for the investment community as they continue to digest United's expected (second-half-of-the-year) capacity additions,"" Cowen's Becker said.When Southwest (LUV) cut its Q1 unit revenue forecast last month, she suspected it was a ""direct result"" of United's expansion plans. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a research note, said that cut appeared to largely be the result of ""forecasting errors"" from the carrier.Also Tuesday, American raised the low end of its Q1 unit revenue guidance and now expects a 3%-4% increase, up from an earlier view for a 2%-4% gain. Delta and United, however, guided to the high end of their respective ranges. Cowen also cut its 2019 EPS forecast for American to $6.50 from $6.85.American also said Tuesday that capacity, or an airline's overall flight coverage, would be up 2.5% for the full year on a schedule-over-schedule basis. But it said actual capacity growth would be slightly higher, due to flight cancellations prompted by the hurricanes that hit Florida and the Caribbean last year.""We suspect some of the selloff today is due to the market having priced in a bigger beat than what American guided to – and some seeing the improved guidance as not a beat at all,"" Joseph DeNardi said in a research note. ""In addition, higher oil prices today along with headlines from Saudi expressing its desire for $80/bbl oil is also a headwind.""Late Monday, United said it expected a roughly 2.7% gain in Q1 unit revenue, helped, as with Delta, by a pickup in international travel demand. That forecast was near the upper end of United's earlier expectations for an increase of 1%-3%.Shares of American sank 4.7% in the stock market today, settling at its lowest close since November. United fell 1.4%, Delta lost 0.4%, and Southwest eased 1.3%.Crude oil futures surged Tuesday, likely adding further pressure on airline stocks.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing Stock Falls Despite Big American Airlines Deal, Easing China Trade FearsSouthwest Airlines Traffic Caps Wild Week For Delta Air, Other Airline StocksBoeing Stock Soars As China Tariff Threat 'Dissipating'

Revenue of $11.97 billion also beat consensus views, and user numbers met expectations. Premarket action suggested the stock could open back above its 10-week moving average. That would set the stock up to begin climbing the right side of a possible base. Premarket moves do not always carry over into regular trade.Chip stocks gathered for a sharp early advance, with all 30 of the Philly Chip Index stocks trading flat to higher. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led, up 10% in premarket trade.

American Airlines (AAL) narrowed its early loss to 2.9% as lowered full-year earnings guidance diluted strong unit revenue growth and a narrow earnings beat for the first quarter.  Southwest Airlines (LUV) dumped 3.8% following mixed first-quarter results.

101,LUV,"Everything you do — or don't do — is an opportunity to either build influence or tear it down. You can't turn that off or even slow it down, so be intentional, not accidental.That's from Tim David, author of ""True Influence: The Magic Of Human Connection.""Tips on getting through to others:Scrutinize your words. It doesn't necessarily cost any extra money or extra time to have maximum influence, David says. Sometimes it only requires that you change the words you say.For example, he tells us that the email app Boomerang analyzed over 350,000 email threads and found there was one ""magic phrase"" at the very end of emails that gets a 65.7% response rate, while all the other words and phrases average only 47.5%.The phrase? ""Thanks in advance!""""It's easy enough to start including that phrase where appropriate, right?"" David adds.Attract their attention. The human brain suffers from information overload. That's why you can arrive at work but not really remember the drive, David says. ""Your brain saves energy by tuning out boring, repetitive, monotonous things.""The solution marketing-wise is to change your approach. ""As soon as something new or out of the ordinary shows up in our awareness, our brains switch on and begin to pay close attention,"" he says."" This can range from the way you word things to changing surroundings in a meeting.If you find yourself saying something you've said a thousand times, ""that might be your problem right there,"" David says.Define yourself. Ryan Holiday, author of ""Perennial Seller: The Art of Making and Marketing Work that Lasts,""  says to think of Southwest Airlines (LUV) co-founder Herb Kelleher, who has an incredibly clear mission statement:Kelleher put it like this: ""I can teach you the secret to running this airline in 30 seconds. This is it: We are THE low-cost airline. Once you understand that fact, you can make any decision about this company's future as well as I can.""Holiday says that due to this, Southwest Airlines' employees know who their customers are and what those customers need.Court influencers. When a real person whom many others trust say your product or service is good, ""it has an effect that no ad can match,"" Holiday says.He points to Marc Ecko, who built his clothing brand Ecko Unltd into a billion-dollar company. His first influencer was popular New York City deejay Kool DJ Red Alert.Ecko loved the deejay's show. To get attention for his company, Ecko sent the show special drawings to show off his product line. Then he started sending airbrushed hats and jackets and T‑shirts.""Ecko never asked for anything — he just made great work and sent it to select influencers he knew might appreciate it,"" Holiday says. ""Eventually, he got his first shoutout on the air, and the brand was officially born.""Probe intelligently. Pose well-thought-out questions that lead people to the conclusion that you desire, David says.""Influence is an emotion transplant,"" David says. ""It's about getting people to care. But it's about getting them to care for their own reasons, not yours.""Connect for free. Build an email list, Holidays says. ""It's the most durable of platforms, and it's the most direct.""Things like creating a newsletter and providing valuable information for free help spread your influence.Another applicable example: TED video talks are free to watch and have racked up billions and billions of views since the first videos went up. Parlaying that influence has helped the company achieve revenue in the tens of millions.Tell a great story. Holiday points out that the average book in this country sells less than 500 copies, there's well over a day of content uploaded to Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube every minute, and many startups don't make it.""A creator needs not only to make something brilliant and exciting and new, but also has to have brilliant, exciting and compelling marketing too,"" he says.David: ""If you want to move mountains, you must be able to move people.""

106,LUV,"Airline stocks are sinking Wednesday, in a repeat of last October's dive, after United Airlines (UAL) vowed to keep matching fares from low-cost rivals, renewing fears of a price war that could hit earnings across the industry.X The carrier appears unlikely to back off anytime soon, forecasting greater expansion this year, next year and in 2020, even as it sees tighter cost management and stronger earnings per share over that time.""The best way to compete with a low-cost carrier is to match their prices,"" United President Scott Kirby said on a conference call late Tuesday. ""Half our revenue approximately comes from customers that are mostly shopping on price, and we cannot ignore half of our revenue and we can't let low cost carriers have price advantages in our hubs.""He added: ""No one chooses to fly on an ultra-low-cost carrier if they can get the same price on United Airlines — nobody — at least if they know what they're buying.""United expects capacity to rise 4%-6% this year, with similar increases coming in 2019 and 2020, as it tries to dig into domestic strongholds, push flight connectivity and regain relevance, the carrier said during a presentation after its fourth-quarter earnings.Prior to the presentation, analysts had already been worried that United's flight-capacity growth might balloon at a bigger rate than its rivals. The company's overall strategic plan, and whether United would stay committed to financial targets attached to it for this year, was the source of a major Wall Street breakdown on Oct. 19 after United gave only vague answers as to how it was approaching 2018. Management's handling of analyst questions about 2018 tanked United's stock by 12% that day and briefly raised questions of whether a shake-out at the top was ahead.In a rerun of that meltdown, shares of United collapsed 11.4% to 69.05 on the stock market today, dipping below their 200-day average. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported Q4 results earlier this month, fell 5.2%. American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), which report next week, tumbled 6% and 4.7%, respectively. Ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) sank 6.9%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.An expansion is likely to revive investor fears that United's rivals will expand in retaliation, and cut ticket prices to fill those extra seats. Still, CEO Oscar Munoz said during the presentation: ""It's about margins this year and forward.""The forecast followed plans announced this month by both United and American to pour more flights into smaller cities. During the presentation Tuesday, United's Kirby outlined a strategy to redouble its efforts to connect more flights to smaller, higher-yielding destinations via its hubs in Chicago, Denver and Houston — mid-continent areas he said were in ""ideal"" locations geographically.Still, United forecast non-fuel unit costs to come in at flat to down 1% this year. But the carrier said increased regional flying, tech investments and higher labor costs posed difficulties to containing those expenses. The carrier expects those costs to come in ""flat or better"" next year and in 2020. And the company is targeting 2018 earnings per share of $6.50-$8.50, a figure that will swell to $11-$13 a share in 2020. Analysts expect EPS of $6.63 this year.United forecast Q1 unit revenue in a range of flat to up 2% — better than the 0.2% increase it put up for Q4, which was largely in line with the company's expectations. That important industry statistic tries to gauge how efficiently an airline is operating by measuring revenue as it relates to an airline's overall available seats and flights.United also forecast Q1 non-fuel unit cost growth of flat to up 1%, better than the 1.5% growth in the Q4, which rose largely due to higher labor costs. Capacity growth was seen coming in at 3.5%-4.5%.For Q4, earnings per share of $1.40 topped estimates for $1.34, while revenue of $9.4 billion just beat views for $9.43 billion. Pretax margins were 6.7%.Since October, United's shares have rebounded as strong travel demand gives airlines room to charge more for tickets, and as United showed signs of clamping down on cost growth.And much of the worry about this year comes as unit revenue – largely the only financial metric Wall Street has cared about in recent years – solidifies with higher prices and demand. And the big three legacy carriers' struggles internationally, particularly in Europe and in Asia, appear to be easing as economies abroad start to tick higher.Delta, in reporting Q4 results earlier this month, said unit revenue in the Pacific region turned up positive for the first time in four and a half years. Management said it was ""bullish"" on international results this year also due to what it expects to be an easier foreign exchange situation.American in November launched daily nonstop service from Los Angeles to Beijing; United this month said it would remove charges on passengers' second checked bag on flights from North America to China and Hong Kong. United is also offering round trip fares from the U.S. to China for as low as below $500 this month and next to celebrate Chinese New Year.And in the U.S., Delta said it expected more people will want to fly due to the GOP's tax cuts signed into law last month.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:United Airlines Weighs These Options As Boeing Eyes New Midsize JetTax Cuts Leave These Airline Winners, Losers; United Lifts Key OutlookMeet The 'Editor' That Tells You What Your New Product NeedsAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

107,LUV,"Stocks shook off morning weakness and were higher Thursday afternoon, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a new high.X The Dow was up 0.6% to lead the main indexes. It benefited from 3M (MMM), which leapt nearly 3% to an all-time high after the company's earnings and sales topped views. Megacap 3M also raised its quarterly dividend and announced plans to increase investments this year.Another contributor to the Dow was Caterpillar (CAT), which reversed higher. The heavy-equipment maker breezed past sales and profit expectations. The stock also is near a record high. United Technologies (UTX), which reported earnings Wednesday, and Boeing (BA) also were outperforming.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were up 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was flat. Volume was lower compared with the same time Wednesday. Winners and losers were even on the Nasdaq but losers had a slight advantage on the NYSE despite the S&P 500's gain.There was no clear leadership in today's market. A mix of health care, cyclical and consumer stocks led, while transportation, homebuilding, some retail and semiconductor groups were lagging sharply.Shopify (SHOP) broke out past a 124.04 buy point in heavy volume. But the pattern is a risky late-stage base and it lacked a cohesive shape, making any purchase riskier. Shopify, which provides cloud-based platforms for online commerce, said today it will report Q4 results Feb. 15.One reason the Dow transportation average plunged 1.5% was airline stocks, which were weaker again after more earnings reports came out. Some of their charts continued to deteriorate.Alaska Air Group (ALK) gapped down to the lowest level since July 2016 but pared losses. The company reported Q4 adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share and sales of $1.96 billion, which met expectations. Alaska Air also said it's raising its quarterly dividend by 7% to 32 cents a share.American Airlines (AAL) beat profit estimates and gave strong earnings guidance. But higher fuel costs impacted results. The stock erased all gains from its 53.84 buy point but has not triggered sell signals.Southwest Airlines (LUV) tumbled below its 50-day moving average in heavy trading and erased all gains from its breakout at 59.99 Nov. 30. That triggers a round-trip sell signal. Southwest beat expectations, but cited higher labor and fuel costs.United Airlines (UAL) — which sparked a sell-off in the industry with a vow to raise capacity, match low-fare rivals and other strategic moves — fell 2% in intense volume.  The stock is forming a cup-with-handle base but it is faulty because the handle's depth exceeds 12%.RELATED:Dow Leader Caterpillar Just Steamrolled Estimates AgainAmerican Airlines Guides High, Tops Views; Southwest Beats, But Airline Stocks Keep FallingAmazon Price Target Raised On Expectations Of Strong Results 
"
108,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter earnings that easily topped views and dramatically raised its 2018 profit guidance, adding to indications of more robust demand across the industry.X The results follow earlier signs from American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) that their pricing power has improved.In Q4, Delta's earnings per share climbed 17% to 96 cents, beating estimates for 88 cents, as revenue increased 8% to $10.245 billion, topping views for $10.16 billion. Passenger unit revenue grew 4.2% vs. Delta's forecast for an increase around 4%.The results exclude a one-time charge of $150 million from the inclusion of foreign earnings and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, following tax reform.Delta now sees 2018 EPS at $6.35-$6.70, up from a prior view of $5.35-$5.70 and well above the consensus for $5.75, on total revenue growth of 4%-6%. Its corporate tax rate should hit 22%-24%.For Q1, Delta sees EPS of 60-80 cents, below consensus for 82 cents, on unit revenue growth of 2.5%-4.5%, with capacity up about 3%.""We enter 2018 with significant momentum and every entity delivering positive passenger unit revenue for the first time in five years, driven by a robust demand environment and improving business fares,"" said Delta President Glen Hauenstein in a statement.CFO Paul Jacobson said Delta will focus this year on getting unit cost trajectory back in line with Delta's long-term 0%-2% target, with Q1 expected to be the peak of nonfuel expense growth.Delta shares surged 4.8% to 58.52 on the stock market today, rising above buy range. American climbed 4.9% to 56.42, clearing a 53.84 buy point, though its relative strength line still lags. United rallied 4.6% after jumping 6.7% Wednesday, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) added 3%, extended beyond buy range once again.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Fourth-quarter forecasts this week from American and United have signaled that ticket prices, from their standpoint, have improved, meaning they've been able to charge passengers more or discount less. American also said that close-in demand domestically had been higher than anticipated.But higher fuel costs could hurt margins this year. Costs have become more of a focus for analysts in recent months — after pay raises and fuel pushed expenses higher last year — and they may keep a tighter lens on how well airlines can manage their nonfuel expenses.But recent tax cuts are helping the airlines' customers, especially big corporations, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said earlier this week that Delta, United and American should see more business and international travel.More domestic-focused carriers like Southwest, however, will likely be outperformed by the big three legacy airlines, the analysts added.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchThese Numbers Show How Much China, Asia Mean To BoeingStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

110,LUV,"Stocks continued to shine on the third day of trading in 2018, and this time the Nasdaq lagged.X Following gains of 1.5% and 0.8% on Tuesday and Wednesday, the tech-rich Nasdaq composite rallied 0.2% by day's end, backing off intraday highs in a rather tight trading session. Yet the leading index of 2017 (up more than 28% that year) still looks poised to hold firmly above the 7000 level in its first week of trading in 2018.Defensive stocks continued to struggle. The Dow utility average, losing more than 1% on both Tuesday and Wednesday, fell another 0.8% on Thursday. The Dow transports added 0.3% and stands as a current leader among sector indexes since Jan. 1, up more than 2%.Meanwhile, DowDuPont (DWDP) is giving large-cap investors a chance to time their new buy wisely as the chemicals giant broke out Thursday, rising out of a nearly 10-week flat base that shows a 73.95 buy point. Shares rose 2.1% to 74.60, helping the Dow Jones industrials rise 0.6%. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.For a flat base, simply add 10 cents to the base's left-side high, or in DowDuPont's case, 73.85. DowDuPont corrected less than 8% within the base from intraday high to low, falling nicely within the maximum 15% decline threshold.Volume in DowDuPont, a fundamentals turnaround play not too unlike Apple's (AAPL) situation in 2016-2017, is running mildly above average. For a big or megacap stock, you'd prefer to see volume run 40% above the 50-day average or higher. However, in some cases, huge turnover doesn't come in until days or even weeks after the breakout itself.Also notice on a daily chart how turnover has definitely heated up compared with the dull volume days during the last two weeks of December.Analysts see DowDuPont's earnings up just 1% in 2017 to $3.22 a share, but then surge 25% to $4.03 a share, which would be the highest earnings since at least 2008. Total sales rose 36% in 2016 to $66.18 billion, and are seen gaining 18% in 2017 to $78.07 billion and up 7% to $83.48 billion this year.DowDuPont has grown sales in each of the past seven quarters. The increases range from 8% to 46%.The Dow Jones industrial average component has 2.34 billion shares outstanding and a market value of $174 billion.The Street sees earnings slipping 33% to 66 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2017, despite revenue rising 49% to $19.43 billion. There may be some restructuring expenses hitting the bottom line following a historic merger between Dow Chemical and DuPont. The company has been cutting jobs and closing facilities as part of a $3 billion savings plan.However, DowDuPont's earnings are expected to bounce back the next quarter, rising 20% to $1.21 a share in the first quarter of 2018 on an 8% hike in sales to $22.17 billion.Elsewhere the highflying Bitcoin-tracking Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is cooling its heels after stupendous gains in December. The ETF fell just 2.2% to 2,204 in ultralight trade. Average volume has recently expanded to 133,000 shares, so the dollar volume is ample for most traders.At this point, following a hyperbolic run last month and a elevatorlike plunge over just four sessions, quiet trading is a welcome change. But at the current price level, the risk of losing money on a new buy is likely higher than normal. Why? Bitcoin Investment has not corrected long enough to produce a genuine new chart pattern that can maximize short-term gain and minimize losses.Over the next several weeks, keep tracking the price movement. Does it hold above its fast-rising 50-day moving average? Will it form a bullish new base such as a cup or double bottom? Or do big sellers come in strong again? Only time will tell.Some commentators believe the strength of Bitcoin is bullish for gold. Gold-related ETFs are doing well so far this year.The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) investment trust rose more than 0.5% to 125.46 in turnover boosting 10% above usual levels. A new base has been forming since the large-cap ETF topped at 128.32 in September. SPDR Gold is now less than 3% below that peak.The current base has elements of a double bottom, which would give a 124.07 entry, 10 cents above the Oct. 16 middle peak of 123.97.Airlines have been rising in recent months, but strength in crude oil futures lately may serve as a stiff headwind. American Airlines (AAL) tried to break out of an 11-week cup with handle that features a 53.57 buy point. But shares, after hitting as high as 54.40 intraday, shaved its gain to less than 0.7% at 52.68. Plus, volume is limp.Southwest Air (LUV), part of IBD Leaderboard, is down slightly. At 64.70, it's extended from a proper buy point, after having broken out past 59.99 in a large cup with handle.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Southwest has one of the best Composite Ratings among the U.S. companies within IBD's Transport-Airline industry group at 81 on a scale of 1 to 99.The Dow transportation average rallied 0.4%.

111,LUV,"As ""animal incidents"" increase on flights, from dogs mauling passengers to scorpions on the loose, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) have tightened up their policies for passengers traveling with emotional support animals. The changes take hold March 1 and follow a surge in customers bringing emotional support animals onto flights.X Those measures — the announcements of which blend corporate speak with mentions of snakes, hedgehogs and tiny marsupials known as sugar gliders — are being put in place for safety purposes and lack of regulations, those companies said.American Airlines (AAL) has said it is reviewing its policies. Southwest (LUV), following an incident Wednesday in which a dog bit a young girl, said it is ""constantly evaluating"" its policies, but did not say directly whether it was giving its support-animal policies more scrutiny than normal.Here's how the companies are dealing.Delta in January said as of March 1, customers traveling with an emotional support animal will need to submit a signed veterinary health form and/or an up-to-date immunization record, a letter signed by a medical professional and a form verifying the animal's training. Customers need to send that documentation to Delta at least 48 hours in advance of their flight.Delta said it had seen an 84% increase in ""animal incidents"" since 2016. Those incidents included biting, urination and defecation. They also included a man who suffered 28 stitches' worth of facial injuries, according to his lawyer, after the man was attacked by an emotional support dog aboard a flight in June.""Customers have attempted to fly with comfort turkeys, gliding possums known as sugar gliders, snakes, spiders and more,"" the carrier said in a release last month.""Ignoring the true intent of existing rules governing the transport of service and support animals can be a disservice to customers who have real and documented needs,"" that release continued.Starting March 1, United passengers with an emotional support animal will need to provide health and vaccination forms signed by the animal's veterinarian.United passengers will also need confirmation from the veterinarian that the animal isn't a threat, and confirmation that the animal has been trained to behave well in public spaces. That's in addition to an existing requirement that passengers with such animals provide 48 hours' notice and a letter from a mental health professional.While that announcement came shortly after a United passenger was barred from bringing aboard a large peacock, Charles Hobart, a United representative, said the carrier had begun reviewing their policy around the end of the summer. Delta's announcement, he said, helped the company decide ""to move forward at a quicker pace"" with the policy change.The carrier last year flew about 76,000 emotional support animals, an increase of roughly 77% vs. 2016, he said. The increase in incidents, he said, was ""comparable"" to that seen at Delta.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmerican Airlines has said it is reviewing its policy on emotional support animals. It was unclear when a decision might be made on the matter or how likely a change would be.""Within the past few weeks we've (taken) a closer look at it after other carriers have announced plans to do something similar,"" said Matt Miller, a spokesman for American, in an interview early this month.Passengers who travel on American currently need to provide a letter from a licensed doctor showing that the passenger has a recognized emotional disability and needs the animal during and after the flight.Between 2016 and 2017, American saw a more than 40% increase of customers who transported support or service animals.Southwest passengers who want to travel with an emotional support animal need documentation that's less than a year old, from a licensed mental-health or medical professional, saying that the passenger needs the animal and has a mental or emotional disability recognized in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.That medical professional also needs to include the date and type of their license and the area where it was issued.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsThese Fightin' Words From United Just Ignited Another Airline MeltdownAmerican Airlines Backs Growth Plans, Outlook Despite Price War Fears

112,LUV,"General Electric (GE) backed its earnings and cash-flow guidance Friday after reporting strong Q1 results, bolstering prospects for GE's dividend.The industrial conglomerate still sees full-year EPS of $1-$1.07, reaffirming it's tracking to the lower end of the range, as well as adjusted industrial free cash flow of $6 billion-$7 billion in 2018.GE expects to end 2018 with more than $15 billion in cash and doesn't see recent accounting changes impacting its industrial free cash flow, which supports GE's dividend. Cash flow was in line with the company's expectations in Q1 and improved $1.1 billion from a year ago.""Cash is front and center in every conversation,"" CEO John Flannery said in a conference call.Investors, including many who count on GE's dividend for retirement income, have been skittish about the payout since the company halved it last year. Plans to shed cash-generating businesses have added to dividend concerns, and last week's restatement raised worries about the earnings outlook.In fact, Goldman Sachs analysts said earlier this week that a cut to GE's 2018 EPS outlook is ""almost a certainty and could potentially happen as early as 1Q earnings.""Shares rose 3.9% to 14.54 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average for the first time since November, though the stock had been up as much as 7.6% earlier and is still down more than 50% over the past year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFlannery also cited ""significant progress"" on a targeted $20 billion in asset sales and a strategic portfolio review, with proceeds from divestitures this year alone now seen at $5 billion-$10 billion, which will include an industrial solutions unit and a health technology unit.""We expect to have something to share with you within the next couple of months,"" Flannery added.Later Friday, reports emerged that GE is in talks with Wabtec (WAB) to sell its rail unit, sending Wabtec shares up 4.5%.Q1 EPS rose 14% to 16 cents, beating Wall Street views by 5 cents, as revenue climbed 7% to $28.66 billion, above forecasts for $27.88 billion. Aviation revenue grew 7% and health care 9%. The power unit slid 9%, extending a slump.GE saw double-digit profit growth in its core health care and aviation markets in Q1, as well as in renewable energy. But power saw profits tumble 38%. Oil and gas profits fell 30%.Management said the jet-engine market is still strong, benefiting from strong growth in both domestic and international markets. The company is on track to deliver 1,100 to 1,200 next-generation Leap engines in 2018, although currently deliveries are ""about 70 units behind.""The aviation segment in particular is in the spotlight, after a jet engine made by GE's joint venture with Snecma blew apart in midair Tuesday, forcing a Southwest Airlines (LUV) flight to make an emergency landing and killing one passenger.Later Friday, the engine joint venture, CFM International, recommended expanded inspections of engines similar to one involved in the Southwest accident. The FAA is also expected to call for emergency inspection of CFM56-7B engines.GE sees the power market trending to less than 30 gigawatts for the next several years, further lowering its own expectations, as energy efficiency and growth in renewable energy have driven lower demand for coal- and gas-fired power plants.But Flannery said he sees ""green shoots"" as GE adjusts to the power market and improves execution.

113,LUV,"General Electric (GE) will report first-quarter results Friday as it continues to slog through a restructuring of its vast portfolio of businesses that spans everything from jet engines to medical scanners.XAnalysts on average expect a 48% decline in Q1 EPS to 11 cents despite a 1% revenue increase to $27.88 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.The world's largest industrial conglomerate faces one of the worst slumps in its 126-year history while the global economy booms.After it posted years of weak earnings, new CEO John Flannery took the helm in August, vowing he will make ""2018 a reset year"" built on massive cost cuts, billions in asset sales, and a new strategic vision. Despite some progress on those fronts, problems have continued to mount.Notably, GE lowered its 2018 profit outlook and disclosed an SEC probe of its accounting practices. Investors responded by dumping its stock afresh, which now sits at its worst level since 2009.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShares closed up 2.4% at 13.99 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow Jones industrial average industrial conglomerates United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM), finished 0.8% and 0.3% lower, respectively.Here are five key areas to watch:Aviation is in the spotlight, after a jet engine made by GE's joint venture with Snecma blew apart in midair Tuesday, forcing a Southwest Airlines (LUV) flight to make an emergency landing and killing one passenger.Last week's accounting restatement also raised some flags. The aviation unit is the ""crown jewel"" of GE's vast business portfolio, according to investment research firm Morningstar.However, restated profits in aviation were flat in 2017 vs. 2016, JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa said earlier this week. Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna chimed in that ""aviation profits were flattish"" despite a much more favorable backdrop in 2017 than it can expect in 2018.Higher oil prices will weigh on the unit, he said. Plus, deliveries of the advanced but loss-making LEAP jet engines are expected to ramp up.GE Power will also be in focus after Flannery's promise to ""reset, refocus, and renew"" the deeply troubled flagship unit. Power's earnings crumbled 45% in 2017. GE has warned that the gas-turbine market was ""far more challenging"" than it foresaw in 2017 and that the pain could persist into 2019.Management's 2018 outlook is unrealistic and will likely have to be lowered, analysts caution.Goldman Sachs' Joe Ritchie warned Monday that a cut to GE's $1.00-$1.07 EPS guidance for 2018 is ""almost a certainty"" after the restatements. He thinks it could happen during the Q1 earnings report.Cowen's Khanna is less certain that the compnay will cut its guidance this quarter, but warns it will ""capitulate"" sometime this year.Analysts on average expect full-year 2018 EPS of 96 cents, following a lowering of estimates in the past four weeks, according to Zacks Investment Research.The continued deterioration in GE Power is a big reason why analysts think the company will have to walk back its numbers.Cash is top of mind for Flannery — and investors in General Electric.For 2018, GE is targeting $6 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow. It needs $4.2 billion just to support its newly reduced dividend. Any cut to cash flow guidance will be another blow to investors who had long prized it as one of the best income stocks.Amid cash flow challenges, the company halved its annual dividend in November to 48 cents.""The dividend may be trimmed again,"" Khanna cautioned Thursday, reiterating a view shared earlier by both Cowen and JPMorgan. A slumping GE stock has raised the dividend yield to 3.5%.Contract assets grew $3.7 billion in 2017 to $28.86 billion. It's an area of concern, not only because those assets have swelled in recent years but also because its contract accounting is now drawing regulatory scrutiny.Contract assets reflect revenues that the company books on long-term equipment and service contracts before it gets the cash in hand.GE may address plans to convert its contract assets to cash in its call with analysts Friday, following the earnings release. In 2017, cash flows from contract assets were below GE's own expectations.Besides contract assets, management will also likely be pressed on plans to dispose of $20 billion in assets.So far, its deals have been relatively small fry, including a sale of its industrial solutions business for $2.6 billion and the sale of a health care technology unit for $1 billion. Proceeds from asset sales will help support the dividend.As GE mulls smaller asset sales, it has kept the option of a bigger breakup in play, with the core aviation, power and health units becoming separately traded assets.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?GE's Factory-In-A-Box Will Help It Expand This Key Business As Power WiltsGE Engine In Spotlight As Southwest, NTSB Probe Fatal FlightIs There A Way To Make A Million Dollars By Trading ETFs?

115,LUV,"The Dow struggled straight through the closing bell Wednesday, marking a mixed finish for the market as gains narrowed in late trade. Still, the three major indexes held or gained ground above their 50-day moving averages.The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.2%. A 2.8% run up by Home Depot (HD) and an afternoon rally among blue chip energy names helped the Dow hold some ground vs. IBM's (IBM) 7.5% slide.The S&P 500 eased to an advance of less than 0.1%. Textron (TXT), CSX (CSX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) powered the index through much of the session, holding their ground after early breakouts. Rallying airline and energy stocks shared several of the index's top gains.The Nasdaq closed up 0.2%, but off its session highs. Intuitive Surgical, CSX and American Airlines (AAL) led the Nasdaq 100.

Both stocks are extended above cup bases.CSX, Intuitive Surgical and Textron all scored gap-up breakouts in the stock market today.CSX was up 7.9% as it broke out past a 60.14 buy point in a four-month-long base. The breakout, fueled by healthy first-quarter results, remains in play: The buy range extends through 63.15. The base is a second-stage pattern, which is good. The stock's relative strength line has been trending higher since February and made a new high from the time the stock was basing.Intuitive Surgical swelled to an 8.2% gain.

117,LUV,"While United Airlines' (UAL) ambitious expansion plans have raised anxieties over a coming airfare war, American Airlines (AAL) CEO Doug Parker said his company had no plans to change its own growth goals this year — ""based on what we know now.""X He also said United's plans won't change American's earnings guidance for this year, despite concerns that lower fares and more competing flights will erode profits.""Look, we'll see where people grow, we'll see where people decide to compete,"" he said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""We will obviously respond where we think it makes sense, but it's always going to be around our core strategic assets.""But he said that the carrier would grow in a way that was unlikely to cause new skirmishes on fares, and that fares were ""too low for oil prices this high. Over time, you'll see it adjust.""American plans to expand flight capacity by 2.5% this year, and 3% when factoring in cancellations resulting from hurricanes in Florida and the Caribbean last year. Still, that's lower than United's plans for 4%-6% growth this year and a similar rate for next year and 2020.But analysts pressed Parker on why they should trust American's longer-term profit and growth targets, which include a minimal fleet expansion and 2018 earnings per share of $5.50-$6.50.He responded by saying ""we're not going to opine on other airlines' capacity plans,"" but that American plans to expand in areas where it has a competitive advantage.The growth, he said, would come from 1) new service to smaller cities like Panama City, Fla., and South Bend, Ind., 2) adding more frequent flights to existing cities like Stillwater, Okla., and 3) connecting those cities to new hubs.While he acknowledged that service to new markets means other carriers may lose ""a little share,"" he maintained it won't start a fare war or ""some sort of enormous competitive response."" He later added: ""Sometimes, you can get overreactions to a number.""In spite of his efforts to add nuance to American's expansion plans, shares closed down 3.2% at 53.05 on the stock market today, piling on to Wednesday's 6% dive. United fell 4.3% after plunging 11.4%, and Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported earnings earlier this month, lost 3.5% after dropping 5% yesterday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Meanwhile, travel demand and unit revenue — an important measure of an airline's operating efficiency — continue to rebound for American. The carrier forecast unit revenue growth of 2%-4%, reflecting expected continued improvement in demand for both business and leisure travel. But that forecast would mark a slowdown from the 5.6% unit-revenue gain in the fourth quarter.""Customers are responding positively to the options American offers, from international First Class to Basic Economy,"" said American Airlines President Robert Isom in a statement. ""We are far ahead of our U.S. competitors in offering Premium Economy on our international flights, which comes just as we begin to prepare for the busy summer travel season.""During the call, management said the ""premium"" section of its cabins did much of the heavy lifting in helping unit revenue to rebound internationally, as more passengers seek more comfort on longer flights over the Atlantic and Pacific. American's results over the Atlantic, where low-cost, long-haul rivals have proliferated, got better due to premium offerings and matching fares more precisely.American earned 95 cents a share in the fourth quarter, better than expectations for 92 cents. Revenue came in at $10.6 billion, compared to estimates for $10.58 billion. Operating expenses climbed 9.8%, due to a 23.5% jump in fuel costs and a 7% increase in salaries and benefits.Also Thursday, Southwest Airlines' (LUV) earnings per share of 77 cents and revenue of $5.27 billion also topped estimates. CEO Gary Kelly said ""our goal remains to achieve positive unit revenue growth in 2018, year-over-year.""The carrier said it expects 2018 capacity growth to be in the low 5% range, according to a Raymond James research note. That's in line with the carrier's earlier forecast for growth of under 5.7%.Shares retreated 3.2% after tumbling 4.7% on Wednesday.Alaska Air Group (ALK) sank 4% after it forecast a 3.5%-4.5% drop in first-quarter unit revenue.

118,LUV,"Thursday's session was volatile early after major stock indexes opened nicely higher amid more weakness in the U.S. dollar and a three-year high for the euro. But the dollar moved off lows and the euro weakened after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that 2018 could come and go with no rate hikes despite improving economic conditions in the eurozone.X In late-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average led the way, rising 0.3%. Dow Jones industrial component 3M (MMM) was a top gainer in the blue-chip index, up around 2%, after the company reported accelerating earnings and sales growth and also increased its dividend to $1.36 a share.

Shares of American slumped nearly 3% after gapping down 6% Wednesday.  Southwest dropped nearly 4%, giving up support at the 50-day moving average after posting modest fourth-quarter growth.Varian Medical Systems (VAR) was a standout performer on strong earnings, soaring 11% to 125.03. The stock gapped out of a flat base with a 114.19 entry, meaning the open price at 123 was a legitimate entry.After Wednesday's distribution day for the Nasdaq, some leading growth stocks are starting to show chinks in their armor.Elsewhere, buyers of Universal Display (OLED) at the last breakout over 145.40 have reason to take at least partial profits after three straight declines in heavy volume, and another one taking shape Thursday.

121,LUV,"Third-quarter earnings season in October was not exactly gentle on the airlines. But investors have, perhaps, been a little easier on Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports Q4 results on Thursday — just weeks after the legacy carrier laid out some ambitious goals to push profit higher and contain costs this year.X The GOP's tax-cut package, ticket prices and, naturally, those targets seem likely to be focal points for investors. On Tuesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the tax cuts are likely to boost business travel, helping Delta, United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).As for Q4 itself, Wall Street expects Delta to report earnings per share of 90 cents, up 10%, on revenue of $10.16 billion, a 7% increase, according to Zacks Investment Research. That top-line gain would mark the biggest increase since Q3 2014.Delta last week said it expected a roughly 4% increase in passenger unit revenue during the quarter, which would be its best showing all year in the key metric. The company expects adjusted operating margin of around 11%.After United flat-out terrified investors in October following a murky 2018 financial forecast and shares of American and others retreated on a mixture of worries about too much expansion and rising costs, Delta has remained ""the go-to legacy airline,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said in a research note last week.He cited the carrier's 2018 profit and the cost targets it outlined last month at its investor day — EPS of $5.30-$5.70 and unit cost growth of flat to up 2% along with the potential lift from the GOP's tax reform — as reasons to like the airline.Many investors on Thursday will likely be seeking more insight into how Delta might use the savings from that law, and how it might affect travel demand. Cowen analyst Helane Becker said she expected Delta to raise its earnings-per-share forecast this year to as much as $6-$6.35 due to the tax reform. Lalwani added that the possible benefits of tax cuts could pad the carrier's industry-leading free cash flow.Analysts will also be watching for Delta's diagnosis of airfares and demand, amid expectations for a pickup in U.S. travel that would increase ticket prices and boost profits.And Wall Street will be watching for signals that Delta can keep a tight lid on costs. Unit costs for airlines rose last year — due largely to labor deals, more expensive fuel and higher airport fees — and raised concerns that they could hurt margins this year. However, Lalwani said cost issues were ""already known by the market,"" and Becker said nonfuel unit-cost growth was easing and that airlines appeared to be getting better at handling those costs.Delta shares remain in buy range after breaking out from a cup-with-handle base last month from a 54.16 entry. But the Relative Strength line, which wasn't strong at the breakout, has weakened as the stock has failed to make much headway while the broader market marches to new highs. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Any brighter outlook from Delta, however, would follow a fourth quarter in which the carrier had to cancel some 1,400 flights following an outage at its Atlanta hub, denting its pretax income by an amount expected to be somewhere between $25 million and $50 million. The company will take a one-time charge of $150 million to $200 million from the tax cuts, which have had the effect of lowering the value of some assets on large corporations' books.Still, the carrier said it expected to see positive unit revenue in all its markets globally, after discounting from low-cost, long-haul European carriers, a stronger dollar and economic difficulties weighed on those results in years past.Delta also has tried to broaden its international coverage through joint ventures. It agreed to form one last month with Canada's WestJet — and management could offer more details on that front.Moreover, Delta has been the ""most rational"" in competing with ultra-low-cost carriers, JPMorgan's investment thesis on the company says. Dirt-cheap fares from Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and others have, at times, tempted the bigger carriers into matching them on price, whittling away profits and aggravating investors.""Delta is often cited as the peer leader in terms of capital allocation and execution, and we believe investors will continue to take notice,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker wrote.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Delta Falls After Raising Q4 Cost Forecasts, Curbing Capacity GrowthThis No. 1-Ranked Leisure Stock May Be Planning A New BreakoutAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

122,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday joined United Airlines (UAL) in raising its fourth-quarter unit revenue, citing better prices across its global network and more flights booked closer to departure times.X The figures, reported ahead of Delta Air Lines' (DAL) fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, indicate that the airlines have had more leeway in charging passengers more to fly, amid solid demand and rising fuel costs, which airlines pass onto travelers.American said it expected total unit revenue to rise 5%-6%, better than an earlier forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% bump. The carrier also said it expected Q4 adjusted pretax margin to come in at roughly 6.5%-7%, compared to an earlier view for 4.5%-6.5%.Unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, were expected to rise roughly 4%, American said, largely due to pay raises to employees and other expenses. But the forecast was lower than its previous outlook, due to a higher than expected completion factor — or total flights completed.American shares sparked 3.3% higher to close at 53.78 in the stock market today, stopping just short of a 53.84 buy point. Delta rose 3.1% to 55.86 and was still within range of a 54.16 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. United, which gave its Q4 forecast late Tuesday, jumped 6.7%. Southwest (LUV) gained 0.9%, and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) added 2.9% after sinking 6.3% Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.American said it expected to record around $315 million in pretax special items in Q4, including costs related to merger integration and fleet restructuring, as well as the $1,000 bonuses given to employees following the tax cuts that Trump has signed into law.Southwest on Tuesday said it was sticking with its Q4 unit revenue forecast, but the stock was also downgraded yesterday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which said GOP tax cuts would boost business travel at Delta, United and American but leave Southwest will little benefit.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

123,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday forecast higher fourth-quarter costs, partly a reflection of the power outage at the carrier's Atlanta hub in December that forced some 1,400 flight cancellations, and the carrier left its margin and unit revenue outlook unchanged despite signs of strong demand.X The carrier said nonfuel unit costs, including profit-sharing, likely rose 5.5% vs. a year earlier, up from a forecast for a 5%-5.5% increase given last month. Delta cited the outage, ""continued investment in our people and product combined with accelerated depreciation of aircraft retirements"" as reasons for the higher costs.Delta said it expected to take a $25-$50 million hit to pretax income during the fourth quarter due to flight disruptions that resulted from the outage.The company said it still expects passenger unit revenue to increase around 4% in the fourth quarter, with operating margin holding at around 11% as higher fuel prices continue to weigh against strong sales trends.Fuel costs should continue to rise for Delta and other carriers. U.S. crude futures rose to $61.63 a barrel on Wednesday, their highest close since December 2014.Delta also said, as previously indicated, that it expected to book a one-time charge of $150-$200 million in the fourth quarter due to the tax cuts that President Trump signed into law last month.Analysts generally expect tax cuts to benefit the airlines, but the lower corporate rate will bring down the value of a company's deferred tax assets, or assets that companies can use to lessen their tax burden when they suffer a loss. Banks like Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have forecast multibillion-dollar hits to profits as a result of the tax cuts' effect on those assets.Shares of Delta slipped 1.85% to 55.69 in the stock market today, but the stock was still in buy range of a 54.16 entry of a cup-with-handle base.American Airlines (AAL) slid 1.25%. In a letter to employees on Tuesday, American Airlines said it would give $1,000 to non-officer employees — a $130 million reward in total — in the first quarter due to the tax cuts. Southwest Airlines (LUV) retreated 2.1%. Southwest Airlines on Tuesday also said it would give $1,000 bonuses to employees this month, and it also stepped up its fleet investments with Boeing (BA).United Airlines (UAL) sank 0.65%.American Air, Southwest, United Air and other carriers should report December traffic figures in the coming days.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Delta also cut its Q4 forecast for flight capacity — a measure of an airline's overall flight coverage — to 2.3% growth, down from a range of 2.5%-3.0% given in December. For December, passenger traffic dipped 0.4%, while capacity rose 0.9% and load factor fell 1.1 percentage points to 84.2%.The monthly figures come as the airline industry gears up for Q4 earnings season and some three weeks after a bullish investor day, when it forecast earnings-per-share growth of 10%-15% this year. But cost management could be more of a focus for Delta and investors in 2018, after the carrier put more money toward its fleet and hiked employee wages last year.Meanwhile, in the wake of the Atlanta outage, the carrier said on Tuesday that it was ""keeping a close eye on"" a winter storm brewing off the southeast coast of the U.S. that could drift further north.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostBig Changes Are Coming To Airbus C Suite Amid Corruption ProbesIt's Official: Boeing Loses Massive Delta Air Lines Order To Airbus

124,LUV,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) has a good earnings and balance-sheet profile, but its focus on domestic traffic means Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) will benefit more from a boost in business travel sparked by tax cuts, analysts said.X Meanwhile, United boosted its outlook for Q4 passenger unit revenue and now sees it coming in about flat from a year ago, driven by stronger yields and better close-in demand. Last month, the carrier predicted it would be down 2% to flat.Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded Southwest to neutral along with Alaska Air (ALK), while JetBlue (JBLU) was cut to underperform. American was upgraded to buy; Delta and United were maintained at buy.""We believe Southwest is the highest quality airline in the group with a very conservative balance sheet and low earnings volatility,"" BofA Merrill Lynch said. ""However, we expect business travel and international markets to outperform Southwest's largely domestic-oriented system in 2018.""Southwest shares closed down 2.5% at 62.38 on the stock market today for a fifth straight decline but still extended from a 59.99 buy point. Delta dipped 0.9% to 54.17, still within range of a 54.16 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. United ended virtually flat but jumped 3% late, and American lost 0.1%.JetBlue, which on Tuesday also said it would add service between Florida and the Caribbean, rallied 0.9%, and Alaska fell 2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Late Tuesday, United also said December traffic grew 2.7% and capacity increased 3.7%, while load factor declined by 0.8 percentage point to 82.3%.Earlier in the day, Southwest said it still expects unit revenue to increase 1%-2%. The airline said that passenger traffic in December rose 2.6%, while its flight capacity rose 1.8% and load factor was up 0.7 percentage point to 83.3%.The monthly traffic figures come as Delta prepares to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Delta's financials have kept analysts relatively happy, but Wall Street appears likely to be more focused on cost containment this year after industry expenses rose in 2017.Southwest, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25, last week said it would give employees a $1,000 cash bonus ""to celebrate the recent passage of the tax reform legislation.""The company also said it would exercise an option to order 40 Boeing (BA) 737 MAX 8 aircraft — 15 next year and 25 in 2020. It deferred 23 737 MAX 7 orders. Southwest at the time said its capacity growth plans for 2018 remained unchanged.American Airlines and JetBlue last week also said they would give their employees $1,000 following the tax cuts, which President Trump signed into law last month.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

132,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) delayed delivery of $5 billion in Boeing (BA) jets on Tuesday, following a similar delay from Southwest Airlines (LUV) in June, and may add more used jets to its fleet as carriers look to cut costs.United said it would delay accepting 61 737-700s it ordered from Boeing earlier this year but didn't give a new delivery date. The carrier will still take delivery of four of the jets ordered but upgrade them to the larger 737-800.United said the delay will save the airline $1.6 billion in capital costs and come as United looks to improve profitability through 2020 in an effort to beat out rival Delta Air Lines (DAL).United shares climbed 5% to 66.06 in the stock market today, coming amid its investor day Tuesday and late Monday disclosure from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) that it has bought a stake in United Airlines, Delta and American Airlines (AAL) in Q3. Buffett also said Berkshire has bought Southwest shares after Sept. 30.Boeing fell 1.25% to 148.11. Southwest added 2%. Delta gave up most of its gains to close up just 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: The delivery delays are trickling down to aerospace supplier TransDigm, which gave weak 2017 guidance and said it is cautious about the commercial transport aircraft market.In June, Southwest said it would delay delivery of 67 Boeing 737 Max8 planes by as much as six years, but would accelerate six 737-800 orders to 2017 from 2018 as it will retire older 737s. And in July, American Airlines pushed back the delivery of 22 Airbus (EADSY) A350 widebody aircraft.Meanwhile, oil prices remain cheap after crashing two years ago. This has made flying older aircraft economical and reduced the need for newer planes with more fuel-efficient engines.Boeing has said cheap fuel hasn't affected long-term demand for aircraft, but carriers are able to push back delivery of new models by deploying used planes.Meanwhile, the company said late Tuesday that it is consolidating facilities in its defense and space business, transferring some jobs and closing sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va. The net result is a reduction of 500 positions. Boeing has trimmed its workforce by almost 17,000 this year.RELATED: Boeing: 'Realistic Possibility' Of Midsize Jet, Stretch 737; Stock In Buy ZoneUnited: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Warren Buffett, Who Called Airline Stocks A 'Death Trap,' Invests In Big 4Boeing Gets $3.2 Billion China Southern Order As China Travel Booms
"
133,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) at its Investor Day on Tuesday said that its network of travel hubs and its range of fare offerings give it a long-term advantage over low-cost, high-fee rivals, which have set their sights on trans-Atlantic routes long dominated by the big U.S. network carriers.The issue has come up as top European airlines launch budget units. But during Delta Air Lines' (DAL) third-quarter earnings call last month, management said it had ""no intent to create an airline within an airline"" to compete on cheaper fares offered by overseas rivals.And on Tuesday, United said such a model ""was always doomed to fail,"" in part because it forced traditional airlines to compete on the low-cost carriers' terms.What the big U.S. airlines are pursuing instead is cabin segmentation, or dividing the plane up into different seating classes. To that end, United also on Tuesday introduced its United Basic Economy seating class, mimicking similar efforts from American Airlines (AAL) and Delta to draw people looking for cheap flights.United Basic Economy is set to debut next year in select markets and offers some of the same amenities as the carrier's traditional economy services, such as food, Wi-Fi and other features, ""with availability depending on the flight.""But full-size carry-ons won't be allowed on board unless the passenger is a Premier member, a Star Alliance Gold member, or a primary card-member of a qualifying MileagePlus credit card. Passengers are allowed to bring a small personal item aboard, and the policies for checking bags are the same as with standard economy.Seat assignments are also automated and provided at check-in, which means that passengers might not be able to sit together, United said.Despite its aversion to creating an airline within an airline, United acknowledged that competing in the skies above the Atlantic would be difficult next year, as budget rivals in and outside of the U.S. have focused more on international travel.Canada's WestJet, Iceland's Wow air and Norwegian Air Shuttle offer cheaper flights across the Atlantic. Within Europe, Lufthansa's Eurowings competes in the low-cost market. And the Wall Street Journal recently reported that Air France-KLM plans to launch a budget airline that could eventually fly to the U.S. Meanwhile, Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) said it expects its low fares to prompt rivals to simply give up in some areas.IBD'S TAKE: As low-cost carriers swarm, Delta has said it would consider an array of options to compete for market share over the Atlantic. United also said it hopes to keep unit-cost growth under 1% from 2018 to 2020, and said it was targeting a 1.5-point margin premium to Delta by 2020.Shares jumped 5% to close at 66.06 on the stock market today. Delta edged up 0.4%, while American climbed 3.1%.Shares of United, Delta and American rose after hours on Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) disclosed new stakes in the carriers. CNBC reported that Berkshire had also taken a stake in Southwest (LUV).That would be just a bit of a reversal for Buffett, who once said investing in airlines was a ""death trap"" that had essentially lit investors' money on fire for an entire century.""Here, a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive since the days of the Wright brothers,"" he said in a 2008 letter to shareholders. ""Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.""Elsewhere during United's Investor Day presentation, management said they might benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's plans to spend big on infrastructure improvements. However, the company said it was still too early to tell how a Trump presidency might affect them, adding, ""We're just simple folks trying to run an airline.""RELATED:United Airlines Will Pare Capacity On Brexit, Corporate DemandUnited Sees Unit Revenue Improving In Q4 But Labor Pact To Lift CostsAmerican Airlines Sees Thinner Margins, Alaska Air Trims Capacity

134,LUV,"Shares of the four big U.S. airlines got an after-hours bump after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) disclosed new stakes in the carriers. It's a dramatic reversal for Buffett, who for decades has vocally opposed investing in airline stocks.Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 2.6% after hours in the stock market today, while American Airlines (AAL) 4.3% and United Airlines (UAL) 2.2%.Airline stock have been soaring in recent days. During the regular session, Delta rose 2.35% to its highest since April. American Air climbed 1.1% to a seven-month best. United Air soared 4.5% to a an 18-month best.Berkshire also took a stake in Southwest (LUV), CNBC reported. Southwest was up 3.4% late Monday after closing 3.4^ higher.In an SEC filing, Berkshire (BRKA) said it owned $797 million in shares of American Airlines, $249.3 million in Delta and $237.8 million in United, as of Sept. 30. Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire has also invested in Southwest after Sept. 30.Back in 2013, Buffett said airline stocks were a ""death trap,"" adding that ""Investors have poured their money into airlines for 100 years with terrible results.""Buffett has been wary of investing in carriers since he nearly lost all of a 1989 investment in US Airways, though he eventually made money on the deal, CNBC noted.""The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, then earns little or no money,"" Buffett wrote in a 2008 letter to shareholders. ""Think airlines. Here, a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive since the days of the Wright brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.""IBD'S TAKE: Airlines are among the many sectors soaring since the presidential election. Here's the case for a Trump bull market.
"
135,LUV,"Right now in stocks, small is big. Small-cap stock mutual funds continue to soar. Small-cap value funds are up 22.20% this year going into Friday, according to Morningstar Inc. Small-cap blend funds were next best, up 18.27%. Those topped all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small-cap growth funds were sixth best, up 12.10%.Small-cap stocks are thriving amid concerns that any trade war sparked by a Donald Trump presidential administration would hurt large-cap multinational companies the most. Meanwhile, U.S. economic growth at the moment is strong enough to prompt Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen to say that a rate hike by the central bank could come ""relatively soon."" That economic growth has heartened small-cap investors.""Small caps are outperforming as investors realize that the Trump administration will be a much more business-friendly administration,"" said Craig Hodges, co-manager of $356.4 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX). ""That's going to have a more dramatic effect on small companies. Also, that fact that ObamaCare could get rolled back is positive for small caps. It's such a costly expense, especially for small caps.""Brian Smoluch, lead co-manager of $169 million Hood River Small Cap Growth (HRSRX), says small caps in several industries stand to benefit from lighter regulatory burdens and possible tax cuts. In addition, if Trump pushes infrastructure investments, small caps in that space would benefit, he adds.Hodges cites Trinity Industries (TRN), which makes rail cars and construction aggregates, as a small cap that stands to benefit from a Trump White House. ""It has gone to nearly 28 from 21 on no new news other than the election results (ushering in) a different business environment.""For similar reasons, he likes United States Steel (X) and Eagle Materials (EXP). U.S. Steel, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 87, is up 73% in the past month. Eagle, which makes gypsum wallboard and cement products, gapped up 8% the day after the election.IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating. Here's where to learn more about reading the Comp Rating road signs.And Hodges Capital Management also holds Corecivic (CXW) and Geo Group (GEO), two REITs that run correctional facilities. ""(Hillary) Clinton was adamant about having the government get out of that business,"" Hodges said. ""Prison stocks fell when the Department of Justice talked about getting out of that. They've rebounded since.""And Hodges says he has renewed interest in restaurants. He has been underweight. We're looking for under-owned, good-looking situations. Hodges Capital is down to one restaurant stock, Cracker Barrel (CBRL). ""Cracker Barrel and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) — we got out of that — a lot of their fixed costs will go down if minimum wages aren't rising 50% and a lot of their health care costs go down.""""And we still like energy,"" Hodges added. If the price per barrel of oil is in the 55-to-65 range, ""a lot of exploration and production companies are extremely popular,"" he said. Oil's recent volatility has hurt oil stocks. ""But we would be buyers on weakness,"" he added.""Matador Resources (MTDR) is active mostly in the Delaware and Permian basins,"" he said. ""They've got the best small-cap management team in the E&P space. Their science is second to none.""Hodges also likes the outlook for some bigger stocks. A decreased prospect of government regulation should aid airlines stocks, he says. ""Warren Buffett said he is buying airlines for the first time since 1989: Delta (DAL), United[ticker symb=UAL], Southwest (LUV), American (AAL). We own all of those.""Smoluch cites PRA Group (PRAA) as a stock that stands to benefit from a regulatory rollback. ""They do credit-card-receivables collections,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if regulation by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is significantly curtailed, which would help this company.""He added, ""PRA Health Sciences (PRAH) would benefit from a biotech spending pickup as that industry gets healthier. This company helps manage clinical trial. As more capital flows into biotech with a healthier outlook, then more money flows to companies like this.""Small-cap funds have done well over those past 10 years as well. Small-cap funds with at least $100 million in assets averaged an annual gain of 6.91% over the decade ended Nov. 16 vs. a 6.79% pace by the S&P 500.If you had invested $10,000 in a cross section of small-cap funds a decade ago, it would have grown into $20,939 by Nov. 16. That would be a bit more than the $20,256 result for the big-cap bogey.RELATED:Small-Cap Rally Offers Investors Alternatives To Big-Cap Multinationals

The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 had slipped below their break-even marks, while the Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.1%.X Among the Dow Jones industrials, Caterpillar (CAT) reversed from early gains to fall nearly 2% after handily beating Q4 earnings and sales targets. Shares were near their highs, about 20% above a 140.54 flat-base entry.Elsewhere in the Dow, Apple (AAPL) was testing support at the 50-day line with a 0.8% decline. The stock has had trouble maintaining its 176.34 flat-base entry and is back under it.Among companies reporting earnings, Lam Research (LRCX) jumped higher before backing off after announcing better-than-expected earnings and sales results late Wednesday. The stock is building a cup-shaped base with a 219.80 potential entry. While the relative strength line is not confirming the breakout by making a new high, it has significantly strengthened over the last week or so.Other chip leaders were on the move higher, including Applied Materials (AMAT) and Nvidia (NVDA), which moved up 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. Applied Materials was eyeing a potential breakout above a 60.99 cup-shaped base entry, while Nvidia continued to trade near its highs —  about 10% above a 218.77 cup-base buy point.Despite the strength in the overall chip sector, Teradyne (TER) fell over 2% after providing Q1 revenue guidance that was mostly below the Street's forecasts.

Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe.

141,LUV,"Taxes: The Republican tax reforms are growing increasingly popular as people start to realize the benefits. For Democrats who unanimously opposed these tax cuts, this can't be good news.X This week, Home Depot  (HD), Starbucks (SBUX) and Walt Disney (DIS) announced that they were handing out bonuses or raises — or both — as a direct result of the GOP's tax cut.Home Depot is giving hundreds of thousands of hourly employees what it calls ""tax reform bonuses"" of up to $1,000. Starbucks is lavishing $250 million in pay raises and stock grants on 150,000 workers, also crediting the tax cuts. At Disney, 125,000 workers are getting a $1,000 bonus, and the company is investing another $50 million in employee education programs.These companies join more than 240 others — many of them household names like Apple  (AAPL), Wal-Mart  (WMT), AT&T  (T), Auto Nation  (AN), Boeing  (BA), Comcast  (CMCSA), Southwest Airlines  (LUV) and Verizon  (VZ) — that have already done so, putting more money in the pockets of at least 3 million workers.This string of tax-cut-related good news is just beginning. In February, millions of workers will suddenly see their paychecks get bigger, as the law's new, lower withholding schedules take effect. And this is to say nothing of the indirect effects of the tax cuts — more investment, faster economic growth, more jobs.Even before all this, the GOP's tax bill was growing increasingly popular, according to the New York Times, which found that support jumped from 37% to 46% in one month, with disapproval dropping from 58% to 49%.Complete Coverage Of The GOP's Tax Cut PlanWhat's more, the share of people who think they will get a tax cut climbed from 33% in December to 41% in January.This must come as a shock to Democrats — not a single one of whom voted for the tax cuts — who thought the public would continue to see the tax cuts the way they did.Nancy Pelosi called the GOP tax plan a ""brazen con job"" and ""tax scam"" that would ""bleed the American people dry.""Chuck Schumer said the bill was unpopular with the public because ""they know what this bill is all about. They know they are getting crumbs, if that, while the wealthy are getting big pieces of cake – that's why it's so unpopular.""It's true that the tax bill was unpopular when President Trump signed it into law — not because people knew what was in it, but because Democrats and their media lapdogs successfully hid the details and deceived the public.That's made abundantly clear in the latest Harvard-Harris poll, which found that just 47% supported the tax bill when they were asked about it at the start of the survey.But then the pollsters described 15 key provisions that are actually in the plan, and found substantial majority support for all but three. Eighty-four percent back the lower income tax brackets, for example, 82% doubling the child tax credit, 77% the cut in the tax rate for ""pass-through"" companies. Even the limits on mortgage and state tax deductions get majority support.The poll then asked a follow up question: ""Given this information about what is in the new tax code, do you favor or oppose it?"" — fully 57% said they supported it.In other words, once people learned about the details of the GOP tax reforms, support jumped 10 percentage points.Even Democrats surveyed by Harvard-Harris found themselves changing their minds — with support going from 18% at the outset to 34% after learning about the details.If this trend continues, Democratic lawmakers will have a lot of explaining to do when they face voters in nine months.RELATED:Great Again: Disabled Rejoin Workforce In Droves As Economy Gains SteamHigh Tariffs And Weak Dollar Are No Way To Make America Great AgainThe Trump Economy, One Year In: A Success By All MeasuresClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

142,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) is waiting to see if Boeing (BA) will release a new midsize jet over the next decade or so before it considers other possibilities to replace its 757 and 767 planes, an executive for the airline said on Tuesday.X The carrier will also consider the most compact version of the 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus (EADSY) A321neo as part of those replacement plans, said the executive, Senior Vice President of Finance Gerry Laderman, according to Reuters. Laderman was speaking at a conference in Dublin.Both the 787 and A321neo seat more than 200 passengers and are more fuel-efficient than older aircraft. The smallest 787 can fly up to around 8,500 miles; the A321neo is a single-aisle jet with a range of up to 4,600 miles.Boeing's project — to potentially release a new midsize aircraft in the mid-2020s — could become ""well defined"" later this year, Laderman said, according to Reuters. He added that it was too early to weigh options for the Bombardier (BDRBF) CSeries and other smaller planes. Airbus has taken a majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries, which faces punitive U.S. tariffs.United Airlines rose 1.4% to 77.97 in the stock market today, working on a cup-with-handle base with a 79.10 buy point. Boeing dipped 0.7%. Airbus fell 1.3%. Bombardier sank 0.4%.Laderman's remarks follow plans from United and American Airlines (AAL), both announced this month, to extend their reach into smaller cities. They also come as United prepares to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market close on Tuesday.The carrier will hold what it described as an ""investor event"" at 4:30 ET after the results are released to, in part, ""provide an update on the company's overall strategic plan and issue 2018 guidance.""That overall strategic plan, and whether United would stay committed to financial targets attached to it for this year, was the source of a major Wall Street breakdown in October after United gave only vague answers as to how it was approaching 2018.Delta Air Lines (DAL) last month decided to buy 100 A321neo jets, with deliveries set to begin in 2020 — a move considered a snub to Boeing. Delta had been in talks to buy around 100 midsize, shorter-range, single-aisle 737 Max 10 jets, whose seating capacity reaches into the low 200s.Southwest Airlines (LUV) this month said it would exercise an option to order 40 short-range Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft — 15 next year and 25 in 2020. It deferred 737 MAX 7 orders.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Delta's Bullish Earnings, Outlook Back Signs Of Strong Airline DemandTax Cuts Leave These Airline Winners, Losers; United Lifts Key Outlook

144,LUV,"Spotting the three-weeks-tight pattern isn't so difficult: It's just three straight weeks with narrow changes in each weekly price close. But on that basis alone, you could be finding a lot of faulty patterns.XFirst, a definition: The 3-weeks-tight is a follow-on pattern — an opportunity to buy a small amount of shares when the stock has already advanced from its base. Basically, it represents a brief consolidation in which institutional investors pause their buying, rather than take profits. That results in a weekly price close of no more than 1% to 1.5% (up or down) from the previous week's close, and a similar narrow finish the next week.The buy point is the highest price within the pattern, plus 10 cents. As with any follow-on formation, try to buy as close as possible to the buy point. Don't buy too many shares, too; you don't want your average cost in the overall position to rise too quickly.IBD'S TAKE: Some chart patterns are almost designed for weekly charts. Use IBD Weekly Charts, which display the weekly price change percentages, to identify the three-weeks-tight.The price bars on the three weeks should present a sideways or slightly downward-tilting look. An upward-wedging three weeks may not have the same solid frame.The pattern can be difficult to spot because it forms in the middle of an advance. So, here are some additional characteristics to identify the right ones:Southwest Airlines (LUV) had one of its best runs in 2013 and 2014, a period that saw a few 3-weeks-tight patterns along the way. The airline began its ascent when it broke out of a double-bottom base in September 2013.After about three months without a break, the stock started trading tightly in the final weeks of December (1). The price differences in those weekly closes were 1.2% and 0.6%, qualifying for a 3-weeks-tight.That boosted Southwest until it formed a flat base in parts of January and February 2014. With shares cruising from that entry, another 3-weeks-tight formed in late April and May. Each week's close in that series was less than 1% and weekly price bars were attractively narrow.In July, there was yet another 3-weeks-tight (2). This time, the middle week in the pattern was noticeably wider than the others. Yet, the stock closed high in the price range in heavy volume — a good result.RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneCan You Make Big Long-Term Returns With Just A Little Money? Yes, Here's HowDaily Chart?

146,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) said it had canceled nearly 400 flights on Monday and nearly 1,000 on Sunday after a fire left Atlanta's massive Hartsfield-Jackson airport — the carrier's hub — without power and thousands of passengers stranded in near-darkness. But airline stocks saw little turbulence Monday.X Power was restored close to midnight, after the airport spent nearly half the day Sunday without it. TSA lines were open early Monday morning, according to the airport's Twitter feed.But as of 10 a.m. ET, the trains at the airport, among the busiest in the U.S., were not operating, Delta said. Customers with paper boarding passes from Sunday would need to reprint them.The outage, caused by an electrical fire at a Georgia Power electrical facility, comes after Delta this spring had to cancel some 4,000 flights due to severe thunderstorms in Atlanta and harsh weather in the Northeast. The exact cause of the fire was still being determined.Shares fell just 3 cents to 56.07 in the stock market today. Southwest Airlines (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL), which also canceled dozens of flights in the blackout's wake, rose 1.6% and 0.8%, respectivelyThe outage also follows Delta's Investor Day last week, which nudged the carrier's stock into a buy zone and left some analysts feeling more optimistic about the airline.The financial impact from the cancellations isn't yet clear. Delta, in conjunction with its Investor Day event, forecast Q4 unit revenue to come in at the high end of its initial forecast. It also said it was targeting 10%-15% earnings-per-share growth next year.United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.3%. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) jumped 3.9%.

148,LUV,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) burst higher Thursday, as the carrier kicked off its Investor Day with a solid 2018 forecast and a fourth-quarter outlook that included more bullish expectations for unit revenue but weaker margins.X Delta on Thursday also officially announced that it would buy 100 A321neos from Airbus (EADSY), a snub to Boeing (BA), with whom relations have cooled.Shares of Delta jumped 3% to 55.25 in the stock market today, once again clearing a cup-with-handle buy point of 54.16. American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) climbed 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively, both closing off session highs.Expectations were high ahead of the Investor Day, and Wall Street's main take-aways could revolve around what the carrier has in store for next year as costs for jet fuel and labor rise and some of the nation's biggest airports undergo renovations.Delta said in a presentation that it was targeting 2018 earnings per share of $5.35-$5.70, higher than Zacks estimates for $5.41. The carrier also said it was ""addressing nonfuel unit costs"" — which became a source of investor angst during third-quarter earnings season — aiming for nonfuel unit costs of flat to up 2% next year.Delta expects unit revenue — which measures an airline's operating efficiency by gauging sales from passengers as they relate to an airline's flight capacity — to be up around 4% in the fourth quarter.That was more aggressive than an outlook given in October for a 2%-4% increase. Delta said the fourth quarter was ""producing strong revenue trends with positive unit revenue in all geographic entities."" JetBlue (JBLU) on Tuesday also raised its Q4 unit revenue outlook. United and Southwest Airlines (LUV) raised their Q4 unit revenue forecasts last week.JetBlue, which briefly hit a buy point on Tuesday before reversing sharply lower, fell 1.4%. Southwest Airlines advanced 1.1%, hitting a new high and becoming further extended from a recent breakout.""Traditionally, the airlines use investor days to discuss significant cost and revenue initiatives,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Monday. ""At this point, Delta has been there, done that. Delta continues to need to prove their margins can improve from current levels.""However, the company said that fourth-quarter operating margins were on track to come in at around 11%, compared to an earlier  forecast for 11%-13%, with higher fuel prices dragging the figure lower.Delta expects Q4 flight capacity to be up 2.5%-3% vs. earlier expectations for a roughly 2% increase. That reflects Delta's coverage of Virgin Atlantic flights in the trans-Atlantic market.And the carrier expects Q4 nonfuel unit costs to increase 5%-5.5%. Those higher costs were pushed higher by ""continued investment in our people and product combined with accelerated depreciation of aircraft retirements.""Delta last week said it had agreed to enter into a joint venture with Canadian low-cost carrier WestJet, a move that strengthens Delta's international service.RELATED:United, American, Delta Rule Air Travel, But Higher Costs LoomAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

150,LUV,"JetBlue (JBLU) on Tuesday raised its fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook, and the carrier said the financial fallout from this summer's string of hurricanes wouldn't be as bad for the quarter as once expected.X The stronger outlook follows similar forecasts last week from United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV), as travel demand remains solid and gives airlines more leeway to charge more. Delta Air Lines' (DAL) stock also got a lift last week after the airline reported November traffic figures.JetBlue said it expected fourth-quarter unit revenue, which tallies sales in relation to overall capacity of available seats and flight coverage, to come within a range of down 0.5% to up 1.5%. The carrier initially expected Q4 unit revenue to be anywhere from flat to down 3%.The company said it expected the impact from the hurricanes — in particular Irma and Maria — to take 0.5% off fourth-quarter unit revenue. But that's better than prior expectations for one to two percentage points.Shares of JetBlue closed down 2.7% at 21.59 in the stock market today, reversing an earlier gain of 1.7%, but still near a 22.46 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Delta fell 1.4% to 53.62, back below a 54.16 buy point of a cup-with-handle base, and American Airlines (AAL) dropped 1.6% to 50.47, further below a 53.84 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Southwest rose 0.2%, extended above buy range.United lost 1.4% but is above its 50-day line as it tries to recover from the 12% drop suffered after management was unable to answer analysts' questions about 2018 financial forecasts, casting doubt on its ability to hit longer-term financial targets.IBD'S TAKE: This summer, Wall Street fretted about the effect airfare discounting would have on airlines' profits. This fall, Wall Street hit them over rising costs. For more, read this story. For November, JetBlue's passenger traffic increased 2.8%, while its flight capacity increased by 4.3%.JetBlue on Thursday said it would add service to Worcester, Mass., by offering daily flights between that city and JFK International Airport starting in May.

151,LUV,"These 2 Stocks Reclaimed Buy Points; 3 Others Are CloseAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry News
"
152,LUV,"A price war that threatens to upend the airline industry likely began this spring, after thousands of Spirit Airlines (SAVE) passengers in May learned their flights were canceled. The low-cost airline blamed pilots, who were entangled in a pay dispute, for engaging in a ""pervasive illegal work slowdown"" — an account the pilots disputed.X Customers were furious, and a fight broke out at a Spirit counter in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. People were arrested. After passengers booked elsewhere, Spirit cut fares to try to lure them back. As it scrambled to contain the damage, United Airlines (UAL) swooped in, matching some of Spirit's prices in several of the legacy carrier's biggest, most prized airport hubs.United, American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) in years past might not have always seen no-frills, bargain-hunting customers as their own. But flush with cash, they now look to tighten their grip on the skies above the U.S. and drive out ultra-low-cost challengers, potentially limiting competition further in an industry that has already seen dramatic consolidation.The shift has prompted analysts to question if passengers have any reason left to fly airlines like Spirit if the legacy network airlines are copying their strategy — either with bare-bones, high-restriction ""basic economy"" seats or fares that cost as little as dinner and a drink or two.""I don't know that the basic fact has changed: that low costs tend to win in the airline industry,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. ""But this is maybe the most interesting moment in history to test that, now that the big three airlines are so successful and now that they have such good balance sheets.""IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review them.
"
153,LUV,"Following 40 bankruptcy-riddled years, the airline industry has consolidated into four airlines that control about 80% of the U.S. market: United, American, Delta and Southwest (LUV). Such market sway has helped improve earnings, and the big airlines have vowed not to let ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) beat them on price.The carriers' path to greater market dominance will be tested in the year ahead. Costs are rising for everything from employee pay to fuel prices to the landing fees that will fund airports' efforts to add parking and transportation and renovate terminals to look more sleek or at least less depressing.The higher expenses to run an airline will threaten profits and the willingness to match bargain fares of the ultra-low-cost carriers, who face some of the same cost pressures.""If your costs are going up, it's not sustainable that you keep lowering your fares,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said of United's discounting onslaught, adding: ""I don't know that I would say (United) would back off first. I would just say that you will see fares trend higher in general.""In years past, the U.S. legacy carriers and the discounters viewed the passengers they pursued as existing in more clearly separated markets, Kaplan says. An airline like Spirit saw itself attracting a more price-sensitive bunch who might otherwise spend their money on, say, going to the movies rather than another airline, he says.Ultra-low-cost carriers generally operate with lower structural costs than their larger rivals do, meaning they can offer super-low fares more easily. Spirit tends to skimp more on seat space, allowing the carrier to cram in more seats and spread costs across more passengers. ULCCs also tend to fly point to point, without guaranteed connections, cutting down on the time — and money — spent on the ground waiting for connecting passengers.As the big three carriers rolled out basic economy, their vast networks offered an advantage on connections, even if the fare class didn't guarantee that, say, a family of four can sit together.With Spirit, you can still sit together. But when United tried to match ULCCs on fares last summer, Spirit had to back off from plans to raise fares to stay competitive with the giants. Spirit stock tanked 18% in a single day in July.""Clearly, the ULCC model is being questioned by the Street,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote in a research note following that dive.Shares of the network carriers weren't faring much better. When a bigger, higher-expense rival like United tries to emulate Spirit, United either loses more money than Spirit or makes less money.In particular, plans by low-cost Frontier Airlines to push into Denver were seen by United as a shift away from its point-to-point model and toward a more costly and complex hub-and-spoke model. In hub and spoke, passengers are routed to big airports and then put on connecting flights.""I've believed for many years that the ultra-low-cost-carrier business model can't work when a network carrier decides to compete on price,"" United President Scott Kirby said in July. ""This is the first public validation that one of the ULCCs has thrown in the towel on the point-to-point business model.""Frontier denied it was changing the way it flies. But ULCCs face tough questions about their future.Asked at a conference in September whether ULCCs were doomed when a major carrier cuts prices, Spirit CFO Ted Christie replied ""absolutely not."" He said ""rumors of the death of the ULCC model are clearly overstated"" and that people like low fares.New concerns over industry costs have since recast the debate. In October, United management unnerved investors by making cagey responses to questions about the airline's 2018 outlook.The carrier said that health care costs, pensions and airport fees were rising. But it offered no specifics, saying only that it was ""in the middle"" of mapping out 2018 costs and taking a ""very different approach"" to them.The remarks signaled that expectations set last year may be softening. Those targets included keeping nonfuel unit cost growth under 1%, producing $4.8 billion in ""earnings improvement"" by 2020, and lopping roughly $1 billion off the carrier's capital expenditures this year.Worries grew about United's ability to catch up with Delta on margins. Investors laid into United's stock, sinking it 12% in one day.""Making it worse was poor commentary on the (third-quarter earnings) call where UAL wouldn't address, even qualitatively, 2018 (unit costs),"" Wolfe Research's Keay said in a research note. ""In fact, we felt warned on it.""A week later, Alaska Air Group (ALK) shares tanked as Wall Street worried over its ability to manage costs as it brings Virgin America under its wing.  Concerns included its efforts to resolve a pilot shortage with higher pay amid rising competition.Then American got hit. Shares tumbled after it forecast greater capacity growth and higher-than-expected costs in 2018, with pay raises, benefit hikes and increased maintenance costs weighing.Southwest forecast higher-than-expected costs in the fourth quarter due to ad spending, tech expenses and costs related to getting the OK to fly to Hawaii.The prevalence of cost fears distracted Wall Street from the only industry statistic it generally cares about: unit revenue, which tries to gauge an airline's efficiency by measuring sales in relation to an airline's available supply of seats and flights. That metric, actually, has been OK.The market had a ""sobering recollection that airlines also have cost structures,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker observed wryly in a research note. He pointed out that management isn't typically ready to talk about unit costs and capacity for the year ahead in October. But he said ""we still wish that most had been better prepared.""Now it was Spirit's turn to gloat.""Consolidation didn't really improve the cost structure"" of legacy airlines, Spirit CEO Bob Fornaro said in October. ""It improved the networks, but the costs are going higher.""Spirit hasn't been spared these cost concerns. Costs are certain to rise if management can strike a deal with its employees. The big three airlines all agreed to pay hikes for employees last year.But some ULCCs have support in high places, and are getting new planes that will enable them to compete even harder.Investor Bill Franke, whose Indigo Partners owns Frontier and other ULCCs, agreed on Nov. 15 to buy 430 new Airbus (EADSY) jets for his carriers, including Frontier, in a deal valued at $49.5 billion at list prices.Frontier will get 100 A320neo jets and 34 A321neos. The narrow-body planes are increasingly popular with airlines, as their range and fuel efficiency have opened more direct routes that previously weren't economical.At a press conference after the pact was announced, Franke, who helped transform Spirit into a ULCC, argued that adding loyalty programs, amenities and other things that raise an airline's costs opens up ""a path to hell,"" according to Bloomberg.""We're firm believers in the ultra-low-cost model,"" Franke told reporters at the Dubai Airshow, where the order — Airbus' largest ever — was announced. ""At the end of the day, in a competitive environment, the lower the cost, the lower the fares, is a winning strategy.""But the big airlines also appear to be firm believers in offering passengers a low-fare option, and American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sees an endgame on the horizon. He said in October that the industry was in the ""final stages of a maturation process,"" in which ULCCs, seeking new markets, run into trouble moving into the nation's big airport hubs.RELATED:New Flights Signal Spirit Airlines Is Still Taking Fight To United, RivalsAmerican Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry News

156,LUV,"Discount carrier Frontier Airlines is set to get a whole bunch of new jets that could give it more options as it skirmishes with United Airlines (UAL) over cheap fares.XBoeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) on Wednesday announced a deal to sell 430 jets to Frontier Airlines and three other partner airlines of Bill Franke's Indigo Partners, a big investor in discount airlines, in a deal valued at as much as $49.5 billion.The memorandum-of-understanding agreement, which Airbus said was its ""largest single announcement ever,"" was announced at the Dubai Airshow. It would hand Frontier 100 A320neo jets — a narrow-body jet that usually seats around 150 people — and 34 A321neos, which typically seat around 185 people.The remaining A320s and A321s would go to other ultra discounters when the agreements with each are finalized: Wizz Air in Hungary, JetSmart in Chile, and Volaris in Mexico.""This significant commitment for 430 additional aircraft underscores our optimistic view of the growth potential of our family of low-cost airlines, as well as our confidence in the A320neo Family as a platform for that growth,"" Franke, managing partner of Indigo, said in a statement on Wednesday.United Airlines closed up 0.5% on the stock market today, Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 0.9%, while American Airlines (AAL) climbed 3%, and Southwest (LUV) added 1.6%. Ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) rallied 2.7%, and Alaska Air (ALK) jumped 4.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The deal comes as new types of jets give budget carriers more ways to make their business models work.Frontier, a carrier known for the ""National-Geographic""-esque portraits of animals on its tail fins, this year has made more of a push into Denver, a big, profitable United hub. United, which has tried to match Frontier and Spirit on some fares in its biggest markets, this summer said Frontier's move amounted to a tacit admission that cracks were forming in the ultra-low-cost model.United President Scott Kirby, during the carrier's second-quarter earnings call, said that in moving into a hub, Frontier was taking on the much more complicated duties of handling connecting flights. He added the battle was one that ""I guarantee United will win.""But Airbus' fuel-efficient A321 jets have made low-cost long-haul flights more viable. Such flights have become particularly common between Europe and the U.S. The cheaper airfares offered by the likes of Norwegian Air and WOW air have chipped away at the stronghold Delta, American and United had built up over the Atlantic.JetBlue (JBLU), which has been considering whether offer flights to Europe, has added A321neos to its fleet and has an option to take delivery of the Airbus A321LR — an alternate version of the A321neo.On its website, Airbus says the A321LR is ""ideally suited to transatlantic routes, and enables airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft.""RELATED:Boeing Reportedly Mulls 767 Passenger-Jet Reboot As '797' LoomsWill Delta Air Lines' Spat With Boeing Weigh On Massive Plane Order?American Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers Fall

158,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Tuesday said it will add seasonal service between Dallas and Iceland, while ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) announced new service from Richmond, Va., to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.XThe announcements come as American and legacy rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) look for ways to compete against budget long-haul carriers in Europe, and as Spirit positions itself for Spring Break.American said that it would begin offering its seasonal service from its Dallas-Fort Worth hub to Iceland's Reykjavik-Keflavik airport on June 7. Tickets go on sale on Nov. 20. The move would pit American against WOW air, a low-cost, long-haul carrier in Iceland that also offers flights between those two airports.Reykjavik, American noted, has become ""a very popular leisure destination"" and complements its ""continued growth from Dallas-Fort Worth, including Rome and Amsterdam.""WOW Air in August said it would add flights from four Midwestern U.S. cities to Reykjavik starting this coming spring for as low as $99.99 one way.During its third-quarter earnings call last month, American said that unit revenue in the trans-Atlantic market, where competition from European discounters is intense, rose during the third quarter. Better pricing and ""easing comps from past terror events"" in 2016 helped with the improvement.Still, management said that they expected to see more of the same in the region for the fourth quarter, with discounting from expanding low-cost carriers still ""aggressive.""

161,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Thursday said it would be ""disappointed"" if unit revenue next year was outpaced by an oft-used measurement for costs, but shares of the airline sank after it signaled that its 2018 flight capacity would escalate from the growth expected this year.XInvestors also digested a forecast for higher costs from Southwest Airlines (LUV), a day after Alaska Airlines (ALK) predicted rising expenses. But they gave Spirit Airlines (SAVE) a boost after the discount carrier signaled it had stopped some of the bleeding after rivals tried to match it on airfares.The forecasts come as analysts increasingly pick over executives' remarks for clues as to how the industry will navigate 2018. When United Airlines (UAL) management last week provided next to no clarity on how it would meet long-term financial goals and keep costs in line next year as it expands service, Wall Street deep-sixed the stock, sinking it 12%.While other analysts have argued that United's problems are uniquely its own, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note last week that ""we believe more clarity regarding 2018 industry growth will be a primary catalyst for airline stocks"" for the rest of 2017.American management on Thursday said that it was still developing its 2018 operating plans, with a formal flight capacity to come when it reports fourth-quarter results. But on a schedule-over-schedule basis, it said it expects capacity — or available seats on flights and how far and often they get flown — to be up roughly 2.5% next year, another focal point for some analysts.That would be higher than the roughly 1% expected for this year, raising the prospect that other airlines might add flights to match American and cut fares to compete.The carrier also said it expected adjusted unit costs to rise around 2% next year, with higher salaries and benefits — as well as costs related to maintenance, rents and landing fees — likely contributing the increase.Few other specifics were given about how American will navigate 2018. But management repeated during the call some iteration of ""we know who we are"" or ""we're running our own show.""""We're not going to define ourselves against what others are doing,"" CEO Doug Parker said.Shares plunged 4.7% to closed at 48.63 on the stock market today, reversing an earlier gain to 53.19. The stock is working its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 53.84 buy point. Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 2.5%, and United Airlines rose 0.1%.Still, Parker touted American Air's ""measured rollout"" of Basic Economy after United's more aggressive expansion of the fare class made it temporarily uncompetitive. American said demand for Premium Economy seats remains high, and about half of its customers are buying main cabin seats when given the option between that and Basic Economy.American's earnings followed a travel advisory the NAACP issued this week warning African American passengers against traveling with the carrier. In its announcement, the NAACP cited several incidents that it said ""suggest a corporate culture of racial insensitivity and possible racial bias on the part of American Airlines.""Parker said the carrier was eager to learn from any missteps, and that it expected to work with the NAACP on the issue in the ""very near term."" Asked if the advisory had an impact on bookings, Parker said: ""We haven't seen anything, but that is not the point.""The carrier sees Q4 unit revenue increasing 2.5% to 4.5%, and said the demand environment ""remains robust."" Unit revenue measures sales an airline gets in relation to how many available seats it has and how far and often it flies them.Earnings per share of $1.42 topped Zacks estimates for $1.39. Revenue of $10.878 billion missed views for $10.884 billion.Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused more than 8,000 cancellations and reduced pretax earnings by $75 million.""We are playing the long game at American to create value in an industry that has been fundamentally transformed,"" said Chairman and CEO Doug Parker in a statement.Shares of Spirit jumped 6.9% to close at 36.08 on Thursday after the low-fare, high-fee carrier forecast a unit revenue decline of 4%-6%, better than the 6.3% drop in the third quarter due to ""aggressive competitive pricing action in many of our markets.""But for the fourth quarter, the carrier cited ""continued improvement"" in revenue management. It said there was still a leftover impact from Hurricane Harvey, but not one from Irma, and that it had temporarily cut service in its Caribbean locations.Spirit canceled over 1,650 flights related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, costing $40 million in revenue, along with revenue overhang from the flight cancellations related to what it alleged was a ""pilot work action"" earlier this year.This summer, a price-cutting battle between Spirit and United raised Wall Street questions over whether the ultra-low-cost carrier model was broken and whether United could balance cheaper fares with the costs of operations.""Contrary to some rhetoric of late, the Spirit model continues to produce excellent returns,"" CCO Matt Klein said on Spirit's earnings call on Thursday.American CEO Parker may have added to that rhetoric indirectly on Thursday, saying that the industry, after bankruptcies and consolidation, was in the ""final stages of a maturation process."" And he said that ultra-low-cost carriers, in search of new markets, have run into trouble as they move into the nation's big airport hubs. The remarks echoed those of United President Scott Kirby in July.Third-quarter EPS of 94 cents beat estimates for 90 cents; revenue of $687.2 million squeaked past estimates for $687 million.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Southwest said fourth-quarter adjusted unit costs would be ""higher than previously expected"" in large part because of a ""shift in advertising spend"" in the quarter, costs related to the carrier's planned expansion to Hawaii, and technology investments.The cost forecast was ""probably higher than investors were expecting,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.EPS of 88 cents topped forecasts by a penny, while revenue of $5.27 billion came in just shy of expectations for $5.297 billion. Unit revenue fell 0.5%, due to the introduction of a new reservation system. Disruption from natural disasters cost $100 million and forced 5,000 flight cancellations.The carrier sees Q4 unit revenue being ""up slightly"" to up 1.5%.Shares sank 3.6% to 55.11 after earlier advancing to 58.72.

163,LUV,"Analysts spent much of United Airlines' (UAL) third-quarter earnings call Thursday morning asking about the carrier's plans to shore up profit, costs, capacity and margins in 2018 and beyond. And much of the time United executives on those fronts were unable to provide specifics.That sent United Air's stock crashing, amid doubts about the carrier's ability to deliver on goals outlined at its investor day last year and management's ability to turn the company around as its margins lag those of Delta Air Lines (DAL).""Is This a Catalyst for Management Change?"" read a research note from Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi after the call. ""That's the #1 question we've received today, which is both surprising and not surprising.""United late Wednesday forecast weaker fourth-quarter unit revenue — a much-watched measure of sales in relation to an airline's flight capacity — rising unit costs and expanding capacity.XCEO Oscar Munoz on Wednesday said several times during the call that United was ""in the middle"" of assembling a clearer forecast. He urged patience, and stressed that relative to rivals, United's management was still new.""We're just getting our mojo working,"" he said.Mojo aside, investors mashed the ""sell"" button on Thursday. United shares collapsed 12.1% to 59.78 in the stock market today, tumbling through their 50-day moving average. Delta lost 1.1% and  American Airlines (AAL) 1%. Southwest Airlines (LUV) dipped 0.3%. Delta, American and Southwest have all been building the right side of cup bases.At its investor day last year, United said it planned to reduce capital expenditures by roughly $1 billion in 2017 and 2018. The airline also laid out long-term plans to produce $4.8 billion in ""earnings improvement"" by 2020, via a combination of stronger revenue management, better flight connectivity, and expanding ""segmentation,"" or different types of fare classes that offer different degrees of amenities.United faces higher costs related to employee benefits next year, among other things, and has been actively trying to chase Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and other low-cost carriers, which are offering fares are low as $10, out of its major hubs.Analysts over the summer worried whether United, which has tried to match Spirit on fares, could absorb the impact of the discounting and whether other airlines might get sucked into the fare war. But in recent weeks they grew more optimistic that fare discounting, which chips away at sales and profits, had eased.""United's unit revenue outlook confirms that prices are firming,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said, ""but United's forecast is not as optimistic as Delta's and may also not be as optimistic as American's when they provide it next week.""Delta reported solid Q3 earnings and guidance last week.Over the past six to eight weeks, United management said that not much has changed in the way United or the ultra-discounters were approaching the way they do battle.Late Wednesday, United forecast a fourth-quarter unit-revenue decline of 1%-3%. United said it sees flat unit revenue for October and November, with December declining due to what President Scott Kirby said were the ""vagaries of the calendar,"" with much of the holiday return traffic pushed into January.United sees Q4 adjusted pretax margin coming in at 3%-5%, below consensus. The carrier forecast unit costs to increase 2.5%-3.5% in the fourth quarter, also a letdown for analysts. United also sees roughly 3.5% fourth-quarter capacity growth.""Further, with fourth-quarter capacity expansion remaining elevated (as the schedule data has indicated), we expect investors will be skeptical that management's plan to improve relative profitability is gaining momentum,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note released before the call.Spirit Airlines retreated 3.3%.RELATED:United Airlines, AmEx, United Rentals Beat Views; Alcoa MissesDelta Air Lines Sees Turnaround In Crucial, Highly Competitive MarketAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

164,LUV,"Spirit Airlines (SAVE) on Thursday said it would begin expanding service in New Orleans, adding flights between that city and a handful of airports along the East Coast and the central U.S. — including major airports for United Airlines (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU).XThe ultra-low-cost carrier's advance follows concerns earlier this year about whether Spirit could withstand a more concerted effort by United to match the carrier on some airfares in the legacy carrier's major airports. However, fears of a downward spiral eased last month after Spirit signaled firmer ticket pricing, and some analysts say the carrier stands to benefit from more travel among millennials.Spirit on Thursday said it would add new nonstop flights between Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and Boston — a big market for JetBlue — as well as Newark/New York — a United hub — and Tampa and Minneapolis/St. Paul. Those flights start this week.Spirit on Thursday was also set to begin making daily, nonstop flights from Hartford and Pittsburgh to Tampa and Fort Myers. The discounter, which announced those flights on Tuesday, also said at that time it would offer new service to Palm Beach from Chicago.On Wednesday, Spirit announced that it would expand its flight network to Columbus, Ohio — offering service between John Glenn Columbus International Airport and a variety of destinations, including New Orleans, Las Vegas and several cities in Florida.The flights from Columbus, where Ohio State University is located, start in February and March. Their timing is intended to line up with the Spring Break travel season.""Given the millennial generation is spending more of its disposable income on leisure travel, Spirit is in a solid position to capitalize on this generational shift,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last month.""In addition,"" she added, ""as a growing number of price sensitive young millennials enter the workforce, Spirit could be an attractive option given larger carriers will have difficulty matching low fares.""Spirit rose 0.5% to 34.95 in the stock market today. United fell 0.9% and JetBlue rose 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Analysts in general cheered Spirit's third-quarter results and outlook last month.""SAVE didn't spend a lot of time complaining about other airlines, a nice change of pace, and for the most part kept the focus on itself,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note late last month. ""That implies they have control over their own fate.""He added that the carrier had signaled optimism on close-in airfare prices, holiday demand, and cost management. Costs have become more of a concern for many airlines heading into next year.Southwest Airlines (LUV) this week also began offering new flights from Florida to Turks and Caicos Islands, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. The carrier last month said it planned to begin selling tickets to flights to Hawaii next year, a move that could raise some of its costs but pose a threat to Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA).Southwest Airlines shares dipped 1%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) sank 1.7% and American Airlines (AAL) 1.3%.RELATED:American Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers FallWill Delta Air Lines' Spat With Boeing Weigh On Massive Plane Order?Delta Air Lines Sees Turnaround In Crucial, Highly Competitive Market

165,LUV,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) led carriers higher after both forecast third-quarter unit revenue and margins that were better than prior expectations.The forecasts mark a rebound for American, United and Delta Air Lines (DAL), which during the third quarter saw their stocks fall following steep fare competition, higher fuel prices and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Delta Air reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.But investor sentiment began to improve last week, when Delta's Q3 outlook for the key metric held up, in analysts' views, when factoring out the impact of Irma. The guidance lifted the carrier and its rivals and signified to some analysts that Delta was better able to shore up prices.American on Tuesday indicated that it had been better able to keep airfares high as well — a practice that dismays travelers but boosts airlines' top and bottom lines.American said third-quarter unit revenue was up roughly 0.5%-1.5%, better than an earlier outlook for flat to up 1%. In raising its outlook, the carrier cited ""stronger than anticipated yield performance,"" referring to an airline's ability to charge customers more money.The carrier said it expected adjusted pretax margin of 9%-11%, better than its previous outlook for 8.5%-10.5%.Shares popped 4.8% to 53.03. The stock is forming a base with a 54.58 buy point.United, meanwhile, said it expected third-quarter passenger unit revenue, which measures sales from passengers in relation to an airline's flight capacity, to be down 3.5% to 4%.

The airline, which recently became the first in North America to fly the 737 Max 8, linked its decision to this new and upgraded Boeing model.""For us, it's the perfect fit for Hawaii,"" Chief Revenue Officer Andrew Watterson told Bloomberg. ""The Max has got 14% better range and 14% better fuel burn"" than the model it succeeded.The discount carrier plans to kick off services to Hawaii within the next two years, initially from California.Flights to Hawaii can be logistically challenging, but the 737 Max 8's flying range of about 3,500 nautical miles is enough to comfortably cover most flights from the West Coast to Hawaii.For Southwest, an advanced new reservation system is also making the flights there possible. It expects to lower fares to Hawaii, one of the most popular destinations for travel within the United States. Regulatory approvals are pending.Southwest shares closed up 0.4% at 58.81 on the stock market today, eyeing a 59.67 entry off a first-stage, cup-with-handle base.

167,LUV,"Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) on Monday boosted its traffic outlook in the coming years and said it expects its low fares to force rivals out of some markets.The bullish expectations come as low-cost carriers in Europe and the U.S. force their larger non-budget rivals to cut fares to compete. Ryanair said it has already seen rivals shrink their footprint across Europe and that they were likely to pull back further.During the first half of the year, ""we've observed a growing trend of competitors closing bases and routes where they are unable to compete with Ryanair's lower fares, and we expect this trend to continue, especially in markets such as Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium, where significant restructuring of loss making operators (even at lower oil prices) continues,"" the carrier said.The low-fare battle prompted Air France-KLM last week to launch a low-cost airline that may eventually offer flights to the U.S., potentially ratcheting up pressure on Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines and United Airlines (UAL), which together control about a third of U.S.-Europe flights. But Delta has said it won't create a budget airline.Nearer term, however, Ryanair said low fares and the U.K.'s Brexit vote have made them cautious about fiscal 2017.Still, it was raising its long-term traffic forecast by more than 10% to 200 million passengers annually by March 2024.""Despite the uncertainty of Brexit, Ryanair believes that we can deliver profitable growth across Europe by controlling costs, lowering airfares, and maximizing load factors in a manner that will most benefit our customers, our people and our shareholders,"" the company said in a statement.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair jumped 5.2% to close at 79.20 in the stock market today, popping above its 200-day line for the first time since September. Delta climbed 3.1%, American jumped 4.4% and United added 2.3%.IBD'S TAKE: With low-cost carriers outside the U.S. starting to offer their own trans-Atlantic flights, carriers like Delta are looking at a variety of ways to compete. Still, Ryanair said the fallout from the U.K.'s decision this summer to leave the European Union would likely ""continue to overhang our business"" during fiscal-year 2018. And it said ""weaker airfares and Brexit uncertainty will be the dominant features"" of the second half of its fiscal 2017, which ends in March.The vote, which caused the British pound to tank and made foreign exchange difficult, has prompted the carrier to slash 2017 flight-capacity growth in the U.K. to around 5% from 12%.The carrier, a vocal opponent of Brexit, said it would, in turn, shift that capacity growth toward Italy, where the government has cut taxes, and Germany and Belgium, where it said rivals were cutting back.While Ryanair has become known for its bare-bones approach to service and its CEO's brash approach to language, the carrier has tried to improve bookings, benefits, business-travel offerings and even leg room.Meanwhile, U.S. discount carrier Southwest (LUV) on Monday said that it continued to expect fourth-quarter unit revenue to fall 4% to 5% based on its October results. October traffic rose 5.2% on a capacity increase of 5.4%.Southwest shares finished 3% higher.RELATED:Southwest Is Only Airline That Sees Worse Unit Revenue; Stock DivesJetBlue Eyes Flights To Europe As Premium Service Expands

However, Delta said it faced an imbalance of supply and demand in the Transatlantic region, while the timing of certain holidays also weighed on results.Delta had indicated on its third-quarter earnings call that unit revenue was likely to be weak in October.Delta's traffic fell 0.3% for the month, while its carrying capacity rose 1.7%.

171,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped views, but the carrier's fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook disappointed, causing shares to sink.The carrier said it expects Q4 revenue per available seat mile to fall 4%-5%, based on ""the shift in holiday timing, and bookings thus far."" The news makes Southwest an outlier in an industry that has forecast improvement in the much-watched metric.""While current trends suggest a stabilization of close-in fares, the overall revenue yield environment remains soft,"" Southwest said.Southwest's forecast makes it the only airline to indicate that it is not seeing quarter-to-quarter improvement in unit revenue, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. Many airlines this earnings season got a boost in Q3 due to stronger September results, following a summer in which the Zika virus and terrorism deterred some passengers from flying.Airlines have tried to prop up unit falling revenue over the past year in part by aligning their expansion plans with demand, and their outlooks for when unit revenue might turn positive have been a main focus for Wall Street. Rising fuel costs could also help the industry temper their capacity growth and raise ticket prices.The airline plans to slow its capacity growth to below 4% in 2017, down from 2016's projected growth of 4%-6%. Capacity rose 4.2% in Q3.Southwest sank 8.5% to close at 38.40 on the stock market today but pared steeper, early losses. American Airlines (AAL) finished the session down 0.9% to 39.32, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) reversed higher to edge up 0.5% to 41.40 and United Airlines (UAL) lost 1.2% to 53.98.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.Earlier this month, United said  expects to continue shoring up unit revenue during Q4. Delta has delayed its timeline for growing unit revenue but sees it turning positive by early next year. American sees Q4 unit revenue declining 1%-3%, with the midpoint slightly improved vs. the 2.2% drop in Q3.So why is Southwest going the opposite direction?""Southwest has historically been slow to reduce capacity after they load it in the system, so the issues in (the fourth quarter 2016) were likely not fixable from when concerns arose on the (second quarter 2016) earnings call,"" Becker said in the research note. ""The comps will be the most challenging for Southwest in (the first half of 2017), but the company is slowing capacity growth which should help to mitigate some of the issues.""Southwest sees adjusted Q4 unit costs rising 4%-5%, pushed up by the expected costs of proposed and amended union contracts, as well as ""the additional depreciation expense associated with accelerated retirement of the Company's Classic fleet (Boeing (BA) 737-300/-500 aircraft) to third quarter 2017.""Q3 earnings per share fell 1% to 93 cents, beating estimates for 88 cents, while revenue dropped 3% to $5.14 billion, missing views for $5.165 billion. Unit revenue fell 4.1%. Some of that likely came from a July outage in its technological infrastructure that caused some 2,000 flight cancellations.RELATED:JetBlue Warns On Q4, Spirit Sees Improving Unit RevenueDelta Delays Unit-Revenue Target But Vows Tight Capacity ControlAmerican Airlines Sees Thinner Margins, Alaska Air Trims Capacity

The S&P 500 was flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%.Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher on both major exchanges compared to the previous session.An unusually high number of blue chip stocks suffered gap downs at the open. A gap down occurs when a stock opens and stays below the lowest price in the previous day's range. In the S&P 100, which is comprised of the biggest blue chips in the S&P 500, a dozen stocks gapped down. This is unusual for conservative stocks.S&P 100 gap downs included Simon Property Group (SPG), Apple (AAPL), and home-improvement chain Lowe's (LOW).Some of the early gap downs reversed to fill in all or part of the gap as the session continued.IBD'S TAKE: The gap downs ought to make individual investors think twice before buying a stock, but Northrop Grumman gapped up into a buy zone Wednesday.In some cases, the negative reactions seemed a bit excessive. Dow transports member Southwest Airlines (LUV) gapped down 11% in torrid volume despite earnings that topped the consensus estimate by about 6%. Revenue fell shy of expectations by 0.6%, and guidance was weak.

173,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) both reported third-quarter results that beat forecasts early Thursday, although American forecast thinner margins for the fourth quarter.American said its adjusted pretax margin in the fourth quarter would be around 4% to 6%, weaker than in prior quarters this year.The carrier also said it expected adjusted mainline unit costs to rise 8%-10% during the fourth quarter and 5%-7% for the entire year, in line with guidance given by the company this month. Those higher costs for the year reflect profit-sharing and the company's recent labor deals with a variety of employees.American said it expected full-year capacity to grow around 1.5%, in line with a forecast given earlier this month.For the third quarter, unit revenue fell 2.2%, while capacity grew 1.2%.The drop in unit revenue ""was due to competitive capacity growth, continued macroeconomic softness outside of the United States, and foreign currency weakness,"" American said.Unit revenue measures revenue as it relates to available seats and distance traveled, while capacity, broadly, measures available seats, flights and distance traveled.Wall Street has called for airlines to improve unit revenue by raising airfares and reining in flight capacity to align with passenger demand. Investors have focused on airlines' forecasts as to when unit revenue might turn positive and when capacity growth will become more restrained after cheap oil made airlines' expansion easier through last year.American's earnings per share fell 36% to $1.76, better than expectations for $1.69, on revenue down 1% $10.59 billion, above views for $10.54 billion.Still, investors showed concern over forecasts, and shares shaved off 4 cents to close at 40.59 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group said it expected fourth-quarter capacity growth of around 3%, far more restrained than in prior quarters. The company sees adjusted unit costs up roughly 0.5% during the fourth quarter.Unit revenue fell 4.4% during the third quarter. Earnings rose 2% to $2.20 a share, whereas analysts had expected a 3% drop to $2.09. Overall revenue climbed 3% to $1.566 billion, just topping views $1.561 billion.The company said it was ""fully focused"" on completing its merger with Virgin America (VA).

"
174,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday pushed back its target yet again for returning to positive unit-revenue growth, but its promise of greater capacity discipline appeared to please shareholders.The company during its third-quarter earnings call said higher fuel prices, more conservative capacity growth and improved ticket purchases made closer to departure time gave it greater hope that it could reverse the nearly two-year trend of falling unit revenue by early next year.Delta had previously said it would reach that goal by this summer, then pushed it back to the end of this year, and then hinted at some wiggle room on that.But management said it would keep next year's capacity growth -- broadly, an airline's supply of available seats -- ""in line with the December quarter's 1% growth level."" That's down from Q3 growth of 1.5%, Q2's 3.2% gain and Q1's 2.7% increase.The carrier also said it expected fourth-quarter unit revenue to fall 3% to 5%, an improvement from Q3's 6.8% drop.Delta shares were up 1.9% to 40.01 in the stock market today, finding support at their 50-day line after falling earlier. American Airlines (AAL) surged 5%, United Airlines (UAL) rallied 1.5%, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) gained 3.4%, with all three also reversing prior losses.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.However, Delta's unit revenue for October, the first month of Q4, is likely to be weak, and November will likely do the heavy lifting during the period, management indicated on the call.Quirks in the calendar this year will also factor in.""We expect a negative impact due to the shift in Jewish holidays from September to October and Halloween falling on a Monday,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a recent research note. ""Business traffic the week of Oct. 31 shifts into November. We are also hearing that December might be challenged by Christmas falling on Sunday, resulting in return traffic being in January.""Unit revenue, an important metric that tallies revenue in relation to capacity, has fallen as airlines added flights and cut fares to compete with each other after oil prices fell. The stronger dollar and a basic imbalance of supply and demand haven't helped.As for the third quarter, earnings per share fell 2% to $1.70. That marked the first EPS decline in two years, but it wasn't as bad as anticipated; analysts expected EPS of $1.65. Overall revenue fell 6% to $10.48 billion.Q3 also suffered from an outage in August that resulted in 2,300 flight cancellations, and management during the call again apologized for the disruption.Delta's results come after a solid September for many airlines, and they appeared to raise prospects for its rivals. United reports quarterly results Oct. 18, American reports Oct. 20, and Southwest reports Oct. 28.RELATED:Alaska Air Sees Stronger Q3 Unit Revenue, JetBlue Holds OutlookCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines?

"
175,LUV,"After years of bargain fares and low fuel prices, U.S. airlines are likely to follow the lead of the second-largest carrier and curb growth next year in a tried-and-true effort to boost ticket prices.Delta Air Lines (DAL) will extend its modest capacity growth of 1% in the fourth quarter to all of 2017, with Chief Executive Ed Bastian citing ""the weakest revenue environment in recent memory.""Given that the U.S. economy continues to expand, albeit sluggishly, the meager seat growth anticipated next year is reminiscent of the industry's capacity slowdown after the 2008 financial crisis. For several years, U.S. carriers checked their growth as they maneuvered through the shoals of recession, high oil prices, and a wave of mergers.Keeping a tight grip on seat capacity is an airline's key to boosting airfares and overall financial returns. If the trend begun by Delta is writ large across the U.S. industry, 2017 capacity growth of about 3% will be the tightest in three years, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analyst Jamie Baker wrote on Thursday in a client note.U.S. carriers are keen to reverse almost two years of declines in an industry metric known as passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), a trend driven by capacity expansion and a profusion of low fares. (A seat mile is one seat flown one mile, the standard capacity gauge.) Delta's choice of a slow-growth 2017 will ""turn up the heat on American and United to demonstrate similar conviction"" to reverse unit revenue declines, Baker wrote.Delta shares have declined more than 21% this year, a steeper drop than those of its domestic rivals. The broader Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index has slipped nearly 10% this year.Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research said Delta's quarterly report on Thursday was ""the first of a few positive earnings season data points we expect where network airlines guide to capacity growth of less than 2% next year. That is the core of the entire bull case on the sector.""Atlanta-based Delta closed up 74 cents, to $40.01, on Thursday in New York trading.IBD'S TAKE: Delta shares are trading below their 200-day moving average, free-falling after cracking a buy point in March off a cup-with-handle base. Delta holds a paltry 39 composite rating from IBD, putting it 14th the list of airline stocks, an industry that is ranked 143rd out of 197. But top-ranked carrier Hawaiian Airlines (HA) has managed to score a 91 composite rating out of a possible 99.With sales adjustments over the summer, Delta said it has already begun seeing fares rise for so-called ""close-in bookings"" made 21 days or sooner before travel. The widespread collapse of fare rules for tickets sold shortly before a flight — predominantly the domain of business travelers — has been one of the chief culprits in the industry's sliding unit revenues.The airlines also need higher fares as they confront new pressures in 2017 on their two biggest costs: fuel and people.Crude oil now trades around $50 per barrel, twice the price of just eight months ago. Delta and other carriers are expecting to pay even higher prices in the future. On top of that, several carriers will probably have higher wage costs if labor groups approve pending deals. Delta and its pilots recently concluded negotiations for a new four-year contract, with a 30% raise, Bloomberg News reported.Pilots at Southwest Airlines (LUV) are voting on a new agreement with a 29% pay hike, while pilots at United Airlines (UAL) have a contract provision that ties their income to whether their peers at Delta achieve more. Also this summer, Southwest and United reached tentative deals with flight attendants.For passengers, more storm clouds may be gathering next week, when American and United report their quarterly results and are likely to preview capacity plans for 2017.
"
176,LUV,"When Delta Air Lines (DAL) reports third-quarter results on Thursday, Wall Street's focus, as it has been for much of this year, will likely be on unit revenue and when exactly the carrier can push the key metric into positive territory.Meanwhile, as the benefits from cheap oil fade, analysts expect Delta's earnings per share to fall 3% to $1.68, which would be the first year-over-year drop since Q3 2014. Revenue is expected to be down around 5% to $10.6 billion.The carrier has said it wants to be the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth this year. But management has pushed back the date for when it expects to do that.Unit revenue measures revenue as it relates to an airline's flight coverage, seats on flights and distance traveled. After cheap oil provided a massive cost windfall for airlines, that measure has fallen as airlines expanded -- too much so, at times -- and cut fares in some markets while the dollar also strengthened.In September, however, Delta said that passenger unit revenue in September strengthened from the prior two months. That month, Delta's CFO also said that potentially higher fuel costs in the fourth quarter could prompt the industry to pass on more costs to travelers.Delta has said it expects a Q3 unit-revenue decline of around 7%, with around 1 percentage point coming from an outage in August that resulted in more than 2,000 flight cancellations. Three months ago, Delta projected a 4%-6% drop in unit revenue for the quarter.Delta's traffic results in July and August was hurt by the outage, weakness in close-in bookings, and overcapacity in the Transatlantic. Airlines have vowed to tighten capacity growth in an attempt to align it with passenger demand.But on Monday, Delta said it will begin daily nonstop service from Los Angeles International Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in April.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.Broader concerns about terrorism and the Zika virus have also hurt shares of Delta and industry rivals like American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). Southwest's (LUV) Q3 guidance also got dinged by its own issues with flight cancellations.But after a tumultuous summer, October has presented its own problems for the industry. Hurricane Matthew has prompted around 4,500 airline flight cancellations, Cowen & Co. said in a research note on Monday, citing data from FlightAware.However, such storms have actually helped passenger unit revenue but not earnings, Cowen said.""If the market were to be true to recent trading patterns an improved near-term unit revenue outlook as a result of the storms should be beneficial to stocks,"" the firm said.Delta shares closed up 2.1% at 39.77 in the stock market today. American rose 3.1%, United added 2.6%, and Southwest rallied 3.4%, nearing its 200-day average.United reports quarterly results Oct. 18, American reports Oct. 20 and Southwest reports Oct. 28.RELATED:Here's How Much 'Brexit' Will Hurt American, Delta And United AirUnited Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries Breakout

177,LUV,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) forecast third-quarter unit revenue that was better than the prior two quarters, making the company the latest airline to signal improvement in the key metric.In an investor update dated Tuesday, the carrier forecast a unit-revenue drop of 4.5%, stronger than the second quarter's 6.4% slide and a first-quarter decrease of 6.1%. The company also forecast slightly lower unit costs.Unit revenue measures an airline's revenue in relation to flight capacity. It has fallen after airlines aggressively expanded during the oil crash.Meanwhile, JetBlue (JBLU) on Wednesday reported improved preliminary unit revenue for September but held to its third-quarter unit revenue forecast for a 3%-4% decline.Preliminary unit revenue for the month fell around 2%, JetBlue said, compared to a roughly 5.5% drop in August. Traffic in September rose 10.8%, outpacing capacity growth of 7.9%.Shares of Alaska Air Group rose 1.6% to 70.43 on the stock market today, emerging above their 200-day line.JetBlue fell 0.5% to 17.79 after rising as high as 18.29 intraday. JetBlue has been trying to regain its 200-day line after finding support at the 50-day line through much of September. JetBlue reports third-quarter results on Oct. 25.The figures from Alaska and JetBlue come after more upbeat forecasts issued Tuesday from American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) on Tuesday also reported traffic growth in September that outpaced capacity growth.Wall Street has wanted airlines to align their flight capacity with passenger demand, hoping that doing so would keep unit revenue from falling.IBD'S TAKE: With concerns related to terrorism, the Zika virus and capacity, most airline stocks have had a bumpy ride this summer and haven't had a chance to form bases from which to break out. Things could be a bit better in the medical sector.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports third-quarter results on Thursday, said that its executive chairman, Richard Anderson, was retiring, effective today after nearly 10 years on Delta's board.Lead director Francis Blake, a former chief executive of The Home Depot (HD) will succeed Anderson's as nonexecutive chairman, Delta said.Delta Air shares rose 0.85% to 39.27.American Air lost 2.2% to 37.37 and United Airlines 1.2% to 52.88.Stifel reiterated its buy rating on American Airlines, but cut its price target to 45 from 50. Imperial Capital maintained its outperform rating on United and raised its price target to 63 from 57.RELATED:Virgin Extends Drop As Alaska Air Merger Review Grows LongerUnited Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries BreakoutCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines?

179,LUV,"Apple (AAPL) and Bank Of America (BAC) top the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, but these large investors also placed big bets on stocks in the medical, semiconductor, building, chemical and machinery sectors.X Fund managers tend to take a longer-term approach, so their investments over the last three months in stocks like managed care provider Aetna (AET), chip equipment stock Applied Materials (AMAT), homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and industrial machinery maker Illinois Tool Works (ITW) show they expect continued growth this year in the key industries and sectors that often drive GDP and the overall economy.And despite fears that Amazon (AMZN) is primed to rule the retail world, these leading mutual funds also established new positions or added to their existing ones in Home Depot (HD) and Best Buy (BBY).Apple saw the most new buyers and the most money invested, with 65 funds picking up an estimated nearly $1.8 billion of the iPhone maker's shares.Apple has been carving out a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. The stock closed Tuesday's session 1% below the 176.34 buy point.BofA was the only other stock on the list to get more than a $1 billion investment, as 57 funds sunk $1.04 billion into the banking giant.The Charlotte, N.C.-based company's share price has nearly doubled since Donald Trump's election in 2016, and the stock is now 19% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared last September.Many names on the list, including Best Buy, Texas Instruments (TXN) and FedEx (FDX), have already broken out and are now extended beyond their buy ranges, but Apple is not the only stock on the list in or near a potential buy zone.Graco (GGG), which provides equipment to measure, control and dispense fluid and powder materials in the manufacturing processing and construction industries, cleared a 44.80 buy point on Dec. 15 and is now trading at the upper end of the buy zone.Defense contractor Heico (HEI) also broke out in good volume on Dec. 15, but then pulled back to its 93.10 buy point, where it found support. The maker of jet engine components and electronic systems closed Tuesday's near the very top of the buy range.Pulte is up over 40% from a breakout in June, but the Atlanta-based homebuilder has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks and may offer an add-on buying opportunity at 34.70.Applied Materials is trying to form a new base, but note that it's late-stage and the semiconductor equipment maker's relative strength line is well below new high ground. The stock continues to tests support at its 50-day line.Although Bank Of America received the aforementioned $1 billion buy-in, it also topped the list of stocks being sold with 36 net sellers (93 funds selling minus 57 buying).No. 2 on the sell side was fellow financial titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which had 35 net sellers (91 funds selling minus 56 buying).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), as well as Aetna and Southwest Airlines (LUV), were also among the 10 stocks with the most net sellers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearLooking For The Next Nvidia?

180,LUV,"The Trump tax cuts were met with bleak poll numbers and high skepticism among Americans about their tilt in favor of corporations and the highest-income groups. Yet barely two weeks after passage, roughly 1 million workers have been awarded bonuses that companies attribute to the GOP tax legislation, according to a running list by Americans for Tax Reform, and a few million more are in line to get small cuts in their utility bills.X Still others will benefit from bigger corporate matches for 401(k) accounts, as well as a new $15 minimum wage adopted by at least 20 banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC), U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services (PNC), in the wake of tax cuts.Among the biggest announcements have been $1,000 bonus awards by American Airlines (AAL) (127,000 employees); AT&T (T) (200,000); Bank of America (BAC) (145,000); Comcast (CMCSA) (100,000); Southwest Airlines (LUV) (55,000); and U.S. Bancorp (60,000). The generosity of those announcements was undercut somewhat by reports that AT&T and Comcast were in the midst of layoffs.Meanwhile, a number of electric utilities have announced plans to cut power bills, sharing their tax-cut windfall. Customers of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) subsidiary Pacificorp and Exelon (EXC) subsidiaries Pepco, Baltimore Gas & Electric, and Commonwealth Edison stand to benefit.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Even before the tax cuts begin to show up in paychecks in February, take-home pay has been surging at a rate that's almost unmatched since recession hit in 2007, the exception being a spurt that coincided with 2017's bonus season that runs through the end of March.Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld employment and income taxes have surged 7.4% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the roughly 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy, so bonuses and other incentive pay likely explain the surge to a large extent.The big political question is whether such displays of corporate generosity begin to shift sentiment about the Republicans' legislative achievement and improve GOP prospects in the midterm elections. From an economic standpoint, the question is how fast will the economy grow in 2018 and how much growth will result from this instant gratification from tax cuts.Most economists have fairly moderate expectations for growth this year, with JPMorgan Chase's economics team seeing 2.5% GDP growth in 2018, thanks to a 0.3-percentage-point lift from tax cuts. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that he thinks ""4% economic growth this year is possible.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

184,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) late Thursday raised its fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook and OK'd a new $3 billion share buyback program. That followed a better unit revenue forecast from Southwest Airlines (LUV) earlier in the day.X United said it expected fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue to be flat to down 2%, compared to an earlier forecast for 1%-3% drop. Unit revenue is a key industry metric that tries to gauge an airline's operating efficiency by looking at its revenue as it relates to overall flight capacity.For November, United said that traffic and capacity both rose 5.1%. United said that it had the fewest cancellations of any month in the company's history.The carrier said it expected to wrap up a $2 billion buyback offering from July 2016 by the end of this month.""We continue to invest in our employees, our customer experience and the growth of our business,"" CFO Andrew Levy said in a statement. ""Returning cash to our shareholders reflects the strength of our balance sheet and the confidence we have in our future.""United rose nearly 2% after hours in the stock market today, aiding its recovery from a deep slide that came after the carrier in October gave a murky financial forecast for next year that flat-out terrified investors. United closed the regular session up 2.15% to 63.53. Southwest Airlines (LUV) also hiked its fourth-quarter unit revenue guidance, based on solid November traffic results.The carrier now expects a unit revenue pickup of 1%-2% in the much-watched industry metric. Thursday's forecast compares to an earlier outlook for a range of ""up slightly to up 1.5 percent.""Traffic during November rose 3.4%, while capacity climbed 2.5%.""The increase in unit revenue appears to be both demand and yield based,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said, referring to the airline's ability to get more money out of passengers when they fly. ""We suspect the remainder of the industry will also raise 4Q17 unit revenue guidance, but note rising jet fuel costs might put modest pressure on the EPS accretion from the improved revenue environment.""Shares rose 3.1% to 63.02, now slightly extended from a 59.67 buy point of a cup-with-handle base.Delta Air Lines (DAL), whose stock jumped on Monday after it reported November traffic figures, advanced 2.1% to 53.41. That stock is in a cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point of 54.16, one of several notable big caps nearing buy points.American Airlines (AAL), which is also making its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 53.84 entry, climbed 2.6% to 50.88.Airline stocks have been a moving target for the latter half of this year, with Wall Street punishing Spirit Airlines (SAVE) on fears of steeper fare discounting over the summer, then punishing United and others over concerns about their ability to control rising costs. Some analysts have indicated that Southwest might be best-positioned if Wall Street began to focus more on costs.IBD'S TAKE: For more on what fare cuts and higher costs mean for the airline business, read this story.Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) on Tuesday also raised its fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook, which Cowen attributed to the bankruptcy filing of Island Air in October. But shares tumbled after the carrier signaled tougher competition on fare prices in the first quarter of next year.Southwest plans to start offering service to Hawaii next year. United Airlines in June said it would expand service to Hawaii, starting this month.Hawaiian is also considering whether to launch a no-frills basic economy fare similar to the one available on Delta, American and United, according to CNBC.Hawaiian popped 4.55% on Thursday to 41.40.RELATED:After WOW Offers $100 Iceland Flight, American Opens Reykjavik RouteAmerican Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers Fall

186,LUV,"After strong 2017 gains, the S&P 500 index and other major averages rose sharply to new highs to start 2018. Chip stocks were strong even with Intel (INTC) disclosing a big flaw in many processors. Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) were among many breakouts, but often with some issues. Tesla (TSLA) struggled to get Model 3 out the factory gate while other auto stocks rallied despite U.S. auto sales capping their first annual decline since the financial crisis. Bitcoin had a relatively calm week of solid gains as rival cryptocurrencies surged ahead. Economic data were solid but shouldn't spook the Federal Reserve.X The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials rose sharply to start 2018, with oil, steel and chip groups among the big winners, while utilities sold off. Facebook, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were among those breaking out, but many were in low volume or had other notable flaws. Crude futures rose to a three-year high. The Treasury yield spread continued to narrow.Intel (INTC) fell as low as 42.69 after a security issue was revealed on its PC and server processors but rallied to close down 3.1% at 44.74.  The security issue could allow hackers to gather sensitive data from the memory of computing devices, but not modify, delete or corrupt data through the exploit, Intel said. The chipmaker said it has developed and is rapidly issuing software patches and firmware updates to correct the problem. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its shares rally because its processors reportedly are not vulnerable to the same security exploit.Bitcoin prices rose to above $16,000 on Friday, capping a solid weekly gain in what was a relatively calm period for the fast-moving cryptocurrency. Alternative digital currencies Ripple and Ethereum surged to new highs. Founders Fund, co-founded by early Facebook investor Peter Thiel, invested $15 million-$20 million in Bitcoin — an investment worth hundreds of millions now, according to the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal also reported that Merrill Lynch barred its financial advisors from making trades for clients in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) or proposing any Bitcoin related investments. Russia is looking at creating its own cryptocurrency after President Vladimir Putin meet with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born founder of Ethereum, to figure out how to regulate them. China is reportedly looking to regulate power usage for Bitcoin mining after closing exchanges last year to reduce spreading financial risks.Nearly all automakers saw U.S. vehicle sales fall in December despite heavy incentives and a year-end sales push, but Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) topped estimates, with Ford eking out a 0.9% gain. For 2017, U.S. auto sales fell 1.8% to 17.2 million vehicles, according to Autodata, marking the first decline in eight years. Both analysts and carmakers see a drop below 17 million in 2018. Despite weak auto sales, auto stocks continue to perform well, as investors expect the momentum in higher-margin SUV and truck sales to continue. GM rose 7.4% for the week, Ford 5.7% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 22%.Tesla continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, with overall vehicle output stagnant in recent quarters. Tesla made 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the quarter, vs. consensus of 4,100. Tesla claimed it made ""major progress"" on bottlenecks but now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned. Tesla shares rose 1.7% but are still near seven-month lows.Shares of BlackBerry (BB) jumped 24% to their best levels since June 2013 in large part as the one-time smartphone leader signed a deal with Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to work together on automotive software for self-driving vehicles.A Goldilocks jobs report for December quieted talk that labor markets are at risk of overheating. Payrolls rose a moderate 148,000, well below the 190,000 expected, as the jobless rate held at 4.1% and average hourly wage gains remained stuck at 2.5%. The data may help Federal Reserve policymakers follow a slow pace of interest rate hikes, at least for now. Yet other indications suggest the economy ended the year with a strong head of steam. Holiday sales were strong. And the ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly rose 1.5 points to 59.7, signaling accelerating factory growth. The new orders gauge vaulted to a 15-year high of 69.4, up from a robust 64.0 the prior month.Macy's (M) Nov.-Dec. same-store sales unexpectedly rose 1.1% — the first holiday gain in three years — and J.C. Penney (JCP) comps up 2.4%. But amid more Macy's store closures, shares of both stocks nevertheless tumbled. Elsewhere, Costco Wholesale (COST) core same-store sales popped 8.8% and Zumiez (ZUMZ) comps jumped 7.9%, both topping views. Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) fell short of comp forecasts and cut its earnings target. Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) said holiday same-store sales increased 3.9% and implied Q4 EPS would edge past views.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) narrowly beat Q1 expectations with $1.28 EPS on $30.7 billion in revenue. U.S. retail pharmacy sales grew 8.9% as comps rose 4.7%. The drugstore chain lifted the bottom end of full-year EPS guidance. Shares fell 5.2% Thursday but were up a fraction for the week. Rite Aid (RAD) met views for a 2-cent-a-share loss vs. a year earlier 2-cent gain. Revenue from continuing operations fell nearly 6% to $5.35 billion, including a 3% retail pharmacy sales drop and 12% pharmacy service revenue decline. Shares dipped 1.4% on Thursday but rose for the week. CVS Health (CVS) said Q4 EPS would come in at the low end of its $1.88-$1.92 forecast, but said tax cuts would boost cash flow. Shares jumped 8.2% for the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) tweaked its Q4 cost forecast higher, partly due to the massive outage last month in its Atlanta hub, and held to its Q4 unit-revenue and margin outlook. Delta expects a one-time hit of $150 million-$200 million in the fourth quarter due to Trump's tax bill. American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) said they'd give employees $1,000 each following the tax cuts. Southwest also said it would invest in modernizing its Boeing (BA) fleet.Winning high rollers reportedly weighed on December casino revenue, which came in light at 14.6% growth vs. Bloomberg views for 20% gains. But Macau gross gaming revenue still got a 19.1% bump for the year, in line with consensus per Reuters and the first annual gain since 2013. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) fell more than 2% for the week, while MGM Resorts International (MGM), which is more Vegas-centric, climbed 1.5%.MoneyGram International (MGI) fell 6.8% for the week after the U.S. government rejected a takeover by Alibaba (BABA) affiliate Ant Financial, on national security grounds.Dominion Energy (D) agreed to buy Scana (SCG) battered by a failed nuclear project, for $7.9 billion or $14.6 billion including assumed debt.Constellation Brands (STX) unexpectedly reported a slim per-share profit rise and set a $3 billion stock buyback.

The company forecasts adjusted pretax margin of 12%-14%, up from 11%-13%.The carrier said that passenger traffic for April rose 3.1%, on a modest capacity increase of 0.8%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, was 82.2%, up 1.8 percentage points.Airlines' bookings practices, including how tightly they pack flights, came under intense scrutiny last month after police dragged a passenger from a United Express flight after he refused to give up his seat to accommodate crew members.However, the financial impact from that incident appears likely to be minimal.Even as United settled with the passenger, David Dao, and airline executives were questioned by a House panel, Wall Street has been focused more on airlines' ability to keep their growth plans in check and wring profits from passengers as oil and labor costs rise. Alaska Air Group said its traffic for April increased 7.8%, while capacity rose 4.6%.United reported a 7.4% jump in traffic, outpacing a 4% increase in flight capacity for last month. United said it would stick with its second-quarter forecast for unit revenue, a key metric that gauges an airline's sales in relation to its overall flight coverage.Southwest on Monday reported April traffic rose 8.4%, while capacity rose 7.6%. Load factor rose 0.6 percentage points to 84%. The carrier held to its second-quarter unit revenue forecast of a 1%-2% increase.RELATED:Why Flying On Spirit Airlines Now Is A Real 'Riot'Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThe Latest Threat To Delta, United Comes From This New Budget Carrier

191,LUV,"People use volume in their voices to show intensity of emotion. Whether it's a raised voice in anger, fear, surprise or elation, volume is a key metric to gauge the level of the emotion. Volume in the markets (the amount of shares traded) is similar. It's your measure of the intensity of the buying or selling behind the price move.Higher volume means more traders were clamoring to buy or sell the stock, or larger players were coming in with bigger orders. Traders need to keep a keen eye on volume in both the general market and for individual stocks, especially at critical areas of support and resistance.The Nasdaq composite, as the leading index this year, has been key in guiding swing trades. Volume, especially at inflection points, has provided additional clues to enhance success. The Nasdaq made little progress in March and was especially shaken by a severe drop on March 21 (1). Over the next month, a lot of sideways action followed, leading to reduced trading as the batting average suffered on IBD's SwingTrader.Things improved on April 24 when the index gapped up on an increase in volume (2). The batting average was over 80% wins in the next month for SwingTrader as that initial intensity at an inflection point fueled a number of positive setups.On the downside, the market was dealt another blow on May 17 with a drop in heavier volume (3).  A suspicious part of the recovery was that five consecutive days of gains also had consecutively lower volume (4). That makes you wonder why there wasn't more intensity behind the buying. During those five days, two stocks were put on the SwingTrader watch list: Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Berry Global Group (BERY). Both were removed without triggering buys. The reason? No volume as they passed their buy points. While both pushed higher, why risk hard-earned money on a low-probability trade in an iffy environment?To the market's favor, May 25 saw volume come in heavier than the previous day for the first time in the rebound (5). There are, however, a few key differences to note when comparing this day to the strength of April 24 (2). First, the small-cap Russell 2000 beat the Nasdaq with an even higher jump on April 24. On May 25, the Russell was up, but grudgingly. It closed up, just barely, and low in its trading range. Second, the action the following day was very different. April 24 was immediately followed by another strong day on even better volume, a key of that rally's success. Friday's action showed an inside day with volume tapering off. Of course, the looming Memorial Day holiday could be blamed for a lack of action, but it still leaves the question: If there isn't any intensity behind the buying, how much progress can we make?More details on past trades are available to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader.

192,LUV,"Even as a House panel tried to grill United Airlines (UAL) CEO Oscar Munoz and other industry executives Tuesday, shares of top airlines were market leaders. The congressional hearing amounted to lawmakers venting and warning, but not signaling a push for new legislation. Meanwhile, new industry data suggest airlines are getting better at packing planes to capacity.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported positive unit revenue — a measure of sales in relation to an airline's flight and seating capacity — for the month of April.Delta Air led the airline sector higher in the stock market today, rising 5.35% to 47.83, retaking its 50-day moving average.United Airlines (UAL) rose 5.2% to 73.94, also retaking its 50-day line.American Airlines (AAL) ascended 4.25% to 43.87, rebounding from its 200-day line and nearing its 50-day.Southwest Airlines (LUV) climbed 3.6% to 58.33. Southwest is currently in a cup base with a 59.78 potential buy point.Delta's passenger unit revenue in April rose 1%. That's the second straight month of positive results for the key metric. In March, the carrier turned passenger unit revenue positive for the first time since November 2015.Delta's flight capacity fell 0.8%. Traffic for the month rose 1.6%.Delta's monthly traffic results come as the very things that airlines do to make investors happy — higher fares, lower capacity and tighter operations — were scrutinized by lawmakers in a hearing before members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.During that hearing, lawmakers called out airlines for a recent string of ""disturbing customer-service breakdowns"" — most notably the violent removal of passenger David Dao from a United Express flight last month that resulted in a settlement between him and the carrier.United's CEO, Oscar Munoz, who attended the hearing with President Scott Kirby, said that event was marked a ""serious breach of public trust"" and apologized for an ""inadequate"" response. Munoz also reiterated changes the airline would make in the wake of the incident.Also in attendance were Bob Jordan, Southwest's CCO; Kerry Philipovitch, senior vice president of customer experience at American; and William McGee, aviation consultant for Consumers Union.Overbookings, a decade's worth of consolidation, passenger contracts as long as 67 pages, the overall ""miserable"" experience from booking a ticket online to going through a TSA checkpoint to waiting at the gate — all those subjects and more were on the table for the House panel.""I can't get comparable prices, so before the ticket, I'm frustrated,"" said Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, who had no questions.And GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter of California — who said he'd considered using his time to gauge the industry's contempt for the American people — said it was ""an absolute joke"" that competition existed in the airline industry, citing a lack of choice in many markets.""We don't have a choice. ... The American people have to fly, all the time,"" he said.Two lawmakers on the panel called for the Government Accountability Office to look at ways to improve operations and consumer protections.Airline executives said competition has intensified over the years, despite the merger wave that began in the prior decade. Low-cost carriers threaten them domestically and internationally. And executives said overbooking — which, in a way, oversupplies flights — allows them to keep fares low and made scores of seats available.Southwest has said it would end overbookings, potentially by the middle of this year, but Jordan said some flights could be oversold for operational reasons.""This is an intensely competitive industry,"" said Philipovitch. She added, ""This competition is good for consumers.""However, most executives wouldn't get into specifics on what measures they would take to make passenger rights easier to understand.When asked if they would create a one-page document that outlined passenger rights, Munoz and Kirby said they supported simplicity but were unsure about whether the document would be one page. Joseph Sprague, senior vice president of external relations at Alaska Air Group's (ALK) Alaska Airlines, said ""that would be our goal."" Philipovitch and Jordan said they favored simplicity.""You may think you're looking at members of Congress,"" said Democratic Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes of the District of Columbia. ""But really you're looking at your customer base.""RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

193,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday forecast improved third-quarter unit revenue, sending shares higher as the industry heads into earnings season.The figures come after Delta Air Lines (DAL) last week also reported unit revenue for the month of September that strengthened from a rough prior two months, which included an outage in August that forced the carrier to cancel 2,300 flights. Delta kicks off third-quarter earnings for the industry on Thursday.Wall Street will now be looking for airlines to carry September's momentum into the fourth quarter, after nearly two years of decreasing unit revenue as airlines used a cheap-oil windfall as an opportunity to expand.American Airlines said it expected Q3's total unit revenue to fall roughly 2%-3%, better than a 3%-5% decline forecast last month. The company also boosted its pretax margin forecast for the quarter — it now expects 13%-15% margins, as opposed to 12%-14% margins forecast in September.The carrier said it expects full-year carrying capacity — an airline's supply of seats and flights — to be up roughly 1.5%. In July, the carrier forecast 2% growth and, in April, forecast a 2.5% increase.Investors have hoped that airlines would trim capacity growth to align it more with demand, a move that would help airlines get more money out of passengers and improve unit revenue, which measures revenue in relation to capacity.American said it expected full-year unit costs for to be up roughly 5%-7%, reflecting labor deals struck with employees.For September, passenger traffic fell 1.7%, while capacity fell 0.4%.American Airlines' shares reversed lower after early gains, closing down 1.7% in the stock market today. The stock recently found support at its 50-day line. American reports third-quarter results on Oct. 20. Delta shares dropped 2.1%.Meanwhile, United Airlines said it expected a third-quarter consolidated unit revenue drop of 5.5%-6.0%, compared to an outlook for a 5.5%-7.5% decline given in September.The improvement, the company said, was largely helped by ""better than expected September close-in bookings driven by the timing of certain holidays."" Still, the stronger dollar, competition, weaker demand and ""travel reductions from customers impacted by lower oil prices"" weighed on unit revenue.United fell 1.25% on Tuesday, also giving up early gains.Southwest (LUV), which like Delta suffered from infrastructure problems during the quarter, said it continues to expect third-quarter unit revenue to fall 3.5%-4.5%. Around 0.5 percentage point of that drop is expected to come from an outage in July that caused around 2,000 flight cancellations.However, traffic rose 7.9% in September, outpacing a 6% rise in capacity. Southwest's stock got a lift last month after it said it would constrain capacity next year.Shares finished less than 0.1% higher.IBD'S TAKE: With concerns related to terrorism, the Zika virus and capacity, most airline stocks have had a bumpy ride this summer and haven't had a chance to form bases from which to break out. Things could be a bit better in the medical sector.Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the ultra-low-cost carrier that helped draw its bigger U.S. rivals into an airfare war last year that damaged unit revenue, said September traffic rose 15.2%, outpacing capacity growth of 14.4%.Shares dropped 1.8% on Tuesday.Hurricane Matthew's financial impact on the airlines this month is not yet clear, but November is expected to be a good month due to Thanksgiving travel. But the timing of some holidays remains a concern.""In recent discussions with airlines, they cited concerns over a calendar shift,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.""We expect a negative impact due to the shift in Jewish holidays from September to October and Halloween falling on a Monday,"" she continued. ""Business traffic the week of Oct. 31 shifts into November. We are also hearing that December might be challenged by Christmas falling on Sunday, resulting in return traffic being in January.""RELATED:United Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries BreakoutCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines?

194,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday said consolidated passenger unit-revenue in September improved from the quarter's prior two months, and the carrier said adjusted unit costs for the third quarter were likely better than anticipated.The month's results come as third-quarter earnings season looms for the airline industry. The industry for some two years has contended with falling unit revenue, which measures revenue from passengers as it relates to available seats on flights and distance traveled.The numbers also cap a quarter in which Delta and other airlines dealt with concerns over terrorism, the Zika virus and their own technology. Delta Air Lines had to cancel 2,300 flights in August after a small fire at a power switch caused a massive outage. Southwest Airlines' (LUV) third-quarter unit-revenue forecast also took a hit after an outage prompted the cancellations of some 2,000 flights in July.Delta on Tuesday said September consolidated passenger unit revenue fell 3%. The company said ""close-in domestic yield pressures moderated slightly with the implementation of lower Fall capacity levels."" Delta also said it continues to deal with ""a supply-demand imbalance"" in the trans-Atlantic region.Investors have wanted airlines to rein in flight-capacity growth to align more with demand. Expansion and fare competition during the cheap-oil boom, along with a stronger dollar that has hurt international demand, have weighed on unit revenue.At the beginning of the quarter, a 7% unit-revenue drop in July made some investors wonder if Delta could hit the unit-revenue target it gave when it reported second-quarter earnings. Then the outage, in part, brought a 9.5% drop in August.But Delta on Tuesday said ""cost discipline and productivity efforts"" enabled it to deal with cost issues associated with the outage. Delta said it expects unit costs excluding some expenses to be roughly flat for the third quarter, compared with an earlier forecast for ""flat to up 1%.""The company on Tuesday also stuck with its third-quarter unit-revenue forecast -- a decline around 7%, with around 1 percentage point of that coming from the outage. In July, Delta had forecast a Q3 unit-revenue decline of 4%-6%.The company said carrying capacity likely rose around 1.5% during the quarter, with operating margin at 18%-19%. Those forecasts were also in line with guidance given last month.Passenger traffic during September rose 1.4%, with capacity up 1.8%, Delta said.Delta shares ended the trading day up 0.4% to 40.15 on the stock market today, still well off 52-week highs.United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) also got an early boost from the numbers. United Airlines rose 0.9% to 53.73 while American Airlines reversed to trade down 0.2% to 37.63.Southwest fell 1.5% 39.16.Recent labor pacts with other airlines could upend Southwest's less-generous tentative pact with its pilots. Delta on Friday announced an agreement in principle with its pilots union for a pay raise that was higher than the one negotiated at Southwest, Southwest's union said, according to Bloomberg.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.

Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro didn't help Illumina's cause when he said that after speaking with Illumina executives, they were ""still searching for answers to explain the miss."" He said a delayedsale of its high-end HiSeq X5 or X10 genome-sequencing system, likely to a China customer was one reason. These systems can cost $1 million-plus, so the sales cycles are long, often longer than expected.

199,LUV,"Shares of JetBlue (JBLU) soared on Tuesday after the carrier said traffic growth outpaced capacity in August and forecast quarter-to-quarter improvement in unit revenue, a key measure of an airline's efficiency.The company said that it expected third-quarter unit revenue, a measure of revenue as it relates to an airline's available seats and flight coverage, to fall between 3%-4%, an improvement from the 8.2% drop JetBlue reported for the second quarter.One analyst said that forecast suggests an improved end to the quarter for the carrier.""The guidance implies September unit revenue will be down 1%-4%, better than initial (forecasts) of September being the worst month of the quarter,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""JetBlue's guidance update is consistent with what we heard from other airlines, with the first half of August being worse than expected, but improving throughout the month and continuing into September.""Traffic rose 6.2% during the month, outpacing capacity growth of 5.7%. Load factor, a measure of an airline's ability to put passengers in seats, rose 0.4 point to 87.4%.JetBlue's traffic and capacity figures for August reverse the trend seen from bigger network carriers American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), which both said passenger traffic had grown less than capacity, or an airline's supply of seats and flights.Wall Street has wanted airlines to curb that supply and raise fares amid concerns that carriers' expansion was unsustainable. Delta has been saying that the days of low oil prices, which cushioned airlines' profits and allowed them expand and absorb costs, are over.JetBlue ascended by 2.4% to close at 17.19 on the stock market today, popping above its 50-day line. American lost 2.5% to 37.37, testing its 200-day line, while United dropped 3% to 51.64. Delta Air Lines (DAL), whose forecast greater operational discipline on a potential rise in fuel prices helped lift airline stocks last week, was down 2.4% to 37.53, undercutting its 50-day line. Southwest (LUV), which has also forecast reined-in capacity growth next year, fell 1.8% to 37.14.IBD's TAKE: Airlines don't exactly rank highly among their peers from other sectors, with IBD's Transportation-Airline group coming in at 108 out of 197 tracked industries. But Hawaiian Holdings has mostly been a standout, hovering within buy range in recent days.  JetBlue's results come after a summer marked by Brexit, terrorism concerns and choppy unit revenue and capacity trends, massive rounds of flight cancellations and executive shake-ups.

200,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Monday held to its outlook for third-quarter unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin, but the carrier said that passenger traffic declined in August while flight capacity rose, after a report from United Airlines (UAL) on Friday also showed weak traffic.The monthly results come as airlines have vowed to pull back capacity growth to be more in line with demand after investors have punished the sector since the spring for what has been seen as a lack of restraint in adding more seats and expanding flight coverage.American said traffic fell 2.8% in August, while flight capacity rose 1.4% but still expects Q3 unit revenue, which measures revenue as it relates to capacity, to fall roughly 3%-5%. The carrier continues to see Q3 adjusted pretax margin of 12%-14%.Shares of American closed down 0.4% to 38.34 in the stock market today, rebounding from intraday plunge below their 200-day average as the major averages rebounded. Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 1.8% after undercutting its 50-day line early, while United Air rebounded for a 1.5% gain. Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose 1.15% to 47.66, above a 47.02 buy point.IBD's TAKE: Airlines don't exactly rank highly among their peers from other sectors, with IBD's Transportation-Airline group coming in at 108 out of 197 tracked industries. Despite dipping below a buy point Monday, Hawaiian Holdings has mostly been a standout. Unit revenue industrywide has fallen after an oil oversupply beginning in 2014 drove down fuel costs, boosting airlines' profits and making it easier to absorb costs from competition and expansion. But Wall Street has been worried that airlines have risked overexpansion. The stronger dollar has also weakened international demand, also pushing unit revenues lower.Airlines got a bump last week after Delta and Southwest Airlines (LUV) forecast greater operational discipline. Delta also said that potentially higher fuel costs in Q4 quarter could prompt airlines to pass those costs onto passengers, meaning higher fares and better unit revenue.A broader market sell-off on Friday, however, helped erase those gains.Also on Friday, United said traffic rose 0.6% in August, outpaced by a capacity increase of 1.9%. But the company stuck with its outlook for a Q3 consolidated passenger unit revenue drop of 5.5% to 7.5%.""The year-over-year performance is primarily impacted by demand growth not keeping pace with capacity growth, soft close-in yields, competitive actions and travel reductions in the energy sector,"" United said in a statement.United also forecast adjusted unit costs to rise 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year, up from guidance given earlier, due to a new contract agreement with flight attendants that was ratified in August. The company's guidance for adjusted unit cost for Q3 was unchanged, but it said there would be ""a modest increase"" to non-fuel expenses during the quarter due to the contract.RELATED:Why Southwest Stock Deserves A Premium Over Delta, United, AmericanDelta Says Flight Cancellations Cost $100 Million, Cites Other Industry Woes

201,LUV,"Boeing (BA) is reportedly considering two ways to make room for more passengers on its 737 Max 9 to answer European rival Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo.Boeing is looking at lengthening the current 737 Max 9, the largest plane in the 737 family with 180 seats, or redesigning it with larger engines, according to Bloomberg.If Boeing goes with the simpler lengthening option, the plane could start operations in 2020, but the more complicated redesign wouldn't enter service until 2022. That could be too late for Boeing as Airbus' A321neo's long-range version is scheduled to start commercial services in 2019.Boeing shares fell 3.3% to 123.53 in the stock market today as the major averages had their worst day in months. Airbus' U.S. listed shares dipped 0.8%. Southwest was off 3.7% to 37.34. Air Lease (AL) shares fell 4% to 28.75.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing's stock has taken a hit from declining commercial sales. But the defense side is booming, as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other defense firms are battling for hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars up for grabs.Carriers have ordered more narrow-body jets in recent years and Airbus' A321neo has been outselling Boeing's 737 Max 9 by 4-to-1, according to a prior Reuters report.Meanwhile, Boeing's 737 Max 7 will get bigger too. The company said at the Farnborough Airshow in July that it would stretch the Max 7 jet to make room for 12 additional seats to compete with Bombardier's C Series model as customers including Southwest Airlines (LUV) have shown interest in a longer model.RELATED: Southwest Is A Buy, JPMorgan Downgraded, Chesapeake UpgradedAirbus Deliveries Are On Track; Boeing Rival Signs Vietnamese OrdersWho Will Win Qatar Airways' 'Large' Order?

203,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said that the trans-Atlantic market would see the biggest quarter-to-quarter improvement in Q4, as business travel strengthens on Europe's emergence from a recession.XThat forecast comes even as low-cost, long-haul carriers in Europe have proliferated in the airspace above the Atlantic Ocean. Competition from those carriers has added a layer of stress for Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), which have tried to shore up sales by adding a wider variety of high-end and low-end seating classes to their cabins.But the resilience in Delta's international business overall, management said on Wednesday's conference call to discuss the carrier's strong Q3 results and Q4 outlook, has been a bit of a ""surprise"" and a key aspect in driving positive unit revenue.Management said domestic performance would see the second-highest level of improvement. President Glen Hauenstein noted that the carrier hadn't seen any ""material decline"" in traffic to and from Las Vegas following last week's mass shooting which killed at least 58 people.""That was a surprise, and I hope it's not a sad commentary on the human state that we're getting used to this,"" he said.The company expects the Pacific region to see the third-best level of sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, followed by the Latin America region, where a string of hurricanes and an earthquake have ravaged the Caribbean and Mexico.Delta forecast Q4 passenger unit revenue — a key industry metric that looks at revenue as it relates to an airline's total flight coverage — to rise 2%-4%, with operating margins of 11%-13%. Wall Street expected Delta to forecast a roughly 1.5% unit-revenue gain for Q4, according to a Cowen research note last week. Meanwhile, CEO Ed Bastian vowed not to pay import duties on Bombardier's C Series jets, of which Delta has agreed to buy 75 worth $5 billion at list prices, after the U.S. imposed a 300% tariff amid claims the Canadian companies received illegal state aid. The airline may delay delivery of the jets, which are due to next year.Delta reported Q3 EPS of $1.57, down 8%, on revenue of $11.1 billion, up 5.5% — topping Zacks estimates for $1.54 and $11.037 billion.However, the carrier said non-fuel unit costs for the full year would be up roughly 4% as a result of a new profit-sharing plan, a depreciation of narrow-body jets and of flight cancellations resulting from bad weather. Management called that rate ""not sustainable"" but said that moving away from its cap on growth would help.""Capacity will play a part,"" CFO Paul Jacobson said on the call. ""We made a decision to cap capacity at 1% this year to improve revenue performance. But this also put pressure on costs. Returning to a more normalized growth rate next year will further benefit our CASM.""Shares of Delta closed up 0.7% at 53.07 on the stock market today, making its way toward a 55.85 buy point of a cup base. American Airlines (AAL) dipped 0.4% to 52.83 and United Airlines (UAL) eased 0.5% to 67.40. On Tuesday, American rose 4.8%, nearing a 54.58 buy point of a cup base, while United Airlines jumped 4.7% as both carriers said Q3 unit revenue would be better than expected.Southwest (LUV) gained 0.9% to 58.55. That stock is forming a base with a 64.49 buy point.JetBlue (JBLU) shares climbed 1.5% to 20.53 despite estimating that hurricanes reduced revenue by $44 million in Q3 and $70 million-$90 million in Q4, with adjusted EPS seeing a hit of 6-7 cents in Q3 and 10-13 cents in Q4.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing and the airlines. In recent months, many airline stocks have either threatened to undercut their postelection gains or actually undercut them. In recent days, however, those stocks have rebounded.Wall Street this summer has worried that an airfare discount battle between United, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier Airlines in some of United's big airport hubs would swallow the rest of the industry. Those fears were followed by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria along with earthquakes in Mexico, which forced thousands of flight cancellations and prompted airlines to pull back on their financial forecasts.However, guidance this week and last from the big three airlines has indicated to analysts that airlines have kept airfare prices high enough to appease Wall Street.American, in an investor update on Tuesday, cited ""stronger than anticipated yield performance"" on airfares in raising its outlook for unit revenue.In a research note on Tuesday about United, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said that ""Houston appears to have recovered a bit faster from Hurricane Harvey than United had originally anticipated"" and that ""drags from the (ultralow-cost carrier) pricing competition and lower demand in Guam appears to have stabilized (not better, but not worse).""Still, Southwest on Tuesday began a 72-hour sale of reduced-price tickets, some of which are advertised for as low as $49 one way. JetBlue, meanwhile, has announced a one-day sale for one-way fares as low as $31.Further out, Delta's recent decision to increase profit-sharing for its employees — by moving them all to a single, higher-paying plan from the existing two — could temper earnings.""Although we acknowledge the slight cost increase, part of our thesis on an improved airline industry rests on culture improvement and employee engagement in driving better operational outcomes,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note. ""With Delta's recent changes, we suspect the carrier has the most generous payout of the large airlines, begging the question whether others will follow.""Delta, on the call, said that it had always intended to have a single profit-sharing plan and that it would be good for employees.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Earnings: 3 Things To WatchAmerican, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapHere's Why Delta, JetBlue And Other Airlines Are Surging TodayUnited, American Both Wage Fare War, But Analyst Sours On One Airline

204,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, kicking off the sector's results ahead of United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and others. Here are three things to watch.XWall Street more-or-less knows what it's getting for Delta Air Lines' third quarter, helped by the carrier's release of monthly traffic figures. So, as with all earnings seasons, investors will be turning to what Delta sees for the fourth quarter.On that front, Wall Street expects Delta to forecast around a 1.5% increase in fourth-quarter unit revenue, or sales an airline gets from travelers in relation to its overall flight capacity.""With continued low fuel prices and intense competition, the U.S. market is likely to remain competitive, which could cap fares from moving higher,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last week.Intense competition, of course, is good news for passengers because it means they're likelier to get a better bargain on airfare. But investors hate it, because lower airfares hurt sales and profits.Much of the recent intense competition is the result of a push over the past few months by United Airlines to drive ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) from some of the nation's busiest airports. American Airlines has remained committed to competing aggressively with the discounters.  Analysts have debated whether other carriers could get sucked in, as well.A 1.5% increase in fourth-quarter unit revenue would be slightly weaker than the carrier's Oct. 3 estimate of a roughly 2% gain for the third quarter. The Q3 forecast was hurt by Hurricane Irma. But when factoring out the storm, the quarter was regarded by some analysts as OK, lifting shares of other airlines in the process.Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said Delta's forecast last week indicated that ""pricing held in pretty well in September and it isn't unreasonable to expect it's continuing into (Q4), too.""Delta, at a Cowen airline conference last month, suggested that trying to compete on sub-$40 fares might not always jibe with its vision for being the world's best global carrier. But a backslide into discounting is never too far away.""American will tell you and Delta will tell you we're not going to match Spirit fares, but we're going to match United fares,"" Becker said in an interview with IBD last month.As for the third quarter, Wall Street expects the carrier to report EPS of $1.54, down 9%, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is seen increasing 5% to $11.037 billion.Shares of Delta dipped 0.5% to 51.74 in the stock market today. Delta is forming a cup base with a 55.85 buy point.American Airlines lost 1.4% to 50.60. American is forming a cup base with a 54.58 potential entry. Southwest Airlines (LUV) retreated 1.3% to 57.66 as it works its way through a cup pattern with a 64.49 potential buy point. United Airlines dipped 0.8% after retaking its 50-day line at the end of last month. All four airline stocks have rallied in recent weeks following corrections.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing (BA) and the airlines.  Delta's fourth-quarter international business could outperform its domestic results, Becker said. A stronger overseas forecast from Delta could ease investor concerns even as the legacy airlines dig in in the U.S.The improvement abroad would follow some steep competition earlier this year between U.S. carriers and the low-cost, long-haul carriers of the Atlantic.""The Atlantic market appears to have absorbed the growth, while other legacy carriers have adjusted their capacity for the new norm,"" Becker said in a research note.Better results in Brazil appear likely to improve the carrier's fortunes in Latin America, while the crowded Pacific market could still remain weak.Delta has targeted yearly adjusted unit-cost growth of under 2%. However, the carrier last month said that on Oct. 1, it would bring its staff under a single profit-sharing plan — one currently in place for the carrier's pilots.Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said the adjustment could hurt earnings next year. Questions about the profit-sharing plan's impact on the bottom line could come up during Delta's earnings call.RELATED:Here's Why Delta, JetBlue And Other Airlines Are Surging TodaySouthwest Airlines Cuts Revenue Guidance In Wake Of Hurricanes, EarthquakeUnited, American Both Wage Fare War, But Analyst Sours On One AirlineThese Airlines Look Like The Biggest Losers In The Latest Price War

206,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) jumped on Tuesday after the carrier forecast third-quarter unit revenue that, when factoring out Hurricane Irma, was better than feared.XThe forecast appeared to offer some relief to other airlines — including American Airlines (AAL), JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) — that send a lot of planes to and from Florida and other areas in the storm's path.""Excluding the hurricane, overall guidance is positive and likely speaks to stabilizing pricing trends for Delta,"" Cowen said in a research note.Delta said it expects Q3 passenger unit revenue to rise roughly 2%. Technically, that's down from the forecast of a 2%-3% increase that the carrier gave early last month, but that prior guidance came before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit. When factoring out the effects from Irma, the Q3 forecast offered Tuesday would be for a 3% increase.Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth also noted that the would-be 3% increase also fell within Delta's original Q3 unit revenue forecast of a 2.5%-4.5% increase. She noted that international trends in the trans-Atlantic also continued to be better than expected.Shares of Delta jumped 6.6% to a month-high of 51.25 in the stock market today, retaking their 50- and 200-day average. JetBlue leapt 7.1%, American added 5.8% and Spirit Airlines popped 7.1%. United Airlines (UAL) surged 6.1%, and Southwest (LUV) climbed 4.5%.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing (BA) and the airlines.  Still, Delta said Irma resulted in 2,200 flight cancellations — in Florida, Georgia, the Caribbean and the company's hub in Atlanta — pushing up unit costs. Delta estimated that the storm cost it around $120 million in pretax income, and the carrier cut its Q3 operating margin forecast to 15.5%-16.5% from earlier expectations of 16.5%-17.5%.For the month of September, traffic rose 0.3% as capacity grew 0.6%. Load factor fell 0.2 percentage points to 84.4%.A combination of higher fuel prices, natural disasters and worries of a widening discounting black hole have hurt airline stocks and their financial forecasts this summer. Analysts and investors seem likely to focus on airfare pricing — and whether airlines can squeeze it back up — when the industry's earnings season rolls around this month.While United and American have indicated that they won't take ultralow fares from the likes of Spirit lying down, Delta has suggested they might try to stay above the fray.During a conference last month, the company said its ultimate goal was to be the world leader in connecting global air traffic and offering the most expansive flight coverage available.""So if that means that we can't have a product that caters to a consumer that wants to (fly for) $39, that's OK,"" Delta management said.RELATED:Southwest Airlines Cuts Revenue Guidance In Wake Of Hurricanes, EarthquakeUnited, American Both Wage Fare War, But Analyst Sours On One AirlineThese Airlines Look Like The Biggest Losers In The Latest Price War

207,LUV,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) on Thursday cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook in the wake of hurricanes that have sheared through Texas and Florida and left Puerto Rico without electricity and the earthquakes that have devastated large parts of Mexico.XThe forecast comes as the impact from the storms continues to add up for the airlines. United Airlines (UAL) (IBD) this month lowered its Q3 unit revenue outlook due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey. American Airlines (AAL) followed, cutting its unit revenue forecast after Hurricane Irma forced 40 airports to close in Florida and the Caribbean, including the carrier's Miami hub.It also comes as airlines across the globe suffered from flight delays due to a ""network issue"" at a flight booking system run by Amadeus IT Group, according to Bloomberg.Southwest on Thursday said it expects third-quarter operating unit revenue, or an airline's revenue in relation to its overall flight capacity, to be flat to down 1%, compared with a forecast of down 1% to ""slightly up"" given earlier this month. Before that, the carrier expected a 1% gain in the key metric.The carrier said it had canceled roughly 5,000 flights through Sept. 27 due to the natural disasters. And it said it expects the disasters to cost around $100 million.The company now sees third-quarter operating unit up, excluding fuel, oil and other items, to rise in the 3%-4% range.Southwest also cited the ""current industry revenue environment"" in cutting its unit revenue guidance. Lower fares, combined with higher fuel costs, have prompted the industry to temper its outlook for unit revenue for the third quarter. United, in particular, has been engaged in an airfare battle with Spirit Airlines (SAVE) at some of United's largest hubs.IBD'S TAKE: With airline earnings season set to begin next month, buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Investors may have already priced in the impact of recent natural disasters. Southwest rose 0.5% to 56.17 in the stock market today, while United advanced 0.4%.

208,LUV,"Just when it looked like the Trump agenda might be getting back on track, Arizona Sen. John McCain may have done more damage than most people realize.In the coming week, Congress was expected to take one more shot at repealing ObamaCare as Republicans release a more detailed and unified vision of where tax reform is going.Now, after McCain's rejection of the last-ditch TrumpCare effort — the Graham-Cassidy bill — it looks like ObamaCare is here to stay and the path to tax reform just got a lot more treacherous.TrumpCare's demise could be bad news for the likes of Apple (AAPL), which would benefit from a low rate for repatriating its $260 billion in profits held overseas. Shares of Apple faltered in the past week amid light crowds for the iPhone 8. While few, if any, analysts think anything close to the 15% corporate tax rate Trump has eyed is feasible, tax reform still holds big potential rewards for companies like CVS Health (CVS) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) that pay high U.S. tax rates and earn most of their money domestically.Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass TrumpCare using a filibuster-proof budget reconciliation procedure that expires at the end of the fiscal year. In theory, Republicans could just start the process over in fiscal 2018, but that's seen as unlikely because the GOP can only use reconciliation once per fiscal year, and the 2018 budget resolution is needed to accommodate tax reform. Probably the fastest way to sink tax cuts would be to attach them to the political anchor known as ObamaCare repeal.So why does the death of TrumpCare matter if Republicans will aim to pass tax cuts by themselves?The answer has everything to do with budget aesthetics and the divide between GOP moderates and conservatives over appropriate spending levels.In that regard, consider how much of a difference it would have made to have a running start toward deficit reduction courtesy of TrumpCare. Independent estimates suggest that the latest bill from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy would have cut about $200 billion in federal health outlays from 2020-2026.On top of that, there's a Graham-Cassidy provision that left many wonks scratching their heads. Instead of continuing to gradually curb the health funds to states in place of ObamaCare, Graham-Cassidy would eliminate that funding starting in 2027, cutting spending by about $230 billion in that single year on top of nearly $50 billion in Medicaid cuts, according to Avalere Health.IBD'S TAKE: Despite a hawkish Federal Reserve and saber-rattling North Korea, the stock market has been enjoying a strong month, and IBD readers were ready. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.While no one sees such a sudden and drastic cut as credible, the appearance of such a reduction might take pressure off the GOP to find other spending cuts. Without those cuts, the risk is that it will look like Republicans, far from being fiscally disciplined, are blowing up the deficit and debt.The failure to repeal ObamaCare looks even more consequential for tax reform after President Trump and top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi agreed on a deal to keep the government funded and hike the debt ceiling through Dec. 8. Come December, it's hard to imagine that Democrats will agree to grease the skids for GOP tax cuts that are coming down the pike.The upshot is that Republicans, who have never been able to summon enough votes to keep the government operating without relying on Democrats, may have to do so to keep tax reform moving forward. After the deal between Trump and Democrats, Goldman Sachs downgraded the odds of a 2018 tax cut to 40%. Goldman cited the possibility that the next government funding deal will collide with tax reform, along with a hefty federal bill for hurricane recovery.RELATED:McCain Pulls Plug On GOP Health Bill; Insurers, Hospitals RallyTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks
"
209,LUV,"Just as President Trump's tax reform push was supposed to start getting serious, Republicans are setting their sights on a tax cut that looks way too be good true.Experts say that the bare bones plan details, which were leaked to news outlets over the weekend and largely confirmed by the White House on Monday, point to total tax cuts worth $5.5 trillion over 10 years. The framework includes a 20% corporate tax (down from 35%); a top individual tax rate of 35% (now 39.6%); a 25% rate for smaller firms and partnerships whose business income passes through the owners' individual tax return; and a doubling of the standard deduction.The wish list looks more than a little rich when compared to the $1.5 trillion in net tax cuts that Senate Republican negotiators agreed to target last week. The implication is that there are some $4 trillion worth of offsetting tax cuts, loophole closures and spending cuts that Republicans are ready to embrace at the same time.While conceivable, so far the only pay-for that seems like a reasonably safe bet for inclusion in the package is elimination of the tax deduction for state and local taxes, which could raise about $1.5 trillion over a decade. That would have a bigger impact on high-tax blue states such as California and New York.The upshot is that something — about $3 trillion worth of taxes — will have to give, either in tax cuts or offsets, which will slow and complicate the path to tax reform.Trump is set to head to Indiana on Wednesday to promote his tax plan, but financial markets were hardly bowled over on Monday by early reports, partly because so few details have been figured out. Passage, if it happens, seems likely to slide well into to 2018. Terry Haines, senior political strategist at Evercore ISI wrote Monday that chances of tax cuts going through are about 50%.The hopeful news for financial markets counting on a tax-driven boost to earnings is that cutting the corporate tax rate is a White House priority that it's reluctant to give ground on. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he still wants the statutory corporate rate cut to 15%, however unlikely.Trump also seems adamant about bringing back home a few trillion dollars' worth of U.S. corporate profits that have been held overseas to avoid paying tax. A bargain rate on repatriating foreign earnings could provide a windfall to companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which could use some of the cash for a share buyback.IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8. Popular features include exclusive stock lists, IBD Stock Checkup, which ranks the leaders in 197 industry groups based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance; and The Big Picture daily update of the underlying market trend. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green.  Shares of companies like CVS (CVS) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) that derive most of their income from within the U.S. also could be winners under tax reform. Homebuilders might be an exception. The National Association of Realtors has warned that killing the state & local tax deduction, while doubling the standard deduction (as both the House GOP and Trump have proposed), could sink home prices by 10%. Under this scenario, the Realtors group says that only about 5% of households would itemize, down from 30%, so the mortgage deduction would offer little incentive for buying a home vs. renting.Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last week that their base case for tax reform would result in a 25% corporate tax rate that's phased in over several years, along with only modest, temporary individual rate cuts. ""We continue to expect a modest deficit expansion that delivers little near-term stimulus,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Michael Zezas.Since Trump has been insisting his tax cuts will help the middle class, a slimmed-down package might end up scrapping tax cuts for higher-income households.The looming likely failure of ObamaCare repeal this week will further complicate the path to tax reform, noted Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Horizon Investments. That's because the GOP was counting on savings from cutting spending on health entitlements to help make the Republican fiscal program look more fiscally responsible. So far the GOP has been unable to implement any spending cuts under Trump, and the annual budget deficit is already projected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2027.RELATED:McCain Killed ObamaCare Repeal, Wounded Tax Reform In One BlowThese Are The Biggest Losers From Trump's Tax ReformTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

But airlines have signaled recently that unit revenue and pricing during Q3 wouldn't be as bad as once expected.Delta, which reported earnings last week, indicated further improvement on that front, with United and American raising their Q3 unit-revenue forecasts. And Spirit on Monday raised its Q3 unit-revenue forecast to a decrease of roughly 6.5%, better than earlier expectations of a 7.0%-8.5% drop. The carrier cited ""improving ticket and non-ticket yields"" and better-than-expected load factor.Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note dated Monday that United and Spirit are near ""some sort of an equilibrium"" but warned that industry airfares were likely ""too fragile"" to begin expecting a massive recovery.Estimates: Third-quarter EPS of $1.47, up 19%.

Eleven states have alleged that the company giant harmed competition by barring businesses who take AmEx from steering customers toward cards with lower merchant fees.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Estimates: Wall Street expects the equipment-rental company's Q3 EPS to increase 16% to $3.00, with revenue up 13% to $1.709 billion.Results: EPS of $3.25 on revenue of $1.77 billion.

211,LUV,"When professional racing pilot Kirby Chambliss is shooting across the sky, aiming to win a Red Bull Air Race in his Zivko Edge 540, there's just one thought crossing his mind: how to go fast and win.""I'm asked all the time, 'What do you think about when you're racing?' "" the 2004 and 2006 winner of the Red Bull Air Race World Series, which wrapped up in Indianapolis this past weekend, told IBD in an interview. ""Do you think about your family, your daughter? All I have time for is to think how to get from gate to gate in the least amount of time possible.""When you're maneuvering an acrobatic plane that can speed more than 225 miles an hour and do a 520-degree roll in less than 1 second (the F-16 fighter jet can only roll 240 degrees in the same time frame), Chambliss must indeed keep a clear head.When fractions of a second can decide who gets to stand on the medals podium, a champion must maintain 100% focus on the job at hand.Other keys to success as a racing pilot?The 57-year-old former test pilot at Zivko Aeronatics from Corpus Christi, Texas, who now lives on an airfield with his wife and daughter in Arizona, tries to focus on three tasks: fly very well, maintain a very good team, and have a great plane. He keeps risk at a minimum at all times.""I'm an adrenaline junkie, but everything is balanced with experience,"" said Chambliss, who has also put in 17,000 hours of flying time at Southwest Airlines (LUV) as a commercial pilot. ""We always have calculated out the risk. I don't go out and do dumb things.""Growth-minded investors need to think the same in order to make the same sort of strides in their own portfolios. Stay focused. Keep things simple. And never let your losing stocks run for long. Cut those losses short.As IBD's Investor's Corner column has taught over the years, focusing your stock buys on just a handful of the very best companies is one of the keys to real success in the stock market. Don't own 25 or 30 names. Never own more than six to eight names when the market is in a sound uptrend. When you're right, be right big.You might have several trading or investing accounts. It's totally fine if you want to generate income from dividend-paying stocks; that's the mission of The Income Investor column. You can find companies that have a better dividend yield than the S&P 500, have excellent earnings, and have to potential to climb substantially in price. Perhaps one of those accounts can be your ""Growth + Income"" engine.But after you've learned the IBD method of picking growth stocks, devote at least one account to those stocks that meet IBD's seven-point selection criteria. Use IBD's screens and features in the IBD Research section and Stock Lists to find those true game changers, not only in the market but in the economy. You want only those companies that have double- or triple-digit increases in earnings and sales, the best return on equity and profit margins in the industry, and products and services that are truly transforming business and our way of life.Finally, expect to make mistakes. Losses are a part of the investing game.""Sometimes it's very frustrating,"" Chambliss said, referring to times when he will invest money in trying to improve his aircraft in the hopes of getting more speed and efficiency out of his aircraft. ""You find out that instead of getting it a knot faster, it's a knot slower. You just spent $50,000, but you have to throw it in the garbage.""In San Diego, racers performed two laps over the bay on a course featuring 15 gates, including a tight 180-degree turn at one end and a ""Vertical Turning Maneuver"" on the other end. Tight narrow spaces, or chicanes, demand extreme concentration, skill, and knowledge of one's plane.Although the track may look simple, ""it means the pilots will have to fly it absolutely perfectly if they are to win. One small mistake will see them out of the running,"" race director Steve Jones said as quoted in a story at RedBullAirRace.com. Coastal fog and changing winds will also challenge every pilot.In the stock market, things are no different. Market conditions continually change. One week, the major indexes appear to be gliding higher. The next week, they get pounded by a barrage of heavy institutional selling. So let the daily Big Picture column and the accompanying Market Pulse table give you a reading on the market skies every day. Only invest aggressively when there are few clouds and skies, and you see excellent breakout opportunities from true market leaders.(Editor's Note: A version of this article originally published on April 13 this year. Chambliss finished fourth overall in the 2017 standings following the final race of the season last weekend in Indianapolis. Congratulations to Chambliss and to Yoshihide Muroya, who captured first place in the final standings with three victories, including one in San Diego and one at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.)RELATED:How To Find Great Stocks: Begin HereHow To Invest: The Most Important Rule In StocksHow To Gain An Edge On Wall Street: Learning How To Spot The Market BottomHow To Invest: Did You Miss Nvidia's Big Run In 2016?

AT&T actually lost 390,000 pay-TV customers, but added 300,000 internet video subscribers, partially offsetting the loss. UBS estimated that the pay-TV industry will lose about 1 million subscribers in the third quarter compared with 325,000 in the same quarter last year. It's a worry for media companies because they garner per-subscriber programming fees.AT&T tumbled 7.5% to 35.70, dropping below the ""collar"" in its proposed acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX).

SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (XME), featured in Tuesday's picks, rose nearly 1%. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) each rose 0.6%. Component stocks Applied Materials (AMAT) and Nvidia (NVDA) gained about 1% apiece.Retail, banks and biotechs underperformed. SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) fell 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. Both are holding above their 200-day moving average lines. SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) lost 1.5% and was seeking support at its 50-day line.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) sank 5%, sliding further below its 50-day line. The volatile ETF, which offers exposure to the price movement of Bitcoin, is 40% off its recent high but still up more than 400% this year.While many U.S. diversified stock funds are extended from recent buy points, two niche plays that hold American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) may be getting close to potential breakouts.U.S. Global Jets (JETS) is shaping the right side of a shallow cup-shaped base. The ideal buy point would be 32.93, or a dime above the left-side high, unless shares pause to form a handle. In that case, the buy point would become the high of the handle, plus 10 cents. JETS soared 11% after a May breakout from a cup with handle to the start of the current base in mid-July.The ETF's shares gapped up 2% Tuesday, boosted by component stock American Airlines and United Continental (UAL), which surged 5% each. The carriers' Q3 unit revenue forecasts were better than expected.JETS, which launched in April 2015, has attracted $115.4 million in assets. It tracks the U.S. Global Jet Index and offers exposure to airline operators and manufacturers around the world. Its top holdings as of Oct. 9 were Delta Air Lines, American, United and Southwest Airlines (LUV), at roughly 12% apiece.

215,LUV,"As carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) engage in a price war, forecasts for unit revenue improvement in the fourth quarter now look too optimistic, according to JPMorgan analysts.XThe firm downgraded the two airlines, along with American Airlines (AAL), to neutral from over weight. JPMorgan also slashed price targets on United to 68 from 84, on American to 53 from 61, on Spirit to 37 from 45 and on Delta Air Lines (DAL) to 67 from 71.Bottom lines will take big hits too, and JPMorgan sees United earning just 64 cents a share in Q4 and Spirit earning just 34 cents a share, according to Benzinga. That compares to consensus EPS estimates of $1.34 for United and 57 cents for Spirit.Airlines have the ability to boost pricing domestically, but that isn't happening yet, JPMorgan noted, adding that higher fuel costs are also weighing on results.Shares of United closed down 2.4% at 59.80 on the stock market today. Spirit fell 3.3% to 33.69, American dipped 0.4% to 46.00, and Delta finished virtually unchanged at 48.25.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (LUV), which was upgraded to overweight and had its price target hiked to 66 from 60, rose 0.7% to 54.72, with JPMorgan saying the discount carrier has a better valuation and risk-reward profile than its rivals. Alaska Air (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU) also received price target hikes.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The major airlines have lowered Q3 unit revenue forecasts in recent weeks, with hurricanes Harvey and Irma adding to the downward pressure. On Tuesday, American cut its Q3 unit revenue outlook to flat to up 1%, compared to an earlier forecast of up 0.5%-2.5%.Last week, United acknowledged the impact the price war is having but vowed to continue offering low fares to compete in key markets, despite the short-term pain.""We don't like where the fare structures are right now. And we don't like the effect it has on short-term earnings,"" CFO Andrew Levy said at a conference. ""It is painful, difficult, but we're going to see it through.""United is also scaling back its ""basic economy"" fares, which were meant to compete with low-cost carriers head-on, in some markets.RELATED:United To Scale Back Basic Economy Amid Price War With Low-Cost RivalsDelta Cuts Revenue, Margin Targets As Airline Competition Heats UpAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

Video of the incident showed Dao with his face bloodied, and an attorney representing him said he had broken his nose, lost two front teeth and suffered a concussion.United shares closed down 0.9% at 70.70 in the stock market today, near session highs. Airline shares in general were lower on Thursday, with American Airlines' (AAL) proposed pay raise to pilots and flight attendants raising concerns about costs.The dragging incident was a learning experience for many travelers, who didn't know they could be involuntarily denied boarding to accommodate crew who might need to board, as was the case that led Chicago aviation security to remove Dao from the flight.Dao's removal also raised questions about overbooking, which airlines use to keep flights tight and sales high. And it renewed the sense that many air travelers have that unless you have the money for first-class, you'll end up peppered with extra fees and relegated to claustrophobic conditions.In United's review, the carrier noted that its procedure for involuntary boarding denials is automated, and that customers ""with the lowest paid fare are placed at the top of the list for involuntary denial of boarding.""Flight 3411 was overbooked by one passenger, United said, after earlier saying the flight was sold out. The dispute began after United tried to offer an $800 travel credit and other accommodations to persuade four passengers to get off the plane, with no luck, the review said. Earlier attempts, pre-boarding, were also unsuccessful, and United resorted to the involuntary boarding denial selection.United, in the review, said it did not offer enough to those passengers, and that agents ""did not have the authority to act independently and authorize higher levels of compensation or provide other modes of transportation and/or the right destination options.""In response, United said that effective Friday, it would raise its payout ceiling for travelers bumped from flights to $10,000. That followed a similar move by Delta Air Lines (DAL) after the incident.The company, which promised the review of the incident by April 30 after it drew worldwide anger, also said it would reduce overbookings.United said ""adjustments have been made to reduce overbookings on flights that historically have experienced lower volunteer rates, particularly flights on smaller aircraft and the last flights of the day to a particular destination.""Among the other changes United outlined the carrier said it would restrict use of law enforcement ""to safety and security issues only"" and not make passengers involuntarily give up their seat unless it posed a risk to security and safety. The carrier also said it would ""ensure crews are booked onto a flight at least 60 minutes prior to departure."" Those policies are already in place.Employees would also get more training and flexibility to resolve issues with passengers, United said. An app for employees that the company will make available this year is intended to help staff compensate passengers more easily when problems arise.The company also committed to creating a customer relations team — expected to be up and running by June — to help gate agents look at other options if flights are packed. Those could include using other airlines, nearby airports and even ground transit, United said.United also said it would develop an automated system to seek out people willing to change flights. That system, set to be introduced later this year, will have a new automated check-in process that will assess a person's willingness to deplane, for compensation, on overbooked flights.The carrier said there were 3,765 involuntary denied boarding incidents last year. The rate of such denials was down 44% from 2015 and below the average of airlines that report statistics to the Department of Transportation.United tends to overbook flights by ""less than 0-3 percent of the plane's seat capacity,"" it said. Roughly four percent of flights have more customers than seats.Delta retreated 1.3%, while American sank 5.1%. Southwest (LUV), which reported earnings today, lost 2%.

218,LUV,"While notable hedge fund firms such as David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, Dan Loeb's Third Point and David Tepper's Appaloosa Management trimmed or exited their Apple (AAPL) stake in the first quarter, one famously skittish tech investor made a massive grab for the iPhone maker — and reaped impressive returns.Here are some of the best and worst calls in Q1 by high-profile investors and hedge funds, as disclosed by their latest 13F filings. Rank-and-file investors closely track this regulatory data to get a sense of where the ""smart money"" is being put to work in the stock market.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) loaded up on Apple in the first quarter, swelling its stake in the tech titan by more than 125% vs. the previous quarter to a total of 129.4 million shares. Shares of Apple have continued to sizzle in the second quarter of 2017, adding 8.8% through May 15 to take year-to-date gains to 35.5%.By comparison, the S&P 500 has gained roughly 2% so far in Q2 and 8% year to date, while the Dow Jones industrial average is up roughly 2% and 7% over the respective periods. And that's with Apple as the biggest weighting in both indexes.Buffett described Apple's resonance with customers as ""amazing"" in a recent CNBC interview. He also said Berkshire used its knowledge of the furniture business to evaluate Apple's worth and its edge over rivals.Apple shares edged down 0.15% to 155.47, their straight modest decline.Another move that paid off for Buffett, who is known to prize more established companies with an ""economic moat"" or durable competitive advantage: avoiding the flash and dazzle of one hot IPO.Snapchat owner Snap (SNAP) was snubbed by Buffett but scooped up by Third Point, Appaloosa and George Soros' Soros Fund Management, to their cost. Snap stock has lost 8% in Q2 and sits 17% below its closing price of 24.48 on March 2, when it made its highly anticipated stock market debut.Still, the hedge funds snapping up the stock may view it as an investment with solid long-term potential.Snap rose 0.1% to 20.76 after big gains the prior two sessions from last Thursday's post-IPO lows.In one of its biggest and best Q1 moves, Soros hiked its position in Facebook (FB) by more than 80% last quarter. The social networking leader has advanced 6% in the second quarter to date, building on a win streak that has seen the stock climb by more than 30% year to date.Soros Fund Management also upped its Goldman Sachs (GS) position by about 40% to 86,000 shares, with less luck.Goldman Sachs has slid a further 2% since the start of April, taking 2017's losses to nearly 6%. The S&P financial sector is flat so far in Q2 and up a mere 2.5% year to date, lagging the broad S&P 500.Soros' hedge fund may be buying the dip in financial stocks, anticipating a resumption in their five-year rally should improving economic conditions keep the Fed's tightening plans on pace.Facebook fell 0.3% to 149.78 as it consolidates tightly. Goldman rose 02.% to 225.60, still below its 50-day line.In Q1, Berkshire offloaded shares of International Business Machines (IBM), the seventh largest Dow component, and 21st Century Fox (FOX), which has been hit hard by scandals, in a big way.Dumping those stocks has buoyed Berkshire's investment portfolio. Shares of both companies are well off their recent 52-week highs. So far in Q2, IBM has tumbled 12% and Fox 13%, extending their hobbled run year to date.IBM rose 1.4%, adding to Monday's gains after tumbling sharply. Fox slid 1.4% extending its sell-off.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) stakes significantly, maintained a position in United Airlines (UAL) and pared back Delta Air Lines (DAL).Those have been smart moves overall. Airline stocks have soared since the end of March despite adverse publicity, with some firms reporting that traffic growth has outpaced capacity increases.American and United are more than 10% higher in Q2; Southwest and Delta are up nearly 8%.United rose 1.4%, still in buy range. Southwest climbed 0.4% and American 0.6%, just below entry points. Delta was flat.Appaloosa's huge bet on an American industrial renaissance in Q1 hasn't paid off so far, but that could change. Most analysts remain bullish on the outlook for the industrials and materials sectors. Infrastructure spending under President Trump and China's One Road, One Belt project are two potential catalysts for companies in these sectors, including steel stocks.In Q2 so far, AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE) — Appaloosa's new buys from last quarter — are both in the red, down roughly 21% and 4% respectively. ArcelorMittal (MT), a position in the hedge fund that grew more than 400% in size, has given up 10% over the same period.AK Steel fell 0.5%, Nucor rose 0.3% on Tuesday. ArcelorMittal climbed 2.7%.In Q1, Third Point opened stakes in Parsley Energy (PE), Halcon Resources (HK) and Enerplus (ERF). The hedge fund may be of the view that the energy sector is oversold and could be due for a bounce in the medium term. Sector earnings and oil prices are highly correlated — and West Texas crude prices averaged $52 a barrel in the first quarter, up more than 50% year over year, following an OPEC-led deal on output cuts.In the near term, however, oil prices and energy stocks have been under pressure.Halcon has given up nearly 12% in the second quarter, extending 2017 losses to 27%. Parsely and Enerplus haven't fared much better this quarter, down 0.8% and up 0.8% respectively.Parsley sank 1.3%, Halcon 3.7% and Enerplus 0.5% on Tuesday.RELATED:Buffett's Berkshire Stays Away From Snap, But Not These FundsBuffett, Soros Moves Keep Delta, American In Holding PatternWhat Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now
"
219,LUV,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) hiked its stake in Apple (AAPL) by more than 125% to 129.4 million shares in the first quarter, and made modest changes to its airlines holdings while avoiding Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), which went public in March.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management bought 1.7 million shares of Snap, joining David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Dan Loeb's Third Point. Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

220,LUV,"When Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) CEO Warren Buffett loaded up on airline stocks last year, he reportedly did so because years of mergers consolidated the industry into a handful of large carriers that kept a lid on competition for passengers and made business more stable.But as Thursday's market freakout over American Airlines' (AAL) higher labor costs shows, airlines still have to battle each other aggressively on employee pay and costs, even as the ""wide moat"" that drew Buffett to the sector protects the carriers from new entrants.What's more, airlines still remain competitive on adding seats and flights to different parts of the world. American in January suggested that it might ratchet up domestic flight capacity, and United defended its own growth plans. Moves like that, as they have over the past two years, threaten to raise investors' stress about more competition and fare discounts that erode profits and returns.American late Wednesday said it wants the pay of its pilots and flight attendants to equal that of rival carriers. Wall Street got mad Thursday, and shares closed down 5.2% on the stock market today, after sinking as much as 8.6% earlier.Southwest (LUV) added to worries about higher expenses in the airline sector when it reported Q1 earnings that missed forecasts, with costs weighing there too. Shares fell 2.1%.Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 1.4,% and United Airlines (UAL) dipped 0.9%. JetBlue (JBLU) edged 0.5% lower, and Alaska Air Group (ALK) sank 3.8%, while Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose 0.1%. Berkshire Hathaway shares dropped 0.6%American said the higher pay would raise costs by some $230 million this year — hitting EPS as much as 35 cents per share, Cowen analysts said — and $350 million for next year and 2019, which could impact EPS by up to 50 cents.In a statement Wednesday, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said the proposed midcontract pay raises follow a commitment after its merger to compensate staff on the same level as its rivals.""But as our industry has rapidly evolved and pay increases at other airlines have accelerated, some of our colleagues have fallen behind their peers at other airlines in base pay rates,"" the statement said. ""And, unless their current contracts are modified, they'll remain far behind for more than two years.""But the potential pay hike worried some analysts.""We are troubled by AAL's wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note quoted by Reuters. ""In addition to raising fixed costs, American's agreement with its labor stakeholders establishes a worrying precedent, in our view, both for American and the industry.""Pilots and flight attendants ratified new five-year contracts in 2014 and 2015, ahead of pay raises at American's two biggest rivals. However, the statement added that currently, pilot hourly pay rates were roughly 8% lower than the industry's best, while rates for flight attendants were around 4% lower. The pressure from labor groups has been building.""While the move is a drag on earnings, it likely removes an overhang on the shares,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in a research note.The proposal needs union approval, and management said ""we do not expect disagreement."" Other analysts, however, expressed caution about the response from workers.""We believe there is some risk that they think they should be paid more than Delta and United employees,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""Giving pay increases out of negotiations is risky and could backfire.""Southwest, meanwhile, said it expected unit costs, excluding fuel and other items, to rise around 6% in Q2, based on current cost patterns.In Q1, Southwest said costs rose ""due to the significant snap up in wage rates"" following its own new contract for flight attendants and pilots that took hold in Q4. Costs were also up due to the preparation of a new reservation system.EPS during the quarter fell 31% to 61 cents, after industry profits were padded a year ago by cheap fuel prices, missing estimates for 63 cents. Revenue slipped 1% to $4.883 billion, missing views of $4.92 billion.Still, Southwest forecast positive unit revenue, or sales as they relate to an airline's flight capacity, in Q2.As for American, its quarterly results and forecast on Thursday remained solid despite the potential extra labor costs and sees Q2 unit revenue rising 3%-5%, reflecting better demand in corporate and leisure travel. Adjusted pretax margins in Q2 are expected to come in at 11%-13%.Q1 EPS plunged 51% to 61 cents, after cheap fuel padded profits a year earlier. Those results topped estimates for 57 cents. Revenue ticked up 2% to $9.624 billion, just shy of expectations for $9.629 billion.The company said that results so far in its Basic Economy fare class were ""encouraging.""""Approximately 50% of customers who are presented with a choice for Basic Economy end up choosing a Main Cabin fare, showing that they understand their options and are choosing the ticket that's the right fit for their travel,"" Isom said in a statement.Meanwhile, United said it would raise its payout ceiling for travelers bumped from flights to $10,000 after one such passenger was dragged from a plane earlier this month. The company, which promised a review of that incident by April 30, after it drew worldwide anger, also said it would reduce overbookings, among a series of other policy changes.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

221,LUV,"For the past two years, airline executives have done their share of groveling before analysts, vowing to be more humble in their ambitions to control the skies so as not to deluge the market with additional service when demand isn't there.Not so on Tuesday with United Airlines (UAL).President Scott Kirby gave a more impassioned defense of the company's growth plans — or, in industry speak, ""capacity"" — than has been normal for earnings conference calls since 2015. During that year, cheap oil enticed airlines to broaden their flight coverage a bit more than Wall Street was comfortable with.""You guys used to get on this earnings call and beat them up about why aren't their finances good,"" Kirby said on United's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. ""And you gave them a cure for that, which was 'Cut capacity, cut capacity, cut capacity.' And it just made the problem worse.""That remark came in response to a question about how United's growth plans might impact margins. United has said it wants to boost margins by gaining or reclaiming market share. However, management stressed that it didn't view their capacity growth — expected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% this year — as invading a rival's turf but reclaiming what was United's ""natural"" share.""Despite taking the same medicine quarter after quarter and the numbers got worse and worse and worse — that was part of the problem,"" Kirby continued. ""When the airline was cutting capacity and taking regional jets out of places ... like Rochester, Minnesota, and redeploying them in places like Newark and Atlanta, in order to keep capacity low — that was driving margins lower.""United did not provide a clear timeline as to when such ""natural"" share might be fully reclaimed. But any attempt to expand could result in attempts by rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) to match it.That means more expansion and lower fares to lure consumers. That's better for travelers, but not so much for investors because it hurts financial results. Investors appeared to be reacting to that possibility.Shares of United finished down 4.3% on the stock market today, while Delta edged up 0.1%, American fell 1%, and Southwest lost 0.55%.In a research note, Cowen analyst Helane Becker noted that United's capacity plans are not new. She also said there has been ""very little competitive response"" to United's capacity moves, beyond those from American in Chicago.United has in recent months advanced into smaller cities in an attempt to reclaim customers lost to rivals. Other remarks made during the call indicated a strategy that held off selling tickets for some seats until it was closer to departure time.""In the past, we forced many of our best customers to fly on our competitors, because we were sold out,"" management said earlier in the call.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

222,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) would not say on Tuesday whether it would end the involuntary bumping of passengers from flights following widespread outrage after security last Sunday dragged one such passenger from a sold-out Louisville-bound flight.Calling that incident the product of flaws within the company's entire system, CEO Oscar Munoz also said he hadn't considered firing any employee afterward. The forceful removal of the passenger, David Dao, has raised questions about the way airlines book flights amid pressure from Wall Street to squeeze more profits out of passengers.The remarks came during United's first-quarter earnings call, one in which executives repeated that the carrier needed to do better following the incident. The carrier has promised the present the results of a review by April 30.But as calls grow for tighter regulations on the overbooking practices airlines use to ensure packed planes, United has forecast higher flight-capacity growth for the year than Delta Air Lines (DAL), which has capped its own growth plans.Analysts during the call questioned management about the impact United's plans to add service, particularly in smaller cities, would have on margins.United tried to emphasize that its growth plans weren't intended to invade a rival's market but were more about reclaiming United's ""natural market share"" and ""restoring United to where it should have been."" But the carrier was unable to offer a clear timeline as to when it might fully reclaim that share, which would give investors a clearer picture of when fundamentals might improve.Shares sank 4.3% to 67.75 in the stock market today. Delta, which issued earnings last week, rose 0.1%, while American Airlines (AAL) sank about 1%.United in a slide presentation also said that the carrier ""now has more seats available for close in business traffic."" Moves to keep more seats open, management said, have helped the carrier reclaim customers.United on Monday reported first-quarter results that topped views, and it forecast positive unit revenue for the second quarter — the first time in two years. The company, in its earnings release, said it was ""obvious from recent experiences that we need to do a much better job serving our customers.""U.S. and state politicians have called for halting airlines' overbooking practices and legislation that prevents the forceful removal of passengers due to overbooking or crew accommodations.United, in response to the incident, has said it would ""not ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers from our flights unless it is a matter of safety and security."" The carrier's crew members must also book ""must-ride"" flights at least an hour before takeoff.The potential financial fallout from the United incident is unclear. United, along with Delta and American, dominate much of the U.S.' airspace, and the barrier of entry for new competition in the airline industry is high.""This fiasco where a man was dragged off a UAL plane is a classic media-driven overreaction, in our view,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote in a research note dated Friday. ""While truly a bad situation that (1) shouldn't have happened and (2) UAL handled badly afterward, we expect it will blow over. These things usually do. But we do believe policy changes are likely.""Delta has raised the ceiling on how much it will pay passengers to get off planes. And on its earnings call last week, Delta cited statistics it said showed that it managed overbookings and so-called involuntary denied boardings better than rivals. Overbooking, management said, was a ""valid business process,"" but stressed the importance of handling it the right way.United on Tuesday said that its corporate accounts were still ""supportive"" and ""want us to fix this."" But the company said it was too early to gauge the impact on leisure travel or demand in China, where some on social media said Dao's removal was racist because he was Asian.Munoz said he had spoken with and would continue to speak with Chinese officials about the matter on a trip to China he had previously planned.IBD'S TAKE: For more about what U.S. airlines are doing to compete with a new type of low-cost, long-haul carrier, read this story. Cascend Securities Chief Strategist told MarketWatch that he did ""expect to see a purchase decline of some level for tickets but the data doesn't imply how bad it could or could not be.""Keay said he expected that United would end involuntary denied boardings. And he added that if United paid $3,000 each to the 3,765 passengers that were involuntarily denied boarding last year, it would have hit United's earnings per share by 0.3%.He likened United's PR difficulties to a situation in 2012, when Spirit Airlines (SAVE) initially declined to refund a Marine veteran, Jerry Meekins, who had said he found out his cancer was terminal shortly after the purchase.After Meekins' doctors told him he shouldn't fly, he tried, unsuccessfully, to get a refund from Spirit. Spirit's CEO defended the airline's decision, arguing that the man hadn't paid extra for insurance. But he later said he would personally refund Meekins after criticism escalated.""It was a PR disaster"" Keay wrote, "" … until people forgot about it.""Spirit Airlines, which released March traffic data late Monday, rose 4.4%. Southwest (LUV) fell 0.55%.RELATED:Delta, American Eye Trans-Pacific Market As Trans-Atlantic Rivals GrowLufthansa, AirAsia Escalate Low-Cost Challenge To Delta, American

223,LUV,"X Shares of IBM lurched 2.5% lower early Friday amid news that Warren Buffett has been dumping the tech giant in 2017. Investors digested the news ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) annual meeting, a day when the Berkshire CEO answers shareholders' questions.Late Friday, Berkshire reported Q1 net earnings dropped 27% to $4.14 billion as insurance losses and adjustments soared 146%, but revenue climbed 25% to $65.19 billion. Insurance premiums earned nearly doubled to $21.75 billion, and railroad, utilities and energy revenue grew 6.3% to $9.4 billion.Among the potential topics that billionaire investor could address are his reasons for selling IBM (IBM), Apple's (AAPL) rising dividends, turbulence in the airline industry and a merger snub for one of his top stocks.Buffett has sold a third of his stake in the tech giant over the first and second quarters, considerably trimming his 81 million shares as of December 2016, CNBC reported.""IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too,"" he said in an interview, adding IBM stock had not performed in line with his expectations.The iPhone maker is a sure bet for the spotlight at Saturday's meeting.Buffett doubled his stake in Apple at the start of this year, owning $17 billion of the stock as of February. He disclosed a position in Apple in 2016 after sitting out the tech giant's hot growth streak over the past decade. He attributed the change of heart to Apple's ""enormously useful product"" and intelligent deployment of capital.Buffett's ""invest in what you know"" principle made him a big buyer of the best high-dividend stocks such as Verizon (VZ), General Motors (GM), IBM (IBM) and Coca-Cola (KO). He likes financially sound companies with a durable competitive advantage that reward shareholders. Dividends can be a sign of a quality company.Apple's hefty dividend hike may make the stock more attractive for Buffett, though he said in February that Apple stock was ""at a price different than I would buy it now.""Apple shares rose 0.6% to 147.38 in morning trade on the stock market today. The stock fell fractionally Wednesday and Thursday after reporting tepid revenue and iPhone sales for the second fiscal quarter but significantly raising its dividend and buyback.Berkshire Hathaway has also been upping its stake in airline stocks — another big change of heart. He is reported to have owned more than 7% of the total common stock of each of Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) as of February.With airlines executives in congressional crosshairs after a spate of disturbing passenger-related incidents, Buffett may be grilled himself on his airline positions.Other headwinds for airline stocks include high labor costs, increased competition and discounted fares that cut into profits.Still, all four of the big U.S. carriers have moved back above their 50-day moving averages.If Buffett stays true to form, investors can expect some frank discussion of Kraft Heinz's (KHC) failed $143 billion merger bid for Unilever (UN) and what other steps Kraft may do to revive growth.Berkshire is one of the largest stakeholders in the $108 billion company behind beloved household names such as Jell-O and Kool-Aid.After Wednesday's market close, Kraft Heinz reported earnings per share and revenue below Wall Street views. EPS climbed 15% to 84 cents a share while sales dipped 3% to $6.36 billion. Analysts had expect EPS of 85 cents and sales of $6.462 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Sales have fallen for four of the last five quarters, while there may be limits to Kraft's aggressive cost-cutting measures under Berkshire and co-lead investor 3G.Kraft shares fell sharply intraday Thursday, but closed up 0.6%. The stock dipped 0.1% Friday morning.In previous annual meetings, Buffett has weighed in on Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) flawed business model, defended his sizable stake in Coca-Cola, and knocked hedge fund managers (between playing ping-pong with a giant paddle and doing a ukulele singalong).RELATED:Apple Investors Find Comfort In 10.5% Dividend HikeLawmakers Grill United CEO Munoz

Large-cap growth stock mutual funds led the way, notching a 2.65% gain on average.World equity funds did even better in April rising 2.54%.

""Going back to the fourth quarter, there was a lot of enthusiasm for potential policies (that would help stocks) when Trump and a Republican majority in Congress were elected,"" said Brian Flanagan, lead manager of $1.6 billion Thrivent Mid Cap Stock Fund (AASCX). ""Then reality set in when investors saw how hard it might be for some policies to get enacted.""Flanagan's fund is an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner for 2017, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.In addition, early April's market was still weighed down by March's disappointing jobs report and weak retail sales, said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.The stock market perked up as corporate earnings reports topped expectations, said Bernie Horn, a manager of $418 million Polaris Global Value (PGVFX), another IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner by virtue of having topped the MSCI EAFE over the past one, three, five and 10 years.In addition, steady if modest economic growth in Asia and Europe began to hearten investors, Horn said.Global science/technology funds led all sector categories, climbing 3.78% in April.World equity funds gained 2.54% on average, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. European region funds rose 4.04%, pacing world equity categories.Taxable bond mutual funds edged ahead 0.75% on average, with Treasury funds up 1.04% and world income funds up 1.11%.Earnings surprises were a key to the late April rally. ""In the small-cap space, there were a lot of upward earnings forecast revisions, especially in technology, telecom and materials,"" said Vincent Costa, co-manager of $322 million Voya Index Plus SmallCap (IPSIX), also an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner.Still, several stock mutual fund managers expect more volatility ahead. ""There will be more volatility in the second half of the year,"" Costa said. ""When the Trump agenda gets announced and we have more clarity on what will come down — and what might not — we'll see more volatility. And any disappointments in earnings will fuel volatility.""Polaris' Horn says the U.S. economy appears to be ramping up after years of stagnation. ""We had eight years of a zombie economy — no real signs of life,"" he said. ""That's changing. We've seen reductions in capacity in areas such as China just as demand has picked up. This is especially helpful to the materials sector.""Horn likes BASF (BASFY). ""The big German chemical company is starting to see some increases in volumes and pricing, especially in China and Asia,"" Horn said. ""It adds to their ability to generate strong cash flows, which will support higher valuations.""Methanex (MEOH) is another materials stock he likes. The Canadian company makes methanol, which is used in the manufacturing of a variety of materials. ""They're the largest methanol producer in the world, and they're seeing a lot of increase in demand from China,"" Horn said.The stock's recent slump reflects the repair closure of a key manufacturing facility in China. ""That is not a long-term problem,"" Horn said.Praxair (PX) is another materials stock favored by Horn. ""This is another early-economic cycle company with broad exposure to many industries,"" Horn said. Earnings per share grew 7% in the first quarter, the first report of positive growth after eight straight quarters of decline. ""This shows that underlying industrial production in all parts of the economy is getting better.""Like Horn's view on materials, Nuveen's Chalupnik sees an improving outlook for industrials. Industrials sector funds gained 1.99% in April.Chalupnik cites Tennessee-based NN (NNBR), which makes bearing components for the automotive, electrical, agricultural and other industries.Chalupnik oversees the team that runs $1.4 billion Nuveen Small Value (FSCCX), another IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner.""NN makes precision parts that help cars, for example, improve fuel economy,"" Chalupnik said. ""They've diversified into aerospace, rail, industrial and medical markets. They benefit from U.S. and global growth. Their free cash flow generation is increasing, which they're using to pay down debt.""Airlines are an industrials segment that Thrivent's Flanagan likes because they added capacity but have done it to create new segments of low-cost no-frills seats. ""These basic economy fares let them compete with ultra-low-cost airlines,"" he said.He cites Southwest Airlines (LUV). ""Many investors were worried about them increasing capacity, but they've done it in a disciplined manner,"" he said. ""Capacity will peak this year. That, combined with a new reservations system, should let them maximize revenue per available seat mile.""Voya's Costa remains bullish on banks and outsourcing and consulting within information technology services. In health care, his fund is looking for companies that stand to gain from a rollback or repeal of ObamaCare.Costa and his colleagues expect rising interest rates to further boost banks' net interest margins. Banks accounted for the fund's three biggest holdings as of March 31. Sporting IBD's SMR Rating of A, the banks are Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI), Sterling Bancorp (STL) and Evercore Partners (EVR). Great Western Bancorp (GWB) was the fund's 10th-largest holding and also has an A SMR Rating.IBD's TAKE: SMR is a proprietary rating pioneered by IBD to help investors identify companies with superior Sales Growth, Profit Margins, and Return on Equity ratios. You can learn more about how to use SMR here at IBD's website.EPlus (PLUS) is one of Costa's smaller holdings. But the provider of IT management products, services and software has a 19% three-year annual earnings growth rate. Shares were up 24% this year through April 30.Flanagan also expects banks, especially regional ones, to continue to benefit from a warming U.S. economy and lighter regulatory burden. Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY) is one. It acquired First Niagara Financial Group last year. ""Investors are seeing synergy savings that are higher than were expected,"" Flanagan said. ""They should also benefit from net interest margin expansion as interest rates rise. And they're starting to see loan growth. Plus, their valuation is lower than their peers' on average.""Flanagan also likes the outlook for information technology stocks. His fund holds Applied Materials (AMAT), a leading semiconductor equipment and software maker. ""They're benefiting from the increased complexity of semiconductor manufacturing,"" Flanagan said. ""OLED screens"" — which use organic light emitting diode technology — ""are rumored to be coming on the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 8."" That should be an additional tailwind for Applied, Flanagan says.RELATED:Managers Seek Sturdy Stocks Amid Expected Rise In Volatility

226,LUV,"Goldman Sachs has been firmly in the tax-cuts-are-coming column — until now.The combination of a hefty federal bill for hurricane recovery and, now, a looming fight over raising the debt ceiling that could collide with tax reform have shifted the odds slightly against it, the Wall Street powerhouse says.XGoldman, which has two former partners running the White House's tax-reform push in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, downgraded the odds of a 2018 tax cut to 40% on Wednesday, following President Trump's deal with Democrats for a 3-month debt-ceiling hike and government-funding extension through Dec. 15.Republican leaders in Congress had been pushing Democrats to agree to an 18-month debt-ceiling hike, pushing the next deadline beyond the 2018 election, or — at worst — a 6-month deal, which would have provided a feasible window for passing tax legislation.The 3-month timeline, by contrast, risks setting up Democrats to use those must-pass bills as leverage to try and frustrate any efforts to pass any tax cuts for wealthy Americans.GOP majorities in both the House and Senate give them the ability to raise the debt ceiling, fund the government and pass tax cuts without help from Democrats. That's why there's still no small chance tax cuts will be forthcoming. Yet, in practice, Republicans haven't been able to bridge the wide disagreement between moderates and conservatives over federal spending levels.Trump hit the road to North Dakota on Wednesday to stump for his virtually detail-free tax plan. Few, if any, analysts think anything close to the 15% corporate tax rate Trump is still eyeing is feasible, but tax reform still holds big potential rewards for the likes of Apple (AAPL), which could benefit from a low rate for repatriating its $260 billion in profits held overseas. Meanwhile, companies like CVS Health (CVS) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) that pay high U.S. tax rates and earn most of their money domestically, also stand to be big winners.IBD'S TAKE: Despite dimming hopes for tax cuts and North Korea's increasingly dangerous signals, the stock market remains in an uptrend. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Even before Trump stunned Republicans by siding with ""Chuck and Nancy"" — Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in the Senate and House — Goldman had lowered tax-cut odds to roughly 50-50.""Harvey has made tax reform slightly more difficult,"" Goldman noted, with hurricane relief expected to add upward of $100 billion in red ink — excluding the cost of Hurricane Irma.Further widening the deficit in the near term may lead conservatives to insist upon deeper spending cuts to offset the cost of reform than moderate Republicans can stomach. Moderates have already been pushing back against plans to package $200 billion in spending cuts over 10-years along with tax cuts.As it is, the Congressional Budget Office already expects the annual federal budget deficit to widen to $1.5 trillion by 2027.The particulars of tax reform could sow further dissension within the GOP ranks if, as expected, the effort targets the state and local tax deduction that disproportionately helps relatively wealthy blue states.One wild card is the outcome of the GOP bid to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which could spring back to life. If Republicans can snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat, that could give renewed momentum to the wider Trump agenda, but the clock is ticking fast. The budget resolution that allows the GOP to pass health care legislation with just 51 votes in the Senate is set to expire on Sept. 30.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksMarkets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanThese Are The Biggest Losers From Trump's Tax Reform

227,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) cut its passenger unit revenue and margin outlook for the third quarter, as Hurricane Harvey contributed to challenges during the period, but the carrier said later on Wednesday that a price war with low-cost rivals is also having an impact.XPassenger unit revenue, or PRASM, is now expected to decline 3%-5% vs. prior guidance for a 1% fall to 1% rise. Pretax margin is now seen at 8%-10%, down from 12.5%-14.5%. United sees capacity growth falling to 3%-3.5%, down from around 4%.Harvey caused operations to halt at George Bush Intercontinental Airport for four days, causing over 7,400 flights to be canceled, said the company. United also cited geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula, pricing issues and higher fuel costs as weighing on the quarter.Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said at a Cowen & Co. conference in Boston that United will continue offering low fares to compete in key markets, despite the short-term pain.""We don't like where the fare structures are right now. And we don't like the effect it has on short-term earnings,"" he said, according to Bloomberg. ""It is painful, difficult, but we're going to see it through.""United is also scaling back its ""basic economy"" fares, which were meant to compete with low-cost carriers head-on, in some markets.Southwest Airlines (LUV) also scaled back its guidance, saying Q3 unit revenue will be down 1% to ""slightly up""  vs. prior guidance for a 1% gain. CFO Tammy Romo largely blamed the ""current competitive pricing environment.""Shares fell 1.6% in the stock market today, paring earlier losses sharply. Rivals reversed earlier losses, as Delta Air Lines (DAL) rallied 3%, American Airlines (AAL) rose 1.1%, and Southwest gained 1.4%.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.United's move follows Delta's announcement on Tuesday to cut its passenger unit revenue and operating margin forecast for the third quarter, citing higher fuel costs and a slower-than-expected rebound in certain fares.Meanwhile, United also ordered 45 Airbus A350s, upping its order size by 10 jetliners. According to Bloomberg, the deal is a conversion of a prior order for a larger variety of Airbus A350 widebody jets.RELATED:Delta Cuts Revenue, Margin Targets As Airline Competition Heats UpAirline Industry News And Stocks To WatchStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks
"
228,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday cut its passenger unit revenue and operating margin outlook for the third quarter, citing higher fuel prices and a ""slower than anticipated"" rebound in its domestic pricing power on flights booked closer to their departure.XDelta's forecast for unit revenue, which measures an airline's sales by its overall capacity to fly people from place to place, comes some two months after several carriers signaled a weaker showing for the key metric and more fare discounting in some parts of the U.S. this quarter. More competition is one reason: JetBlue (JBLU) said last month that it would double flights into Atlanta, Delta's main hub. Iceland's WOW carrier said in August that it will expand super-discount trans-Atlantic flights to more U.S. cities.It also comes after Hurricane Harvey left much of Houston underwater and forced scores of flight cancellations, particularly for United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV). Meanwhile, Hurricane Irma, which grew into a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, was forecast to strike South Florida this weekend.Delta on Tuesday expects third-quarter unit revenue to be up 2%-3%, compared to an earlier outlook for 2.5%-4.5% growth. Operating margins for the third quarter are expected to be 16.5%-17.5%, lower than previous expectations for 18%-20%, the carrier said.Delta fell 3.5% in the stock market today, still in a sharp downtrend since peaking in early July. United stock lost 2.1% and American Airlines (AAL) dipped 3.1%. Southwest (LUV) retreated 2%. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) sank 4.5% and JetBlue 3.3%.As Harvey approached and then hammered Texas, more investors stepped into airline stocks, with many feeling they were oversold. Airline stocks likely were pressured Tuesday as Hurricane Irma increased to a Category 5 storm, headed for Florida.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, passenger traffic for the month of August jumped 6.9%, while capacity rose 2.7%. Load factor rose 3.5 percentage points to 87.9%.More details about airlines' third-quarter financial forecasts are set to follow in monthly traffic reports due in the coming days. Delta and other airlines could provide more detail on the state of travel demand during presentations at Cowen & Co.'s global transportation conference on Wednesday.RELATED:Harvey May Hit Airlines Harder Than Katrina DidDelta, Southwest, Other Airline Stocks Extend Gains As Harvey Bears DownWOW: Why Delta, American, United And Other Airline Stocks Are Sinking Yet AgainAs Airlines Brace For Fare War, Here's Why Delta's Margins May SurviveAirlines See Weaker Q3 As Competition Mounts On Fares
"
229,LUV,"Harvey seems more powerful and potentially carries a bigger impact to the airlines than Hurricane Katrina did, a top airline analyst said Tuesday, as rain and flooding plunged Houston deeper into crisis.XKatrina scarred New Orleans for years, but that city isn't a hub market. When Hurricane Ike struck Houston in 2008, it cost Continental $50 million, said Cowen analyst Helane Becker in a research note. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 maybe more comparable for airlines due to its prolonged impact.United Airlines (UAL) seemed likeliest to bear the biggest financial impact from Harvey, which could cost the carrier at least $265 million, assuming airports reopen on Thursday, Becker wrote.""Given Houston is a major hub for United, they will likely be the most impacted by the storms,"" she said.Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE), which follow United in being most exposed to Houston, would take hits of $77 million and $11 million respectively, she said.Shares of United closed down 0.4% on the stock market today. Southwest eased 0.6%, and Spirit slipped 0.8%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 0.7%, and American Airlines (AAL) fell 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Airlines' most recent round of earnings reports have left investors questioning the industry's operational discipline and the state of the ultra low-cost carrier business model. Even as Harvey closed in on Texas on Friday, airline shares rallied on Wall Street's belief that the sector had sold off too harshly in recent weeks.That slide intensified after the industry in July threw off signals that more price cuts could be on the horizon and that unit revenue, or an airline's sales in relation to its overall flight capacity, might not be as strong as once anticipated.Airlines typically factor in some degree of bad weather into their financial forecasts. But in Tuesday's note, Cowen's Becker said the storm could hang over people's traveling habits for some time.""We assume the airports in the area will be closed for seven days and expect relatively little chance to recoup the lost revenue as the impact to people in the region could be profound (justifiably difficult to go on vacation after your house was flooded or the roof torn off),"" she wrote.""In addition, we expect school closures, and it is possible future vacations will be canceled to make up the lost classroom time.""Hundreds of United and Southwest flights have been canceled due to the storm, which has caused reservoirs to swell and levees to breach and made canalways out of the Houston's streets. At least 10 people have died as a result of the storm.RELATED:Flooring, Home Improvement Shares Advance As Rain Estimate SpikesDelta, Southwest, Other Airline Stocks Extend Gains As Harvey Bears DownInsurance Stocks Tumble As Hurricane Harvey Impact MountsHow Much Will Gasoline Prices Jump?

230,LUV,"Tech stocks lagged on Friday as strength in the transportation, energy and select retail sectors helped boost at least two of the key averages. Apple (AAPL) (94 Composite Rating), meanwhile, appeared poised for a fourth up week in a row.XApple is up more than 1% to 159.84, up mildly from an Aug. 2 breakout past a 156.75 flat base. That base is second stage.Apple's gain wasn't enough to lift the Nasdaq composite, which saw its early gains of almost 0.6% wither to nearly break-even. Sell-offs in medical software, video game software, biotech and security software stocks are weighing on the market.But Apple is a key component of both the S&P 500 and the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, which at around 1:30 p.m. ET rose roughly 0.2% to 0.3%.The correct buy zone for Apple goes up to 164.58, or 5% past the 156.75 proper entry.To find the right buy point in a flat-base pattern, in most cases, take the left-side high and add 10 cents.Airline stocks helped propel the Dow Jones transports up more than 1.4%. At 9156, the sector index is up 0.6% for the week, but still lies more than 6% below a recent 52-week high of 9763.Truck, logistics and ship transport firms are also up 1.5% or more, even with WTI crude oil futures up 0.4% to $47.70 a barrel. WTI futures, however, are still down 5% for the month.Alaska Air (ALK), Southwest Air (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL) are all still entrenched below their 200-day moving averages. The airline transport group has sunk to the lower half of IBD's daily rankings of 197 industry groups and subgroups amid fierce price competition brought on by some new deep-discount airlines based in Europe.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alaska Air, the former big winner after a breakout in October 2012, now holds a lowly 19 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The Composite Rating is 57. Growth stock hunters should focus on those with a 95 or better.Back to Apple, the prospects of further gains in Apple still look intact. One reason: the most recent base is second stage. A high-quality company tends to thrive when coming out of a first, second or third stage base. Fourth and fifth stage bases tend to bring out more sellers and put a breakout in doubt.To count bases, find the proper buy point, then see if a stock climbs a minimum 20% from that entry. A stock that forms a new base before rising at least 20% from a proper buy point is forming a ""base-on-base"" pattern, which counts as one stage.As noted in IBD multiple times in Stock Market Today in January, the iPhone and iMac titan surpassed a 118.12 buy point within a cup with handle on Jan. 6-9, then really picked up steam after it reported a small 2% gain in fiscal Q1 earnings per share and a 3% lift in revenue. As small as those increase were, they broke a three-quarter slump in both the top and bottom lines.Apple gapped up more than 6% on that report, then continued to rally as it went on to report further gains in profit (up 11% and 18%) and sales (up 5% and 7%).More reasons why Apple remains a leader? One, the RS Rating remains strong at 90. Two, Wall Street has been revising its EPS estimates higher. Three, Apple's relative strength line (see it in blue in an IBD or MarketSmith chart) has moved into new high ground, meaning it's beating the S&P 500. And four, the Telecom-Consumer Products group has been improving in rank, to No. 50, up from 87th six weeks ago.The gain in Apple from the 118.12 entry has exceeded 37%.RELATED:How To Invest And Win: The Essence Of A Cup With Handle3 Reasons Why Apple Could Rise Another 20%

""This is a bit of a recovery from oversold levels especially with the market moving up today.""More information on the storm's fallout could emerge in the coming weeks, when the airlines release monthly traffic figures. Airlines are also set to present at a Cowen & Co. conference on Sept. 6, and additional information could come then.But the airlines likely factored in some of the impact already.""Most of the airlines do, when they give guidance, assume at least one or two storms every quarter that would cause earnings to be affected by it,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker said.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.During Q2 earnings reporting season, investors soured on disappointing unit-revenue forecasts and worries about a bigger fare war to come — things that could erode airlines' sales and profits.Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares plummeted after the budget carrier cited deeper fare discounting in United's hubs. United also issued a ""guarantee"" that it could beat out Frontier, a low-cost carrier that has advanced into Denver, United's most profitable hub.A terrorist attack in Barcelona, more planned competition from JetBlue (JBLU) in Atlanta, and plans from Iceland low-cost, long-haul carrier WOW Air to expand in the Midwest have also depressed airline stocks.Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi, in a research note on Thursday, said that characterizations of a fare war on par with the one seen in 2015 seemed like ""an overstatement.""""Based on our discussions with airlines, it would seem as if United's pricing action against Spirit is far more tactical and less strategic than what happened in 2015,"" he wrote.""For example, in 2015, there was a strategic decision at American to begin fare matching Spirit, which resulted in a step down in fare levels in many markets,"" he said. ""What's happening now seems to be United tightening up the way it is competing against Spirit and which fares it's choosing to match. We think that's an important difference as it should result in less of an impact on industry fares.""He also noted that the weakness in airline stocks could prompt more operational discipline from the industry next year.RELATED:As Texas Braces For Harvey, Investors Stock Up On These CompaniesAirline Industry News And Stocks To WatchWOW: Why Delta, American, United And Other Airline Stocks Are Sinking Yet AgainWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Dumps General Electric Stake, Trims AirlinesAs Airlines Brace For Fare War, Here's Why Delta's Margins May Survive

233,LUV,"Low-cost Indian airlines are weighing options to add widebody jets from Boeing (BA) or Airbus (EADSY) to their narrow-body fleets but analysts question if demand from that fast-growing aviation market can offset weakness from once-high-flying Middle East carriers.XSpiceJet's Chairman Ajay Singh told Bloomberg TV that the carrier is considering Boeing 787-10s and Airbus A350-1000s to augment its mostly Boeing 737 fleet. The airline already has the purchase rights for 50 more Boeing aircraft, but didn't specify the type.IndiGo, which currently flies an all Airbus A320 fleet, is also reportedly interested in widebodies.Boeing shares closed up 1.1% at 238.78 on the stock market today, as they work on a flat base with a 246.59 buy point. Airbus' U.S.-listed shares edged down 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Singh said India could be a ""tremendous"" long-haul market ""if you can work out the math and bring down the cost.""Air traffic in South Asia is expected to grow 8% over the next 20 years, outpacing the global average of 4.7% as well as China's growth of 6.2%, according to a Boeing in July.Boeing said it expects Indian carriers to order up to 2,100 new planes, valued at $290 billion, over the next two decades. Demand will mostly be single-aisle 737 and 737 Max jets, as demand for point-to-point travel increases.Widebody jets are higher-margin planes for Boeing and other air frame manufacturers who are seeing a slowdown in orders of widebodies from Persian Gulf carriers, which went on buying sprees a few years ago but have since curbed purchases as oil prices tanked.But Seth Kaplan, a managing partner at Airline Weekly, warned that it won't be a one-for-one trade-off between the Gulf and India, saying the long-haul model doesn't work on a sustained basis for discount carriers.""A lot of the advantages of low-cost carriers come on the ground,"" he told IBD.Low-cost carriers like Southwest (LUV) have perfected the quick turnaround model and can have a single jet flying five or six times a day, he added. But widebodies won't see as many flights.Also, traditional carriers have alliances and joint ventures, strong loyalty programs, and fancy lounges for first-class and business carriers that make a difference to passengers on long-haul flights, Kaplan said.So it's unclear how successful the push into long-haul will be for low-cost Indian carriers. Norwegian, which bought Boeing 787 Dreamliners to augment its fleet and AirAsia X have both struggled turning a profit with long-haul operations.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBoeing Raises Its 20-Year China Demand Outlook To $1.1 Trillion

242,LUV,"Stocks fell mildly on Wednesday as an apparent rift already emerging between President Trump and Congress on the issue of having enough money to keep the lights on in Washington seemed to take center stage.

243,LUV,"The Dow Jones industrial average outdueled the Nasdaq composite for the week amid the past week's big batch of quarterly results. Boosted by some of its industrial plays (think Caterpillar (CAT), up 7% for the week), the Dow industrials inched almost 0.2% higher on Friday for a fourth straight advance to new all-time highs and a weekly gain of 1.2%.XIn contrast, the Nasdaq composite lost 0.1% on Friday and ended the week off 0.2%. It was plagued by steep drops by some FANG names including Google-operator Alphabet (GOOGL) (up nearly 0.5% Friday but down 3.6% for the week).The S&P 500 finished the week practically break-even.The Nasdaq, however, continues to be the premier index of U.S. growth companies, rising 18.4% since Jan. 1 vs. a 10.5% lift for the Dow 30.Alphabet reported highly respectable numbers for Q2 (EPS up 27%, revenue up 21%, after-tax margin up 140 basis points to 24.1%), yet investors were clearly displeased with news that Alphabet may have seen its traffic acquisition costs going up following a new contract with fellow Silicon Valley stalwart Apple (AAPL).Apple showed resilience both on Thursday and Friday despite falling in price both days. Why? It's trying to stay on the north side of its 50-day moving average. That would bode well for the current uptrend since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from a bottoming base pattern at 118.12.The Dow transports dropped more than 2.5% for the week, its worst weekly performance since a nearly 3.6% dive in the week ended June 24, 2016.Big losses by airline, ship, railroad and logistic companies hurt the important sector index, even amid a report that showed the U.S. GDP rebounded a bit in the second quarter, up 2.6%. GDP was up from a downward-revised 1.2% gain in Q1.Cheap ticket airline and former stock market leader Spirit Airlines (SAVE) collapsed more than 20% for the week, hitting its lowest level since September of 2016. Even before its plunge, the stock triggered a key sell signal when it fell 8% below a recent breakout from a flawed cup with handle at 59.64 during the week ended May 12.Southwest Air (LUV) slumped more than 5% for the week but bounced off its 40-week moving average, which behaves similarly to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart.Returning to Alphabet hasn't yet triggered the golden rule of selling, but shares had an awful weekly showing, falling 3.7% in steep turnover and undercutting its 10-week moving average. More than 17.6 million shares exchanged hands for the week, the biggest weekly volume since February 2016.As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, Alphabet etched a flawed double-bottom base, which raised the risk of a breakout failure. Double-bottom bases must be a minimum seven weeks in length. A better interpretation is a flat base with a 1,008.71 buy point.In other financial markets, crude oil topped off a splendid rebound as U.S. oil futures jumped another 1.3% to $49.69 a barrel, racing more than 8.5% higher for the week. The euro charged higher, finishing the week near $1.1755.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged higher for the week, finishing near 2.29%.RELATED:In The Big Picture: This Laggard Group Led The Day; Why?Also In Stock Market Today: Time To Sell This FANG Stock And Lock In Gains?How Did The U.S. Economy Perform In Q2?More FANG News Exclusively At IBD

244,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped forecasts, but it sees unit revenue growth slowing sharply in the third quarter, as fare discounts appear to escalate across the sector.XThe outlook follows unit-revenue forecasts from rivals such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) that generally underwhelmed Wall Street, after postelection demand and a more conservative approach to expansion elevated investors' hopes for stronger, more sustained gains in the key metric — a gauge of how efficiently an airline manages its operations.Perhaps most notably, on Thursday, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) crashed nearly 18% after the low-fare, high-fee carrier cut its unit revenue forecast to a 2%-4% decline, after forecasting an increase earlier, amid steeper fare discounting in Chicago, Denver, Houston and Newark — big hubs for United.And as American's results effectively closed out earnings season for the airlines, analysts parsed out what the forecasts meant for the industry and the ultra-low-cost model of flying in general.American expects unit revenue, which measures revenue in relation to an airline's capacity, to rise 0.5%-2.5%, with that figure accelerating in the fourth quarter.However, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said the fourth-quarter forecast ""is a bit premature especially given what its peer group has said about discounting in the domestic market.""For the second quarter, total unit revenue rose 5.7%, with capacity up 1.4%.Earnings per share of $1.92, up 8.5%, topping estimates for $1.87. Revenue rose 7.2% to $11.11 billion, compared to estimates for $11.09 billion.Operating expenses climbed 11% on rising fuel and employee benefit costs. American's recently said it wants the pay of its pilots and flight attendants to equal that of rival carriers.Shares rose 1% to 50.49 in the stock market today, after falling intraday to 48.73, below their 50-day moving average. Delta Air Lines rose 0.5%, United Airlines sank 0.3% and Southwest Airlines fell 1 cent. All four carriers still suffered their second straight week of significant losses.Still, American cited ""strong passenger demand and improving yields,"" or an airline's pricing power on airfare, particularly in the U.S., Central American, South American and Caribbean markets. Co-branded credit card agreements that took hold last year also helped push revenue higher in the quarter.Those credit-card agreements, which have become more competitive for the industry, have become more of a focus during earnings calls. Delta, during its earnings call, said its partnership with American Express (AXP) could bring $300 million in value this year. United, which has a partnership with Chase, said that was ""one of the areas where we are currently underperforming"".Branded fares — or fares that package certain types of amenities together — and offering a more diverse array of seating classes have also become more important. American, like Delta and United, is moving ahead with plans to segment cabin space.American has expanded its Basic Economy class into 78 markets and expects to roll it out across the rest of its domestic network by the end of September. About half of American's customers are buying up to Main Cabin when given the option between that and Basic Economy.The airline said adoption of the new Premium Economy class has been strong too, and most widebody aircraft will be retrofitted with the class for international customers by the end of 2018.The big U.S. network carriers have introduced basic economy in an attempt to more effectively compete with budget carriers like Spirit. Cowen analyst Helane Becker also noted that United appeared to be pricing ""aggressively"" for the peak summer travel period, and that it was unclear how long the discounting would go on.Scott Kirby, a former executive at American who is now president at United, has also not shied away from competing against — or trash-talking — the low-cost carriers.Last week, he said Frontier Airlines' push into Denver, United's most profitable hub, risked sinking fares in the short term. But long-term, he said it was ""the best news that I've heard in the last ten years.""And he added that ""I have believed, for many years, that the ULCC business model can't work when a network carrier decides to compete on price, particularly once we've been able to roll out Basic Economy.""He argued that the move from Frontier amounted to a hub-and-spoke approach more akin to what the big U.S. network carriers do — a much more complex operation. And he indicated the move was a concession of sorts that Frontier's business model had run out of steam.Frontier advancing into Denver, he said, was ""a battle I guarantee United will win.""Spirit and Allegiant (ALGT) have said that Basic Economy were not pushing fares lower, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note. While he characterized Thursday's sell-off in airline stocks as an overreaction, he said the discount carrier would be ""a battleground stock for the foreseeable future"".Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said the plunge in Spirit's stock created an opportunity to move into the stock.""While elevated capacity (and likely resulting pricing pressure) is a concern for U.S. airlines in general, we believe SAVE's underperformance reflects concern that the ULCC model is broken,"" she wrote in a research note. ""We emphatically disagree and expect Spirit's self-help initiatives and low-cost model to drive sustainable superior margins along with faster growth.""Cowen's Becker, meanwhile, urged caution.""Investors might be tempted to try and catch a falling knife,"" she said, ""but we believe a wait-and-see approach is prudent.""RELATED:Delta's Guidance: 'Good Enough' Falls Short Of 'Whisper Number'United's Aggressive Growth Plan Assumes This About RivalsThree Reasons Why Southwest, Spirit Air Are Plunging

245,LUV,"Weak unit-revenue forecasts, higher costs, an epic dispute with pilots: all seemed to be helping steer shares of Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) into a nosedive Thursday after the carriers reported second-quarter earnings.XThe stock slide came even as Southwest's results beat expectations on the top and bottom lines, while Spirit topped earnings-per-share views and matched estimates for sales.Here are the main takeaways.Ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines called its Q2 results ""disappointing,"" with an ongoing dispute with pilots causing more than 850 flight cancellations during the quarter. Those cancellations, the company said, likely cost it nearly a percentage point of unit revenue, or around $45 million. Unit revenue rose 5.7% in Q2.Spirit and its pilots' union have been locked in a dispute over pay increases. That dispute boiled over in May, with video purportedly showing security attempting to restrain angry Spirit passengers at an airport in Florida following scores of flight cancellations that the carrier said were being caused by pilots who weren't taking assignments.The carrier at that time accused the pilots of staging ""a pervasive illegal work slowdown"" in an attempt to strongarm management into agreeing to their terms. The union said it and Spirit's pilots were ""not engaged in a job action.""Meanwhile, Southwest's second-quarter adjusted operating expenses spiked 10.6%, driven higher in large part by wage hikes to pilots and flight attendants that took hold in Q4.Labor costs should continue to come under scrutiny as pay gets more competitive. In April, American Airlines (AAL), which reports Friday, said it wants the pay of its pilots and flight attendants to equal that of rival carriers.Spirit offered a weak outlook for third-quarter unit revenue due to what it characterized as heightened competition, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in brief research note.However, the panic might be a bit much, DeNardi said.""While our estimates will likely come down as a result of the lower guidance, our initial thoughts would be that the magnitude of the sell-off is an overreaction,"" DeNardi said.Spirit shares sank 18% to 40.07 in the stock market today, hitting their lowest levels since September. Southwest was down 5%, but had dropped by as much as 10% earlier. Still, shares are now below the buy zone and had touched sell territory. American lost 2.1%, Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 2% and had also touched sell range, and United Airlines (UAL) fell 3.1%.Southwest on May 9 launched a new reservation system, an undertaking that the carrier said was its largest technology project ever.However, despite ""virtually flawless"" execution, CEO Garry Kelly noted that ""a new system is always challenging for the users."" And the carrier said the shift to the new system would hurt Q3 unit revenue, which it expects to rise 1%. That forecast included a roughly 1 percentage-point drag resulting from the new reservation system.The carrier's Q3 unit revenue forecast might be below investor expectations, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note.She wrote that ""forward guidance is likely to disappoint with 3Q17 EPS estimates likely needing to be lowered. Surprisingly, the reservation system cutover is having a ~1 ppt drag on (unit revenue) in 2Q/3Q17.""Southwest said it didn't expect ""a significant unfavorable impact"" from the changeover to the new system after Q3.For the second quarter, unit revenue rose 1.5%, at the midpoint of an earlier outlook. Those results included ""less than 1 point of temporary pressure"" due to the rollout of the reservation system.RELATED:United's Aggressive Growth Plan Assumes This About RivalsDelta's Guidance: 'Good Enough' Falls Short Of 'Whisper Number'

"
247,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) management on Wednesday appeared to encourage patience on the company's longer-term plans, which assume rivals will lower fares too, but it was unclear whether its disappointing third-quarter unit-revenue forecast was just a one-off blip or something more.XUnited late Tuesday forecast third-quarter unit revenue to come in at a range of down 1% to up 1%, as rival airlines hoist the key industry metric higher.That comes as the carrier on Tuesday said it expects capacity growth of 4% in the third quarter and kept its full-year outlook at 2.5%-3.5% growth. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) has said it plans to cap capacity growth at 1% this year, and American Airlines (AAL) sees full-year capacity growth of roughly 1.5%.""The outlook is likely to exacerbate concerns that United's somewhat aggressive capacity growth plans are hurting results,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note sent before the company's earnings call.On Wednesday, United said summer-season competition and calendar quirks factored into its Q3 unit-revenue forecast. But management said it didn't yet have a clear picture into Q4, when year-over-year comparisons become more difficult while calendar shifts on some holidays and Southwest's (LUV) retirement of older planes could benefit United.United President Scott Kirby told analysts that the airline's growth initiatives will take some time to pay off.United this year has announced plans to expand the flights it offers to many smaller cities, and Kirby noted that those moves won't boost unit revenue immediately.He also said the carrier's bare-bones basic economy fares will become more of a financial benefit once its rivals, who are currently selling more seats at higher prices, adopt the cheaper fares more broadly.Delta in April said it had completed the expansion of basic economy to all of the U.S. and Canada. American in January said it hoped to have basic economy available across domestic flights over this year and early next year.Wall Street seemed to give the rest of the airline sector a pass, for now, punishing United's stock, which sank 5.9% to 74.24 on the stock market today, while Delta pared early losses to just 0.3%. American fell 1%. Southwest also rebounded and was down just 0.3%.United, in a slide presentation on Wednesday, also raised its full-year capital-expenditures forecast to a range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion to reflect technology upgrades, aircraft purchases and other items. But the carrier said it expected capex to fall around $1 billion next year.The company said Wednesday that a big part of its spending this year was going toward automation in warehouses, and said there was a ""big opportunity"" to bring more technology into the business, from application development to technology that aids in disaster recovery.Management also defended the oversight of its margins, saying it has worked to close the margin gap between it and its network rivals over the past several quarters.Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note before the call that United's unit revenue and margin outlook watered down the carrier's more aggressive long-term goals. And he said the carrier would likely lag rivals in margins.But he said ""profit opportunity still looms large"" and that United shares ""still represent deep value within a broader industrial universe of equal or lesser returning companies.""In that research note, titled ""2Q17, Touch of Grey,"" referencing the Grateful Dead song, Oglenski said ""United will get by, maybe just a bit longer than prior plans.""RELATED:Delta's Guidance: 'Good Enough' Falls Short Of 'Whisper Number'This Is Why Airline Stocks Have A Tailwind Today

248,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday forecast third-quarter passenger unit revenue in a range that could dip into negative territory, even as rivals like Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) rein in the key industry metric.United said it expected third-quarter passenger unit revenue, which measures sales from passengers in relation to an airline's overall capacity to fly them places, of down 1% to up 1%.XShares sank 3.6% after-hours, after finishing 1.6% lower at 78.51 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The stock was drifting from an 83.14 buy point in a base-on-base pattern.United also said it expected third-quarter capacity to be up around 4%, compared to a 4.2% increase in the second quarter. United said it expects Q3 pretax margin at 12.5%-14.5%, compared to 13.2% for the second quarter.The carrier's second-quarter earnings per share of $2.75 rose 5%, beating estimates for $2.65. Revenue rose 6.4% to $10 billion, just past estimates for $9.964 billion.United's earnings conference call is Wednesday.Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 1.5% late, but is still in buying territory. American Airlines (AAL) fell 0.8%. Southwest (LUV) was flat.Unit revenue, or an airline's sales in relation to its flight capacity, has improved across the industry amid a rise in postelection travel demand and airlines' attempts to restrain capacity growth.The statistic, industrywide, had fallen for some two years after the 2014 oil crash. The resulting cheap fuel at that time made it easier for airlines to expand without denting profits, but the more crowded skies and competitive ticket-price slashing ended up hurting unit revenue, to the irritation of Wall Street.United is also trying to recover from the backlash it suffered after a video surfaced online of security dragging a passenger from a packed flight in April.The incident led to a settlement and policy changes from the carrier, including a compensation of as high as $10,000 for giving up one's seat and the creation of a customer help team to assist in offering alternatives to help customers get to their destination in the event flights are overfilled.The carrier said that it had implemented ""the majority of the ten changes announced at the end of April"". United said that it cut its overbookings during the quarter, and saw an 88% decrease in involuntary denied boardings in June — the kind that got them in trouble in April.""From investing in our products and our people, redoubling our focus on the customer experience, closing the margin gap with our peers and delivering strong returns to our investors, we have made important progress and moved United decisively forward,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement.That statement continued: ""No single quarter constitutes a trend and we still have much further to go before we fully realize the potential of this airline and exceed the expectations of our customers.""Delta shares retreated on Thursday after the company reported Q2 earnings, a reaction analysts attributed to earnings per share that missed forecasts and lofty expectations for third-quarter unit revenue.Some analysts also said before United's earnings that they expect its third-quarter unit revenue to slow as the carrier heads into tougher year-over-year comparisons and faces more competition over the Pacific.United in recent weeks has pointed to an ""unfavorable supply and demand dynamics"" in China and Hong Kong. Airlines in Asia have been adding flights, and those in China have piled on service over the Pacific, a threat to carriers in the U.S. and in Korea.The International Air Transport Association last year said that the Asia-Pacific region was set to generate more than half of new passengers over the coming two decades, with China on track to become the world's biggest aviation market around 2024.The big U.S. network carriers have tried to get ahead of those trends, while Asian airlines have tried to protect the top and bottom lines.Delta has an alliance with China Eastern and recently formed a joint venture with Korean Air intended to create a ""leading intra-Asian network."" The carrier plans to add a hub in Beijing. Those moves are intended to make it less dependent on Tokyo and drive profitability, management said during its Q2 earnings call last week.American, meanwhile, agreed to invest $200 million in China Southern Airlines (ZNH).For the increasingly competitive Pacific market, Delta last week said that better business demand made up for weaker leisure demand. Same for the Atlantic, it said, where business demand helped offset weaker pricing on leisure travel.The earnings also come as the big airlines see a bigger financial future in adding new types of fares that bundle different levels of services. Delta last week said those so-called branded fares were expected to bring in an incremental $1 billion in revenue through 2019.RELATED:This Is Why Airline Stocks Have A Tailwind TodayAmerican Airlines Calls Qatar Airways Offer 'Puzzling And Strange'

249,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday said that margins this year are on pace to land at the low end of its forecast, as higher fuel and labor costs dented second-quarter results.But the company said that the the worst of its cost pressures — outside of fuel —were likely behind it. For Q3, Delta sees operating margins of 18%-20%, with the midpoint above Q2's 18.4%. But full-year margins are now seen at the bottom of its 16%-18% outlook.XStifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said that Delta's forecast for a roughly 4% increase in unit costs ""is limiting the margin expansion that management had expected"" in the second half of the year.Management also sees a spike in capacity, which could weigh on unit revenue. For Q3, capacity is seen up about 2%, double the pace of the 1% cap that Delta has set for the full year and a sharp acceleration from Q2's 0.4% uptick.Still, Q3 passenger-unit revenue, a key industry measure of an airline's ticket sales as it relates to overall flight coverage, is seen up 2.5%-4.5%.""All-in, we view the report and guidance as good enough and an indication that revenue and demand trends continue to improve,"" Stifel's DeNardi said in a research note released before a conference call with analysts.But ""good enough"" did not appear to be good enough for Wall Street. Shares of Delta fell 1.8% to 54.50 in the stock market today, extended after breaking out last month from a 50.28 entry point in a flat base.Analysts apparently expected more from Delta's unit revenue guidance, or passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM).""The shares are weak today on what we view as near-term noise,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note released after the company's earnings call. ""Clearly the 'whisper number' for 3Q17 PRASM was higher than the company's expected 2.5% to 4.5% range.""American Airlines (AAL) rose 1 cent to 53.81. United Airlines (UAL), which reports results Tuesday, slid 0.45% to 80.17. United has been heading toward an 83.14 buy point. Southwest (LUV), lost 0.1% to 62.02, still beyond buy range.In Q2, Delta earnings per share rose 12% to $1.64, just missing views for $1.65. Revenue rose 3% — the first such increase in two years — to $10.79 billion, below estimates for $10.8 billion. Unit costs rose 7.3% in the second quarter.But as the industry continues to chop up its cabin spaces into different seating classes and break out costs for services, Delta's management spent a good part of its earnings call emphasizing that they were in the ""early stages"" of unlocking the value of an increasingly diverse array of fares.So-called ""branded fare"" initiatives, or fares that package different amenities together, drove nearly 40% of Delta's increase in passenger revenue during the second quarter, the company said.And the practice of dividing up the cabin to serve different types of customers willing to pay for different degrees of service — known in the industry as segmentation — would help improve results in the second half of the year, the company said.As the carrier bulks up on larger, newer aircraft, management said the opportunity to offer more profitable premium services would grow.In Q3, Delta will also enjoy easier year-ago comparisons. Last year, a fire at a power switch turned into a colossal technology outage for Delta, costing it some $100 million in sales and more than 2,000 canceled flights.Barring a repeat, analysts said, the carrier was set to enjoy the heightened demand — and, in turn, pricing power for airfare — that it saw in Q2 as it heads into the heart of summer travel season.""In 3Q17, Delta faces one of the easiest comparisons among the U.S. airlines,"" Becker wrote in a research note last week.She also said ""at least 50% of all tickets sold for July and August were sold before oil prices started to trend lower, so they were priced at higher levels.""RELATED:Airlines, Tech Stocks Hit After Top Court Largely Reinstates Travel BanAmerican Airlines Calls Qatar Airways Offer 'Puzzling And Strange'

250,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday hiked its second-quarter forecast for unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin, propelled in part by stronger travel demand in the U.S. and Latin America.XThe more optimistic outlook follows a similar one last week from Delta Air Lines (DAL), which cited ""commercial initiatives and an improving revenue environment."" United Airlines (UAL) after the close on Tuesday also offered a solid Q2 unit-revenue forecast.Airline stocks were active on the news from American and United, along with the strong overall market. American rose 4.2% to 53.80 in the stock market today. Delta, which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, climbed 2.2% to 55.48.United, which reports Tuesday, jumped 4.7% to 80.53, moving back above its 50-day line. United is in a short flat base just above a prior consolidation. The potential buy point is 83.14.Southwest (LUV) rose 0.4% to 62.08. Southwest reported June traffic figures earlier this week as well, sticking with its Q2 unit revenue targets.Separately, Panama-based Copa Holdings (CPA) rose 3.4% to 129.12, breaking out of a cup base with a 125.87 buy point.American said it expected second quarter unit revenue, or airline revenue as it relates to its overall seating capacity and flight coverage, to increase roughly 5%-6%. That's an improvement from an earlier forecast of a 3.5%-5.5%.The carrier said the brighter picture for unit revenue was helped largely by higher passenger yields — a measure of an airline's ability to charge passengers more for tickets — particularly in the U.S., Central and South America, and the Caribbean regions.American also said it expects adjusted pretax margin to be 13%-14%, better than an earlier view for 12%-14%. Unit costs excluding fuel and other items were expected to rise roughly 7% during the second quarter, largely because of salary and benefit hikes given to pilots, flight attendants and other staff.For the month of June, American's passenger traffic rose 0.8%. Capacity rose 1.1% and load factor fell 0.2 percentage points to 84.7 %.Demand for air travel has generally improved since the U.S. election in November, helping to push unit revenue higher. The major network carriers have also found more ways to break out costs, offering both ""basic economy"" seating classes to compete with low-cost carriers and more lucrative premium fare options.Alaska Air Group (ALK), the carrier that bought Virgin America in December, said on Wednesday that it expected second-quarter passenger unit revenue to rise around 3.5%. That figure factored in ""historical results"" for the two carriers from last year's Q2, which took place before the acquisition closed.Shares gained 3.3% to 94.63.RELATED:American Airlines Calls Qatar Airways Offer 'Puzzling And Strange'Is Airline Service Actually Showing Signs Of Improvement?

251,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday said it expected second-quarter passenger unit revenue to land in the middle of its forecast, but added that the trans-Pacific market continued to face ""incremental weakness.""XThe carrier said Q2 passenger unit revenue, an important metric for the airline business, was expected to rise roughly 2%. Earlier, the carrier said it expected a unit revenue increase of 1%-3%.That outlook follows Delta Air Lines' (DAL) announcement last week that its unit revenue had risen around 2.5%, at the higher end of its forecast range. Southwest (LUV) on Monday stuck with its original guidance for a unit revenue increase of 1%-2%.Unit revenue, which measures an airline's revenue in relation to its flight capacity, has improved as travel demand picks up and after higher fuel prices encouraged moderation in airlines' plans to add flights.For the month of June, United said that passenger traffic rose 3.4%, while capacity rose 5%.Shares rose 1% after hours in the stock market today. United Air closed down 1.7% to 76.92, back below its 50-day line. United is in flat-base pattern with a potential 83.14 buy point. That's just above or next to a prior consolidation.Delta and American rose modestly late after falling 1% and 2%, respectively, during the regular session. Southwest Airlines retreated 2.1% on Tuesday.United's monthly operational figures come ahead of Delta's second-quarter earnings, set for release on Thursday. United reports next Tuesday.United's performance in the increasingly crowded Pacific market has been hurt by ""unfavorable supply-and-demand dynamics in China and Hong Kong.""

252,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said second-quarter passenger unit revenue would come in at the high end of its outlook, adding that ""an improving revenue environment"" helped cushion the blow that the carrier took in April after severe thunderstorms over the Atlanta area forced thousands of flight cancellations.The carrier said passenger unit revenue, a key industry measure that gauges an airline's sales as they relate to its flight capacity, had risen roughly 2.5% during the quarter. Earlier, the company forecast a 1%-3% increase in passenger unit revenue.Delta in recent weeks has said that unit revenue was headed toward the upper end of its expectations, citing better conditions in business travel.The company said it expected a Q2 operating margin of 18%-19%.

Delta Air Lines and Southwest also pared gains and were up 1% and 0.8%, respectively.

Qatar has submitted a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act related to the intended investment and has said it only seeks a passive stake.American and Qatar already have a code-share agreement and are both members of the Oneworld airline alliances.American Airlines said the interest doesn't budge its belief in the enforcement of open-skies agreements with the United Arab Emirates and the nation of Qatar to ensure fair competition, it said.""American Airlines continues to believe that the president and his administration will stand up to foreign governments to end massive carrier subsidies that threaten the U.S. aviation industry and that threaten American jobs,"" said the filing.American and other top U.S. carriers have accused Gulf rivals like Qatar, Emirates and Etihad of receiving unfair government assistance that has allowed them to expand aggressively and have pressed the U.S. government to take action.RELATED:Is Airline Service Actually Showing Signs Of Improvement?As Southwest, United, American Test Buy Zones, SkyWest Eyes TakeoffAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry News

261,LUV,"Boeing's (BA) launch of its 737 Max 10 stretch and more details on a completely new midrange plane will likely be the big news stories out of the Paris Air Show, which starts Monday.Still, overall expectations are subdued for this year's event, with orders expected to be down. After a buying frenzy a few years ago, airlines are taking a breather while Boeing and rival Airbus (EADSY) scramble to work through their steep backlog of orders.And with oil prices staying low, airlines have been able to fly older, less fuel-efficient planes for longer. Carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) recently have delayed delivery of new jets.""New aircraft orders are expected to be relatively meager,"" Rob Stallard, a Vertical Research Partners analyst, wrote in a note. ""Although the trend for new orders would appear worrying, we expect aerospace companies to still be positive on the outlook for continued growth.""Airbus has booked only 73 net orders in the first five months of 2017, down 55% from a year-ago and Boeing only had 56 at the end of May, though China Aircraft Leasing Group on Thursday announced an order for 50 737 Max jets with a list price of $5.8 billion.Another missing demand catalyst is the lack of a new aircraft. But that could change soon, and the Paris Air Show may be the start of a push to stoke interest.""Middle market is going to be the big thing, "" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group. ""You'll see Boeing talk about new midsize aircraft.""Boeing is considering building a brand-new midrange plane, informally dubbed the ""797"" by some in the industry, as it looks to take back market share from Airbus' A321neo, which has allowed airlines to open new routes that weren't accessible with smaller planes and not profitable with larger ones.So far, Boeing has kept any details under wraps but could start talking it up at Paris so top customers hold off on any A321neo orders and instead wait for the 797. The new plane could carry 200-275 passengers up to 5,000 nautical miles and is expected to be available by 2024-2025.Airbus isn't waiting for an official launch. To counter the 797, the European company is reportedly working on a bigger variant of the A321 that would have new wings and a longer cabin. The A322neo would seat more than 240 passengers, vs. the 180-240 capacity for the A321, and fly farther than the A321's maximum range of 4,000 nautical miles.But both the 797 and A322neo won't actually be available for orders next week. What is likely to be unveiled at Paris is Boeing's 737 Max 10, which is seen as a stopgap to keep the A321neo at bay until the 797 is ready.Indonesia's Lion Air will likely be announced as a launch customer when Boeing officially unveils its Max 10, which will carry 190-230 people or 10-15 more than the 737 Max 9. Earlier this month, Lion Air Group President Director Edward Sirait confirmed to Reuters that the carrier would be a launch customer but wouldn't say how many of the new planes it will buy. United could also be among the first 737 Max 10 customers.Indian full-service carrier Jet Airways also is reportedly in talks to purchase 50 narrow-body jets worth at least $5.6 billion, with the 737 Max 10 seen more likely to be chosen than the A321neo.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing stock just hit a fresh record high and is at the top end of buying territory. The Dow Jones industrial average component has been a top performer this year, rising 25% year to date.All the activity in the midsize sector could help offset weakness in the widebody market.In particular, Airbus' super jumbo A380 could reach the end of its runway, as rising tensions in the Middle East, low oil prices, and President Trump's attempts to ban travel and electronic devices from the Mideast weigh on demand.""Emirates is throttling back their orders. They are pretty much the only customer after this year,"" Aboulafia said. ""Airbus is talking about less than one-per-month rates. That's not sustainable.""RELATED: How Boeing's Air Force Tanker Woes Are Helping Its Commercial PlanesDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

268,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) fell Tuesday as markets weighed conflicting reports on how a laptop ban may be widened on U.S. flights.X Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that laptops may be banned from the main cabins on all flights into and out of the U.S., despite a lobbying effort from the airline industry, which sent executives from the top U.S. carriers to meet with him earlier this month.On Tuesday afternoon, Politico reported the U.S. won't ban the devices on flights to the U.S. from Europe, following a call between Kelly, European Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, and EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc.A few hours later, a Homeland Security Department spokesman reportedly said that Kelly told his European counterparts that the ban is is ""still on the table.""The U.S. has already banned electronic devices larger than smartphones from inbound flights on several Middle East-based airlines originating from several Middle Eastern and African airports.That restriction has hurt carriers like Emirates, which competes against Delta, United and American for lucrative trans-Atlantic traffic. Earlier this month, Emirates said it will reduce flights to several U.S. destinations, citing the device ban as well as tougher policies on security vetting and visas.Shares of Delta sold off 3% early, then halved their losses before closing down 3.4% at 49.06 on the stock market today.

More domestic-focused carrier Alaska Air Group (ALK) lost 0.9%, and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) dipped 0.4%.Another factor potentially weighing on airline stocks is news that European budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) is looking to accelerate its global fleet growth with more narrow-body Boeing (BA) planes.The proliferation of low-cost carriers and the expansion of existing ones has turned the trans-Atlantic market into a cutthroat competitive environment and eroded the market share that Delta, United and American once commanded.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair rose 1.45% to 107.76 and are well into profit-taking sell territory after breaking out last month.RELATED:If Airplane Device Ban Expands, It Could Cost You This Much Virgin's Branson Was Asked About Starting A New Airline; He Said ThisThese Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts Stakes

270,LUV,"To the surprise of no one, air travelers like it more when police don't drag them off flights. The share of United Airlines (UAL) customers who said they'd consider flying with the carrier again plummeted to 22%, from 47%, in the 30 days after videos last month showed aviation security dragging a passenger from a United Express flight, YouGov BrandIndex has found.Those findings, published Wednesday, amounted to ""a significant and unusually fast drop,"" said the firm, which measures consumer perception. However, in Wednesday's findings it also said that two airlines ""seemed to benefit"" from the outrage the video drew: JetBlue (JBLU) and Southwest (LUV).The firm said that over the 30-day period ""purchase consideration"" for JetBlue among that carrier's customers rose to 30% from 24%; Southwest's rose to 57% from 53%. United's perception among its own customers has improved since May 9, a month after security dragged the passenger, David Dao, off a packed Louisville, Ky.-bound flight after he refused to give up his seat to accommodate crew members who were needed for another flight. The findings follow United's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Such events can take on the feel of a raucous town hall, but no investor asked about the dragging incident, according to a Chicago Tribune report. While travelers' feelings toward United have suffered, actual ticket sales are another matter. CEO Oscar Munoz said at the shareholder meeting that he hadn't seen that the incident had an impact on bookings. Analysts have also said that the financial fallout would be minimal — consumers in the U.S. are largely relegated to United, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) when they choose to fly. Those carriers control about 80% of U.S. flights. Shares of United dipped 0.2% to 81.25 on the stock market today, while American climbed 1.5%, and Delta added 0.8%. Southwest edged down 0.4%, and JetBlue gained 0.6%. United Airlines is just extended from an entry point, while the other four carriers' stocks are still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: More upbeat views on unit revenue and this week's sharp drop in oil prices have helped propel airlines stocks lately. American, Southwest and JetBlue are now in buy range. Meanwhile, United shares are up 13% since the dragging incident.

271,LUV,"When he was forcibly removed from his seat, Dao suffered a broken nose, a concussion, and the loss of two front teeth. He and United settled at the end of last month for undisclosed terms. Thomas Demetrio, one of Dao's lawyers, at that time said that Dao had become ""the unintended champion"" for disaffected air travelers demanding change to a way of business, incentivized by Wall Street, that crams passengers into planes — and which can tank an airline's stock price if workers are offered a raise.United apologized multiple times and announced a wave of policy changes after the incident, and Southwest said it would eventually end overbookings. The incident led to a congressional hearing in which one lawmaker suggested that airline executives hated the American people and another compared Dao's removal to a Trump campaign rally.RELATED:Now There Are 3 Airline Stocks In Buy Range As Summer Travel NearsUnited Won't Commit To Ending Denied Boardings; Defends Capacity Growth PlanDelta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook Strong
"
272,LUV,"X JetBlue (JBLU) on Tuesday ratcheted up its second-quarter unit-revenue forecast and said Q3 is looking better than anticipated, in keeping with similar news from Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) as the industry heads into warmer weather and the peak travel season.The more optimistic forecasts followed speculation earlier this year over whether postelection travel demand could rise to the industry's expectations.In a conference presentation, JetBlue said it expected Q2 unit revenue, a measure of an airline's sales compared with capacity, to rise 4% to 6%, up from an earlier forecast of 3% to 6%.JetBlue said unit revenue for May and June was expected to be positive and that it expected Q2 to benefit from the timing of the Fourth of July.Shares of JetBlue climbed 2.4% to 22.08 in the stock market today, retaking a 21.97 buy point after breaking out last month then selling off. That makes in the third notable U.S. airline stock that is in buy range currently. United Airlines (UAL) edged up 0.1%, still in the buy zone, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) added 1.2% after breaking out Monday.American Airlines rose 1% and Delta edged up 0.2%. American and Delta aren't in buy range, but they are approaching possible entries in their own consolidations.Earlier this month, American hiked its Q2 unit-revenue outlook to 3.5% to 5.5% from an earlier view of 3% to 5%, while Delta said it expected Q2 unit revenue to come within the upper range of a forecast for a 1%-to-3% increase.""We believe the revenue environment continues to improve as we head into the peak summer season, which appears consistent with recent commentary by U.S. airlines, particularly in the domestic market,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Even as demand improves domestically, Delta, American and United face rising competition from low-cost, long-haul carriers over the Atlantic. JetBlue has tried to strengthen its positions in Boston and Fort Lauderdale while expanding its premium Mint service, which offers more convenience before and during boarding, as well as free Wi-Fi and lie-flat seats.But Wall Street has questioned whether airlines can ensure they wouldn't over-expand capacity — an airline's supply of available seats and flight coverage — and risk greater competition from rivals, while also keeping labor costs in check.RELATED:These Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts StakesThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

274,LUV,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) edged closer to entry points Tuesday, a day after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) disclosed bigger positions in the carriers.Berkshire hiked its stake in American by 8.4% to 49.3 million shares, as compared to the fourth quarter. The firm bulked up its holdings in Southwest by 10.4% to 47.7 million.Berkshire's position in United Airlines (UAL) was unchanged, and its holdings in Delta Air Lines (DAL) were trimmed to 55 million shares, down 8.3%.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management dissolved its position in Delta.Shares of American ended the regular trading session up 0.6% to 46.94 on the stock market today, closing in on a 47.49 buy point. Southwest rose 0.4% to 58.27, just below a 58.83 entry. Delta shares were flat at 49.51, and United climbed 1.6% to 79.06, still in buying territory from a 76.90 entry.Buffett's disclosed investments in the airline industry — after previously calling airline stocks a ""death trap"" that had brought ""100 years with terrible results"" — helped lift the sector last year.Buffett reportedly reconsidered the airline industry after consolidation brought operational discipline and minimized competition, a characteristic he tends to prefer when he picks investments.President Trump's election, and the hopes of deregulation, a better economy and increased travel demand, also helped airline stocks. So did airlines' results, after rising fuel prices prompted the industry to tighten up flight capacity and improve unit revenue, a much-watched figure in the airline business.But despite the consolidation that may have attracted Buffett, airlines still try to match one another aggressively when they add service to different parts of the world, cutting fares as their supply of seats and flights rises — moves that threaten financials.Rising labor costs have also risked cutting into profits. And demand, while solid, perhaps wasn't as strong as once expected following the election.RELATED:This Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's PortfolioDelta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook Strong

275,LUV,"Richard Branson hinted that he was considering creating another U.S. airline following Alaska Air Group's (ALK) $2.6 billion purchase last year of Virgin America, the carrier that is part of the Virgin brand that he started.A new airline would have to compete in an industry whose barriers to entry have grown higher due to a decade of consolidation that has left Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) in control of 80% of U.S. traffic.Also, a new carrier would increase the supply of available flights, potentially sending fares lower, even as Wall Street pressures the industry to pull back on expanding flight coverage to shore up profit.In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Thursday, Branson had been discussing the royalties that Alaska must pay Virgin. He said that Alaska would ""carry on paying royalties — unless we decide to start another airline. So, we'll see what happens.""When asked if starting a new airline was something he would be willing to do, he said: ""Watch this space.""Shares of Alaska were up 2.2% to close at 84.57 on the stock market today. Delta rallied 1.1% to 48.20, while American rose 1.3% to 45.22, heading for a 47.49 buy point. United climbed 2.6% to 77.98, going back above its 76.90 buy point, as Southwest gained 1.3% to 58.04, creeping closer to its 58.83 entry.IBD'S TAKE: The International Air Transport Association estimates that an expansion of the in-flight electronics restrictions imposed by President Trump would cost passengers more than $1 billion annually.Branson's remarks come as Virgin and Alaska argue over how long Alaska should pay royalties. Branson has said that Alaska has to pay royalties on the Virgin brand through 2040, based on the terms of a licensing agreement.However, Alaska, which will retire the Virgin brand in 2019, has said there were many ways out of that deal and that they didn't believe they should keep paying for a name they weren't using.Meanwhile, Alaska's acquisition of Virgin gives it a chance to toughen up its position against Delta on the West Coast and on transcontinental flights.But some have argued that Virgin, despite its upbeat, more cosmopolitan take on air travel, struggled to compete against larger rivals on profitability and against the cheap fares offered by budget carriers.Meanwhile travel demand has been strong, but some analysts have said it hasn't been as strong as once expected following the election. Higher labor costs also threaten the industry's margins.Higher oil prices in recent months also have helped chasten the industry. But that could help capacity stay under control by preventing overexpansion and excess competition.Berkshire Hathaway's (BKRB) Warren Buffett has continued to buy airline stocks after last year's surprise change of heart about investing in the industry as the benefit of consolidation became clear.In its most recent filing, Berkshire hiked its stake in American by 8.4% to 49.3 million shares in Q1 vs. Q4 and bulked up its holdings in Southwest by 10.4% to 47.7 million. Berkshire's position in United was unchanged, and its holdings in Delta were trimmed 8.3% to 55 million shares.RELATED:These Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts StakesThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

276,LUV,"XDelta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said that more legislation to regulate the overbooking of flights wasn't necessary and called the practice a ""valid business process,"" and it emphasized that it handled involuntary boarding denials better than rivals.The remarks from the carrier, on a conference call to discuss first-quarter earnings, came after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday called for a halt to the rule that enables airlines to overbook flights after a passenger was dragged from a sold-out United Express flight on Sunday.Delta, however, would not comment on whether it was concerned that more regulations on overbooking were coming. The airline said that managing overbooked flights before boarding was crucial and that the process wasn't a ""significant challenge"" for them.Delta on Wednesday said it had 1,200 involuntary boarding denials last year. That was five times better than other major carriers, it said.Government data, as reported elsewhere, has shown that Delta had the lowest rate of involuntary removals last year and from 2008 through 2016 among major U.S. airlines. United, the data shows, has reduced the rate at which it bumps passengers against their will.Delta sees passenger unit revenue, the metric that Wall Street zeros in on to gauge an airline's efficiency, rising 1%-3% in Q2. That was in line with Wall Street forecasts for a 2% gain. Second-quarter capacity was seen as flat to up 1%. Full-year capacity growth will be capped at 1%.Delta earned 77 cents per share in the first quarter, above estimates for 75 cents. Revenue of $9.148 billion was shy of expectations for $9.184 billion. Total passenger unit revenue edged down 0.5% but was positive in March for the first time since November 2015.""We expect the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure to have occurred in the March quarter from higher fuel prices,"" said CFO Paul Jacobson in a statement. ""With an improving revenue profile and further improvement as our cost growth moderates in the second half, we are on track to expand margins for the balance of the year.""Delta fell 0.5% to 45.05 on the stock market today, reversing from morning highs of 47.17 as broader averages retreated. American Airlines (AAL) clung to a 0.1% gain. United Airlines (UAL), which reports Monday, briefly erased its weekly losses and peeked above its 50-day line, but retreated for a 1.1% decline.Delta's outlook comes after the carrier this month canceled around 4,000 flights following heavy thunderstorms around Atlanta. Management said the storm will reduce its Q2 pretax income by $125 million.Delta, during the earnings call, said the carrier was not understaffed, but that a combination of severe storms around Atlanta during the spring-break travel season limited what it could do to accommodate passengers. The carrier said it was investing in technology to help better track crews to minimize disruption.The carrier said it had completed its expansion of its basic economy fare option in the U.S. and Canada. It described its recent joint-venture agreement with Korean Air as a ""game-changer"" and said alliances in the trans-Pacific region were ""crucial.""IBD'S TAKE: U.S. airlines have paid more attention to Asia, where a massive upswing in travel demand is expected in the years to come. Meanwhile, they also face more competition from low-cost carriers in Europe. But Delta's flight cancellations and United's difficulties have brought more scrutiny over the way airlines manage bookings — and the dignity that carriers afford passengers.The industry has used higher-end fares and business travel to drive unit revenue while testing the boundaries for ""economy"" seating amid ultra-low-cost competition. Wall Street has pressed for fuller flights and limited availability — moves that can squeeze airfares and profits higher and boost airline stocks. Airlines also regularly overbook flights as a hedge against people who don't end up aboard the plane.United has drawn sweeping condemnation after video posted on social media showed police wrestling a passenger, David Dao, from his seat and dragging him by his wrists down the aisle of a sold-out United Express flight heading to Louisville, Ky., from Chicago.The situation arose after the carrier said it needed four passengers to give up their seats to accommodate crew members needed for another flight. After a voucher offer didn't work, the carrier selected passengers to leave. Dao refused; authorities dragged him away.In an interview with ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" broadcast Wednesday, United CEO Oscar Munoz said he felt ""shame"" watching the incident. He said that in the future the carrier would not use a law enforcement official to remove ""a booked, paid, seating passenger. We can't do that.""United Airlines later said it would reimburse tickets for everyone on the flight.Since the incident occurred, United has appeared to try to balance defending its reputation while standing by its employees. Munoz said language used in prior remarks — including an apology for ""having to reaccommodate"" passengers, which drew ridicule given what video footage showed — ""fell short"" of what he and the company were feeling.He called the incident a ""system failure"" and said United needed to look at the way it offers incentives to passengers once they board planes.""We have not provided our front-line supervisors and managers and individuals with the proper tools, policies, procedures that allow them to use their common sense,"" Munoz said. ""They all have an incredible amount of common sense, and this issue could have been solved by that. That's on me. I have to fix that.""He said he hasn't spoken to Dao and that the company's attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful. Munoz told ABC he had not considered resigning.On Tuesday, Munoz said the carrier would conduct a review of its relationships with airport and local authorities and the way it handles oversold flights and present the findings in some form by April 30.RELATED:What The New Travel Ban Means For Airlines, Travel Demand

277,LUV,"As Delta Air Lines (DAL) prepares to report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, its second quarter has started off with real, actual headwinds.The carrier over the past several days has had to cancel more than 3,000 flights after powerful thunderstorms last Wednesday swept through Atlanta, Delta's biggest hub airport, and bad weather hit the Northeast.Along with that weather, which the carrier described as ""convective activity and storm cells, mixed with tornadic conditions,"" rest and work guidelines have limited the availability of flight crews, forcing more delays and cancellations.What's more, as Wall Street pressures Delta and rivals to pull back on expanding service — constraining available seats to push up airfares and unit revenue — Delta said last week said that customer ""call volumes remain high and Spring Break travel means reaccommodation opportunities are limited.""Anyway, nobody's happy, and the difficulties come as Delta's Q2 outlook will likely be a big focus when the company reports Q1 results. Analysts expect Q1 earnings per share to slide 44% to 74 cents, as rising fuel and labor costs cut into profits. Revenue is seen edging down to $9.19 billion.Raymond James said Monday in a research note that the storms could take roughly one percentage point off Delta's Q2 unit revenue.""Storms at times tend to boost (passenger unit revenue) because the resulting capacity (ASM) decline is greater than the lost revenue,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in Monday's research note.""However,"" she continued, ""this is when impacted passengers can be re-booked easily, which is typically when the airline can be proactive about repositioning aircraft and crew ahead of severe weather or there is sufficient slack in the system.""The possible dent to the second quarter follows Delta's decision last week to cut its Q1 outlook for unit revenue, a measure of sales in relation to capacity, to a roughly 0.5% decline. The company said ticket prices on flights booked closer to departure weren't as strong as they'd expected.In March, Delta said it expected the metric to be flat. Earlier, the company said the metric could actually come in positive, something Wall Street has wanted for around two years.Shares of Delta closed down 0.4% at 44.97 in the stock market today, while American Airlines (AAL) rallied 1.2% and United Airlines (UAL) gained 0.9%. Southwest Airlines (LUV) dipped 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline stocks come off a postelection rally and try to temper investor expectations, global travel demand remained solid in February, the International Air Transport Association said last week. Still, Delta has said it expects to be in a position to improve margins in the back half of the year as unit revenue improves. The company in January said it expected ""the margin pressure to peak"" during Q1.And, as Cowen analyst Helane Becker noted, Q3 should be an easier year-over-year comparison. In Q3 of last year, the company's results were hurt due to a massive technology outage that also prompted scores of flight cancellations.RELATED:'Fly The Friendly Skies' United To Review Forced Removal Of PassengerDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticDelta, American Eye Trans-Pacific Market As Trans-Atlantic Rivals Grow

Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) will report Q1 results, the first airline and the first big company to issue financials this earnings season.U.S.-listed shares of Brazilian airline Gol jumped 7.1% to close at 32.90 on the stock market today, clearing a 31.92 buy point. The stock has been helped by the trading debut of Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras (AZUL), Brazil's third-largest airline by passengers, which climbed 7.2% to 21.50 after pricing American depository shares at about 20.06 Monday and raising $571.2 million. Irish budget carrier Ryanair rallied 2.45% to finish at 87.76, topping an 86.05 entry.U.S. discount airline Southwest rose 1.4% to 55.06, making its way toward a 59.78 entry, and JetBlue gained 1.4% to end at 21.54, closing in on a 23.25 buy point.For all its PR woes, United shares are 8% below a 76.90 buy point.

American recently took a stake in China Southern Airlines (ZNH), following Delta's acquisition of a stake in China Eastern Airlines (CEA) in 2015.The carrier reports Q1 results before the market opens.Estimates: EPS to drop 43% to 75 cents as revenue dips 0.7% to $9.19 billion.Stock: Shares finished 0.7% higher at 45.29 but remain well below their 50-day average.While expectations for the airline sector were high following a rise in postelection demand, Delta last week cut its outlook for Q1 unit revenue, saying fare prices for last-minute domestic flights were ""more modest than initially anticipated.""Delta's Q2 outlook will likely be a big focus as more than 3,000 flights were canceled in the last several days after powerful thunderstorms last Wednesday swept through Atlanta, Delta's biggest hub airport, and bad weather hit the Northeast.RELATED:Delta To Report Q1 Earnings As Total Mess In Atlanta Looms Over Q2

282,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) on Friday stuck with its first-quarter unit outlook predicting a drop in revenue, but said that key metric and booking trends ""remain strong"" heading into the second quarter.The results come as Delta Air Lines (DAL) prepares to kick off the first-quarter earnings season for the airline industry on Wednesday.The airlines' outlook for the second quarter seems likely to be a focus for investors, after Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest trimmed their first-quarter unit-revenue forecasts after initial high hopes following the election. Stifel last month said demand remained healthy but was perhaps not as strong as initially expected.Southwest on Friday said it continues to expect unit revenue, a measure of an airline's sales as they relate to its available seats and overall flight coverage, to fall 2%-3%.The carrier said March traffic rose 3.9%, while flight capacity grew by 4.5% and load factor dipped to 84.1% from 84.6% a year earlier.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline investors worry about the industry's ability to manage airfares and capacity, as well as the impact of President Trump's attempted travel ban, the International Air Transport Association says global travel demand largely held up in February. Investors largely shrugged off the news. Southwest shares closed up 2.2% on the stock market today. Shares are currently in a flat base.

283,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL), which resurrected its ""fly the friendly skies"" slogan a few years ago, said it would review Sunday's forcible removal of a passenger, who was taken to a hospital for injuries, while the police officer involved was put on leave for violating standard procedure.The Associated Press reported earlier that airline staff had chosen four passengers to get off the flight, which United said was overbooked. Three agreed to leave Flight 3411, headed to Louisville from Chicago, but the fourth didn't.Video surfaced Sunday showing police grabbing the passenger, wrestling him from his seat and dragging him by his wrists down the aisle after he didn't want to leave the flight. The man can be seen screaming as he was removed, then turning motionless and silent, followed by exclamations from passengers.One of the officers involved didn't follow standard procedure and was placed on leave, Chicago's aviation department told the AP. The passenger, who was described by Chicago police as ""a 69-year-old Asian male,"" was taken to a hospital after his head hit an armrest, according to a statement obtained by NBC News. Another passenger told the AP that the man who was dragged off the plane said he is a doctor and needed to see patients the next day.""This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in an emailed statement. ""I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly with him to address and resolve this situation.""@United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane. Here's how they did it: pic.twitter.com/QfefM8X2cW— Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017""After our team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate,"" United said in a statement to Business Insider. ""We apologize for the overbook situation.""""We followed the right procedures,"" a United spokesman told the Associated Press. ""That plane had to depart. We wanted to get our customers to their destinations, and when one gentleman refused to get off the aircraft, we had to call the Chicago Police Department.""United, in the statement to Business Insider, referred further inquiries about the passenger to authorities.Even as people online expressed disgust with how the situation was handled, Wall Street's reaction was muted. Shares closed up 0.9% in the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday as it works out its own booking issues, slipped 0.4%. American Airlines (AAL) climbed 1.2%. Southwest (LUV) edged down 0.6%.United last month drew ridicule after it kept two teenage girls who were wearing leggings from a flight. The two girls were boarding with passes that give free boarding to United employees or their family. The company said the leggings ran afoul of its attire standards for such passengers, which the company says represent it when they board.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline stocks come off a postelection rally and try to temper investor expectations, global travel demand remained solid in February, the International Air Transport Association said last week. After the close Monday, United said it expects Q1 passenger unit revenue to be ""approximately flat,"" compared to a forecast last month for a range of down 1% to up 1%. United said that passenger traffic for March rose 3%, with capacity up 3.4%.Meanwhile, Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) boosted its first-quarter unit-revenue outlook to a 6.5%-8% increase, up from an earlier forecast of a 4%-7% bump.The company also hiked its unit-cost outlook for the quarter, to a 6%-8% increase, to reflect a new pilot contract and new accounting standards.""With the pilot contract now in place, the focus for the company will shift to execution,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""Hawaiian is facing increased competitive capacity in the neighbor island markets, but continues to see better yields from the West Coast to Hawaii.""For the year to date, Hawaiian said capacity rose 3.5%. Hawaiian said passenger traffic in March rose 7.2%, with capacity up 4.5%.Hawaiian jumped 5.3% on Monday. The stock's 50-day and 200-day lines have nearly come together in recent days.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said March traffic rose 5.5%, with capacity up 5.7%. Year-to-date, traffic rose 4.7%, while capacity increased 4.9%.

284,LUV,"Stocks opened higher Thursday as markets digested mixed earnings and economic news ahead of a significant after-hours reporting session.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1% as the Nasdaq led with a 0.3% increase.Despite a weak finish Wednesday, the major indexes headed into Thursday's session in strong standing so far this week. The Dow industrials were up 2.1% and leaning toward their best weekly performance since early December. The Nasdaq composite is up 1.9% and tapping new highs. The S&P 500 opens with a 1.7% gain so far this week, and within a half percent of its March 1 record.Earnings reports were the driving factor in early action, but the premarket also felt some pressure from oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate down 2% to below $49 a barrel. Overseas markets may also factor into early action. Europe's markets were under pressure in afternoon trade, as London's FTSE 100 dropped 0.6% and Frankfurt's DAX slumped 0.5%.On the Dow, Cisco Systems (CSCO) rose 1% after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to outperform.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company reported after Wednesday's close its first-quarter earnings rose 167% and revenue climbed 36%, beating forecasts. The stock broke out from a base with a 94.82 buy point.Also in the early winners camp, PayPal Holdings (PYPL) was up nearly 6% after reporting late Wednesday a strong first quarter and a new $5 billion share buyback program. A 19% earnings advance and a 17% rise in earnings were enough to top analyst views, and management's full-year guidance was just above consensus targets. The stock is extended from a 43.90 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Netherlands-based Yandex (YNDX) chalked up an early 5% advance. The operator of the most widely used search engine on Russia's internet reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter. The stock broke out past the 24.65 buy point in a cup with handle base.On the downside, American Airlines Group (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) all posted sharp losses after their quarterly results.Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) drilled 18% lower after first-quarter earnings and revenue missed expectations by wide margins, and management lowered guidance to below views.F5 Networks (FFIV) cratered 8%, as fiscal second-quarter earnings and third-quarter earnings guidance missed analyst targets.Citrix Systems (CTXS) fell 2%. Citrix reported late Wednesday its first-quarter results met or narrowly beat analyst estimates, but second-quarter guidance was below views. Robert W.

286,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) trimmed its first-quarter unit-revenue forecast Tuesday, saying the rebound in prices of U.S. flights booked closer to departure was ""more modest than initially anticipated.""The more muted outlook follows other moves in recent weeks by Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) to temper Wall Street's expectations after travel demand rose postelection, airlines tightened up operations, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Warren Buffett got behind the industry.In an investor update, Delta said that passenger unit revenue, or sales from passengers as they relate to overall flight capacity, likely fell around 0.5% in Q1. The company last month said it expected the metric to come in flat for Q1, worse than an earlier projection for as much as a 2% increase.The carrier expects capacity to have declined 0.5% for the quarter, compared with an earlier capacity forecast for flat to down 1%.Delta also forecast operating margin of 10% to 11%, in line with earlier guidance. The company said it expected the effects of higher fuel costs to hit their peak for the year during the first quarter. Delta has said it would be able to improve margins later on in the year.Delta closed down 2.6% on the stock market today. American dropped 3.7%, United Airlines (UAL) lost 2.2%, and Southwest eased 1.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Along with low-cost carriers in the U.S., Delta, American and United face growing competition from budget carriers in Europe. Travel demand is seen as still solid, but maybe not as intense as once expected. Thousands of flights were also canceled last month due to Winter Storm Stella.In a separate report out Tuesday, Delta said that passenger unit revenue for March rose 0.5%, its first positive monthly showing since November 2015. Passenger traffic rose 2.3% during the month, and capacity grew 1%.The March passenger unit revenue figure was shy of investors' expectations for a 1% to 3% gain, according to a research note from Raymond James out Tuesday.""U.S. airline shares are also under pressure as Delta's results likely indicate that March did not see a material improvement from trends in February,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in that research note.Delta's passenger unit revenue was flat in February and fell 2.5% in January.RELATED:Delta, American Eye Trans-Pacific Market As Trans-Atlantic Rivals GrowLufthansa, AirAsia Escalate Low-Cost Challenge To Delta, AmericanWhat The New Travel Ban Means For Airlines, Travel Demand
"
287,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Korean Air have agreed to form a joint venture to share costs, sales and schedules and expand code-sharing, Delta said early Wednesday Eastern time, a move that could strengthen its position in the trans-Pacific as competition escalates just about everywhere else.The agreement comes after American Airlines (AAL) on Tuesday agreed to invest $200 million in China Southern Airlines (ZNH).That decision, American said, would give travelers ""an unmatched range of destinations in two critical markets for business and leisure travelers."" The two carriers are expected to begin a code-sharing agreement later this year.The International Air Transport Association has forecast that China will be come the world's biggest air-travel market by 2024, Bloomberg noted. Delta already owns part of China Eastern Airlines (CEA).The focus on the trans-Pacific comes as low-cost carriers try to chip away at areas long controlled by the big three U.S. network carriers. Budget carrier Frontier Airlines is reportedly hoping for an IPO in the second quarter. British Airways parent International Airlines Group this month said it would launch a low-cost, long-haul airline that would fly to the U.S. from Barcelona.IBD'S TAKE: As U.S. carriers turn toward the trans-Pacific, they already face a new breed of low-cost, long-haul carrier over the trans-Atlantic. Shares of Delta closed down 1.25% on the stock market today as higher crude futures signal higher fuel costs ahead. American Air slid 1.5%. United Airlines (UAL) lost 1.3%. Both Delta and United were making their way through consolidation patterns.Delta's agreement with Korean Air still awaits regulatory approval, would cover more than 80 destinations in Asia and more than 290 in the Americas. Delta flights from Atlanta to Seoul will start in June, while Korean Air this summer will add service from Seoul to the West Coast.""This agreement deepens our long-standing partnership with Korean Air and will provide the global access and seamless service our customers demand,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement.Korean Air's CEO, Yang Ho Cho, said the move would help ""reinforce Incheon airport's position as a major international hub in North East Asia and support the growth of Korea's aviation industry.""And more broadly, the international picture for U.S. airlines could grow more complicated. The U.K. on Wednesday formally declared its intent to leave the European Union following a vote to do so last summer, potentially jeopardizing the airlines' ""Open Skies"" agreements in the area. Meanwhile, President Trump's second attempt at a travel ban remains tied up in federal court.Among more domestic-focused carriers, Southwest Airlines (LUV) stock fell 1.3%, Alaska Air Group (ALK) 2.1% and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) 0.9%.RELATED:What The New Travel Ban Means For Airlines, Travel Demand

289,LUV,"Stocks expanded their midday gains Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, hiked short-term interest rates by a quarter-point but hinted that it would continue to act prudently before engaging in further increases in the cost of money.Meanwhile, oil stocks got a much needed lift after getting slammed in recent days as crude oil futures rallied. West Texas Intermediate futures rose more than 2%, to $48.79 a barrel. Meanwhile, the metals, medical, heavy industrial and transport sectors also showed resilience.For instance, airline industry leader Southwest Air (LUV) is halting a seven-session losing streak and reversed off its lows, with a 2% gain, to 53.90, in fast turnover. Watch to see if the consumer- and business-spending play can climb back above its 50-day moving average. Shares are still up 8% year to date, better than the S&P 500's roughly 6% advance. Randgold Resources (GOLD) surged 3.3%, to 86.97, and is trying to retake its 50-day line. AngloGold Ashanti (AU) jumped 7.1%, to 10.54, but remains far depressed from its 52-week highs.Meanwhile, in the steel sector, Leaderboard name and industry top dog Nucor (NUE) rallied more than 3%, to 62.72, in low volume; watch to see if it can keep climbing and pierce through the top of its three-week handle with a 65.50 buy point.Nucor is seen growing Q1 profit by 230%, to 76 cents a share. Earnings have rebounded 28%, 43%, 144% and 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters. A fifth sector, banking, is also regaining some lost ground; Bank of New York Mellon (BK) rose 0.6%, to 48.56, and is close to surpassing a 48.88 buy point within a nine-week cup-with-handle pattern.Small-cap issues are leading the stock market today with the Russell 2000 up 1.2%, vs. a 0.6% lift by the Nasdaq composite and 0.7% for the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrials lagged, up 0.4%, but at least five of the 30 components rose at least 1 point or more, including Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and United Technologies (UTX).  J&J has cleared a 122.60 early buy point within its long saucer construction. The left-side high of 126.07 also offers an entry point at 10 cents above that price.J&J has now risen slightly more than 5% past the early buy point. Be sure not to chase breakout stocks more than 5% past the proper entry. The reason: often a stock will pull back and try to shake out weak holders as it test support at or near the proper entry. IBD founder Bill O'Neil's study of the greatest market winners found that rarely does a leading stock market winner fall more than 7%-8% below the proper buy point in a cup, double bottom, flat base or other bullish pattern before a stock charges to new highs.Notice how, on the weekly chart, in six straight prior up weeks, J&J rose in above-average turnover in five of those weeks. That bodes well for the diversified medical products giant as it indicates surging demand for shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, banks and the like. J&J's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now a sprightly A-; the proprietary grade goes from E (heavy distribution) to A+ (heavy accumulation).J&J's 66 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 relects the big cap's long basing action and is sharply improved from as low as 26 just eight weeks ago. Among small and mid-cap names, focus on those with RS ratings of 80 or higher before they break out.Even with the move by the Fed to increase the fed funds rate to a 0.75%-1% target range, observers applauded the U.S. central bank's decision to maintain a careful and gradual approach to ""normalizing"" the bond markets.""The weaker dollar itself is a reflection of the Fed's policy path,"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD. ""Markets see the Fed keeping a lid on the dollar and providing a bid for U.S. exporters, commodities and emerging markets.""The U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the Japanese yen.In the meantime, keep an eye out for the reaction by European equity markets on Wednesday's Dutch elections, which are being perceived as a test of Europeans' tolerance of immigrants, particularly from the Middle East. The Dutch elections could also have ramifications for the future of the eurozone. In June last year, Britons shocked the world by voting to leave the single-currency region.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Dow Industrials Components Now?How To Invest: Why The Base-On-Base Pattern Makes Money For InvestorsThe Top Market Sectors Today: See IBD's Smart Research Tables

290,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) on Wednesday hiked its full-year outlook for carrying capacity, while Alaska Air Group (ALK) announced another set of new flights from the West Coast.The less-than-ideal forecasts came a day after airline stocks sank on a wave of flight cancellations due to Winter Storm Stella, and a day before President Trump's new temporary travel ban takes hold.United, in a slide presentation at the JPMorgan Aviation, Transportation & Industrials Conference, said it expects full-year growth in capacity — an airline's available seats and flight coverage — of 2.5%-3.5%. That's up from a prior outlook of 1%-2% growth.United's extra flight coverage comes as Alaska Airlines on Wednesday said it would add six new routes from San Diego — part of a broader plan to establish a stronghold on the West Coast. Alaska Air Group, which recently bought Virgin America, said last week that it would add 13 new flight routes from the Bay Area.Investors over much of the past two years have wanted airlines to temper their plans to increase capacity after cheap oil made it easier to expand and compete. That expansion prompted concerns that the industry was adding flights and cutting fares too aggressively.In the fourth quarter, Wall Street got what it wanted. Consumer confidence and travel demand picked up after the election. Even Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB), where Warren Buffett was perhaps convinced that the airlines could operate with the discipline of other large industries, got behind the business. But there have been concerns recently that capacity could creep back up, now that demand and fundamentals have improved.Still, United on Wednesday said it expected positive passenger-unit revenue in Q2 and sees unit costs to be lower for the year than initially expected.During United's Q1 earnings call in January, President Scott Kirby said that, assuming the market holds up the way it has, ""I think we're going to be at positive (passenger-unit revenue) either this quarter, or certainly next quarter.""The company on Wednesday said the first quarter ""has played out largely as expected.""Airline shares reversed higher, with United closing up 2.4% at 68.17 on the stock market today after falling earlier to 64.32, puncturing the bottom of a flat base. Delta Air Lines (DAL) climbed 2%, American Airlines (AAL) rose 2.1%, and Southwest (LUV) gained 2.7%. Alaska added 0.9%.Delta, in its own conference presentation Wednesday, said that rising postelection demand in the U.S. had spilled over into 2017. And it said that business yields — or a measure of an airline's ability to charge business travelers more for airfare — had improved ""but remain well below historical levels.""American's presentation touted the carrier's ""unprecedented investment in product,"" saying it expected capital expenditures to surpass Delta and United this year. The company said that with the addition of new jets and the retirement of old ones, it expected to have ""the youngest fleet of the major airlines"" by the end of the year.IBD'S TAKE: Along with the stress of matching rivals on when they add flights or cut fares, the major U.S. airlines also have to contend with low-cost carriers that have set their sights on the trans-Atlantic. Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said in a regulatory filing that it expected Q1 unit revenue to fall 4%-5%, more than its prior view for a 2.5% dip. The shift in timing for the Easter holiday to April this year is affecting March travel plans. Delta, American and Southwest also have cut unit revenue forecasts for Q1.But Spirit, like United, said it expected unit revenue to turn positive in Q2.Spirit rose 2.6% on Wednesday.Wednesday's stock gains in the sector followed two days of steep losses as Winter Storm Stella hit the Northeast and forced thousands of flight cancellations, pressuring the Dow Jones Transportation Average.CFRA analyst Jim Corridore said that the financial impact of the storm would be lighter than others and the airlines were well-prepared as the storm approached. He also said that oil prices had fallen over the past week and could keep falling, potentially easing the cost burden for the airlines in the months ahead.""We think U.S. airlines were well positioned ahead of Winter Storm Stella, cancelling flights to ensure equipment does not get stranded and operations can quickly scale up once the storm passes,"" he wrote in a research note, later adding that ""storms are part of the airline business.""RELATED:Southwest Joins Delta, American In Cutting Unit Revenue Forecast

293,LUV,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) got decked Tuesday as Winter Storm Stella buried the Northeast, a day after cancellations piled up in anticipation of the storm.American said it and its regional partners had canceled more than 1,675 flights Tuesday and 400 flights for Wednesday. Delta had canceled more than 900 flights. Southwest had canceled more than 1,300 flights from Monday through Wednesday, the carrier said on Monday. About 6,800 flights have been canceled so far today, according to FlightAware.com.Delta expects operations to resume on Tuesday evening, albeit with a reduced schedule. Flights ""should return to relative normalcy"" on Wednesday, the carrier said, but added that its schedule depended on whether New York's mass transit system has resumed service and other facilities were in decent enough shape.Meanwhile, American said all Tuesday flights in New York and Boston have been canceled, but it would resume normal operations at airports in those cities on Wednesday at noon Eastern Time. American also said that any restoration of service depends on the weather, the roads and the state of public transportation.Shares of American closed down 2.7% in the stock market today, setting a four-month low after losing 3.5% Monday. Delta lost 2.3%, also hitting a four-month low, on top of Monday's 1.2% loss. Southwest fell 3%, undercutting its 50-day line, after retreating 2.5% Monday. United, which has a hub in Newark, N.J., tumbled 4.7%, worse than Monday's 3.4% sell-off. JetBlue (JBLU), which has a hub at JFK airport, dropped 1%. The Dow Jones Transportation Average dipped 1.4%.IBD'S TAKE: The flight cancellations announced this week come as President Trump's new travel ban is set to take hold on Thursday. Airline stocks have risen on postelection demand and Trump's promises to lighten regulations on the industry. Here's a look at what the travel ban means for travel demand. The cancellations also raise further questions about airlines' unit revenue. Southwest, Delta and American have all cut their first-quarter forecasts for the metric, which measures revenue in relation to flight capacity, after offering a more upbeat outlook over the past few months.In reporting February traffic results, American pulled back from its unit-revenue outlook in part due to its year-to-date completion factor — that is, the rate at which an airline completes its scheduled flights — which added to the carrier's capacity.Southwest, in lowering its unit-revenue forecast, also cited a higher completion factor, an abnormal amount of rain in California that hit passenger traffic, and weaker close-in bookings.""Our view is that the demand environment remains very healthy, but perhaps it is somewhat softer than airlines were expecting based on the acceleration post election,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note last week.RELATED:Buffett's Berkshire Piles On Shares Of Apple, Airlines, Cuts Wal-MartThis Is Why Airline Stocks Are Big Market Losers Today

295,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) shares fell as the major carrier said consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 5.5% in February. Meanwhile, Alaska Air (ALK) initially dipped after reporting that capacity growth is still outstripping traffic growth.But Delta and Alaska stock charts are still acting well.Delta shares fell 0.7% on the stock market today to 48.55, closing near session highs. The stock is still working on a handle in its cup-with-handle base with a 49.55 buy point. Shares retook their key 50-day moving average on Feb. 22. Prior to that, shares had largely been in a period of consolidation following two failed breakouts in late 2015.Traffic rose 5.3% for the month, slightly less than the 6% capacity growth it logged in February. Load factor fell from 80.3% to 79.7%.Delta also reported an 86.4% on-time performance rate and mainline completion factor of 99.6%.""Across all entities, booking trends into the peak leisure season are strong and corporate demand remains solid as higher volumes continued to offset lower yields,"" said the company in a release.Delta, American Airlines (AAL), United Continental (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) have all recently hiked airfares.Separately, Alaska Air on Wednesday reported a 13.8% increase in traffic -- i.e., revenue passenger miles (RPM). But capacity swelled 18% as measured in available seat miles (ASM). Load factor fell 3 points to 80.4%, said the company.Several other carriers, including Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines (LUV), late last year trimmed ambitious expansion plans amid capacity concerns.Alaska Air stock fell in the morning, but rose 0.25% at the close. The stock has been forming a deep cup base since December, with shares climbing comfortably above the key 200-day level on Tuesday after finding support at the 50-day moving average on Feb. 24.United shares fell 0.8%, JetBlue shares rose 0.45% and Southwest Air 1.3%.RELATED:Why Delta Air Lines Is Accelerating Its Stock Buyback In Q1
"
296,LUV,"Most airlines court business customers -- or more accurately their business expense accounts -- but Hawaiian Airlines is finding success catering primarily to vacationers in the U.S., Asia and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim.Mai Tais and pupus, truly friendly skies and an on-time record that’s the envy of the industry: these are the competitive advantages of the airline and its parent, Hawaiian Holdings (HA). Its unique model focuses sharply on bringing an island-like experience to its patrons.“It really caters to the leisure customer,” CRT Capital analyst Michael Derchin told IBD. “Maybe 1% of their market is business.""Derchin, who has a buy rating on Hawaiian, says he initiated coverage with a buy rating back in February 2014, when the stock was trading around 11. Now it's approaching 50.“It’s been a grand slam home run,” he said.Hawaiian, which expanded into Australia in 2004 and began daily service to Tokyo’s Haneda airport in 2010, has been growing its long-haul business. This year, it will begin service to Tokyo’s Narita airport. Hawaiian says it flew a record 10.7 million passengers in 2015, a 4.7% increase from 2014.“The allure of Hawaii is really pretty universal,” Hawaiian Chief Commercial Officer Peter Ingram told IBD. As the middle class grows in Korea and China, the airline expects to fly more Asian tourists to Hawaii, he said.Ingram notes that Japan has always had a big presence in Hawaii and that tourism from Japan is rising with the strengthening yen. The airline currently flies from Hawaii to Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa, Tahiti, Japan, South Korea and China.He also said that Hawaiian offers service to smaller cities on the Pacific Rim, such as Auckland in New Zealand, Brisbane in Australia, and Japan's Sapporo, that “don’t register on the map of the big carriers.” Though, after Hawaiian began service to Auckland, American Airlines (AAL) started flying there too, says Ingram.And of course, the airline outpaces everyone on inter-island flights within the Hawaiian chain, with about 160 daily departures.“We understand travel to Hawaii better than anyone. We’re prepared to take on any competitor who enters the market,” said Ingram.All of the big three U.S. carriers, American, United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) compete with Hawaiian for the mainland-to-Hawaii business. Alaska Airlines (ALK) and Virgin America (VA) also offer flights. And Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways also flies to Hawaii from Japan.Additionally, wags have predicted for years that Southwest Airlines (LUV) would enter the Hawaii market. But it won’t happen this year, says Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen & Co., who spoke with IBD.“Southwest doesn’t have any aircraft with extended over-water operations certification,” she said. “It would take about a year to get ... certified from the FAA on the existing fleet. And we would know if they applied for it. … They haven’t, so we don’t view Southwest as a short-term threat.”Becker rates Hawaiian at market perform. She says the stock is at a high valuation, but adds, “They’re a very strong competitor on the West Coast, and they’ve been growing aggressively.”For each of the past 12 years, Hawaiian has led U.S. carriers in on-time performance, according the U.S. Department of Transportation. And the airline is noted for its top-notch service; it even still serves food, included in the fare on mainland-to-Hawaii flights.It’s also adding luxury to its liners. In October 2015, Hawaiian said it will put lie-flat seating in its Airbus (EADSY) A330 premium cabins.“Those airplanes do all our long-haul flying outside Hawaii,” said Ingram. Hawaiian’s customers are couples or families, he said. And unlike business travelers, they don’t necessarily want isolation.“We’ve worked to custom design” the seats to accommodate our customers, he said. “We will have planes with these seats in the second or third quarter of this year.”Ingram says the majority of Hawaiian's A330s will be retrofitted by the end of 2017.The airline is also adding the A321 NEO to its fleet this year -- a single-aisle, smaller long-haul aircraft. It will enable Hawaiian to fly more cost-effectively from smaller locations on the West Coast of North America to Hawaii, said Ingram.The airline's net income for its fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31, more than tripled to $37.9 million from $11.1 million in the year-earlier period. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rocketed up to 66 cents from 17 cents in the year-earlier quarter.Yet, total revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter to $574.2 million from $574.8 million. For the full year, total revenue grew a bit to $2.32 billion from $2.31 billion. The company’s revenue took a hit from foreign-currency impacts, reduced fuel surcharges (from lower fuel costs) and thus lower total fares, as well as higher capacity from competitors, which put pressure on the fares in North America, Ingram said.So what’s fueling the jump in income and earnings on declining revenue? Well, cheap fuel. For the fourth quarter, Hawaiian’s aircraft fuel costs dropped 41.4% to $88.4 million from $150.8 million.Asked if Hawaiian would stockpile or hedge fuel at the current low prices, Ingram demurred: “We do hedge fuel, but we’re not speculators.”Zack’s puts Hawaiian’s first-quarter 2016 earnings at 73 cents a share and full-year 2016 earnings at $4.57 per share. But both Derchin and Becker estimate Hawaiian will earn $5 per share for 2016.Not long ago, its stock price was at 5. Hawaiian (in business for 87 years) went through its second bankruptcy in 2003-2005, and its stock was still bumping along at a dismal 5 to 6 from 2011 through early 2013, when it finally started climbing. In the past year, the stock has jumped up from a low of 19.66 in mid-March 2015 to 52-week intraday high of 46.98 on Wednesday.“We’re feeling very optimistic about our prospects for 2016,"" Ingram said. ""We’re seeing flatter comparisons on foreign exchange, and we’re seeing continued strong demand throughout our network.”

297,LUV,"Managers of $389 million Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund (FIGWX) made defensive tweaks to their portfolio as the winter market storm kicked up, while also retaining their basic focus on growthier stocks.Keeping aim on certain growth stocks should benefit the mutual fund even if a slower growth environment prevails for some time or if negative stock market news about sluggish oil prices or China's economic slowdown weighs down the market.""The fund's largest overweight is in the area of companies with high growth potential that we believe can perform well somewhat independent of the economic cycle,"" the fund's managers wrote in their fourth-quarter commentary. ""We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""With that double-barreled approach, the fund's -1.28% return topped 77% of its large-cap growth peer mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the 12 months going into Tuesday. Its direct rivals averaged a 3.89% loss. The S&P 500 eked out an 0.51% gain.Over the past three years, the fund's average annual gain of 11.16% beat 62% of its peer group, which averaged a 10.31% yearly return. The big-cap bogey averaged an 11.23% advance.While the fund rotated from some smaller, fast-growing biotech and technology stocks in Q4 into better-established, more stable stocks, it has hardly abandoned growth. Holdings in the portfolio average an IBD Composite Rating of 72. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Top holdings with very strong Comp Ratings of at least 80 as of Dec. 31 included Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Home Depot (HD), Priceline (PCLN) and Nike (NKE).New buys with Comp Ratings of 90 or better included McDonald's (MCD), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Southwest (LUV) and MSCI (MSCI).Stocks poised to do well can be spotted deeper in the portfolio, too. Chemicals and paint company Sherwin-Williams (SHW), with a 97 Comp Rating, is up 9% so far this year. It is still within buy range of its 282.10 entry on a cup pattern.It also sports a dividend yield of 1.2%. Its earnings per share have climbed 23%, 18% and 39% the past three quarters.Comerica Bank (CMA), BLB&B Advisors, Bank of the West, Berkshire Money Management, HighPoint Advisor Group and Beese Fulmer Investment Management reportedly all opened or added to stakes in Sherwin-Williams during Q4.Online travel agency Priceline is pushing into China and elsewhere in Asia. Shares are up 4% this year and are approaching a double-bottom entry at 1342.09.Priceline's EPS growth was flat three quarters ago, but its earnings per share grew 14% and 16% the past two stanzas. Within the past week, Cantor Fitzgerald and Cowan & Co. reportedly restated their buy recommendations.McDonald's is up 4% this year. Shares are forming a flat base with a 124.93 buy point.Its EPS rose 28% and 16% the past two quarters after declining in five of the six prior four frames. Its dividend yield is 2.9%.
"
298,LUV,"With epic profits from cheap fuel, Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Continental (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) have found themselves more able than they have in years to treat passengers to free snacks, more legroom and other amenities that could survive a recession and force the hands of budget carriers.How much further airlines can go with their extra cash remains a question, though analysts don't expect too much of a hit to earnings from improvements in service.As airlines try to please passengers, they’re also trying to accommodate employees and investors who rode out bankruptcies, the financial crisis, surging oil prices, layoffs and other cost cuts.“Overall, they’re growing in the right way, which is a hard thing to say historically about airlines,” Argus Research analyst David Coleman said. “I think this is more important than getting a week-old turkey sandwich.”He also stressed that airlines are likewise investing in things passengers don’t always notice: profit-sharing, reducing debt and investing in fuel-efficient planes. Those moves aim to keep carriers competitive in the long term, when oil prices come back up.“If you’re making a whole bunch of money right now, and you start giving everyone free meals and drinks, they’re going to get used to that,” Coleman said. “So then when you cut them away when fuel prices go back up, they’re going to be screaming, ‘Why don’t I get my free rum and Coke?’ ”Improved service would come as complaints from passengers jumped 30% in 2015, according to Transportation Department data.Free snacks have largely returned on the major airlines after years of austerity, but free meals on shorter flights likely won't come back.
"
299,LUV,"Carriers are also investing in new planes, including ones from Boeing (BA) that have more overhead space. Delta Air Lines and United Continental are trying to draw more business travelers with on-time commitments. American Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK) are planning more comfortable ""premium economy""-style seating. JetBlue (JBLU) is exploring ways to improve customer and operational service through Big Data and artificial intelligence.Delta also has tested pre-loading carry-ons into overhead bins to hasten the boarding process. Cowen analyst Helane Becker sees airlines reconsidering how they approach boarding and fees this year, saying airlines probably have their current fees backwards.“They should have charged for overhead bin space and let you check your bag for free,” she said.
"
300,LUV,"Still, checked-bag and other fees, which began when oil prices jumped, almost certainly aren’t going anywhere despite today's low prices, as customers grow accustomed to fees, analysts say. (Southwest Airlines (LUV) still allows two checked bags for free as long as they are within certain weight and size limits.)And as more passengers bring their own mobile devices aboard, some industry watchers say airlines could move away from in-seat entertainment. That would free up seat space for passengers -- plus remove weight from planes and save fuel.The new perks come as bigger airlines try to differentiate themselves from carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), which grew by offering cheap airfares, tacking on fees elsewhere, and doing so with a bit more irreverence than many would expect from a public company.But in May, American Airlines’ CEO Doug Parker told Bloomberg the airline would “compete aggressively” with low-cost airlines, after they pushed airfares lower and moved in on territory the bigger airlines left amid the recent merger wave.The efforts seem to have had some success. Increased competition, along with abysmal on-time performance and complaints of minimal customer service, have weighed on Spirit’s profit and share price.The bigger airlines are now feeling safe enough to raise airfares again, hiking them in some key markets this month and last.“If you’re a low-cost or ultra-low-cost guy, and American, Delta, United compete against you, and they offer a better product, you have to think about stepping up your game and at least offer a comfortable seat or an on-time or operationally effective product,” Becker said.In the company’s most recent earnings call, Bob Fornaro, Spirit’s new CEO, said the company would make customer service a priority this year but added that no sweeping changes would take place.“In the era of higher oil prices, SAVE got away with being an unpleasant travel option with poor operational reliability because they materially undercut competitors on price,” Wolfe Research said in a note discussing Spirit’s Q4 earnings. “And they were irreverent about it. It was funny at the time, but in hindsight it was also an unsustainable way to do business.”Wolfe added: “So maybe the upshot of lower oil prices is that low oil prices will force change that will be better for SAVE in the long run. And, after that, SAVE will have better growth options.”As speculation of a recession intensifies, JPMorgan, which believes airlines’ profit margins would stay strong in a downturn, doesn’t see in-flight improvements going away.“Only in the event of multi-year profit pressures would we expect recent amenities to be scaled back,” JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker told IBD via email.Cowen's Becker, however, said that what airlines cut depends on the downturn’s causes and impact.“Certainly the rhetoric has been ‘This time it’s different, and they will be profitable,’ ” she said. “But if you’re adding cost by offering new products, you’re increasing your labor costs, and fuel costs rise, you better raise your ticket prices pretty quick.”

302,LUV,"Republic Airways' (RJET) stock collapsed Friday, sinking 73% after the company and some subsidiaries said a day earlier they had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.The Indianapolis-based carrier, whose planes serve Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) for their shorter routes, said flights were continuing as planned and that the company was ""doing business as usual across its locations"" as it restructures.But the filing followed several quarters of plunging revenue after disagreements with labor, a pilot shortage across the U.S., difficulties related to ""out-of-favor aircraft"" and an apparent impasse with major stakeholders, the company said.Republic's stock closed below 1 in the stock market today. A year ago, the stock was trading above 12. Delta fell 2.7%, United dipped 0.5%, American Airlines fell 1.2%.“We worked hard to avoid this step,” Republic Airways CEO Bryan Bedford said in a statement Thursday.He added: ""Our filing today is a result of our loss of revenue during the past several quarters associated with grounding aircraft due to a lack of pilot resources, combined with the reality that our negotiating effort with key stakeholders shows no apparent prospect of a near-term resolution.""The company also Thursday named Lars-Erik Arnell as chief restructuring officer to manage the turnaround.While other, bigger airlines have expanded amid low fuel costs -- to the concern of some investors last year -- Republic's traffic and capacity have fallen in recent months. The company has also struggled to attract pilots amid years of contract disputes, the Wall Street Journal noted.Meanwhile, Southwest (LUV) has expanded its regional coverage after federal restrictions fell away in 2014, and low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) have moved into flight areas left vacant after their larger rivals began consolidating several years ago.Republic Airways' pilots in October ratified a three-year contract. The company, in a statement at that time, said the agreement ""includes significant improvements in work rules and pilot quality of life,"" but it said there were still ""many challenges to overcome to achieve a successful consensual restructuring of our business.""
"
303,LUV,"The U.S. airline industry's profit margins would be just as good as in prior peaks in a potential recession, even though a downturn was not ""the most probable outcome"" in the future, JPMorgan said in a research note Thursday, calling Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Southwest (LUV) its best picks.However, broader skittishness has weighed on stock prices, prompting the investment firm to cut its price target on Delta to 66 from 74, on Southwest to 52 from 56, on United Continental (UAL) to 66.50 from 77 and on American Airlines (AAL) to 50.50 from 66.JetBlue's (JBLU) was left unchanged, and Virgin America's (VA) was raised to 35.50 from 31.""The market multiple has contracted 1 to 2 times, hence we made similar revisions to our airline target multiples,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in an email to IBD. ""While our earnings estimates broadly rose, it’s true that lower multiples drove downward revisions to most price targets.""But JPMorgan added Delta and Southwest to its focus list. Delta, Baker said, could bring investors 50% EPS growth this year, saying the company was set to benefit from the falling-away of its costly fuel contracts and that it had the ""most returns-oriented management team.""Southwest's stock, he said, represented a good value pick, citing the company's ""best-in-class balance sheet"" and resilient demand for leisure travel.Airline stocks over the past year sank on worries of overexpansion and the low-fare competitive landscape weighing on results. Air carriers pared back their growth plans accordingly, but broader anxieties persist.In the note, Baker wrote that ""we believe the main concern standing between investors and heady potential gains in U.S. airline equities is uncertainty around a recession.""But Baker said the industry's annual margins would likely fall to around 10.5% in a recession. That's still better than the 10% peak the industry reached in years past. The annual industry revenue decline in a recession would likely be 10%, he said, compared to 13% in prior recessions.Besides, conditions for airlines have changed since the 2007-2009 recession that crippled the industry. Fuel prices surged during that time, but the oil-price crash in 2014 has helped keep airline fuel costs low, allowing for the return of free snacks, spending on improved seating options and sturdier finances overall.""Regardless of one’s view on recessionary revenue reversal,"" Baker wrote, ""there’s no escaping that the industry’s collective balance sheet has never been stronger, and individual airlines are in materially better shape than YE08.""Delta rose 0.55% in the stock market today, while Southwest rallied 1.9%. United Continental gained 1.8%, and American added 1.9%. JetBlue slid 0.4% and Virgin America climbed 2.6%.

Revenue dipped 1.5% to $9.5 billion, under views for $9.6 billion.Adjusted fuel expenses fell 29% to $1.74 billion on 40% lower market fuel prices. For the year, adjusted fuel expenses dropped by 20%, or $2.29 billion, to $8.88 billion.Delta said it could realize $3 billion in cost savings this year from lower fuel prices as well as other operational and cost initiatives.Shares climbed 3.3% to close at 45.96 in the stock market today.In Q4, Delta's passenger unit revenue fell 1.6%, which includes approximately 2 points of impact from foreign currency. Delta sees passenger revenue falling 2.5%-4.5% during Q1.""The first half of 2016 will see the most pressure to nonfuel unit costs, and we expect performance will improve through the year as we lap last year's employee wage increases,"" said CFO Paul Jacobson in the earnings release.Earlier this month, Delta and its peers raised one-way fares by $3.Southwest Airlines (LUV), United Continental (UAL) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) are reporting later this week.

306,LUV,"A winter storm bearing down on the East Coast will likely have a significant impact on sales at publicly traded restaurants with a large exposure to the area, with Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) considered to be two of the most vulnerable.Winter Storm Jonas is expected to unload heavy snow and possible blizzard conditions on large swaths of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, including major metro areas like Washington, D.C., New York and Philadelphia. Because the storm will hit over the weekend, when a lot of eateries see heavy traffic, restaurant operators are bracing for a big slowdown in revenue.""We see the snowstorm headed for the East Coast, which to date has had a rather uneventful winter, as a significant weather event for this weekend,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson noted in a Thursday morning report. That's especially true for full-service restaurant chains that depend on weekend traffic for a big chunk of their business, he said.""Casual-dining restaurants with a significant exposure to weekend traffic in the Northeast, particularly Darden and Texas Roadhouse, will be most affected by the storm,"" Anderson said, adding that both companies have more than 20% of their units in the affected states.Anderson sees a more limited impact on quick-service and fast-casual chains, with the most affected there expected to be Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).""However, we contend that these chains can take some solace in the fact that they are more dependent on weekday traffic than on weekend traffic, and that temperatures in the area are forecast to rebound above freezing for the work week, thereby minimizing the potential impact for these names,"" Anderson said.Shares of Darden, whose holdings include the Olive Garden and Capital Grille chains, rose 1.1% on the stock market today. Texas Roadhouse fell 1.25%, Dunkin' rose 1% and Panera fell 0.65%. Chipotle fell 0.9% as it attempted to crawl back up from the pounding it has taken following E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at some of its restaurants.Meanwhile, airlines have issued warnings due to the storm. Southwest Airlines (LUV) announced a travel advisory stating that its Friday and Saturday services will likely be delayed, diverted or cancelled.

310,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Friday said its carrying capacity growth this year would accelerate from last year's, while it anticipates higher costs due to a recent five-year labor deal struck with employees.The carrier, which flies more passengers than any other U.S. rival, forecast about 3% capacity growth this year, targeting the high end of the 2%-3% growth view given in October. Capacity rose 1% last year.The forecast follows a year of concerns over whether airlines' expansion plans, inspired by much cheaper fuel, had reached a boiling point. As airlines like American lowered airfares to compete with lower-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Southwest (LUV), they took a hit on passenger unit revenue.American's passenger revenue per available seat mile fell 6% in the fourth quarter, the midpoint of its forecast given last month.Shares closed up 2.2% in the stock market today.American's capacity growth has been restrained compared to some of its competitors. Earlier this month, Southwest, with which American is locked in a fierce rivalry in Dallas, said it sees capacity growth of 5%-6% in 2016.American's Q4 earnings per share surged 31.5% to $2.00, topping consensus by 3 cents, as fuel costs sank by 41%. Revenue slid 5.2% to $9.6 billion, matching views.During Q4, American booked a $592 million write-down on ticket sales proceeds held by Venezuela, which has placed restrictions on converting sales made in its currency into dollars and put off repatriating the money to American Airlines.American expects Q1 pretax margin of 12%-14%, stronger than the forecast United Continental's (UAL), whose performance has lagged Delta and American on many fronts.American, which has opted out of fuel-hedge contracts that commit it in advance to certain fuel prices, expects to pay $1.19-$1.24 a gallon for fuel this year, down from its 2015 average cost of $1.72 a gallon.Cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, is seen rising 0.5%-2.5% in 2016 due to the new contract with pilots, customer service staff, flight attendants and others.During its earnings call, management said the spread of the Zika virus in the Americas had not yet affected travel demand.Shares of United rose 4.7%, and Southwest gained 4%.

391,LUV,"Whether the stock market is enjoying a big market uptrend or bobbing up and down like a buoy in the ocean, earnings growth still matters. The numerous positive surprises in earnings-per-share gains that large-cap companies have issued across the market in the past couple of weeks have certainly helped investors feel more bullish.Earnings research firm S&P Capital IQ sees third-quarter earnings dropping 3.8% among S&P 500 firms to $28.92 a share. That's a solid improvement from the 5% decline seen on Oct. 6. Plus, earnings would likely be up 4.5% for the S&P 500 minus the energy drag.A 4.5% overall gain might not be something to hoot and holler about. The mild increase reflects an economy that is still recovering at a modest pace. Revenue increases have been equally weak. In that light, today's IBD Big Cap 20 screen can be useful in guiding readers to the small minority of companies that are growing much faster.Do not forget that 25% EPS growth is the minimum threshold for IBD's CAN SLIM stock selection system. Consistent double-digit profit increases that fall short of that high bar are still acceptable for large, established companies.Growth deceleration, as seen in former Big Cap 20 component Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) (EPS up 52%, 47%, 27% and 11% in the past four quarters) can knock the stock's EPS Rating down and spark sell-offs.Today, Chipotle is still a great business with outstanding products, service and management. Yet for now, the hot sauce is missing from its quarterly numbers. Thus, the stock is no longer on the screen.Southwest Airlines (LUV) is coming off a thrilling ride, thrusting ahead 11.5% last week for its fourth straight up week.Some traders might say that the reason lies in the stock's ""cheap"" valuation, currently 14 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. But a bigger reason may be the company's outstanding job in delivering above-normal profit growth. Last week, the discount air carrier reported a 71% jump in Q3 earnings to 94 cents a share, slightly above the consensus view. That's on top of a 62% EPS increase in the year-earlier quarter.No matter what the industry, that is called ""crushing it.""

422,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday pared its third-quarter capacity-growth forecast and said it anticipates higher year-over-year fuel costs in the fourth quarter, a first in roughly two years, potentially boosting unit revenue as airlines raise fares and other costs. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (LUV) said it would curb capacity growth next year.Rising fuel costs have ""historically led to RASM traction in the industry, as everybody has to pass through those higher costs going forward,"" Delta Air CFO Paul Jacobson said at Cowen & Co.'s Annual Global Transportation Conference, referring to unit revenue.Delta shares jumped 5.65% to close at 38.90 in the stock market today, rising solidly above a downward-trending 50-day moving average after investors punished the carrier for nearly five months.

Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings last week broke out of a consolidation with a 47.02 buy point. But is it too late to book your HA flight? Wednesday's intraday action has pushed it to the edge of its 5% buying range from the pivot. Check out Hawaiian's stock chart.Delta also offered a third-quarter forecast that investors appeared to applaud despite last month's outage that forced the cancellation of 2,300 flights. The carrier said ""performance has improved as fall capacity reductions have started to be implemented.""Delta Air Lines, in a presentation for the conference, said it expected third-quarter passenger unit revenue to fall 7% due to the outage. The carrier said the disruption and recovery would cost it $150 million in pretax income during the quarter, or roughly 1.5 points of operating margin.But excluding the outage's impact, Delta's unit revenue and operating margin guidance still fell largely within the carrier's forecasts given during its second-quarter earnings report in July.Delta said the outage added about 1 percentage point to the unit revenue decline during the third quarter. In July, the company said it expected Q3 unit revenue to fall 4%-6%.Delta's outage cost $100 million in revenue last month, the airline said last week.The carrier also sees capacity growth of around 1.5%, compared with the 1%-2% growth forecast in July. The carrier forecast operating margin of 18-19% on Wednesday, compared with an estimate two months ago for 19%-21%.Delta now expects slightly higher unit costs. And while it expected cheaper fuel than its estimates given in July, it said the cheap-fuel tailwind, which fattened profits and made it easier for the industry to expand through 2015, was ""now behind us.""Airline stocks in general have struggled due to rising oil prices, an inability to align flight and seat capacity with demand, foreign exchange challenges in part due to Brexit and concerns about the Zika virus and terrorism. The overestimation of demand and broader global factors have hurt unit revenue, which measures revenue as it relates to passengers flown and seating capacity.IBD's airlines industry group ranks 144th out of 197 groups, with few stocks like Hawaiian that show good chart action.Meanwhile, Southwest Air, which this summer cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook after a massive outage of its own, held to its forecast for an operating unit revenue decline of 3.5%-4.5%. But the company projected 2017 capacity growth to increase ""less than 4.0%,"" tightening from the 5%-6% increase forecast this year.Southwest said that passenger traffic rose 3.6% in August, but capacity grew 4.6%.RELATED:United Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries BreakoutDelta's Unit Revenue May Not Grow Until '18, But It May Still Beat Rivals

423,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) could cut its annual share buybacks more sharply next year, easing from capital returns that have been more aggressive than rivals, Raymond James said in a research note Wednesday.American in the second quarter returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks and quarterly dividend payments. In 2015, American returned $3.9 billion in dividends and buybacks.The prediction for smaller repurchases came a day after Microsoft (MSFT) OK'd a repurchase program of up to $40 billion and an 8% dividend increase to 39 cents.Overall, firms in the S&P 500 spent $125.1 billion on share buybacks during Q2, the smallest quarterly total since Q3 2013, FactSet said. This comes after Q1 set a post-recession high.Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in buybacks last quarter, followed by General Electric (GE), Microsoft (MSFT) and drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV), FactSet said in a report Tuesday.American shares fell 1.4% in the stock market today, rebounding from intraday losses as the major averages rebounded after the Fed left rates unchanged. Delta Air Lines (DAL) closed 1.1% higher while United Airlines (UAL) dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Companies have been taking advantage of low interest rates to borrow money for stock repurchases, which also help boost a company's earnings per share by thinning its supply of outstanding shares.
"
424,LUV,"Raymond James also downgraded American Airlines to market perform from outperform due to its valuation relative to rivals and slashed its earnings per share target to $4.35 from $5.30, largely due to a new labor agreement that was bigger than expected. The firm cut its 2016 EPS target to $5.20 from $5.25.American's labor deal announced in August provides ""significant pay increases"" to 30,000 maintenance, fleet service and other employees, the carrier said at the time. Other airlines have attempted to strike deals with their workers after the oil glut in 2014 lowered fuel costs and cushioned carriers' profits.""While labor cost pressures are being felt across the industry and y/y unit cost (CASM) headwinds at American in 2017 is unlikely to be among the highest, it follows two years of above industry increases,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in the note.Lower oil prices prompted a wave of competitive growth that hurt unit revenue, or how much money an airline makes compared to available seats, flights and flight coverage. However, Delta and Southwest (LUV) have signaled more operational discipline could be on the horizon, potentially improving the much-watched metric.American's unit revenue is also likely to improve, and a recent credit-card deal and better results from its Latin American region are also likely to help, Raymond James added.""However, we expect similar favorable trends at its legacy peers,"" Syth said.""Additionally, following the departure of Scott Kirby, considered the architect of last year's (ultra low-cost carrier) pricing strategy, we believe investors will question American's pricing strategy moving forward,"" Syth wrote.

425,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Friday said that the outage in August that forced 2,300 flight cancellations over three days cost the carrier roughly $100 million in revenue, or two points worth of passenger unit revenue, a key metric seen as a measure of how effectively an airline makes money off passengers.The announcement comes after Southwest (LUV) dimmed its third-quarter outlook following an outage that caused more than 2,000 flight cancellations.Delta said that consolidated passenger unit revenue, which measures unit revenue as it relates to a carrier's flight capacity and distance flown, dropped 9.5% in August. Along with the outage, Delta cited airfare weakness for flights booked closer to their departure time, ""ongoing supply-demand imbalance in the Transatlantic, and headwinds from its Yen hedge positions.""Capacity, however, rose only 0.5% for the month. Passenger traffic fell 2.8%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, fell 2.9 points to 84.4%.Delta rose about 1% to 37.17 in the stock market today but is still in a downtrend, finding resistance at its 50-day line.United Airlines (UAL), which got a bump this week after bringing the president of American Airlines (AAL) into its ranks, rose 0.4%. Southwest ascended and American Air 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: While many airline stocks have been battered this summer, a few carriers are rising above the clouds. Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings is breaking out of a cup-with-handle base, though in light volume. Check out Hawaiian's stock chart.The figures appeared to set Delta on track for a rougher-than-expected third quarter. They come after Delta reported a 7% drop in unit revenue for July. In July, Delta forecast a third-quarter unit revenue decline of 4% to 6%. Delta has said that it wants to be the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue, but it has broadened its timeline as to when that turnaround might happen.Investors have wanted airlines to align capacity -- an airline's available seats and flights -- with demand. That imbalance, along with the stronger dollar and expansion during last year's cheap-oil windfall, has hurt unit revenue.RELATED:Time To Fly?

426,LUV,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) unit revenue might not start growing again until after next year, far later than the carrier's goal of turning the much-watched metric positive by the end of 2016 -- but still earlier than rivals American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL)An Imperial Capital analyst said on Wednesday that Delta's unit revenue will be flat until the fourth quarter of 2017. The forecast comes after Delta over the past several months has tempered expectations over when it might turn unit revenue around.In December, the company said it expected unit revenue, or revenue as it relates to flight capacity, to be ""flat to positive"" by the summer. The goal was later moved back to year-end, and in July, Delta appeared to soften its outlook further, saying it was making the right decisions to reverse its declines in unit revenue, ""even if it takes longer than year-end.""Delta shares were up 0.2% on the stock market today. American rose 0.7%, United added 0.2%, and Southwest (LUV) dipped 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Transportation-Airline industry group ranks at 141 out of 197 groups tracked, with investors increasingly worried that the industry has depended too much on cheap oil -- and not enough on operational discipline -- for its recent profits. Find out more on how to evaluate stocks.Unit revenue, seen as a gauge of an airline's operating efficiency, has fallen industrywide after a cheap-oil windfall lowered fuel costs, facilitated expansion and prompted sometimes-damaging competitive fare cuts. The strong dollar and weak international demand have also hurt the metric.Investors have grown annoyed at airlines' reluctance to raise ticket prices and curb their flight-capacity growth -- moves that could help unit revenue. But Imperial Capital analyst Michael Derchin said Delta could beat American and United to positive unit revenue growth, in part on the strength of its branded fares.""As the first airline to adopt a Branded Fares strategy that optimizes the service/price trade-off offered to customers, we believe DAL may be the first airline among the Big 3 to report flat RASM (revenue per available seat mile) and a pathway to positive results, which we anticipate by the"" fourth quarter of 2017, Derchin wrote.Branded fares -- or the array of airfare classes that include or exclude different charges or amenities -- have become more important for airlines to stay competitive. Having a wider variety of fare options gives airlines more ways to make passengers pay for preflight and in-flight conveniences.The Big 3 have either launched or plan to launch ""basic economy"" fares to compete with Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) cheap, bare-bones but often fee-heavy service. Delta last week also unveiled Delta One, a new international business-class seating option. United in June introduced Polaris, also a new international business seating class. American announced the launch of its international premium economy seating in December.Overall, Derchin -- who initiated coverage on Delta, rating it in-line and setting 41 price target -- said that Delta was ""the highest-quality airline among the Big 3."" The carrier, he said, ""has the only investment-grade corporate credit rating and industry-leading margins, free cash flow generation and established capital deployment plan.""But he said that a number of events beyond the carrier's control are reason for short-term caution.""The biggest surprise was Brexit and its potential impact on U.K. business travel for DAL and its U.K. partner, Virgin Atlantic,"" Derchin wrote. ""At the same time, DAL and its Continental Europe partner, Air France/KLM, have been adversely impacted by deteriorating economic, social, and terrorism problems in Europe.""Terrorist attacks in Europe -- notably those in Paris, Brussels and Nice -- have helped caused ""an industrial disaster"" for Paris' tourism industry, a tourism official for the Paris region said, according to reports on Tuesday. German carrier Lufthansa this month warned on terror attacks in Europe, and heightened unrest around the world had hurt passenger volumes. Air France-KLM has issued a similar warning.RELATED:

The company said its plans to trim its fall flight schedule have set the stage to accomplish that goal by the end of the year. Management also said it would continue to shuffle flight schedules in areas where they can't pass on fuel costs to passengers.What's more, corporate-travel revenue rose 10% during the quarter. As President Trump doubles down on complaints over international trade, Bastian said the carrier was ""not seeing any signs that the rumored escalating trade wars"" were hurting travel, business or otherwise. Delta Air Lines on Thursday also hiked its dividend by 15% to 35 cents a share.Shares of Delta Air Lines rose 1.8% on the stock market today, though they are still below their 50- and 200-day averages and are 16% 52-week highs. American Airlines (AAL), whose shares sold off 8% on Wednesday, rose 1% Thursday. United Airlines (UAL) picked up 3.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarlier in the morning, Delta Air Lines slashed its full-year earnings-per-share outlook to $5.35-$5.70 from $6.35-$6.70, citing a $2 billion expected increase in fuel costs. Analysts expected earnings per share of $5.70.Management expects total unit revenue growth of 3.5%-5.5% for Q3. The midpoint of that range would mark a slight slowdown from the 4.6% gain notched in Q2.For Q2, the carrier's EPS rose 11% to $1.77, above Zacks estimates for $1.73. Revenue came in at $11.8 billion, just above forecasts for $11.68 billion. Adjusted fuel costs surged 33% to $578 million.""With strong revenue momentum, an improving cost trajectory, and a reduction of 50-100 bps of underperforming capacity from our fall schedule, we have positioned Delta to return to margin expansion by year end,"" said Bastian said in a statement before the call.Precisely how Delta might rebalance its flight schedule later this year is also not completely clear. The carrier said it is reducing capacity in underperforming markets in Latin America, the region it said faced the most difficulties during the quarter.Elsewhere, international travel remained strong. As negotiations in the U.K. crumble over the terms of its departure from the European Union, Delta said its business traffic to and from the U.K. was at record levels. The outlook for corporate demand remains strong, the carrier said.Higher fuel costs have led analysts to wonder how airlines might adjust flight schedules to shore up sales and profits. Airlines could potentially deploy flights to areas where it's more expensive to fly and pull them back elsewhere. The smaller supply of seats and flights could help airlines raise fares.American Airlines on Wednesday added to those worries. The carrier lowered its Q2 unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power in the U.S., even as strong travel demand and higher oil prices increasingly allow airlines to pass higher costs onto consumers.Some analysts said American would likely also adjust its flight capacity growth plans as the higher fuel costs eat into profits. Southwest (LUV) last month cut its own outlook for full-year capacity growth.Unit revenue, an important efficiency metric that gauges airline revenue as it relates to flight capacity, has generally improved since last year. American's announcement left some analysts wondering if competition from Southwest Airlines (LUV) was to blame, and if American's demand relied on low fares. Others downplayed American Airlines' forecast, saying the downbeat forecast was expected.On Thursday's call, Delta said domestic yields, or its ability to charge passengers more to fly, were weaker than they would like them to be. But a ""flush consumer"" with an appetite for travel experiences helped leisure travel, management said.Delta also said there was room to improve corporate airfare trends in the U.S. The company said that corporate fares have moved up internationally.When asked by a reporter about the point at which higher fares might curtail demand, Bastian would only say that trends were still pretty good.""We're not seeing anything other than strong demand for our product,"" he said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Top Airlines Issue These Warnings As Higher Fuel Prices BiteSouthwest To Abandon This Piece Of Its 'History And DNA' PermanentlyS&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Airline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

432,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday cut its second-quarter unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power on airfares. The announcement appeared to surprise Wall Street, denting airline stocks and leaving analysts searching for reasons after rising fuel costs and strong demand have given airlines more leeway to charge passengers more to fly.One analyst, in wondering about reasons for the cut, said ""most fingers are being pointed at"" competition from Southwest (LUV). Others said American's less upbeat view on unit revenue was unusual because many airlines had suggested the worst fare discounting was behind them.American Airlines said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to increase around 1%-3%, lower than an earlier outlook for a 1.5%-3.5% gain. The carrier said the cut was due to ""lower than anticipated domestic yields."" Yields measure how much money an airline can get out of passengers when they book flights.Shares of American tumbled 8% to close at 35.96 on the stock market today. The carrier's stock has been at lows not seen before the 2016 election. Airline stocks this year have suffered due to higher jet-fuel costs and President Trump's trade-related provocations.Other airline stocks retreated as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 1.5%. United Airlines (UAL) lost 3.4%. Southwest fell 0.9%, touching its 50-day line.When fuel costs rise, investors prefer that airlines push fare costs higher. In a solid demand environment, higher fares usually translate into higher unit revenue. Unit revenue gauges how efficiently an airline operates by measuring sales in relation to an airline's overall flight coverage.""In an environment with higher fuel prices and what by all accounts seems to be very strong demand, it's curious that domestic yields would be weaker than expected,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.""We have some theories but no concrete explanation. It seems like most fingers are being pointed at American's neighbor,"" he added, referring to Southwest.American on Wednesday also said it would lose $35 million in pretax income as a result of computer-system problems at PSA Airlines, a regional airline the carrier owns, that forced the cancellation of some 3,000 flights last month. But it said costs at non-fuel units would only be up 2.5%. That's less than the 3.5% bump expected earlier, due partly to lower-than-expected maintenance costs.The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would impose tariffs on an extra $200 billion in Chinese products. U.S. tariffs targeting $34 billion worth of Chinese products took hold on Friday. Some analysts worry that a full-blown trade war could force companies to cut spending. That spending pullback, in turn, could crimp corporate travel.As airlines prepare to report second-quarter earnings this month, Wall Street will be focused on how carriers can counterbalance rising fuel prices. American CEO Doug Parker said last month that customers could face rising airfare costs, as higher fuel expenses prompt carriers to pull back on the flights they offer. However, he said such a scenario was unlikely in the near term.Southwest, which reported June traffic results on Tuesday, has already pared back its full-year flight capacity. Delta could announce its own decision on how many flights it will ultimately offer for the rest of the year when it reports on Thursday.""In a rising jet fuel environment, airlines should be raising prices, and investors expect yields to show improvement to offset higher labor and fuel costs,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""The increase in yields will take time, but investors did not anticipate a reduction, mostly because most airlines have indicated that a lot of the deepest discounted fares have left the system.""She said that even though American has benefited from strong demand, that demand appeared to be the product of low fares. As jet-fuel costs rise and unit revenue flags, American would likely trim its fall and winter flight schedules as well, she said.""Demand remains solid but they need to show they can overcome rising fuel costs with higher fares,"" she said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines To Make This Key Decision Over Next Month As Fuel Hits ProfitTop Airlines Issue These Warnings As Higher Fuel Prices BiteAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

433,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) on Tuesday reported a bump in June traffic, but a gauge of seats filled slipped, as questions about rising fuel costs and a trade war weigh on airline stocks ahead of second-quarter earnings.The carrier on Aug. 1 will also abandon of something it described as forever a part of its ""history and DNA"" — peanuts — citing the risks they pose to passengers with peanut allergies.""Peanuts forever will be part of Southwest's history and DNA,"" Southwest said in a statement. ""However, to ensure the best onboard experience for everyone, especially for customers with peanut-related allergies, we've made the difficult decision to discontinue serving peanuts on all flights beginning Aug. 1.""""Our ultimate goal is to create an environment where all customers — including those with peanut-related allergies — feel safe and welcome on every Southwest flight,"" the statement continued.An airline spokesperson told IBD that the end of peanut service will be permanent.Southwest will continue to serve free pretzels, along with its ""wonderful portfolio of free snacks on longer flights."" The carrier said it hoped those offerings ""will please customers who might be nostalgic or sad to see peanuts go.""The carrier will join United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) in not serving peanuts aboard flights. United, on its website, warns that it is ""not possible to prevent customers from bringing food items on board that contain major food allergens including peanuts.""Southwest edged down 0.5% in the stock market today, still above its 50-day line. United dipped 0.7%, while American lost 0.5%. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports Q2 earnings Thursday, rose 0.2%.Southwest's passenger traffic rose 2.6% in June. Capacity, or an airline's supply of seats and flights, rose 3.2% during the month. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, was 86.9% during the month, down from 87.4% a year ago.As airlines report second-quarter earnings in the weeks ahead, Wall Street will be on the lookout for ways airlines can contain costs as jet-fuel prices rise. Southwest already dialed back its full-year flight capacity last month due to higher jet-fuel costs.In the wake of an engine blowout in during a flight April that resulted in the death of a passenger, Southwest also cut its outlook for unit revenue. The company cited ""lower bookings largely due to reduced marketing efforts.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?What's In A Name?

434,LUV,"When Delta Air Lines (DAL) releases second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Wall Street will be bracing for its response to the higher fuel costs and international tensions that have converged on airline stocks and profits this year.Delta Air Lines last month cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook, citing a ""sharp rise"" in jet-fuel costs. The carrier this month stuck with that EPS forecast, of $1.65-$1.75, compared with Zacks forecasts for $1.75, up 7%. Analysts expect revenue to rise 8% to $11.679 billion.But fuel costs and labor are typically an airline's biggest expenses. Since Delta first cut its EPS outlook in June, analysts have been waiting to see whether the airline will trim flights from its schedule, or otherwise rearrange it, to recapture sales.Delta in June said it would make a decision on how to handle its flight-capacity plans for the fall. The company said that decision would be made ""through the lens of strong demand and volatile fuel.""""The first course of action may be to adjust their fall and winter schedules, while trying to raise fares in strong markets,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last week.Despite the concerns about fuel, corporate and leisure travel remain solid. Delta expected a 4%-5% gain in second-quarter unit revenue, or an airline's sales as they relate to the scope of its flight coverage.""Delta's unit revenue outlook will be important as investors continue to worry about the industry's ability to raise ticket prices to cover rising jet fuel prices,"" Becker said in the note.Southwest Airlines (LUV) last month also pulled back its outlook for flight-capacity growth this year amid higher fuel costs. American Airlines (AAL) said travelers might have to deal with steeper fare prices as fuel costs run higher.Delta stock rose 0.2% in the stock market today. American Airlines stock lost 0.5%. Southwest Airlines stock retreated 0.5%. Delta, American and Southwest all recently hit their worst levels of the year.United Airlines (UAL) was down 0.7%. United stock tested support at its 50-day line; it has been consolidating for more than a year.Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said in a research note Monday that he expected Delta to cut its earnings-per-share outlook for the year. He said American Air earnings per share would likely come in at the lower end of its expected range. He also said airlines' foreign-exchange-related advantages were ""subsiding.""Conditions could also deteriorate for U.S. airlines' international business — an area of strength for Delta in recent quarters.Some analysts remain concerned that a U.S. trade war with China, Europe and others could ding companies' spending plans, which would ultimately hit corporate travel. Outside the U.S., where the airspace is crowded with rivals, all kinds of difficulties await.Airline stocks have been ""pressured by rising fuel prices, trade issues, supply concerns, Iran sanctions, Italy, North Korea, Russia, Brexit, etc.,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg said in a research note last week. ""In our conversations with investors, we have encountered far more excuses to sell them than reasons to buy them.""Analysts also worry about the state of Brazil's economy, and how much that will weigh on demand in Latin America. But any good news, Linenberg said, could be really good for airline stocks.""That said, investors' expectations toward the sector are quite low, and we are of the view that it probably wouldn't take much positive news to send airline shares higher by 5%-10%,"" he continued.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines Flags This 'Wild Card' In Earnings Guidance This YearSouthwest To Abandon This Piece Of Its 'History And DNA' PermanentlyAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

"
451,LUV,"But going the extra mile for passengers didn't translate into extra dollars, analysts and investors complained. Unit revenue and ancillary sales, which include baggage fees, lagged peers.

"
455,LUV,"What changed? JetBlue's relatively weak financial and stock performances led to a series of changes that cut away some perks and added a premium business class at a price below rivals.
"
456,LUV,"Several executives left last year, followed by the announcement in September that CEO Dave Barger would leave when his contract expired in February of this year.
"
457,LUV,"New Captain, New Initiatives
"
458,LUV,"He was replaced by company executive Robin Hayes, a former British Airways executive, who also holds the title of president.
"
459,LUV,"Under Barger's final months, the firm implemented some new initiatives to get customers to pay up for more, such as a premium ""Mint"" business-class service launched in mid-2014 on flights between New York and the West Coast. It'll be expanded to flights between Boston and San Francisco in March.
"
460,LUV,"At the end of June, JetBlue started charging for bags that used to fly free, part of ""Fare Options,"" a new tiered pricing scheme that still includes free checked bag options.
"
461,LUV,"For this past September, Deutsche Bank projects that JetBlue will have been the only airline of the top six U.S.-based carriers to show a year-over-year increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile — up an estimated 2%. It forecast declines of 3.5% at Southwest Airlines (LUV) and up to 7% declines at American Airlines (AAL). 
"
462,LUV,"On Friday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) was the first of the carriers to report on September: unit revenue was down 5%.
"
463,LUV,"Beginning in mid-2016, JetBlue will add 15 more seats to A320 aircraft, for a total of 165 seats. But analysts say that its leg room will still be more generous than the competition's.
"
464,LUV,"JetBlue says that all of the new initiatives will add $450 million in operating income, starting in 2017.
"
465,LUV,"In a research note last month, the Buckingham Research Group estimated that the current Mint service alone likely generates an incremental $120 million in revenue and 10 cents per share annually. If expanded to the airline's other routes of 2,000 miles or more, the report noted, it could translate to $500 million in incremental revenue and 40 cents in earnings.
"
466,LUV,"JetBlue is the fifth largest U.S.-based airline by revenue, after Delta, American, United Continental (UAL) and Southwest.
"
467,LUV,"The New York-based carrier flies to more than 90 cities in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America. Its leading markets are New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Orlando and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Service to Mexico City launched on Oct. 1 from Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.
"
468,LUV,"JetBlue is essentially positioned between the consolidated legacy carriers, with their extensive routes, and ultralow-fare airlines such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Allegiant Travel (ALGT), which boost cheap fares with add-on fees.
"
469,LUV,"""It still has lower costs than peers, but it is not a low-fare carrier in the traditional sense,"" Corridore said.
"
470,LUV,"While changes made so far have already had a positive impact on JetBlue's financial performance, so have lower fuel costs and easing competition in key markets.
"
471,LUV,"JetBlue is benefiting from rivals' relatively low-capacity increases in its key markets New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Becker says.
"
472,LUV,"While capacity increases are up around 3% in JetBlue markets, she adds, the airlines' average is somewhat higher, and some markets such as Seattle and Dallas are up in the double digits.
"
473,LUV,"""Nobody's really been growing aggressively in New York and Boston and to some extent Fort Lauderdale, which are all big markets for JetBlue,"" she said.
"
474,LUV,"Operating income in the second quarter doubled from a year earlier to $282 million. Per-share earnings jumped 132% to 44 cents per share.
"
475,LUV,"Passenger revenue per available seat mile — a closely watched metric in the airline industry — increased 1.4%. Revenue passenger miles rose 8.7% on a capacity increase of 7.5%, for a load factor of 85.6%, up 1 percentage point.
"
476,LUV,"Meanwhile, JetBlue's operating expense per available seat mile decreased 8.6%. Excluding fuel and profit sharing, it rose a slight 0.6%.
"
477,LUV,"With lower oil prices and only 19% of its fuel consumption hedged, JetBlue's realized fuel price in the quarter fell 31% to $2.13 per gallon.
"
478,LUV,"Oil Eases Slower Sales Growth
"
479,LUV,"Lower-priced oil — down more than 60% from a year ago — is a ""good trade-off"" to slower growing airline-industry revenue this year, Corridore says. Jet fuel accounts for a third of an airline's costs.
"
480,LUV,"With domestic revenue growth slowing, capacity growth in the industry will remain tempered, analysts say. That's unlike past stretches following oil-price declines, when airlines would order new planes using their excess cash.
"
481,LUV,"Now U.S. carriers (JetBlue included) have been using excess cash to buy back shares and pay down debt, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report on Sept. 30.
"
482,LUV,"Still, JetBlue expects capacity to increase at the high end of its 7%-to-9% range for the full year. It sees operating expenses per available seat mile rising 0% to 1.5%, excluding fuel and profit-sharing.

484,LUV,"More tailwinds could be ahead for JetBlue.

But analysts say that its leg room will still be more generous than the competition's.JetBlue says that all of the new initiatives will add $450 million in operating income, starting in 2017.In a research note last month, the Buckingham Research Group estimated that the current Mint service alone likely generates an incremental $120 million in revenue and 10 cents per share annually. If expanded to the airline's other routes of 2,000 miles or more, the report noted, it could translate to $500 million in incremental revenue and 40 cents in earnings.JetBlue is the fifth largest U.S.-based airline by revenue, after Delta, American, United Continental (UAL) and Southwest.The New York-based carrier flies to more than 90 cities in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America. Its leading markets are New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Orlando and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Service to Mexico City launched on Oct. 1 from Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.JetBlue is essentially positioned between the consolidated legacy carriers, with their extensive routes, and ultralow-fare airlines such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Allegiant Travel (ALGT), which boost cheap fares with add-on fees.""It still has lower costs than peers, but it is not a low-fare carrier in the traditional sense,"" Corridore said.While changes made so far have already had a positive impact on JetBlue's financial performance, so have lower fuel costs and easing competition in key markets.JetBlue is benefiting from rivals' relatively low-capacity increases in its key markets New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Becker says.While capacity increases are up around 3% in JetBlue markets, she adds, the airlines' average is somewhat higher, and some markets such as Seattle and Dallas are up in the double digits.""Nobody's really been growing aggressively in New York and Boston and to some extent Fort Lauderdale, which are all big markets for JetBlue,"" she said.Operating income in the second quarter doubled from a year earlier to $282 million. Per-share earnings jumped 132% to 44 cents per share.Passenger revenue per available seat mile — a closely watched metric in the airline industry — increased 1.4%. Revenue passenger miles rose 8.7% on a capacity increase of 7.5%, for a load factor of 85.6%, up 1 percentage point.Meanwhile, JetBlue's operating expense per available seat mile decreased 8.6%. Excluding fuel and profit sharing, it rose a slight 0.6%.With lower oil prices and only 19% of its fuel consumption hedged, JetBlue's realized fuel price in the quarter fell 31% to $2.13 per gallon.Oil Eases Slower Sales GrowthLower-priced oil — down more than 60% from a year ago — is a ""good trade-off"" to slower growing airline-industry revenue this year, Corridore says. Jet fuel accounts for a third of an airline's costs.With domestic revenue growth slowing, capacity growth in the industry will remain tempered, analysts say. That's unlike past stretches following oil-price declines, when airlines would order new planes using their excess cash.Now U.S. carriers (JetBlue included) have been using excess cash to buy back shares and pay down debt, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report on Sept. 30.Still, JetBlue expects capacity to increase at the high end of its 7%-to-9% range for the full year. It sees operating expenses per available seat mile rising 0% to 1.5%, excluding fuel and profit-sharing.The airline's earnings for the year are seen as growing 170% over last year to $1.89 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.More tailwinds could be ahead for JetBlue. The carrier's strong presence in Florida, especially South Florida, should put it in a favorable competitive position when travel to Cuba opens, Corridore says. ""Cuba could be a lucrative market for them,"" he said.

500,LUV,"Little Lies.....Fleetwood Mac - Tango in the Night - 1987 ""If I could turn the page, In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two, I couldn't find a way, So I'll settle for one day to believe in you........Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies...Oh no, no, you can't disguise....""
"
501,LUV,"And so - let the confessions begin - or not......Yesterday - Citron Research - a firm that publishes negative research and actively makes bets against companies - made some very high-profile allegations against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) using phrases like - ""web of deception"", ""Fraud"", calling it the ENRON of the pharmaceutical industry.....Now for those of us who actually remember the ENRON scandal - that was not good.... and or those of you who do not - let me outline it....
"
502,LUV,"At the height of its 'season' Enron was an energy, commodity and pulp and paper services company based in Houston, TX. Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!
"
503,LUV,"Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......
"
504,LUV,"At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
505,LUV,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......
"
506,LUV,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.
"
507,LUV,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.
"
508,LUV,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....
"
509,LUV,"So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......
"
510,LUV,"More earnings to come today.. MCD, CAT, and MMM all report prior to the open.....some have already reported and they have been positive.....SWK, Alaska Air, LLY, LUV, DOW, AEP, RTN, UA.. - all showing bottom line beats....and pre-market trading has most of these names moving higher.... After the bell look for Alphabet (Goog), AMZN, MSFT and T..... Eco data today includes - Inti Jobless Claims of 265k, Cont Claims of 2.18 mil, Existing Home Sales of 5.39 mil, and M/M of +1.5% - Kansas City Fed to show lower activity at -9.....
"
511,LUV,"European markets are all slightly higher as they await the ECB rate news....No one expects that Draghi will change rates but will in fact leave the door open to further easing..... Will they increase their current 1 tril Euro QE program? My guess is - not yet......FTSE flat, CAC 40 + 0.14%, DAX + 0.37%, EUROSTOXX + 0.33%, SPAIN +0.36% and ITALY flat.
"
512,LUV,"US futures are up 7 pts at 2015...I suspect that with oil a bit higher and the dollar flat - as long as we get better earnings the market will hold steady here....Resistance still holds at 2035.....with short term support right here at 2015.....if that does not hold - then look for 1980 to be the next real support level.

529,LUV,"The fall in ticket prices for U.S. carriers so far this year has steepened slightly from last year, Airlines for America said Wednesday, a trend that has helped air travelers but worried investors in carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).Ticket prices had fallen some 6% systemwide so far this year, compared to a 5.2% drop in 2015, the trade group said in a statement Wednesday.Airfares have fallen as airlines have expanded flight and seat capacity to stay competitive. Investors over the past year have occasionally punished airlines for what has been seen as an inability to keep capacity -- a carrier's supply of flights and seats -- in line with demand.Airlines for America also projected that 4% more passengers would travel over the Labor Day travel period than last year. Airlines would add more than 98,000 seats per day to its capacity during the period than a year earlier, the group forecast.That outlook comes as the TSA has dealt with its own difficulties in ushering passengers through checkpoints and after huge rounds of flight cancellations from Delta and Southwest (LUV) this summer. Those cancellations have raised questions about airlines' aging technological infrastructures and passenger expectations of air travel in general.Southwest cut its third-quarter revenue outlook after an outage caused more than 2,000 flight cancellations, while Delta spent much of last week racing to get its systems back online after a power outage caused a similar number of flight cancellations.Last Thursday, Delta said that backup systems didn't kick in after a small fire occurred that Aug. 8 at a power switch, causing a ""massive failure"" at its technology command center that created the outage. The carrier said that around ""300 of about 7,000 data center components were discovered to not have been configured appropriately to avail backup power"" and that it was working to bolster redundancy and connectivity.Airlines have been trimming their post-Labor Day capacity in recent weeks, Wolfe Research notes.""But our optimism is a bit guarded as we've noticed some airlines have shown a tendency to make capacity cuts to only add it back the following week somewhere else,"" Wolfe analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note on Monday. ""Regardless, the constant pruning shows airlines continue to schedule fairly dynamically and eliminate unproductive flying where it makes sense.""Delta Air fell 1.2% in the stock market today. American Airlines slid rose 0.2%, United fell 1.2%. Southwest retreated 1 cent to 36.84. Oil prices continue to limb, suggesting that jet fuel costs will trend higher.IBD'S TAKE: Terror attacks, warnings about the Zika virus and Brexit have been bad news for airline stocks this summer. Higher oil prices and labor deals could also weigh on profits. Many airline stocks have struggled for support at their 50-day line, a key measure of investor support. Learn more about  how to read stock charts. Delta this week also introduced a new international business-class seat, Delta One, whose seats feature sliding doors for privacy, lie-flat seats and direct access to aisles. The seating class is set to be available on select flights in the fall of 2017, debuting on the carrier's first Airbus (EADSY) 350 and then, over time, its Boeing (BA) 777 jets.The new seating class comes as airlines continue a so-called ""unbundling of the product"" -- breaking out different costs and adding new segments to cabins in an attempt to find new ways to draw money out of passengers. All three network carriers have also debuted or plan to debut bare-bones ""basic economy"" fares to compete with Spirit Airlines (SAVE), whose low-cost service has helped lead pricing downward.Airbus fell 1.7% while Boeing climbed 0.2% and Spirit 0.1%.RELATED:

530,LUV,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL) edged up Tuesday after the carrier forecast that a key operational metric wouldn't be as bad in the third quarter as originally anticipated, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) continued to cancel hundreds of flights due to an outage a day earlier.American said it expected third-quarter unit revenue -- a measure of how much money airlines make on passengers as related to available seats -- to fall roughly 3% to 5%. That compared with an earlier forecast for a 3.5%-5.5% decline, which was still an improvement from prior quarters.The company said it continued to expect third-quarter adjusted pretax margins of 12%-14%.Still, the measure of an airline's ability to fill seats, known as ""load factor,"" dropped 2.1 percentage points to 85.2% in July. The carrier said July traffic fell 0.3% on a 2.3% increase in carrying capacity.The monthly figures and quarterly forecast come after American agreed last week to a pay raise for 30,000 workers.American shares were up 0.7% to 34.59 by the closing bell on the stock market today. American's stock has hovered above its key 50-day line after reporting improved fundamentals this earnings season, including restrained capacity growth plans and improved unit revenue, which has fallen as airlines have expanded and cut fares.IBD'S TAKE: Delta shares struggled this earnings season compared to rivals American Airlines and United Airlines. While investors want airlines to trim capacity and raise fares to boost profits, the industry has contended with fears related to terror attacks and the Zika virus. See how the sector is doing at IBD's Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, Delta said it would cancel roughly 300 flights Tuesday morning as it continues to untangle the mess caused by a power outage on Monday in Atlanta. The outage created widespread computer problems for the carrier and forced around 1,000 flight cancellations on Monday, although it was able to resume flights that same day.""We were able to bring our systems back on line and resume flights within a few hours yesterday, but we are still operating in recovery mode,"" Dave Holtz, a senior vice president for the airline, said in a statement. ""We are sorry for what many of our customers have experienced over the past 24 hours, including those who remain at airports and continue waiting for their flights.""The carrier offers around 15,000 flights daily. Delta last week reported July traffic figures that disappointed many investors, and how the outages will affect its overall third-quarter performance remains unclear.Shares of Delta dipped 0.8% to 37.15, while Southwest (LUV), which experienced a similar outage last month, added 1 cent to 37.46. United Airlines (UAL) shares lost 1.4% to 47.81.
"
531,LUV,"After an outage in Atlanta early Monday forced Delta Air Lines (DAL) to cancel at least 450 flights and delay hundreds more, the carrier said systems were now ""fully operational and flights resumed hours ago but delays and cancellations remain as recovery efforts continue.""The company also said it would offer $200 in travel vouchers to any passenger whose flight was canceled or delayed more than three hours.""We want our customers to know we are thoroughly investigating the matter and that we are truly sorry,"" COO Gil West said in a statement.Delta's outage, which disrupted its computer systems, comes after Southwest (LUV) last month suffered a computer outage that forced the carrier to cancel more than 1,000 flights. Delta offers more than 15,000 daily flights.Delta shares fell 0.6% in the stock market today. Southwest ticked down 1.1%. United Airlines (UAL) rose 0.2%, while American Airlines (AAL), which on Friday announced an interim agreement to raise pay for 30,000 employees, was down 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: The airline sector last week was also hit by fears of terror attacks and a CDC warning advising pregnant women not to travel to parts of Miami due to concerns about the Zika virus. See how the sector is doing at IBD's Stock Checkup.How Delta's and Southwest's outages will hurt monthly or quarterly results is unclear. Delta shares sank last week after the carrier reported disappointing July traffic figures. Other airlines are set to report monthly traffic results in the coming days.
"
532,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) on Wednesday cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook after an outage last month caused more than 2,000 flight cancellations, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) said it expected operations to be back to normal ""by mid-to-late afternoon"" after a meltdown within its own computer infrastructure.Southwest said it expects third-quarter unit revenue, a much-watched metric that measures revenue as it relates to carrying capacity, to fall 3.5%-4.5%, below an earlier forecast for a 3%-4% drop.The carrier also said it expected adjusted unit costs to rise 3%-4% during the third quarter as a result of the outage.Southwest also said that July traffic rose 1.4%, while capacity climbed 2.3%.Shares fell 1.3% to close at 36.99 on the stock market today. Delta was off 1.3% to 35.48 while United Airlines (UAL) gave back 1.4% to 47.12 and and American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.2% to 34.18.Southwest's forecast doesn't seem to bode well for Delta, which saw a unit revenue decline last month that has already disappointed investors and left some worried that the carrier faces an uphill battle in improving the measure of operating efficiency in the third quarter overall.A combination of overexpansion -- leading to unfilled seats -- competitive fare discounts and an adverse foreign-exchange environment have weighed on unit revenue industrywide over the past several quarters.Delta said it would begin Wednesday ""with a little over 150 systemwide cancellations,"" following the cancellation of 800 flights on Tuesday and more than 1,000 a day prior. The carrier said an outage at one of its locations in Atlanta early Monday crashed its computer systems and that backup systems failed to kick in.IBD'S TAKE: Investors have punished airlines occasionally this year for what they see as lack of capacity and unit-revenue control. Terror attacks, Brexit and a recent travel warning in Florida related to the Zika virus have also hit shares. Now, technological issues could compound their difficulties. For more, see IBD's Stock Checkup.The outages experienced by Delta and Southwest, as well as technological glitches at United last year that upended travelers' plans, have raised questions about whether the technology airlines use to deploy flights needs to be modernized.JetBlue (JBLU), meanwhile, said July traffic rose 6.6%, outpacing capacity growth of 5.5%. Preliminary unit revenue for July fell roughly 2.5%.JetBlue stock rose 0.8% to 17.13.

533,LUV,"This week's top insider sales were led by the chief executives of Amazon (AMZN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Meanwhile, top brass at Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) purchased shares amid the industry's recent sell-off. Bank of America (BAC) also got in on the action ahead of Friday's bullish jobs report.Chief Executive Jeff Bezos disclosed on Thursday the sale of 1 million shares for a total transaction value of $756.7 million, a week after the company's view-topping second-quarter earnings report. Bezos also shed 1 million shares the week after Amazon's first-quarter report.The e-commerce giant has been on a big run, gaining 27% since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base shortly before its first-quarter earnings report in April. Amazon shares finished Friday up 0.7% to 765.98, just below their all-time high of 770.50 set on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon earns a high IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of 99 based on top-notch fundamental and technical factors including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. For all the details, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.The defense contractor's CEO, Wesley Bush, disclosed on Friday the sale of 35,000 shares for a transaction valued at $7.65 million.Northrop reported estimate-beating quarterly results last week, but a drop in technology service sales impacted its profit margin and weighed on shares.Still, the stock has been able to find support at its 50-day line. It ended Friday trading at 218.95, a penny ahead of its buy point. Northrop is also trading just 2% below a recent high.CEO John Milligan on Monday disclosed a sale and options exercise of 70,000 shares for $4.97 million.Last week, Gilead gapped down to breach its 50-day moving average after reporting its first quarterly sales and earnings decline in years. The biotech's shares are now trading more than 30% below their 52-week high, and ended Friday up 0.8% to 80.41.Three Southwest executives grabbed more shares this week. CEO Gary Kelly disclosed Wednesday the purchase of 28,106 shares for a little over $1 million.Director William Cunningham bought 5,700 shares for a little over $204,000, while EVP and COO Michael Van De Ven bought 4,200 shares for about $150,000.Southwest jumped 3.9% to 37.85 Friday, looking to rebound from a nearly six-month low hit on Tuesday amid a broad sell-off in consumer stocks as well a drop among airline peers sparked by European travel fears.Delta was hit especially hard on Tuesday after reporting a 7% dive in July unit revenue. Director George Mattson took the opportunity to buy shares on the cheap, and disclosed Thursday the purchase of 10,000 shares for nearly $365,000.The stock's recent attempts to retake the downward-sloping 50-day line have been met with resistance. Though shares rebounded Friday, climbing 3.1% to 37.67 at the close, the stock is still trading nearly 30% below its 52-week high.Director Thomas Woods disclosed Wednesday a 25,000-share purchase totaling about $353,000.Bank of America and its banking peers rallied Friday as the strong July jobs report increased the chances of a Fed rate hike, which would potentially boost lenders' net interest margins.Shares gapped up by early 4% to retake the 200-day line for the first time in 2016, ending Friday's trading at 15.05. The stock is trading 17% below its 52-week peak.Insider transactions don't typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider's holdings, however, can affect a stock.
"
534,LUV,"Shares of global carriers Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) dropped Tuesday after German carrier Lufthansa warned on passenger volumes and Delta reported a 7% dive in July unit revenue.The Atlanta-based carrier blamed the July weakness to currency swings, excess capacity on trans-Atlantic flights, and low fares for last-minute bookings. Capacity rose 2.1% during the month, outpacing a passenger-traffic increase of 1.2%.Meanwhile, Lufthansa warned recent terror attacks in Europe and heightened global distress had caused ""a tangible impact on passenger volumes."" CEO Carsten Spohr said in a first-half earnings release that ""our industry has to prepare for a difficult second half-year.""""The terrorist attacks in Europe and also the increasing political and economic uncertainties are having a tangible impact on passenger volumes,"" he added. ""The forward bookings, in particular for our long-haul services to Europe have declined significantly. We expect the high pricing pressure to continue.""Delta plunged 7.8%, while American tumbled 5.9% and United lost 6.25% on the stock market today. The big three U.S. network carriers offer flights to Europe and collaborate with European airlines, but recent violence and upheaval around the world has made passengers more reluctant to fly. JetBlue (JBLU), which is considering offering flights to Europe, sank 6.5%.The share-price drop extended Delta's journey below its 50-day line, and it pushed American and United closer to the key test of investor support.IBD'S TAKE: Domestic-focused carriers like Southwest and Alaska Air have been less exposed but not immune to the global unrest affecting travel demand. Compare the industry's big names at IBD's Stock Checkup. Lufthansa said it expects unit revenue excluding currency fluctuations will drop 8%-9% in the second half of the year, and the company cut its planned flight capacity growth to 5.4% from 6%.Unit revenue gauges how much money an airline makes compared to available seating capacity and distance traveled, and is considered a key measure of how efficiently an airline is operating.Along with the violence, the U.K.'s vote this summer to leave the European Union has also raised concerns about foreign exchange difficulties as well as the U.S. airlines' ""open skies"" agreements in the region and other potential business restrictions.Delta and United took a more cautious approach toward Brexit, with plans to cut flight capacity to the U.K. American, however, was a bit more upbeat, saying that in short-term, the planned separation might cause more corporate travel as businesses try to find their footing in a post-Brexit world.United and American got a boost this earnings season on tighter capacity discipline and improving unit revenue trends. American's shares were also helped by a credit-card deal expected to generate more pretax income over the next two-or-so years.Investors have wanted airlines to pare back capacity growth to be in line with passenger demand. More aggressive expansion and competition between airlines stateside has caused airfare prices to drop, hurting unit revenue.Alaska Air Group (ALK), meanwhile, said traffic increased 7.8%, compared to a capacity increase of 9.6%.Alaska shares fell 4.1%. Discount carrier Southwest (LUV) lost 4%.

535,LUV,"Stocks moved sideways at all-time highs this week, but the week was packed with market-moving news. Alibaba (BABA) broke out as growth accelerated, while Acacia Communications (ACIA) exploded as fiber optic and IPO growth names sparked. Macy's (M) triggered a huge relief rally, and Wal-Mart (WMT) bought Jet.com to better compete vs. Amazon (AMZN). Oil prices rebounded, but solar stocks crashed.After weeks of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hitting all-time highs, the Nasdaq eclipsed its 2015 peak. All three major indexes rose fractionally for the week -- the Nasdaq and Dow closed up 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 1 point. More quality breakouts appeared. Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings. So do mobile gaming portal NetEase (NTES) and flash e-commerce seller Vipshop (VIPS).IBD'S TAKE: With the market at record highs, many growth names large and small are breaking out. To get an in-depth look at Alibaba, Acacia and other top-rated stocks -- and how they fare vs. rivals -- go to IBD Stock Checkup to develop your watch list.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih hinted at a production freeze, which could come at a meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum next month. But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.

536,LUV,"Facebook (FB) was downgraded Friday ahead of its earnings next week, an Apple (AAPL) chip maker's price target was raised while another's was lowered, and Starbucks' (SBUX) price target was cut on weak Q3 same-store sales.BTIG Research downgraded Facebook  to neutral, saying that while the social networking site is one of the few ways to invest in the shift from legacy ad dollars to mobile ad revenue, investors have set expectations for Facebook ""simply too high.""Facebook is scheduled to report Q2 earnings Wednesday, and the consensus estimate is for revenue to jump 50% to $6 billion and adjusted EPS to surge 62% to 81 cents.Facebook shares initially fell but rose 0.3% to 121 in the stock market today. Facebook fell 1.1% to 120.61 on Thursday, undercutting a 121.18 buy point. Facebook cleared that entry area to a new high on Wednesday, though on light volume.Goldman Sachs lowered Starbucks' price target to 69 from 73, but said the coffee giant still has ""comp levers to pull"" and that changes in the loyalty program likely caused the drop in digital business.Late Thursday, Starbucks said the 4% growth in U.S. same-store sales in Q3 was an ""anomaly"" citing weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest.In Q3, adjusted earnings grew 17% to 49 cents a share, matching views, while sales fell short of estimates with 7% growth to $5.24 billion. Analysts had expected $5.33 billion.Starbucks now sees full-year consolidated revenue growth of 10%, down from prior guidance for ""10%+"" growth.Shares fell sharply in the premarket but closed up 0.5%.Cowen raised Qorvo's (QRVO) price target to 65 from 55 but lowered Skyworks' (SWKS) price target to 72 from 76.Late Thursday, Skyworks, a supplier for Apple, reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that fell year-over-year but still beat analyst expectations.Fellow Apple iPhone chipmaker Qorvo rose 0.8% to 60.56. Skyworks shares plunged 8.6% to 64.81. Apple, which reports its earnings next week, fell 0.8%.Southwest Airlines' (LUV) price target was cut to 47 from 49 at Cowen. On Thursday, the budget airline missed Q2 analyst expectations and said it sees Q3 unit revenue falling 3%-4%, worse than the 1.3% drop Cowen analysts expected.The airline is working to normalize travel on Friday after a computer issue caused hundreds of canceled flights and thousands of delays earlier in the week.Southwest shares rose 1.4% to 37.83 after diving 11.2% on Thursday.Chipotle's (CMG) price target was cut to 400 from 420 at Telsey Advisory Group. Late Thursday, the fast-causal burrito joint reported earnings and sales that missed views but said efforts to win back customers are working.Shares fell in the premarket but jumped 5.8% for the day to 442.48, moving back above the 50-day line.
"
537,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) missed second-quarter expectations and forecast its first unit-revenue decline for the year, while warnings from European carriers on the effects of recent terror attacks weighed on Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).Southwest's Q2 earnings per share rose 15.5% to 1.19, missing estimates by 2 cents. Revenue rose 5% to $5.38 billion, shy of views for $5.405 billion. Traffic growth of 6% outpaced capacity growth of 4.8%, leading to a unit revenue gain of 0.6%.But the discount carrier expects Q3 unit revenue, which measures revenue as it relates to an airline's carrying capacity, to fall 3%-4%. That's worse than consensus for a 1.3% drop, according to a research note from Cowen.""While solid traffic demand has continued into July, thus far, the fare environment remains challenging, and close-in yields have softened in recent weeks,"" CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement, referring to an airline's ability to charge more for tickets booked closer to a flight's departure.Shares plunged 11.2% on the stock market today, diving below their 50-day average. A computer glitch Wednesday also forced Southwest to cancel flights, but it has since been fixed. United lost 3.4%, Delta dropped 4.2%, and American retreated by 2.7%. European carriers Lufthansa and easyJet said Thursday that terror attacks in the region and international upheaval were likely to discourage travel.IBD'S TAKE: Southwest and other domestic-focused carriers have been more insulated from the international troubles faced by its bigger network rivals. But low fares continue to affect fundamentals. See how Southwest and rivals stack up at IBD Stock Checkup. Southwest also said it expected unit costs to rise around 2% for Q3 and roughly 1% for the full year.Southwest began offering more flights after federal limits on its Love Field hub in Dallas expired in 2014. But as oil prices crashed that year, the big three network carriers and low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) also stepped up flight coverage, creating a competitive, lower-fare landscape that weighed on unit revenue.On Tuesday, Spirit warned on its Q2 unit revenue, citing ""more fare discounting than what is typical for a peak summer travel period.""Southwest noted Thursday that Q3 comparison will be more difficult as its co-branded credit card agreement JPMorgan Chase (JPM) went into effect a year earlier.

538,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) on Wednesday said it expected transatlantic flight capacity to be down 1%-2% in the fourth quarter, and the company said weaker pricing for corporate travel and global uncertainty could restrain seating supply for the rest of the year.The capacity forecast for the region, included in a slide presentation, came a day after the carrier said it would reduce U.S. flights to the U.K. this winter, partly due to the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union. Delta Air Lines (DAL) also cut its fourth-quarter flight capacity outlook to 1% growth, partly due to the Brexit vote.The vote initially shocked world markets and has left the U.K.'s business relationship with the rest of Europe up in the air. United's presentation said the company was monitoring the effects of Brexit and would ""adjust accordingly.""United expects overall fourth-quarter capacity growth of 1%-2%, partly due to lower GDP estimates for the period. In addition, the carrier expects ""further softening"" of its ability to charge corporate travelers more to travel for the rest of the year, Chief Revenue Officer Jim Compton said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday.In reporting second-quarter earnings late Tuesday, the carrier cut its full-year capacity growth outlook to 1%-1.5% growth.United Airlines shares rose slightly less than 1% to 48.30 on the stock market today after the company topped Wall Street's estimates for the quarter.

American reports later this week, with its Q2 earnings call on Friday.Investors have been hoping airlines would work harder to keep flight capacity more in line with passenger demand after last year's cheap-oil windfall allowed more room for profits and inspired aggressive industrywide expansion.IBD'S TAKE: United Airlines, Delta Air and American Airlines face headwinds from a weak European economy, terror fears and other global fears. Domestic-focused carriers Southwest Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Holdings tend to have better ratings. Review the entire fleet of airline stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.United on Wednesday also said it expected adjusted unit costs for the year to rise between 2%-3%, reflecting extra expenses from labor deals.The company has struggled to keep up with Delta and American. United CEO Oscar Munoz said Wednesday that ""we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing from a financial perspective to the level of our and your expectations.""Delta has said it would remain dedicated to turning around unit revenue, a key measure of an airline's financial performance, by year-end. United has been less committed to a specific target.Munoz on Wednesday said the company acknowledged ""the importance of returning to positive unit revenue"" and how its capacity plans affect the metric, which measures sales per passenger as it relates to available flight seating and distance traveled.""However, we must evaluate what our network is today and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization of sustainable earnings is maintained,"" he said during the call. ""At times, this may include adding capacity to strengthen our best-performing markets and ensuring we remain competitive.""On Thursday, domestic-focused Southwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) report earnings. Southwest stock fell 1.6% to 42.03, Alaska rose 0.6% to 63.49 and Hawaiian climbed 0.5% to 43.76.

563,LUV,"Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said at the Farnborough Airshow that the airline is in advanced talks with Boeing (BA) to buy up to 30 narrowbody planes, a month after canceling its first delivery of Airbus (EADSY) A320neo jets due to delays.Baker also warned Monday that more Airbus cancellations could be on the way if progress isn't made to speed up deliveries.Meanwhile, Boeing said it would stretch its 737 Max 7 jet to make room for 12 additional seats in an effort to compete with Bombardier's C Series model. Boeing said customers, including Southwest Airlines (LUV), have shown interest in a longer model. But Boeing didn't announce a stretched version of its 180-seat 737 Max 9 to answer Airbus's A321 neo.This year's Farnborough Airshow isn't expected to see blockbuster deals, but some notable ones were announced Monday.China's Donghai Airlines said it will buy 25 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and five 787-9 Dreamliners in a deal valued at over $4 billion at list prices. Airlines, however, typically get discounts for large orders. Boeing also signed a memorandum of understanding to sell 30 737 Max 200 planes to Xiamen Airlines for $3.4 billion at list prices.IBD'S TAKE: Watch for Boeing's decision on whether to extend a next-generation 737 model or develop a new, midrange passenger jet as it looks to counter Airbus sales in the market gap left by the end of 757 production.On the defense side, the U.K. finalized a $3.88 billion contract for nine new Boeing P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft. In January, the Royal Australian Air Force ordered four of the planes to replace its aging Lockheed AP-3C Orions. British officials also announced a deal for 50 Boeing Apache helicopters.Virgin Atlantic will buy eight of Airbus' new A350 widebody jets and plans to lease another four, calling the jet its ""future flagship."" Airbus also signed a deal with Israel's Arkia Israeli Airlines to up to four A330-900neo aircraft. Vietnam's Jetstar Pacific Airlines signed a memorandum of understand for 10 A320ceo aircraft.But Airbus could follow those announcement with much bigger ones later this week. The European aerospace giant is near an agreement to sell as much as 100 planes, likely A321neo jets, to AirAsia in a deal worth $12.57 billion at list prices, according to Bloomberg. Airbus is also in talks with Go Airlines India to sell 70 A320neo planes worth $7.5 billion.Boeing shares closed up 1.5% on the stock market today. Airbus climbed 2.2%.Concerns of a slowing global economy and worries over the U.K. leaving the European Union haven't put a damper on demand expectations at Boeing and Airbus.Boeing raised its 20-year demand estimate by 4.1% vs. last year, now estimating that the world's airlines will need 39,620 new aircraft over the next two decades. Boeing sees strong demand from fledgling Asian carriers as more people travel for leisure and business in the region. Despite current low fuel costs, Boeing also sees demand for more fuel efficient planes, like its 737 Max, rising.Meanwhile, rival Airbus sees demand for 33,070 new aircraft valued at $5.2. trillion over the next 20 years, up by 500 planes from its prior outlook. It sees passenger traffic growing by an average of 4.5% a year over the next two decades, with the middle class in developing countries doubling to 3.5 million people by 2035.Also Monday, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson told CNBC that the price on the F-35 is down 57% from the first aircraft delivered to the Air Force in 2011 and will be down to $85 million per plane in 2019. Currently the jet costs $100 million. The Pentagon said it will extend by two years an F-35 cost-cutting program that so far has trimmed the price tag by $1 million per plane.Lockheed shares rallied 1%.
"
564,LUV,"American Airlines' (AAL) bullish forecast on its credit-card deals and United Airlines' (UAL) more upbeat Q2 outlook sparked a sector rally ahead of Delta Air Lines' (DAL) quarterly report Thursday.Three months ago, when Delta reported Q1 results, investors and analysts were focused when the carrier might improve unit revenue -- a key measure of money made from passengers -- amid concerns cheap fuel was doing the heavy lifting on the bottom line. Three months later? Basically the same story.""It's a broken record: the focus will continue to be on the pricing environment,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Monday.Analysts expect Delta's Q2 earnings per share to rise 16.5% to $1.48, its weakest growth since 2014, when a drop in oil prices helped lift industry profits all through last year. Overall revenue is seen slipping 1.9% to $10.5 billion.American surged 11.2% in the stock market today. United jumped 8.8%, and Delta rallied 5.5%. American shares were helped by management's forecast that credit-card deals with Citigroup (C) and Barclays (BCS) will add $1.55 billion to pretax income in  the next two-and-a-half years.IBD'S TAKE: While United, Delta and American have seen unit revenue continue to suffer, discount carrier Southwest Airlines (LUV) has predicted a Q2 increase in that metric.Unit revenue dropped industrywide last year after costs fell and airlines expanded with lower fares in competitive markets. Weaker travel demand and the strong dollar have also hurt unit revenue.The environment may have shifted. Late Monday, United said it sees Q2 consolidated passenger unit revenue falling 6.5%-6.75%, better than an earlier forecast for a decline of up to 7.5%. The company cited higher fares internationally and stronger business travel at the end of June as reasons for the improvement.On Tuesday, analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded United, American and Delta and lifted their prices targets, saying headwinds like Brexit, weaker global growth and excess capacity have been priced into shares, while improvements in unit revenue have yet to be fully reflected in their stock prices.""In light of the current valuations, we think downside is limited and that therefore investors can afford to be early given the rapidity in which airline share prices can appreciate once it becomes apparent that trends are indeed getting better,"" according to Deutsche Bank.Analysts at Credit Suisse, however, said earlier this month that unit revenue for Delta, United and American is unlikely to stop declining until late 2017.Delta has said that it wants to be ""the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth later this year."" That almost certainly didn't happen in Q2 -- the carrier last week said that unit revenue for the quarter likely fell 5%, worse than the company initially expected.Fuel prices spiked far past Delta's expectations during the quarter, the company said, while capacity rose to the high end of its expected range. Operating margins were also expected to be thinner, due to losses suffered after the company settled its remaining fuel-hedge contracts for this year. Those contracts attempt to lock in cheap fuel prices to guard against oil-price fluctuations.In reporting first-quarter results, Delta said it would cut capacity during the fall if necessary to improve unit revenue. The company had already begun to pare back some post-Labor-Day capacity as of last month, according to Wolfe Research.
"
565,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) on Friday said second-quarter operating unit revenue increased less than 1%, but it added that passenger traffic growth of 6% during the quarter outpaced flight-capacity growth of 4.8%.The Dallas-based carrier had said last month it expected a ""modest increase"" in second-quarter operating unit revenue, an important industry metric used to assess an airline's efficiency that measures revenue per passenger as it relates to available seats. The results come ahead of earnings season for the industry, and amid questions over how efficiently -- and profitably -- airlines can run their businesses without the aid of low fuel costs.Cheap oil last year helped prop up earnings and inspired a wave of industry expansion, competition and cuts in some ticket prices. But corporate and leisure travel demand have not always risen in tandem. Investors have wanted airlines to raise fares and keep capacity in line with passenger demand to improve unit revenue amid signs that oil might not be so cheap in the future.Delta Air Lines (DAL) this week said it expected fuel costs in the second quarter to be around $1.95 to $2.00 per gallon on average, well above the $1.48-$1.53 range it forecast in April. The company said it expected second-quarter operating margin, unit revenue and capacity that would be worse than prior guidance. Delta will hold a conference call to discuss results on Thursday.Southwest shares gained 1.7% in the stock market today, clawing their way back up toward their 50-day line. Delta climbed 2.75%, while American Airlines (AAL) was up 2.2%, and United Airlines (UAL) surged 3.5%.Airline stocks have spent much of the past two months below their key 50-day lines, which have crossed below their 200-day lines, a bearish sign.Southwest's traffic during June rose 6.8%, while capacity increased 5.4%, and load factor -- a metric that gauges seats filled -- crept up to 87.4%.Southwest's results came a day after Hawaiian Holdings (HA) subsidiary Hawaiian Airlines said it expected a 7.1% increase in traffic during the second quarter, compared to a 2.5% rise in capacity. Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) also reported monthly traffic results this week.Credit Suisse this week downgraded American and United and said declines in unit revenue for the big three airlines might not find a bottom until late next year. The firm expects more expensive fuel, labor deals, the stronger dollar and the uncertainty following the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union to dent their results.""Until unit revenues show firm evidence of improvement, which requires capacity discipline or a macro reacceleration, the disillusion with owning airlines will persist, with rallies limited to those led by risk-on appetites instead of improving fundamentals,"" the firm said.Southwest, however, remained its top pick.
"
566,LUV,"Earnings for Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are likely to badly miss analysts' consensus estimates in 2017, and unit revenue is unlikely to stop declining until the fourth quarter of that year, Credit Suisse said in a research note Wednesday.The investment firm cited a range of factors for the downbeat forecast, including higher fuel costs, deals struck with airline workers, the stronger dollar, weaker corporate demand and the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union.Credit Suisse sees United's earnings per share next year coming in at $5.08, 38% below Wall Street estimates. For American, it sees 2017 EPS of $4.00, 28% below views. Delta's EPS next year is likely to be $5.55, 16% below analyst forecasts.The firm downgraded American to underperform from outperform, while it cut United to neutral from outperform. But Credit Suisse kept its outperform rating for Delta, saying it was better equipped to hold up after the cheap oil -- which many say was a crutch for airlines' profits last year -- gets more expensive.""With an investment-grade balance sheet, the most sustainable cash flow and shareholder return profile and the best execution track record, we prefer DAL over UAL and AAL,"" Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates said in the note.Shares of Delta closed down 0.1% in the stock market today, but had lost as much as 4.3% earlier. American and United also pared steeper loss and finished 2% and 2.4% lower, respectively.Shares of all three have tumbled below their 50-day and 200-day lines since this spring, as investors perceive a lack of disciplined expansion. Competitive fare cuts have helped customers, but insufficient demand has hurt unit revenue, which measures money made per passenger as it relates to capacity. Airlines' attempts to stay ahead of fuel-price fluctuations through their fuel-hedging strategies haven't always been successful either, adding to investors' irritation.On Tuesday, Delta said that fuel costs have spiked and that margins and unit revenue would be weaker than anticipated for Q2. Those results could prompt the carrier to move away from its goal to get unit revenue into positive territory by the end of the year, Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a note Tuesday.As for carrier-specific problems, Credit Suisse said Wednesday that American's exposure to challenged international markets could become more of a difficulty for the rest of this year. After slashing ticket prices to compete with budget carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), ""AAL does not have as much control over its domestic pricing to undo the aggressive actions taken in 2015 vs. ULCCs as we thought,"" Yates said, referring to ultra low-cost carriers.American has said it will launch a new ""basic economy"" fare class as part of its plans to compete with low-cost carriers and turn unit revenue around, but the benefits from that and other initiatives could still be a long time away, Credit Suisse said.Meanwhile, United's management is ""heading in the right direction,"" Credit Suisse said. While United announced plans last month to drive profits -- including installing slimline seats and reducing flight-delay and cancellation costs -- it could take a while for the company's plans for improvement would materialize as ""labor pressures stand to increase in 2017,"" Credit Suisse said.

Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer. Plans include a new kind of pickup and minibus, as well as a compact SUV and a commercial truck. All of this as Tesla struggles to meet its production goals. The expansive report gave no indication about when Tesla will be consistently profitable. Tesla stock fell more than 3% on Thursday after the ""masterplan"" was released, but rose close to 1% for the week, holding above the 200-day line.Tesla will hold a ""grand opening"" event July 29 for its Gigafactory, though the Reno, Nev., battery plant is far from finished.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock is still trying to recover and the company has report several quarters of losses.

Microsoft shares rose 5.3% to 56.57 this week, close to a buy point of 56.87.Japan's SoftBank will pay $32 billion to acquire ARM Holdings, which designs chips for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, as well as for most other smartphones and the booming Internet of Things market. The deal occurred after the Brexit vote caused the British pound to tumble vs. the yen. SoftBank plans to expand ARM's overseas headcount over the next five years. But some analysts wonder: Can SoftBank maintain ARM's vendor-neutral approach?ARM shares have soared 40% so far this week. SoftBank fell nearly 11%. Sprint (S), majority-owned by SoftBank, slid 7.6%.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) Q2 EPS sank 80% to 87 cents, while revenue fell 17% to $998.4 million. Both missed views.

Domino's stock broke out to a new high, leaping 9.6%. Papa John's (PZZA) popped 6% as KeyBanc said pizza deliveries are faring well amid civil unrest.Starbucks (SBUX) disappointed with a Q3 revenue miss and in-line EPS, as adjusted profit grew 17% to 49 cents on 7% sales growth to $5.24 billion.

Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong. Yahoo (YHOO) Q2 EPS missed by a penny but revenue and Q3 revenue guidance easily beat forecasts. Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high. For fiscal Q3, Skyworks reported $751.7 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, both down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but narrowly beating consensus expectations. Skyworks slid 8.6% on Friday and 3.8% for the week.After a long review, the Justice Department filed to block the Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) mergers, saying they would hurt competition and consumers. Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta.

The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.

570,LUV,"Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) warning on its second-quarter unit revenue raised fears that fare discounts from rivals could be weighing, sinking shares Tuesday and putting pressure on Southwest (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK).Late Monday, Spirit said Q2 total unit revenue, which measures the money an airline makes as it relates to available seats and flight distance, ""came in at the low end of the range contemplated in our initial guidance for the quarter (down 14.3% year over year).""Spirit also said it saw ""more fare discounting than what is typical for a peak summer travel period."" Industrywide fare discounting -- some of it prompted by aggressive expansion from low-cost carriers like Spirit into the bigger airlines' turf -- has hurt airlines' unit revenue.Shares closed down 6.1% on the stock market today. The stock is making its way through a cup base begun in April. Southwest shed 1.1%, JetBlue eased 1.2% and Alaska fell 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Airline stocks have struggled in recent months. But domestic-focused carriers such as Spirit Airlines, Alaska and Southwest have fared far better than global giants such as United, Delta and American, which are more exposed to the strong dollar and other global headwinds. How does Spirit's stock compare with its larger rivals? See IBD Stock Checkup for more information.Spirit also estimated that its economic fuel cost crept up 2 cents from its earlier forecast to $1.47 per gallon. But the increase wasn't as steep as those forecast this month by American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL). Wall Street has been concerned that airlines have been too dependent on cheap oil for profits.However, Spirit said Q2 capacity growth likely came in at 23.1%, slightly lower than the 23.8% growth the company forecast in April. Investors have been hoping airlines would rein in their capacity, or supply of available seats, to improve unit revenue.Adjusted unit costs likely fell around 8%, Spirit said, better than the roughly 5% drop expected for the second quarter in April.Spirit's announcement came ahead of United Airlines' (UAL) second-quarter results, which topped Wall Street forecasts on earnings and revenue.United Airlines shares closed 0.3% higher then rallied 2% after the close.

572,LUV,"Wall Street continued to unload shares of American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) in the stock market today, following the U.K.'s vote last week to leave the European Union.American Airlines, which has the most flight exposure to the U.K., sank 6.6% to 25.27, the lowest since December 2013. United plunged 8.1%, while Delta tumbled 5.2%, both the lowest since 2014. American Air lost 11% Friday, with United off 9% and Delta 8%.Nobody knows what the business landscape would look like for the U.K. following a departure from the bloc, but the long process of hammering out a formal separation agreement could further heighten economic uncertainty.Analysts have also worried that a so-called ""Brexit"" would dampen travel demand and jeopardize U.S. airlines' ability to collaborate with carriers that are based in the U.K. American has such a partnership with British Airways.Delta, meanwhile, owns roughly half of British carrier Virgin Atlantic.In Europe, conditions continued to be far worse. Budget carrier EasyJet on Monday forecast weaker revenue per seat for the second half of the year as a result of the U.K.'s vote, saying it expected ""additional economic and consumer uncertainty"" this summer. The carrier said it expected a constant-currency decline in revenue per seat of ""at least a mid-single digit percentage"" as a result of the referendum outcome.On Friday, EasyJet said it was ""confident"" the vote would ""not have a material impact on its strategy or its ability to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth and returns to shareholders.""The carrier said then that it had been preparing for a potential vote in favor of leaving the EU and that it would ""accelerate discussions"" with authorities to ""ensure that the U.K. remains part of the single EU aviation market."" Its shares traded on the London exchange went into freefall, losing 23.7%Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), a vocal supporter of the U.K. staying in the EU, followed EasyJet down, with its U.S.-listed shares plummeting 13.9%.

575,LUV,"Airlines have been raising capacity in the second quarter but industry experts say carriers have learned from past expansion missteps. S&P Capital analyst Jim Corridore said in a report Tuesday that he expects a record profitable year for airlines in 2015 on revenue growth and lower oil prices.
"
576,LUV,"He said fare increases, fewer fare discounts and more business travelers helped revenue growth in the first half of the year, even as capacity increased.Last week American Airlines (AAL) reported an increase in Q2 capacity and profit that topped analyst estimates. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) reported Q2 earnings above Wall Street estimates as capacity increased 30%. Delta Air Lines' (DAL) Q2 earnings and revenue beat estimates while the carrier's domestic capacity rose 6%. Alaska Air (ALK) boosted flights by 11% out of its home airport in Seattle this spring. Southwest (LUV) is boosting flights out of Dallas.On Tuesday, Alaska said traffic rose 6.4% last month, with capacity up 6.9% vs. a year ago. Load factor fell 0.4 point to 88.1%.Delta said July consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 3% on pressure from foreign exchange, lower surcharges in international markets and continued yield pressure in domestic markets.Revenue passenger miles rose 4.7% last month, and available seat miles, a measure of capacity, grew 4.2%.The increases in capacity come at a time when airlines say they are trying not to let growth spiral out of control and hurt fares. At the same time, the Justice Department is looking into whether airlines conspired to constrain capacity and keep fares high.Corridore says capacity increases shouldn't worry investors.Lower oil prices are also helping airlines post profits this year. The report said the U.S. airline industry uses 19 billion to 20 billion gallons of jet fuel each year. Oil prices are down nearly 50% vs. a year ago. Delta has its own refinery to help curb fuel prices even further.Unbundling ticket prices has also helped airlines boost revenue as travelers now have to pay extra for food or a checked bag.By late morning, Delta shares edged up 0.3% in the stock market today. American shares were up 0.9%. Spirit shares jumped 3.1% to 61.40. Alaska Air shares rose 2.2% to 79.43. Southwest shares were flat.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

577,LUV,"Alaska Airlines (ALK) topped the list of best frequent-flier programs, according to a new study published Tuesday. The airline also announced increases in traffic and capacity in July.A new U.S. News & World Report ranked the Seattle-based carrier as the top airline for rewards. The company has partnerships with American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), giving travelers more ways to accrue miles even if they don't always fly Alaska directly. American came in at No.2 and Southwest (LUV) at No.3.Delta came in near the bottom along with United Continental (UAL).Alaska Air shares closed down 0.3% in the stock market today. American shares rose 2.5% to 42.74. Southwest shares were up 1% to 37.93.Rewards such as upgrades to first class and free flights are becoming harder to get for infrequent fliers,according to the report, and airlines have made it harder to take advantage of rewards with blackout dates and other travel restrictions, requiring more miles for perks.Credit cards from Capital One Financial (COF) and Citigroup (C)offer ways to help get more travel miles with purchases.Also Tuesday, Alaska said traffic rose 6.4% last month, with capacity up 6.9% vs. a year ago. Load factor fell 0.4 point to 88.1%.Delta said July consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 3% on pressure from foreign exchange, lower surcharges in international markets and continued yield pressure in domestic markets.Revenue passenger miles rose 4.7% last month, and available seat miles, a measure of capacity, was up 4.2%.Delta shares ended the day up 1.3% to 46.34.Meanwhile, United CFO John Rainey stepped down Tuesday to become the CFO for PayPal (PYPL), replacing Patrick Dupuis, who was in that position for five years.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

597,LUV,"The airline industry has fallen from a No. 1 rank to the bottom half of IBD's 197 industry groups in just a few months. But it's still outperforming the broader transportation sector, up a fraction year-to-date vs. a nearly 10% slide for the Dow Jones transportation average.The group also is showing an interesting divergence among former leaders. As some continue to break out of bases to new highs and lead, others have broken down and even flashed short-sale setups.Group leaders still acting well include Alaska Air Group (ALK), JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and Allegiant Travel (ALGT). All three have Composite Ratings above 90 and are trading near record highs.Alaska Air is still barely in buy range after clearing a 71.50 consolidation buy point July 13. It will report Q2 results Thursday before the open.JetBlue Airways broke out on July 10 past a 21.70 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares are now extended about 7% past the entry.

598,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) announced Thursday that it would delay delivery of  Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft as the carrier looks to invest more in technology and operations.The budget carrier said in an investors presentation that it would delay 67 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes by as much as six years, but will accelerate six 737-800 orders to 2017 from 2018 as it will retire older 737s, according to Bloomberg.Boeing shares rose 1.35% to 133.55 in the stock market today, but gave up some gains from the morning. Southwest shares fell 1.7% to 39.59.The announcement comes as Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said that demand for passenger jets is rising, and it sees 38,000 needed over the next two decades.Muilenburg told the French newspaper Le Figaro that ""in commercial aviation, demand is not dipping, on the contrary,"" adding that Boeing will increase its annual delivery rate to 900 planes in five years, up from 750 planes for 2016.Also Thursday, Boeing was initiated with an overweight rating and a 153 price target at Morgan Stanley on margin expansion opportunities. The analysts were also bullish on possible orders from Iran.But Morgan Stanley also warned that Boeing's  exposure to Asia and the Middle East could increase the risk of cancellations due to cash-strapped economies relying on oil as well as slowing growth. They said demand for the 737 was growing but Bombardier's (BDRBF) new C-Series jet will be be a formidable opponent for the line.Meanwhile, Boeing's European rival Airbus (EADSY) announced Thursday that AWAS, an Irish leasing company, ordered 15 single-aisle planes, which include 12 A320s and three bigger A321s. The deal has a list price of $1.5 billion.AWAS's CEO said he was bullish on the single-aisle market, and the order comes just weeks after the company cancelled a deal for two A350 long-range jets.Airbus' U.S. shares jumped 4% to 15.90.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 2.9%, and the Shanghai composite dropped 1.3%.British Prime Minister David Cameron, who had placed the referendum in front of U.K. voters, announced he would resign before the Conservative Party conference in October. EU leaders in Brussels demanded Britain quickly engage in exit talks and invoke Article 50, which sets a two-year deadline for exit, according to the Financial Times. Cameron reportedly declared those matters would be up to his successor.Leaders of both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank said they were prepared to provide additional liquidity, as needed, as markets and currencies adjust to the change. Both banks reported extensive preparation for the contingency. The Swiss franc rose sharply, spurring the Swiss Central Bank to the first central bank currency intervention following the vote.Both the euro and the pound plunged vs. the dollar, with the pound diving to a 30-year low and the euro suffering its worst decline on record. Europe's benchmark Brent crude oil futures swooned 5% lower. Gold spiked nearly 6% to above $1,334 an ounce. The dollar fell hard against the yen.

600,LUV,"Despite Brexit-inspired global growth woes that pushed bond yields to record lows, stocks rose, helped by a strong jobs report. Breakouts were more common. Tesla Motors (TSLA) held up amid negative headlines. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) bet big on oil, but crude prices promptly suffered heavy losses. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and other carriers face stiff headwinds.The major averages were up and down for most of the week, but moved higher after Friday's strong jobs report. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% for the week, settling Friday just 1 point below a record close and 5 points from an all-time best. The Nasdaq advanced 1.9%. General Electric (GE), Facebook (FB), Costco Wholesale (COST) and Pepsi (PEP) were among the notable breakouts. Apple (AAPL) retook its 50-day moving average. Health food stocks soared after Danone agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV).The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to a record low but closed above those levels Friday.The U.S. economy added 287,000 jobs in June, far more the 180,000 economists expected. It was a sharp bounceback from May, which saw its meager gain of 38,000 revised down to just 11,000. The jobless rate rose to 4.9%, reflecting a jump in the labor force.Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 144,000. That, along with the upward trend in wage gains, might have been enough for the Federal Reserve to start hiking rates again soon, but Brexit will likely keep policymakers on the cautious side.Minutes from the Fed's June 14-15 meeting, when policymakers kept rates steady, revealed concern over the June 23 Brexit vote and the sharp slowdown in U.S. job gains in May. But there remained divisions over the labor market's general health, inflation trends and the outlook for economic growth.Tesla Motors said car deliveries fell well below its forecast for the second quarter. The 14,370 vehicles delivered fell short of its guidance of 17,000, due to ""the extreme production ramp in Q2 and the high mix of customer-ordered vehicles still on trucks and ships at the end of the quarter."" But production fell short of Tesla's estimates as well.It was the second quarter in a row that Tesla has missed its own delivery targets, and it comes as Tesla has made a much-criticized bid to acquire SolarCity (SCTY). A key objection to a SolarCity deal is that it could distract Tesla from ramping up vehicle production.Meanwhile, Tesla confirmed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a preliminary evaluation into the performance of the Autopilot feature in the Model S, following a recent fatal crash. The NHTSA confirmed it will also investigate the recent nonfatal crash of a Tesla Model X ""to determine whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash.""Tesla shares rose 0.1% fractionally for the week, just between its 50-day and 200-day lines, which crossed in bearish fashion during the week.Chevron, Exxon Mobil and their partners said they would invest $36.8 billion to expand the Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan. Main operator Chevron and its partners have already spent $37 billion on the project. The report comes after BP (BP) said it would spend $8 billion to build another liquefied natural gas plant in Indonesia. Energy giants had cut spending as crude prices fell but the new investments could be a sign that companies are confident about the price rebound after a rally in 2015 failed.But did oil majors bet at just the wrong time? Crude prices have tumbled this week amid global growth concerns, a stronger dollar and higher-than-expected U.S. inventories. U.S. crude fell 7.1% to $45.41 a barrel, its biggest weekly drop since February. Brent futures sank 7.1% to $46.76 a barrel, its sharpest loss since January.Samsung Electronics posted its biggest Q2 sales gain in more than two years, helped by strong demand for its Galaxy S7 handsets. Samsung is benefiting from weaker-than-expected demand for Apple's iPhone 6S handsets. Apple's next smartphone, the iPhone 7, likely will be released in September, but it isn't expected to be much different than the 6S. Apple moved sideways during the week, but the stock closed above its falling 50-day line on Thursday.Meanwhile, BlackBerry (BBRY) said it's ending production of its iconic BlackBerry Classic mobile phones.Shares of Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Amplify Snack Brands (BETR) were among the health-focused food companies that got a lift after French dairy products maker Danone (DANOY) agreed Thursday to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) -- the owner of Silk soy milk and brands that include Horizon Organic -- in a $10 billion deal. The proposed merger highlights the trend among consumers toward healthier fare. On Thursday, WhiteWave rose 19%, Hain Celestial climbed 7% and Amplify rose 2%. For the week they rose 20%, 6% and 9%, respectively.Delta Air Lines forecast Q2 operating margin and a unit revenue decline that were worse than it had anticipated in April. The carrier also said fuel costs were far higher than expected. Unit revenue declines for Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) might not level off until the end of 2017, Credit Suisse said, while earnings could also come in below consensus for that year. Among the reasons cited for the darker forecast are higher fuel costs, labor deals, Brexit and an unfavorable foreign exchange environment.Southwest Airlines (LUV) traffic rose 6.8% in June, more than the 5.4% capacity increase.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said June traffic rose 10.9%, outpaced by an 11.7% capacity increase. Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) said June traffic rose 11%, while load factor edged up to 94%.Delta, American, United, Southwest and Alaska Air rose modestly for the week, while Ryanair fell somewhat, but well off its lows.Comcast (CMCSA) soon will offer direct access to Netflix (NFLX) for subscribers with its broadband-based X1 set-top box. The nation's No. 1 pay-TV operator previously refused to allow third-party, over-the-top internet video services on its set-top boxes, for competitive reasons. The arrangement is seen as a win-win for both firms. The deal bolsters Comcast's broadband service and reduces the risk of cord-cutting, while providing an easy on-ramp to Netflix service for new and existing customers.Costco said June sales increased 3% to $11.33 billion, while sales for the 44 weeks ended July 3 rose 2% to $96.33 billion. Shares climbed 5% Thursday in heavy volume, breaking past a 158.89 buy point from a double-bottom base with a handle.Pepsi also broke out Thursday, rising 1.5% to clear a 107.04 flat-base buy point in heavy trade. The packaged-food and beverage giant said quarterly earnings increased 2% to $1.35 a share, beating estimates by 5 cents. Sales fell 3.3% to $15.4 billion, but were above forecasts.Costco rose 1.1% to 165.44 on Friday while Pepsi climbed 0.7% to 108.27.The drugstore chain topped Q3 profit views by 4 cents with 16% growth to $1.18 per share, but revenue gains of 2% to $29.5 billion missed analyst estimates for $29.7 billion. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 3.7%. International retail pharmacy sales fell 2.3% but rose 3.4% ex currency. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) raised the lower end of full-year guidance by a dime to $4.45-$4.55, vs. views for $4.49. But shares lost 1.5% for the week, below their 200-day line but rebounding from their 50-day line.
"
601,LUV,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) continued their rapid descent Tuesday, closing at their lowest levels since late 2014, amid a slew of negative headwinds and headlines.The plunge came amid elevated concerns about terror in the skies, Brexit and a general market sell-off.The attack by suspected ISIS sympathizer Omar Mateen at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday killed 49 and was the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since the 9-11 attacks. It has once again put the threat of attacks -- in the air or at tourism hot spots -- back in the headlines.The U.K.-based Guardian newspaper said Tuesday that a new poll showed that the campaign to have Britain leave the European Union was 7 points ahead of sentiment to stay in the EU. The referendum will be held June 23. Britain's exit would shake up the EU, and businesspeople are likely to avoid traveling to the EU to conclude deals until they know which way Britain votes.Meanwhile, the stock markets were down amid general uncertainty Tuesday afternoon. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were working on their fourth straight day of losses, all trading back below their 50-day moving averages. American Airlines, the largest U.S. carrier by annual revenue, was headed for its third straight downward close. After recovering from the early 2016 market sell-off, it rose as high as 43.78 on March 21 but has plunged 31% since then. It ended the day down 4.5% at 30.36 in the stock market today. American Air is trading at the worst intraday levels since October 2014.Delta, a close rival to American, slid 3.6% to 39.11. That's the lowest since the Aug. 24, 2015 market flash crash and it's set for the lowest close since October 2014.After years of steady revenue growth, Delta has seen sales shrink slightly for the last three quarters in a row. Delta recently warned on passenger unit revenue.No. 3 United Airlines fell 4.5% to 42.09, well below a March 21 intraday high of 61.41. Shares have undercut their January low to their worst intraday levels since October 2014. Southwest Airlines (LUV), the top domestic carrier by passenger volume, was down 5.4% to 39.88. Southwest Air has plunged through its 200-day line this week and is at a three-month low.JetBlue Airways (JBLU) ended the trading day down 3.1% at 16.77. That's the lowest since the Aug. 24, 2015, market crash. JetBlue is on track for the lowest close since March 2015.
"
602,LUV,"JetBlue (JBLU) on Friday cut its full-year carrying-capacity forecast and offered a dimmer outlook for second-quarter unit revenue, following Delta Air Lines' (DAL) weaker outlook this week as higher fuel costs loom.JetBlue now sees full-year capacity growth of 8%-9.5% vs. an earlier forecast for 8.5%-10.5%, as it seeks to ""assess the fuel and revenue environments.""Meanwhile, the carrier now expects Q2 unit revenue to drop 7.5%-8.5%, ""toward the lower end of prior expectations."" In April, JetBlue predicted a decline of around 7%.For May, unit revenue fell roughly 7%, which is an improvement from April's 12.5% tumble. Traffic rose 10.7% in May, while capacity rose 12.1%. Load factor fell 1.1 percentage points to 84.6%.JetBlue shares fell 1.8% in the stock market today. Delta dipped 0.85%.The results cap an eventful week for the industry, which has tried to balance the needs of shareholders, passengers and employees amid a period of huge profits brought by two years of cheap oil.Pilots picketed Delta's shareholder meeting on Friday to demand higher pay and ""raise the sense of urgency in concluding the ongoing negotiations.""“All other stakeholders – management, the other employees, investors – have now been rewarded ... except for the pilots,"" a pilots' representative said in a statement this week.Also this week, Delta guided Q2 unit revenue toward the lower end of an earlier forecast, while American Airlines (AAL) held to its forecast for a 6%-8% decline in consolidated passenger unit revenue but said it would change its frequent-flier program in August to reward miles based on ticket price paid, as rivals have done. Southwest (LUV) said it expected a ""modest increase"" in unit revenue.Airlines have added flights and slashed airfares in some markets to stay competitive, but the dollar has remained strong and travel demand has been shaky at times. Those factors hurt unit revenue through 2015, but a JPMorgan report this week found airlines have had better luck hiking ticket prices this year. Investors have been eager for airlines to turn unit revenue around and restrain capacity expansion.Shares of American Airlines were down 0.8%, while United and Southwest lost 1.3%.
"
603,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) warned on two key operating metrics Wednesday, while Southwest (LUV) said it continues to expect a ""modest increase"" in second-quarter operating unit revenue, based on May traffic results.After the close, United Airlines (UAL) said traffic fell 1.2%, while capacity edged up 0.5% and load factor dipped 1.4 percentage points. Discount carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said traffic jumped 24.8% as capacity surged 24%. Load factor edged up 0.6 point.Delta CFO Paul Jacobson, speaking at a conference, guided Q2 passenger unit revenue to the low end of its expected range, saying it will be closer to a 4.5% decline vs. prior views for a 2.5%-4.5% drop. He also said Q2 operating margin will be near the low end of its 21%-23% outlook.The warning comes just a few weeks after Delta said it will become “the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth later this year.”Shares of Delta closed down 0.6% in the stock market today. United dipped 0.3%, and American Airlines (AAL) edged up 0.5%. Southwest rallied 1%.Southwest said traffic rose 6.4% last month, compared to an increase in carrying capacity of 4.6%. Load factor, a way to measure how effectively an airline puts passengers in seats, rose 1.4 percentage points to 85.8%.On Tuesday, the carrier offered a three-day low-fare sale for some domestic and international fall travel.But it and other airlines -- including JetBlue (JBLU), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Virgin America (VA) -- got a bump in stock price Tuesday on an analyst report indicating the industry had slightly raised fares. Alaska Air signed a deal earlier this year to buy Virgin America, pending regulatory approval.Wall Street has been concerned about the lower airfares that have characterized much of the industry since 2014. Over the past two years, cheap oil has kept fuel costs thin and margins fat, prompting flight expansions and discounting, with investors worrying airlines could overestimate demand.In Europe, meanwhile, Air France-KLM said Wednesday that May traffic rose 0.8%, while capacity increased 1.8%. Load factor fell 0.8 points to 84.1%.Air France pilots plan to strike beginning on Saturday, a day after the Euro 2016 soccer championship is set to start in France, drawing huge crowds, the Financial Times noted this weekend.Air France executives called the strikes ""deplorable"" and said they would hinder the airline's recent turnaround, the Times said. The pilots want better pay and more resources devoted to operations in France, as opposed to KLM, a Dutch airline and Air France subsidiary, according to reports in the Times and the Independent.The demonstrations would be in keeping with a wave of strikes -- including by air traffic controllers -- that threaten to overtake the nation. Many workers in France are protesting measures that would allow employers to hire and fire workers more easily.Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) has called the air traffic controller strikes ""unjustified"" and said they caused dozens of flight cancellations.Ryanair shares fell 1.3%.

604,LUV,"BlackBerry (BBRY) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) saw price target cuts Friday, while coverage was initiated on Salesforce.com (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) -- both at outperform -- and SolarCity (SCTY) was downgraded.BlackBerry had its price target cut to 7 from 8 by RBC Capital Markets, which maintained a sector perform rating.BlackBerry early Thursday reported a break-even fiscal first quarter that handily beat Wall Street estimates, as did its bottom-line guidance for the year.The company has been restructuring over the last several years, as its once-dominant smartphone market share has dwindled to about 1%, far behind Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Android phones from Samsung and others. To salvage its business, BlackBerry has focused on secure mobile software and services.BlackBerry's U.S. shares closed down 4.7% amid a broad market retreat following the Brexit vote.Southwest Airlines had its price target cut to 51 from 49 by Cowen. Southwest announced Thursday that it would delay delivery of Boeing (BA) 737s as the carrier looks to invest more in technology and operations. The budget carrier said it would delay 67 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes by as much as six years, but that it will accelerate six 737-800 orders to 2017 from 2018 as it retires older 737s, according to Bloomberg.Southwest shares fell 3.2%.Coverage was initiated on Salesforce.com by Cowen with an outperform rating.Earlier this month, Salesforce agreed to buy Demandware, a provider of platforms for e-commerce, for $2.8 billion. The deal is Salesforce's largest acquisition.Shares lost 4.6%.Coverage on Adobe was initiated by Cowen at outperform. The digital media and marketing software firm released fiscal Q2 earnings after the markets closed on Tuesday. The company beat Wall Street forecasts, but investors focused on Q3 guidance, which missed Wall Street's target.Analysts remained largely positive on the prospects of a company that many say has transitioned quickly to the cloud-computing era.Adobe shares dropped 4.2%SolarCity was downgraded to hold from buy, and its price target was lowered to 25 from 32 by Citigroup.SolarCity has been hit with several negative reports from analysts in reaction to the plan by Tesla Motors (TSLA) to acquire the residential solar installer. Tesla made its stock-swap bid after the market close Tuesday in a deal valued at about $2.7 billion.

605,LUV,"Airlines are rallying Tuesday, with United Continental (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Delta Air Lines (DAL), JetBlue (JBLU) and Hawaiian Airlines (HA) all taking off.Carriers are having more luck raising fares, JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker wrote in a research note Tuesday. JetBlue hiked one-way fares by $3 on Monday, with American, Alaska Air (ALK), Delta, Southwest, United and Virgin America (VA) all matching on similar routes.However, Southwest also announced Tuesday the start of a three-day low-fare sale, with one-way domestic fares beginning at $49 and international fares starting at $99.Earlier signs of rapid capacity gains had sent airline stocks lower amid fears that the additional seats will weigh on airfares and profits.Late Monday, Hawaiian Airlines reported 4.9% in May passenger traffic growth that outpaced 0.3% capacity growth.Earlier Monday, American announced a change to its rewards program, with members now earnings 5 miles per dollar spent, and higher-status members earnings more miles per dollar.Shares of United closed up 2.9%. American climbed 3.5%, Delta rallied 2%, Southwest gained 3.3% and Hawaiian surged 5%. JetBlue rose 3.3%, and Spirit (SAVE) added 3.2%. But Alaska Air lagged somewhat with a 1.7% increase. Virgin America, which has agreed to a takeover by Alaska, edged up 0.4%.Shares of IBD's Transportation-Airline industry group collectively rose about 3%, though they remain well below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages after breaking support in April.RELATED:Delta Unit Revenue Slide Worsens; United Debuts ‘Polaris’

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Delta to report a 17.3% increase in earnings to $1.22 per share. Revenue is seen rising just 0.1% to $10.63 billion.Delta has reported that total available seat miles, a measure of capacity, rose 2.6% in June to 22.3 billion. Revenue passenger miles, a measure of traffic, rose 3.2% to 19.7 billion. Load factor edged up 0.6 point to 88.1%.In late June, Delta said it would increase cross-country capacity out of New York's JFK airport, expanding to 10 daily flights to Los Angeles from the nine it has currently. Six of the flights will use refurbished Boeing (BA) 757 aircraft. Delta will also upgrade three of its eight daily flights to San Francisco to Boeing 767 widebody aircraft.The move comes as United Continental (UAL) shifts its transcontinental flights to Newark from JFK.American Airlines (AAL) may follow suit and add flights out of JFK, according to Seth Kaplan, managing partner with Airline Weekly, an industry publication, in an earlier interview with IBD.The increases come at a time when airlines say they are being capacity conscious, trying not to let growth spiral out of control and hurt fares.Industry consolidation had limited growth in seats, keeping fares up, while the drop in fuel prices provided another boost to earnings. But some discount and regional carriers have been expanding rapidly, adding to pressure from Persian Gulf airlines that are boosting service in the U.S.Top U.S. airlines have trimmed capacity forecasts in response, and Southwest, which has been adding flights out of Texas, also pulled back from more aggressive plans.But the Justice Department has launched a probe to look into possible ""unlawful coordination"" among airlines to keep ticket prices high by containing capacity expansion and asked airlines to turn over intra-airline communications.Delta, American, United and Southwest Airlines (LUV), which have acknowledged they've been contacted by the DOJ, control about 85% of air traffic in the U.S.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

For Hawaiian Holdings' (HA) Hawaiian Airlines, complaints per 100,000 enplanements nearly tripled to 1.76.United's rate fell 28.6% to 2, Delta's edged down to 3% to 0.61, and American's complaints per 100,000 enplanements fell 34% to 2.13.Complaint rates also fell in March, and low fares and better on-time performance have made passengers happier overall with air travel. Airlines are trying to improve amenities as well to get more revenue out of passengers.But data for the month of May could slam the brakes on that trend, after scores of people missed flights due to epic wait-times at understaffed TSA checkpoints during the month. Lower airfares could encourage more people to fly this summer, adding more strain to the TSA.Airlines are trying to address the complaints. American Airlines has spent $4 million to deploy staff to help TSA staff move lines faster. Delta has ponied up $1 million to test out ""innovation lanes"" in Atlanta. The lane systems allow five passengers at a time to load items into bins.And U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey have also said airlines should eliminate bag fees this summer to move passengers through the lines more quickly.Shares of Spirit finished the day down 3.3% to 44.30, while Hawaiian tumbled 5.8% to 37.67.

Sarepta stock is up 28.5% this week.Airline stocks got a bump this week after an analyst report found carriers had raised airfares. But Delta Air Lines (DAL) said its Q2 unit revenue, a key metric that has fallen industrywide in part on lower fares in some markets, was likelier to come in closer to the low range of its forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% drop.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) was another big decliner in the group, down 11%, on news its flagship drug Soliris missed a primary goal in a late-stage trial. Soliris, already approved to treat a couple of rare blood diseases, is a big moneymaker for Alexion. The latest trial was looking at the drug as a possible treatment for a neuromuscular disease.The Dow industrials and S&P 500 added 0.4% each, with the latter hitting its highest level since last July. The Nasdaq picked up 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE was tracking close to Monday's levels. Nasdaq volume was heavy, partly due to the biotech sell-off.Early gainers in the Dow included Chevron (CVX), up 2.5%, and Exxon Mobil (XOM), up 1%, as West Texas Intermediate crude oil for July delivery reclaimed the $50-a-barrel level. It rose 0.7% to $50.02 a barrel.Despite rising oil prices, airlines were big winners, with American Airlines (AAL) up more than 4%, while Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and United Airlines (UAL) all up more than 3%.

"
674,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Monday raised its dividend 50% and said it would cut its expected carrying-capacity growth to ""below 2%"" for the second half of the year, part to become ""the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth later this year.""The carrier also said it would shave a percentage point off its fourth-quarter capacity growth plans, with a focus on cutting its expansion in ""underperforming markets"" domestically and in the Pacific region.Delta Air Lines rose 3.4% on the stock market today, helped by the increase in its annual payout to 81 cents. Delta rose back above its 200-day average, moving just above or below that key line over the  last  several sessions.American Airlines (AAL) rose 1.9%, United Airlines (UAL) added 1.7% and Southwest (LUV) also rallied 1.6%.Delta's forecast, included in an SEC filing, follows the company's promise last month to ""be disciplined with our business in the face of volatile fuel prices"" and turn around ever-falling unit revenue. Delta also said then that it would modify fall capacity levels if unit revenue did not show signs of improvement.""While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment and we know fuel won’t stay low permanently,"" CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company's Q1 conference call in April.But the industry's inability to pull unit revenue into positive territory and pare back expansion plans have continued to irritate investors. While low oil prices have helped polish the bottom line for airlines -- and allow them to shower investors with buybacks and dividend increases -- Wall Street has remained concerned about airlines' ability to operate more efficiently.Delta's stock has fallen since last month's earnings season, when the company and rivals issued disappointing forecasts for capacity growth and unit revenue. American, United, Southwest and others have followed suit.Passenger unit revenue -- or how much money an airline makes from passengers compared to flight capacity -- is often used as a way to assess an airline's efficiency and profitability. But the metric has fallen in tandem with the drop in oil prices.Low fuel costs inspired airlines to expand -- or overexpand, some might say -- since 2014. But competition from low-cost rivals like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), weaker demand and a stronger dollar have caused unit revenue to fall across the business. Airfare wars in some markets haven't helped.Some analysts have said Delta could be the first airline to turn out positive unit revenue growth since the drop in oil prices. But the company's own target for a unit-revenue increase has been delayed.""While we are not there yet, we understand the importance of getting back to positive revenue,"" President Glen Hauenstein said on Delta's Q1 call. ""Volatility and closer yields and challenges in Europe may mean we achieve our goal a few months later than we previously had expected, but we continued to target reaching the inflection point this year.""In the filing Monday, Delta said it would defer the delivery of four widebody aircraft from 2018 to 2019-2020. The decision, Cowen said in a research note, was also intended ""to address the current weakness in the international market, where there is still too much capacity on the north Atlantic.""Delta also said that volumes remained positive for many corporate travelers, but noted that ""fares continue to be depressed.""

676,LUV,"It turns out that Dubai-based Emirates -- the world's biggest international airline best known for its ultracosmopolitan plane interiors and aggressive overseas expansion -- has to deal with the same problems that less flashy rivals like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) face.The carrier -- whose growth plans have been a headache for the U.S. carriers -- said Tuesday that a measure of how full its seats were fell to 76.5% during its most recent fiscal year from 79.6%. The slide came amid a 13% jump in seating capacity and ""lingering economic uncertainty and strong competition in many markets.""What's more, Emirates' overall revenue fell 4% to $23.2 billion, with a tough currency exchange environment costing the company $1.6 billion. Passenger revenue fell by 3%. The stronger dollar also prompted a 10% decline in the carrier's passenger yield -- a measure of how much an airline gets from airfare as it relates to distance flown.Shares of Delta closed up 1.3% on the stock market today, United climbed 2.8%, and American added 2.5%. Southwest (LUV) rallied 1.6% and Alaska Air Group (ALK) rose 0.8%. JetBlue (JBLU), which has a codeshare agreement with Emirates, fell 0.6%.American also stuck to its forecast Tuesday for a 6%-8% drop in second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue and said that April traffic fell 0.2% year over year, with capacity up 1.3%.""Looking at the year ahead, we expect that the low oil prices will continue to be a double-edged sword – a boon for our operating costs, but a bane for global business and consumer confidence,"" Emirates CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in a statement. ""The strong U.S. dollar against major currencies will remain a challenge, as will the looming threat of protectionism in some countries.""The results follow a year in which Emirates expanded its fleet to 251 aircraft and broadened its passenger flight coverage to eight new areas, including Orlando, Fla. Those moves have posed stiffer competition stateside and abroad for Delta, American and United.The carrier now operates in many major U.S. cities, and has drawn attention over the years for its in-cabin bars, spas and state-of-the-art entertainment options on some flights. But terror attacks in Europe, where Emirates gets nearly a third of its revenue, and elsewhere dampened travelers' spirits.The results also come as U.S. airlines continue to try investors' patience over ever-growing capacity and falling unit revenue, a much-watched metric that is often a reflection of an airline's efficiency and ability to draw as much money as possible from passengers.Many analysts feel airlines have lacked sufficient restraint in their expansion plans, and worry they'll end up with too many seats compared to passengers who want to fly. Some airlines during last month's earnings season said they would pull back capacity growth to improve unit revenue, which has fallen due to inadequate demand and a stronger dollar.
"
677,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) said Monday it still expects a ""modest increase"" in second-quarter operating unit revenue, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) reportedly raised fares.Southwest's April passenger traffic rose 4.7% from a year earlier, outpacing a capacity increase of 4.3%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, edged up to 83.4%.Shares closed up 1.1% in the stock market today and continued to find support at their 200-day line. Airlines stocks sank last month after giving a disappointing Q2 outlook on unit revenue, which measures how much money airlines take in compared to available capacity.Delta shares rose 1.2%. Rivals United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were flat and down 0.3%, respectively. Spirit fell 0.6%.With massive cheap-fuel-induced profits essentially a given over the past two years or so, investors have increasingly turned their attention toward airlines' ability to pull back on capacity growth and wring more profit from passengers.Passenger unit revenue, often a way to look at how effectively airlines do just that, has fallen over that time as airlines expanded, lowering prices to compete with low-cost carriers like Spirit. The stronger dollar has also hurt unit revenue, and investors have been concerned about airlines' capacity growth, overshooting actual demand.Airlines have said they would pare back capacity if needed to improve unit revenue. The question has been when, exactly, the key metric will get out of negative territory.Delta and Spirit both boosted some fare prices last week, Cowen & Co. noted in a report today, adding that traffic results for April so far ""appear to be better than anticipated.""Delta last week said passenger unit revenue fell 4% in April. Traffic rose 2.7%, while capacity climbed 2.5%. Delta is expected to be the first airline to turn unit revenue around. But the carrier has pushed back its target to achieve flat-or-better revenue from this summer to the fall.""A key question is whether carriers will remain disciplined and remove capacity if demand deteriorates in an environment where returns are still elevated relative to history because of low fuel,"" Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates wrote in a report last week.

678,LUV,"Stock futures were quoted mixed early Monday, as a rally in crude oil prices faded.Futures for the Nasdaq were barely higher, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial showed a slight loss. Stocks appeared to be following crude oil, which climbed about 2% earlier today but were up only 0.3% near the opening bell of today's stock market.Wildfires in Canada disrupted oil production. Also, reports said Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister Saturday, which could cause a change in the Saudi policy of maintaining high oil production.Facebook (FB) fell slightly. The social networking company won a rare trademark victory in China against a company selling beverages labeled ""face book,"" Reuters reported. Facebook rose 1.6% last week to 119.49, but is still in buy range from a 117.09 buy point.Southwest Airlines (LUV) was up 0.7% ahead of the open. The carrier reported Monday a 4.7% increase in revenue passenger miles for April. Load factor, or percentage of seats sold, was a record for the month of April at 83.4%, vs. 83.1% a year earlier. Southwest said it continues to expect ""a modest increase"" in its Q2 operating revenue per available seat mile.Tyson Foods (TSN) vaulted nearly 4% in premarket moves after the poultry producer beat profit expectations. The company raised its forecast for adjusted earnings to $4.20-$4.30 a share. The stock is rising above its 50-day moving average.Baidu (BIDU) tumbled 5% in premarket trading. The China-based Internet search engine set limits on advertising after the death of a man who sought a cancer treatment advertised through Baidu. The stock has triggered the 8% sell rule from a 193.83 buy point.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) slid nearly 2% after Raymond James downgraded the retailer to market perform from strong buy. The stock has been extended from a 188.58 buy point, so it does not face an imminent sell signal.In Europe, Germany's DAX was up 1.5%, while France's CAC 40 rose 1%, and London's FTSE 100 edged up 0.1%.

679,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), and United Airlines (UAL) sold off after Air France-KLM became the latest air carrier to express caution over potential lower airfares and unit revenue.The French-Dutch carrier warned Wednesday of a ""a high level of uncertainty"" amid broader industry concerns about oil prices and a tough foreign exchange environment.On Tuesday, German carrier Lufthansa said it could face lower airfares and that it would rein in its expansion.Delta slid 3.5% in the stock market today. American dropped 4%, and United fell 3.35%. Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), however, crept up less than 0.1%.The declines come after a round of similar warnings during the airline industry's earnings season, much of which took place last month.Delta, for instance, expressed uncertainty over how long cheap oil -- and thus the industry's recent wave of quarterly profits -- could last. The company said it would cut carrying capacity if needed to improve unit revenue, a measure of how much an airline makes relative to how much capacity it has.The key metric is often a window into ticket prices and has generally fallen as airlines expanded over the last year or so. Investors and analysts have been watching for signals as to when airlines might be able to turn unit revenue around.Elsewhere, American also said last month that it expected lower unit revenue following “competitive capacity growth,” while United also said it would temper its growth plans.Other discount and regional carriers sold off as well. Southwest (LUV) dropped 3.4%, while low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) fell 4.2%. JetBlue (JBLU) eased 3%. Alaska Air Group (ALK), which recently announced the purchase of Virgin America (VA), was down 1.9%.
"
680,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Alaska Air (ALK) saw traffic gains outstrip capacity growth last month, as the airline sector tries to weather renewed warnings on over-expansion.Delta said Tuesday that consolidated passenger unit revenue fell 4% in April. But total system traffic, as measured by revenue passenger miles, rose 2.7%, while as capacity, measured by available seat miles, grew 2.5%.Delta Air Lines had last month projected a year-over-year 2.5%-4.5% passenger unit revenue decline in its second quarter, which would mark an improvement from its Q1 decline of of -4.6%. Capacity is expected to rise 2%-3% during the June quarter.Delta shares closed up 1.8% on the stock market today. The carrier's stock has been sinking since reporting March-quarter results on April 14, breaking support at both its 50-day and 200-day key levels.Alaska, which is buying Virgin America (VA) for $2.6 billion, said April traffic climbed 11.% as capacity grew 10.4%.Shares of Alaska ended virtually unchanged. American Airlines (AAL) edged up 0.2%. United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.2%. Southwest (LUV) shares slipped 2%. American, United and Southwest are all due to report April traffic figures over the next couple of weeks.Oil prices retreated again on Tuesday. That should be good news for airlines, absent fuel hedges, but crude futures are falling in large part on global growth concerns that could affect travel.Meanwhile, Deutsche Lufthansa said Tuesday that it is seeing ""significant pricing pressure"" at its passenger and cargo lines, but that unit cost cuts have ""more than made up for pricing declines.""

Is it because of the strong dollar or because of weakening global demand? Are those concepts mutually exclusive? No.....they go hand in hand..... Hey look! Commodities and the Dollar have an inverse relationship....when one goes up the other goes down - commodities are priced in dollars, foreign buyers will use dollars to buy commodities, so when the value of the dollar rises they have LESS buying power - putting pressure on demand, conversely when the dollar weakens - then they have more buying power which should naturally produce more demand....so before we all go and make ourselves crazy that there is a global slowdown and the end of the world is coming (again) - consider the natural inverse relationship between the dollar commodities.

A number of high profile 'tech' names reported earnings and the results were 'less than stellar' - not horrible, but just a bit disappointing......Commodities continued to weaken.........The chatter was all doom and gloom, THIS was going to be the catalyst for the market to correct. OMG! What would this all say about China? It's as if the whole world is dependent upon this one country.....It's the herd mentality playing out.....Apple (AAPL) - reported another great quarter - yet somehow so many seemed to find something wrong with the report or the $48 billion they earned or the 47 million units they sold or the $49 billion they are expected to earn in the current quarter..whatever.....That is what traders do - they react and pounce.....Investors do not...they do the analysis, they strategize and they lay out the plan - then they take advantage of the opportunity created by the short-term disruption....... and take advantage is what they did....buyers yesterday will be patting themselves on the back today as Apple begins the climb back. Look for it to struggle a bit at $127.80 - but after that - it's off to the races yet again......Just sayin.....Then we get the likes of some high profile market strategists - (Dennis Gartman) seeing 'the makings of a protracted bear market' - as he, like so many others, jumps on the commodity breakdown bandwagon......Gold, Copper, Oil, Wheat, Soybeans, all collapsing. Is it because of the strong dollar or because of weakening global demand? Are those concepts mutually exclusive? No.....they go hand in hand..... Hey look! Commodities and the Dollar have an inverse relationship....when one goes up the other goes down - commodities are priced in dollars, foreign buyers will use dollars to buy commodities, so when the value of the dollar rises they have LESS buying power - putting pressure on demand, conversely when the dollar weakens - then they have more buying power which should naturally produce more demand....so before we all go and make ourselves crazy that there is a global slowdown and the end of the world is coming (again) - consider the natural inverse relationship between the dollar commodities. And by the way - weaker oil and food prices NEVER hurt anybody....Add in the expectation that the Fed is about to raise rates - that will only cause the dollar to get stronger - which will put more pressure on commodities.....so what's the issue?

710,LUV,"Southwest (LUV) sees 2016 capacity growth slowing from 2015's pace, but gains will still be elevated and fares will be pressured in the near term.The discount carrier, whose added flights have sparked oversupply fears and a selloff in airline stocks, said Tuesday it intends to cap its 2016 capacity increase at about 6%, citing weaker-than-expected economic growth.Last month, Southwest discussed growth of 6%-7% for next year. The more cautious stance comes just over a week after it backtracked from plans to boost 2015 capacity by 8% and instead grow it by 7%.Shares closed down 4.2% at 34.59 on the stock market today to their lowest level since October. United Continental (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) reversed earlier losses and finished up 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively, despite a jump in oil prices. Delta Air Lines (DAL) pared steep losses ended down less than 0.1%.Despite Southwest's retreat from more aggressive targets, it still expects a key measure of unit revenue growth to suffer. On Tuesday, it said Q2 passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) should fall 4%-5% vs. a year ago.But Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk doesn't expect Southwest to lower its capacity guidance again, as any further reductions would require the airline to cancel new routes.""I think this was a bit of a minor tweak,"" he said of the latest move.While Southwest's planes were fuller in May, with the load factor rising to a record 84.4%, and traffic growth (8.5%) exceeded capacity gains (7.6%), PRASM sank 6% last month.""That was the point that scared the market,"" Purk added. ""Why add more capacity if it's not helping overall profitability?""The prospects for the U.S. airline industry have shifted dramatically from earlier this year, when low oil prices and a recent history of strict capacity discipline sent earnings and stock prices soaring.But while American, Delta and United have kept a tighter hold on capacity to boost pricing power, discount and regional airlines have been expanding service with new routes at more airports, sparking fare wars.Southwest's added flights out of Dallas in particular have been rippling through the industry. Competitive capacity in that market is increasing about 25% since last year's repeal of the Wright Amendment, which restricted nonstop U.S. service out of Southwest's Love Field hub, noted Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth in a research report issued Monday.The carrier's daily departures from Love Field have jumped to 166 from 118 in October, with plans to reach 180 later this year, Syth said.Such growth is hurting American Airlines, which has been responding on price and seeing unit revenue suffer as well. Last month, CEO Doug Parker told Bloomberg News that it will ""compete aggressively"" against discounters.On Tuesday, American lowered its Q2 PRASM forecast and now sees it falling 6%-8%, down from a previous outlook for a 4%-6% slide. May traffic edged up 0.7%, lagging its 2.1% capacity gain, and the load factor dipped 1.2 percentage points to 82.8%.Late Monday, United said it sees Q2 PRASM falling 5%-6% vs. its earlier guidance for a 4%-6% drop. May traffic rose 0.5%, with capacity up 2.1%. Load factor decreased 1.4 points.Although the big domestic airlines haven't been adding flights as quickly as Southwest has, they are trimming capacity views too.On Thursday, Delta said it was ""reassessing domestic capacity levels for the Fall — current bias is for a downward revision,"" and United reaffirmed its 2015 capacity growth target of 1%-2%, which the airline lowered in April from its earlier forecast for 1.5%-2.5%.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

730,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) dropped Thursday after the disappearance of an EgyptAir flight raised new fears of terrorism.Egypt's civil aviation minister said the cause was more likely terrorism than any technical problems, but the exact reasons for the flight's disappearance were still unclear. U.S. intelligence officials said there is evidence an explosion took place on the plane, NBC News reported. Debris from a plane was found near Greece.Shares of Delta closed down 1.7%, American lost 1.4%, and United slid 2.8% in the stock market today. It wasn't much better for other national carriers: Southwest (LUV) fell 1.7% and JetBlue (JBLU) eased 1%, while Spirit Airlines (SAVE) dipped 0.4%.Sixty-six people were aboard the plane, EgyptAir Flight 804, which was headed to Cairo from Paris and lost radar contact early Thursday. The Airbus (EADSY) jet ""swerved and then plunged"" toward the Mediterranean, Greece's defense minister said, according to CNN.The big aircraft companies felt the pinch as a result, though the jet's maker Airbus wasn't hit as hard as Boeing (BA). Shares of Boeing fell 2.2%, while Airbus rose 0.4%.Shares of Delta, American and United fell by about the same level following the November attacks in Paris and the Brussels attacks in March. But neither of those attacks involved the use of jetliners or resulted in any extended sell-off, perhaps because investors anticipated that travel demand would rebound. Some airlines have recently suggested the impact of the attacks in Brussels was largely short-lived or offset by other factors.While German carrier Lufthansa this month reported a first-quarter net loss, Chief Financial Officer Simone Menne said the attacks in Brussels had not weighed significantly on the company's financial performance, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, the newspaper said, bookings made well in advance were less common.And Delta and American have said demand has held up despite the attacks.""In our core European markets, U.S. point-of-sale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the events in Brussels,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said on the carrier's first-quarter conference call in April.""Demand across the trans-Atlantic though, particularly in light of the Brussels tragedy, has remained pretty strong and pretty resilient,"" American Airlines President J. Scott Kirby said during the company's Q1 call last month.But the sentiment hasn't been as positive elsewhere. United said the after-effects of those attacks would likely weigh on the second quarter, but it added that demand generally tends to rebound after such incidents.""I think the recent events and the tragedy in Brussels has impacted bookings,"" Chief Revenue Officer James Compton said on United's Q1 call in April. ""What we generally see is a slowdown in bookings after events like that. Those begin to pick back up, but quite frankly you lose days, even weeks of the booking curve.""And Air France said this month that for its long-haul flights, ""it was a mixed story, with, of course, a negative impact of the geopolitical unrest and the aftermath of the Paris attacks and what happened in Brussels at the end of March.""The parent of British Airways, International Airlines Group (ICAGY), also said it would pull back on its expansion plans after the attacks in Brussels hurt travel demand.

731,LUV,"Alaska Air Group's (ALK) takeover of Virgin America (VA) allows it to expand on the West Coast, where it competes aggressively with Delta Air Lines (DAL) in Seattle, but it also inherits Virgin's struggles to stay abreast of an industry unafraid to cut fares or borrow from its in-flight panache.Alaska Air on Monday said it would buy Virgin for $57 a share, or $2.6 billion, beating out rival bidder JetBlue (JBLU). The deal is expected to close by Jan. 1, 2017.Virgin America shares soared 41.7% to 55.12. Alaska fell 3.8%, and JetBlue dropped 4.3%.Analysts said the lesson for Virgin, which launched nearly a decade ago with plans to restore glamour to a utilitarian, consolidation-prone industry, is that in-flight atmosphere isn't everything.""This was an airline that never really found its footing in terms of profitability,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. ""It's been sustainable over the past few years just because the tide is so high in the U.S. that you can be the least profitable airline and still be profitable in global terms.""The deal comes after Virgin's profitability has soared on low fuel costs. But earnings still lagged other carriers' as Virgin struggled to compete against lower-cost airlines. For example, it had said it would not lower fares in the highly competitive Dallas region.But despite the popularity of Virgin's mood-lighting and in-flight entertainment, the lounge-like setting was perhaps a bit too lavish for customers who just wanted more affordable airfares.""That made it impossible for them to ever be all that profitable in short-haul markets,"" Kaplan said.It's unclear what will become of Virgin America. Alaska Air said on a conference call that the Alaska brand would stay and that they wanted to ""learn more"" about the Virgin America brand for potential future use.Kaplan said that Alaska's stronger balance sheet gives it flexibility to step up its business-class offerings or stick with what it has. Alaska is unlikely to bring premium products to shorter flights, he said, but it's also unlikely to gut what's made Virgin a well-liked airline.For Alaska, which has been growing capacity aggressively in recent years, the deal expands its West Coast transcontinental flights. Kaplan also called it a defensive move to keep JetBlue at bay in the region.The deal boosts Alaska's scale, negotiating power and efficiency, and aligns with its broader plans to expand coverage, Loizos Heracleous, a professor at Warwick Business School and airline researcher, told IBD.Regulatory concerns are likely to be minimal, given the carriers' similarities and relatively small sizes, he added.But the deal raises questions about whether Alaska overpaid. Alaska's agreement to buy Virgin at $57 a share is 46% higher than Virgin's closing price Friday and 86% higher than the price on March 22, a day before Bloomberg reported Virgin was considering putting itself up for sale.Kaplan said that the price tag is ""very high for an airline that's not all that successful compared to most of its peers."" Heracleous said the bidding war raised the price to levels that will make it hard for Alaska to garner benefits that can justify the price, at least in the short-term.The move would also present challenges in Dallas, where Southwest (LUV) reigns supreme, American Airlines (AAL) has struggled to compete, and Virgin has gotten killed.""Alaska's going to have to make some decisions about whether to double down or do something different there, or tolerate it or get out and find somebody else to take the gates,"" Kaplan said.Still, analysts say it was the right time to cash in. While most profitable airlines had either a strong network or low costs, Virgin had neither of those.""If you don't have very low costs, you're just not going to generate the revenue premiums from the corporate travel community that you need when your network is inferior, when you don't have as many flights,"" Kaplan said. ""I don't care how much mood-lighting you have.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

732,LUV,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Air (ALK) reported strong first-quarter results Thursday, bolstered by lower fuel prices. Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) shares tumbled on a weak passenger revenue forecast.IBD's Take: How does United Airlines stack up vs. its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupSouthwest's Q1 earnings climbed 25.7% to 88 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 84 cents. Revenue rose 9.3% to $4.8 billion, in line with views.Operating unit revenue (RASM) was flat vs. a year ago and capacity jumped 9.2%. Southwest expects ""modestly positive"" Q2 RASM vs. the year ago quarter.Fuel costs during the quarter fell 11% to $1.78 per gallon, and Southwest sees Q2 costs of $1.75-$1.80 per gallon, below the $2.02 it was in the year ago quarter.Unlike most of its peers, Southwest stock maintained altitude, closing up 1.45% in the stock market today to 47.73, its best level since hitting a record high of 51.34 on Dec. 7.Alaska Air's Q1 EPS rose 30% to $1.45, beating views by 3 cents. Revenue was up 6.1% to $1.35 billion, just above views for $1.34 billion.Capacity jumped 12.9% year over year and passenger revenue rose by 4%.Alaska shares fell 2.7%.For Q2, Alaska sees capacity up 11% and cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and special items, falling 1%. For the year, the carrier expects capacity to rise 8%  and costs per available seat mile falling 0.5%.Earlier this month, Alaska Air said it would buy Virgin America (VA) in an all-cash deal valued at $2.6 billion. The deal is expected to close later this year or early next year.Airlines are getting a major boost from lower oil prices. But Delta Air Lines (DAL) management said last week that if fuels prices go up and economies don’t grow, that will be an indication the industry would need to pull back on capacity to increase margins.United Airlines late Tuesday said it would curb growth plans as industry capacity outpaces traffic. United Air beat Q1 profit estimates but said Q2 passenger revenue per available seat mile will fall 6.5% to 8.5% after Q1's 7.4% PRASM slide.United Airlines stock dived 10%, falling through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages after rising for eight straight sessions.Delta shares fell 3.5%.Hawaiian's (HA) Q1 earnings more than doubled to 80 cents a share, beating by 4 cents, but a 2% revenue increase to $551.2 million fell short of views for $558.2 million. Shares fell 1.7% late after closing down 1.4%.American Airlines (AAL), which reports Friday morning, fell 3%.
"
733,LUV,"United Airlines (UAL) announced Wednesday it will slow growth plans after naming former Air Canada CEO Robert Milton non-executive chairman and appointed two new board members to satisfy activist investors.United Airlines late Wednesday  reported first-quarter earnings per share that fell less than expected. Highly rated Southwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) report earnings on Thursday.Current United Chairman Henry Meyer and two other directors won't seek re-election at the carrier's annual meeting in June.United appointed Barney Harford, former CEO of online travel service company Orbitz Worldwide, and Edward Shapiro, a partner at PAR Capital Management, to its board. United will also add a mutually agreed upon third independent director in the next six months.The move was meant to appease PAR Capital and Altimeter Capital Management, which claimed that the carrier didn't have enough directors with expertise in airlines.The hedge funds, who together own 7.1% of United, argued that industry experts were needed to help CEO Oscar Munoz, former president of railroad operator CSX Corp. (CSX).Munoz was appointed CEO in September, but suffered a heart attack in October and took a five-month leave of absence.""We are eager to see the new board turn its attention to creating stockholder value, improving labor relations and enhancing customer satisfaction,"" said Paul Reeder, CEO of PAR Capital, in a press release.Late Wednesday, United said Q1 EPS fell 19% to $1.23, beating views by 5 cents. Revenue fell 4.8% to $8.2 billion, in line with views. Revenue per available seat mile fell by 7.4% and United said it would slow growth plans as supply outpaces demand.United shares were down 2.7% in late trading after closing up 1% in the stock market today.Southwest Airlines, Alaska Air and Hawaiian all closed down fractionally Wednesday.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
734,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) sees $3 billion in fuel savings this year but is also looking ahead to the end of cheap oil and vowed Thursday to improve unit revenue via capacity cuts if necessary.Ed Bastian, president and soon-to-be CEO of Delta, said in a conference call that the carrier is ""pushing as much of those fuel savings to the bottom line as we can.""In the first quarter, adjusted fuel expenses plunged 54% to $1.24 billion on 40% lower market-fuel prices. That helped Q1 earnings nearly triple to $1.32 per share, 2 cents better than consensus forecasts. Revenue fell 1.5% to $9.25 billion, slightly under views for $9.26 billion, as currency headwinds and the terrorist bombings in Brussels weighed.Shares rose as much as 3.7% earlier in the day but ended 0.9% higher in the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) climbed 3.1%. United Airlines (UAL) rose 2.1%, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) added 1.9%.While Delta expects fuel to average $1.48-$1.53 per gallon in Q2, up from $1.33 in Q1, more unfavorable fuel hedges will expire, helping Delta boost profits.Still, oil prices have rallied since February, and market forecasters are seeing signs that the global supply glut could ease later this year.""While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment and we know fuel won’t stay low permanently,"" said CFO Paul Jacobson on the conference call. ""So as result we remain focused on staying disciplined with our costs.""Delta management added that demand is strong, but if fuels prices go up and economies don’t grow, then that will be an indication the industry would need to pull back on capacity to increase margins.In Q1, passenger unit revenue fell 4.6% on a 2.7% increase in capacity. For Q2, Delta sees passenger unit revenue falling 2.5%-4.5% and capacity up 2%-3%.“While this is an improvement over our March quarter performance, we are focused on getting unit revenues back to a positive trajectory and we will make adjustments to our fall capacity levels if we are not making sufficient progress over the coming months,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s incoming president, in the earnings release.Capacity typically grows when oil prices fall as carriers look to lower unit costs. But that comes at the expense of unit revenues.Seth Kaplan, managing partner with Airline Weekly, said Delta and others will have to keep a ""real close eye on capacity"" to keep falling unit revenues in check.He also applauded Delta's performance in Q1, an off-peak quarter, saying the numbers would have been the envy of the industry even in a peak quarter.""First and foremost this is a fuel story,"" Kaplan said. ""But it's not only that, it's also a deft capacity-management story.""Delta has other factors working to its advantage besides low fuel costs. Its network exposure has been more sheltered from slowing economies in Asia that have impacted United, though Delta is among the U.S. carriers being hit by new capacity from low-cost Chinese airlines expanding rapidly.Delta also has less exposure to Latin America, which is likely to hit American's Q1 earnings. And domestically, it doesn't have as much exposure to the Texas market, which is reeling from falling oil prices, as peers like United do.American, United and Southwest report quarterly results next week.
"
735,LUV,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) first-quarter earnings are expected to nearly triple from a year earlier when the airline reports results Thursday, helped as ever by low fuel costs. But with the company expecting positive passenger unit revenue this year -- a rarity across the industry recently -- analysts may be focusing more on the company's guidance.Meanwhile, labor and profit-sharing deals could weigh on American Airlines' (AAL) earnings this year, the company said Monday. But it lowered its capacity guidance, which was pushed down by difficulties internationally.Wall Street expects Delta to report Q1 earnings per share of $1.30, up 189% from the 45 cents reported a year earlier. Total revenue for the quarter is expected to edge down to $9.256 billion.Delta's passenger unit revenue -- how much an airline makes per passenger as it relates to its available flight capacity -- likely fell roughly 4.5% in the quarter, the company said last week in an investor update.Passenger unit revenue has fallen across the industry due to the stronger dollar, which discourages foreign travel, as well as lower airfares and capacity expansion last year in some competitive markets.But given Delta's upbeat forecasts on the key metric, many investors could be looking more toward Q2.""Delta continues to reiterate they expect PRASM to turn positive at some point in the summer (for a day? a month? the quarter? remains unclear), and it will be interesting to see if they reiterate that on the earnings call,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note Monday. PRASM refers to passenger revenue per available seat mile.Delta could have a lot more room for profits this year as fuel hedges -- contracts airlines enter into to lock in fuel prices and guard against market fluctuations -- fall away. The company's staff is less unionized than rivals, which also gives it more financial flexibility.The carrier likely paid an average of $1.33-$1.37 a gallon in fuel for the quarter, it said last week. But unit costs were seen rising between 4.5%-5%, with carrying capacity up around 2.7%.The company also expects operating margins in the quarter of 18%-19%, below an earlier forecast of 18%-20%.Last week, Delta said the company's March traffic results suffered from weaker foreign exchange and ""a $5 million impact"" due to the terror attacks in Brussels. However, the company said that ""demand remains solid with forward bookings tracking ahead of last year,"" even though close-in yields -- a measurement of last-minute bookings -- weighed on results during the month.Shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today. Earlier, shares topped their 50-day and 200-day lines, which had become entangled in recent days, but ended below those levels of support.Meanwhile, rival American Airlines said it expected recent contract deals with staff to push unit costs 3%-5% higher this this year. The return of a profit-sharing program, announced last month, will also increase unit costs. However, the company lowered its full-year capacity guidance to a 2.5% increase from an earlier forecast of 3% growth.""The international capacity reductions do not come as much of a surprise, given the currency headwinds, lower fuel surcharges, recent terrorist events in Paris and Brussels, as well as struggling international economies,"" Becker said in a separate research note Monday. ""The reduction in capacity will increase non-fuel unit costs but benefit PRASM.""American expects first-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall roughly 7%-8%, worse than an earlier forecast for a 6%-8% slide, and stuck with its forecast of pretax margin of 12%-14%. The margin outlook includes the impact of the profit-sharing program.The airline reports first-quarter results on April 22. Analysts expect EPS to fall 33% to $1.15, with revenue down 4% to $9.4 billion.American's March traffic rose 3.3%, while capacity grew 3.8%, the company said Monday. Load factor, a measure of an airline's ability to fill seats, slipped 0.4 percentage point.Shares rallied 0.6% Monday, but they have trended below their 50-day and 200-day lines following the announcement of the profit-sharing agreement.On Friday, United Airlines (UAL) reported that traffic and capacity slipped in March. The carrier expects first-quarter passenger unit revenue to fall 7.25%-7.75%, hurt by a stronger dollar, falling close-in business travel around spring break and Easter, and ""travel reductions from energy-dependent corporate customers.""United shares rose 1.2% Monday.The end of certain federal restrictions in 2014 allowed Southwest (LUV) to expand its flight coverage, prompting other airlines to boost capacity to compete.While that sparked worries that expansion could overshoot demand, there's a greater sense that the bigger players could temper their growth plans this year as the smoke clears.""For the first time in a while, we actually expect an improvement in (year over year) PRASM growth in Q2, entirely on capacity deceleration and not higher fares,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note last week. He said schedule data indicates domestic capacity in the industry growing 4.5% in the second quarter, down from 6.3% in Q1.Image provided by Shutterstock.

738,LUV,"Boeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) and Siemens (SIEGY) have agreed to work together on developing an electrically powered aircraft, with a plan of ""demonstrating the technical feasibility"" of hybrid or electric propulsion systems by 2020, the companies said Thursday.Boeing has also put its weight behind efforts to develop electric aircraft, and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has also entertained the idea of making an electric jet.Airbus in 2014 ran its first public test flight of the E-Fan, a two-seat electric aircraft intended for pilot training. Siemens has been at work on an electric aircraft engine since sometime around 2011, when Airbus, Siemens and Austrian aviation company Diamond Aircraft introduced a hybrid aircraft.For their latest effort, Airbus and Siemens have assembled some 200 employees who will focus on the project. The companies will focus on propulsion systems for smaller, short-haul aircraft with 100 seats or less.The aviation industry in recent years has sought ways to conserve fuel and keep the skies cleaner and quieter amid more ambitious environmental goals across a variety of nations. Europe is targeting 75% lower CO2 emissions by 2050 as compared to 2000 levels, the companies noted in a statement.""Electric and electric-hybrid flight represent some of the biggest industrial challenges of our time, aiming at zero-emissions aviation,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in the statement, adding that the company believed hybrid aircraft with 100 seats or less ""could be propelled by hybrid propulsion systems"" by 2030.Airbus shares closed down 0.6% in the stock market today, with shares briefly emerging above the handle of a cup-with-handle base last month but failing to advance higher. Siemens eased 2.9%.Boeing fell 0.7% as it reported a 4.3% drop in Q1 commercial aircraft deliveries. Tesla shares fell 3%.Airbus and Siemens' plans come even as low oil prices continue to free up room for more profit for airlines. However, several airlines, including some unidentified bigger ones, ""moved last week to place significant oil price hedges for 2017, 2018 and even 2019,"" Reuters reported Wednesday, citing sources.The hedges, used by airlines to lock in fuel prices in attempt to guard against fluctuations in those prices, were smaller than in years past, Reuters said. But they could be a sign that airlines are more convinced the bottom for oil prices might be near.Airlines, however, don't exactly have a great track record in predicting fuel prices. Wolfe Research, in a research note Wednesday, estimated that the four largest U.S. airlines may have suffered an aggregate loss of $5 billion in hedging fuel over the past 10 years.""Hedging to cover fuel costs over the period it takes to cut capacity in the event of a change in the demand environment is understandable,"" Wolfe analyst Hunter Keay wrote. ""Hedging beyond that, into 2018-19, for example, isn’t hedging -- it’s gambling.""Delta Air Lines' (DAL) shares closed down 3%; American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.4%, United Airlines (UAL) fell 3.6% and Southwest (LUV) ended virtually flat.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Unit revenue for the quarter fell around 4.5%, hurt by foreign exchange, and it sees carrying capacity rising roughly 2.7%.The company said its fuel costs were likely $1.33-$1.37 per gallon during the quarter.Consolidated passenger unit revenue in March fell 5%. Foreign exchange also weighed. The airline logged an on-time performance of 87.8%. Carrying capacity rose 1.5%, outpacing a traffic increase of 1.2%.

Not every stock obeys its 50-day line, but it often works because institutional investors see such a pullback as an opportunity to add shares. Individual investors can do the same.
"
762,LUV,"As you watch the 50-day moving average on a daily chart, don't forget about the 200-day line.
"
763,LUV,"This line is less frequently used as a support area for a fast-moving stock. Most stocks that are rallying sharply are well above the line. Yet the 200-day moving average can help you decide when to exit a long-term winner.
"
764,LUV,"Let's step back and define what we mean by the moving average lines. In the 200-day line, each day you add the closing price for all of the past 200 trading sessions, then divide by 200 to get an average. Many chart services, including IBD and its sister company, MarketSmith , have 50-day and 200-day lines built in.
"
765,LUV,"Some investors use other lines, such as the 10-day line, to time short-term trades.
"
766,LUV,"One way to use the 200-day line is as a sell signal if the stock is 70% to 100% above the line. But IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil writes in ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" that he has seldom used that signal. You should probably use it only when other sell signals confirm it.
"
767,LUV,"But there are instances in which you can use it as a support line. Take Gol Intelligent Airlines (GOL) in its run-up to a 2006 top.
"
768,LUV,"Brazil-based Gol was a discounter in the mold of Southwest Airlines (LUV). Its fares were cheap enough to get budget travelers off buses and cars. Despite rising fuel prices, which pinched all airlines, Gol managed to grow market share from 4.7% when it started in 2001 to 45% by 2007.
"
769,LUV,"Gol's earnings soared 148%, 58% and 80% between 2004 and 2006.
"
770,LUV,"The stock went public in June 2004, built an IPO base, moved up and eventually formed another base. It cleared a double bottom with handle on Nov. 1, 2005.
"
771,LUV,"It was a solid breakout. The stock moved up more than 20% in three weeks, which means that investors should have held it at least eight weeks to see if it should be a long-term hold.
"
772,LUV,"Gol rose until May 2006. Before the breakout, the stock had found support at its 40-week moving average (1), a weekly chart's equivalent to the 200-day line on a daily chart. After a big move up, Gol moved sideways and found support again (2).
"
773,LUV,"After Gol broke down and fell below the line (3) in October 2006, the 40-week moving average turned into an area of upside resistance. That's a good sell signal.
"
774,LUV,"In 2007, Gol acquired the assets of bankrupt Varig Airlines. A year later, Gol reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, ""The launch and integration of Varig's operations, however, has in 2007 and may, in the near term, result in lower profitability.""

776,LUV,"Airline stocks fell last week on investors' concerns that capacity was expanding too much for airlines' own good.

833,LUV,"Domestic-focused airlines like Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) may largely evade an expected downturn in corporate travel that looks set to hit larger rivals like American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental (UAL).In a Friday research note, Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg downgraded American, Delta, United and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) to hold from buy due to a slowdown in corporate profits that is typically a leading indicator of economic activity, as well as corporate travel.""The prevailing view is that we are in the latter stages of an economic cycle (April marks the 83rd month of U.S. GDP expansion, fourth longest on record) which is typically a period of underperformance for U.S. airline stocks,"" Linenberg said.Also, UBS analyst Darrly Genovesi said his Q1 EPS estimates are below analyst consensus, and cited data that books imply a 7% Q1 decline in carriers' unit revenue.United shares closed down 5.25% in the stock market today, despite falling oil prices. American lost 3.6%, Delta fell 3.4% and Hawaiian slipped 2.5%. Southwest dipped 0.5%, but JetBlue rallied 1%.On a brighter note, ""Consumer spending and housing, on the other hand, have fared better,"" Linenberg wrote, ""which should bolster demand for discretionary and leisure travel, at least through the summer.""Accordingly, Deutsche Bank analysts have favored ""domestic names that are less reliant on corporate travel"" -- specifically, Southwest, Alaska Air Group (ALK), JetBlue, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and SkyWest (SKYW).Shares of Spirit fell 2%, Alaska Air Group ended flat, and SkyWest slumped 1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

834,LUV,"Ahead of the anticipated release of March traffic data, several airline stocks -- including United Continental (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Virgin America (VA)  and Ryanair (RYAAY) -- are all at or near buy points.Delta, often the first to release monthly traffic and capacity data, fell 1.3% to 48.68 in the stock market today. The stock tried but failed to stage a breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 49.55 buy point earlier in the month, but it is presenting a new entry point at 50.60.The company said last week that Delta customers were among those killed in the March 22 terror attack at Brussels' Zaventem Airport. The airport said Thursday that it is ""technically ready"" to open again, according to an AFP report.European budget carrier Ryanair remains squarely in buy territory Thursday after breaking out last week from a cup-with-handle base with a 84.97 entry point, falling fractionally to 86.04 intraday. It uses Charleroi Airport, located an hour south of Brussels, which has become a key stop for air travelers while Zaventem remains closed, said Bloomberg. More than 90 of Ryanair's Thursday flights were canceled, however, due to strikes by French air traffic controllers.United shares rose less than 0.1% to 59.86, having formed a long, choppy base over the last year or so, with no clear entry point. But 61-62 has been a resistance area for the last several months.Meanwhile, Southwest shares were just shy of a 45.49 buy point mid-afternoon, down 0.4% to close at 44.80 after forming a cup-with-handle base since December. The carrier said Thursday that it is partnering with Lyft to reward Southwest loyalty program members who use the ride-sharing service for the first time.Virgin America rose as much as 39.18 intraday, edging it closer to an entry point of 39.30 from a cup base, though shares cooled to 38.56 at the close, up 0.2%. The stock has surged in recent days on reports that Virgin America has put itself for sale, and that JetBlue (JBLU) or Alaska Air Group (ALK) are suitors. Alaska Air broke out on March 11 and dipped 0.4% Thursday to 82.02, just below the top of the buy range at 82.52.

839,LUV,"Shares of Virgin America (VA) spiked 13% Wednesday on a Bloomberg report that the carrier was considering putting all or part of itself up for sale after ""receiving takeover interest.""The news follows a string of strong results since Virgin's 2014 IPO and its recent -- and potentially difficult -- plans to expand in an environment where low oil prices have generated higher profits and steeper competition. Several years ago, a wave of consolidation overtook the airline industry following intense capacity growth.Virgin America, known for its stylish plane interiors and deep reserves of in-flight entertainment options, has been engaging parties potentially interested in a purchase and consulted a financial adviser on the matter, Bloomberg reported, adding that Virgin had not yet made a final decision on whether to offer itself up for sale.Shares of JetBlue (JBLU), another rapidly expanding carrier, climbed 2.2% on the stock market today.Any sale, however, would come amid Virgin America's plans to grow capacity by around 15% this year and by around 10% annually in the years to come, according to a Cowen & Co. research note last month. The carrier began increasing capacity last year after having not expanded for three years, the note said.""Virgin's capacity growth might result in 'growing pains,' with yields coming under pressure in an attempt to stimulate demand,"" the note said.Virgin has locked horns with Southwest (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL) in the highly competitive Dallas market, pushing fares lower.""Management stated they do not intend to match low fares or engage in market share battles,"" the note said of Virgin. ""To that end, they have rationalized their capacity in Dallas by growing to markets where they are strong. As a result, they are seeing better pricing. Virgin's growth strategy going forward will focus on Hawaii and Denver, while strengthening core (transcontinental) markets.""Southwest stock ticked 0.4% lower, and American fell 2%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

840,LUV,"Ryanair (RYAAY) debuted initiatives Tuesday meant to improve customer service, and JetBlue (JBLU) said it would expand its transcontinental Mint premium service.European budget carrier Ryanair is known for its no-frills pricing and amenities but the carrier announced plans to revamp aircraft interior for more legroom, offer auto check in, and lower ticket prices by passing on ""on lower oil savings"" to travelers.So far major U.S. carriers like American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL)  haven't passed on fuel savings to travelers as base fares have remained the same over the past two years despite oil's plunge from over $100 a barrel to about $40.Ryanair's U.S.-listed shares rose 0.45% in the stock market today.Meanwhile, U.S. discount carrier JetBlue said it would start offering its Mint premium service to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Las Vegas, San Diego and Seattle in 2017 and 2018.Mint launched in 2014, offering amenities like seats that fully recline into beds, to customers flying between New York and California. It also has flights out of Boston to destinations in the Caribbean.JetBlue used to fly passengers in coach-only cabins, similar to Southwest Airlines' (LUV) business model, but its Mint service turned the carrier into a sort of hybrid that  looks to capture high-margin business travelers and lower-margin vacationers.JetBlue shares fell 0.2%.After the market close, JetBlue said March traffic rose 12.1% vs. a year earlier, while capacity climbed 12.5%.The expansion of Mint comes a week after Alaska Air (ALK) beat out JetBlue to buy the high-value, low-fare Virgin America (VA) in a deal with a total equity value of $2.6 billion. The transaction is valued at $4 billion, including debt and aircraft operating leases, according to the airlines.On Tuesday, Alaska Air said its Horizon Air unit is buying 30 three-class Embraer (ERJ) E175 jets, in a deal valued at $2.8 billion. Horizon plans to use the jets for ""long, thin routes"" that are too far for its current Bombardier Q400 turobprops.Alaska Air shares rallied 1%, while Embraer climbed 0.9%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

919,LUV,"Find your passion and stay true to yourself to get top results. Cheryl Bachelder, CEO of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (PLKI), has asked dozens of people why they work. She rarely heard a meaningful answer until that of her hairdresser.His goal was to lift the confidence of his clients and help them feel better about themselves by helping them look good. ""When people know their purpose, you see it in their demeanor and in their performance,"" Bachelder told IBD. ""He was the top performer at the hair salon."" Here's how to get that kind of performance: Find your reason. Figure out what your company does besides turning a profit. Roy Spence, co-founder and chairman of Austin, Texas-based ad agency GSD&M, worked with Herb Kelleher at Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Sam Walton at Wal-Mart (WMT).Kelleher was in business to democratize the sky. Walton wanted to save people money.""They had a purpose beyond making money,"" said Spence, who also co-founded Austin's Purpose Institute. ""Purpose is important because it gives you the why."" Dig deep. Great business leaders start companies to serve a need, Spence says. You can't just sit down and come up with the purpose for your firm. It should become apparent.He asks leaders three questions to determine it: What are you most passionate about? What can your company do the best in the world? If the company collapsed, what would people miss about it? Make it a point. Take action to build your culture. You don't create a vibe by posting a plaque on the wall, says Bachelder, who wrote ""Dare to Serve."" Popeyes has new employees talk about where they get their motivation. That helps her develop people and get them to perform their best.""If you as leaders don't draw that out of people, we're not doing our jobs,"" she said. ""How you do things will determine your culture."" Win trust. When Bachelder took over Popeyes in 2007, she knew she had to show that she lived by her principles. She and top managers made themselves accountable, treated others with dignity and remained humble. They listened to franchisees and worked with them to solve problems.""Our steady, consistent actions showed we were working for them,"" she said. ""They became confident and trusted our leadership."" Stand by principles.  Tell employees and prospective hires what your values are. Then it's easier to bring in like-minded people. Spence's firm includes integrity among its standards.""If you live and breathe those core values, you'll hire people who share those values,"" he said. Set the example. Leaders should start every meeting by saying, ""You know why we're here?"" and then explain why, Spence says. He quotes the view attributed to management guru Peter Drucker: ""Culture eats strategy for lunch."" Don't stop. Once you've instilled the culture among your employees, the job is just beginning. Bachelder spreads values to top managers, who take them to franchisees, who take them to store employees. Finally, customers see the results in good food and service.""That can break down anytime in the chain, and then it's not visible to our guests,"" Bachelder said. Reap rewards. Bachelder believes her push for purpose has driven Popeyes' results, which include an 1,800% stock rocket since 2008. ""This is all about driving performance results,"" she said. Strengthen. Put people in positions to excel, Spence said: ""People will love the impact they make on people's lives.""

921,LUV,"Airline stocks on Thursday continued to falter for a third day after the terrorist attacks in Brussels. Oil prices were edging lower once again, which usually gives a boost to airlines, but the oil benefit wasn't strong enough to outweigh the current global travel fears.Let’s take a look at the charts of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Air Group (ALK).Delta’s 2.2% drop put the stock further away from a cup-with-handle buy point it cleared in strong volume on Friday. Thursday’s volume was lighter than average. Shares are now trading 9% below their December peak.American fell 3.4% in above-average turnover. The stock breached support at the 200-day line and is now looking for support at the 50-day line. Shares are trading 24% below their 52-week high.United gapped down 3.2% in above-average volume. Shares are above their 200-day line, but the stock has moved more or less sideways for many months. It’s 15% below its 52-week peak.Southwest was also down for a third straight day, falling 0.8%, but it was able to pare its losses. Volume was light. The stock was trading 14% below its high and a potential buy point.And Alaska dropped 0.65% in lighter-than-average trade. Shares are still trading in buy range from a cup-with-handle base the stock broke out of earlier this month. Alaska is 7% below its December high.

922,LUV,"Most airline stocks were down on Wednesday, yet not by much, following Tuesday's terror attacks in Brussels. Airline stocks in general are making their way through -- or trying to emerge from -- consolidations.United Airlines (UAL) fell 1.2% to 59.74 in the stock market today, after finding resistance above 61 once again on Monday. The buy point is 61.97. Shares over the past month have moved above their 50-day and 200-day lines, both key tests of investor support. The all-time high was 74.52 on Jan. 26, 2015.Delta Air Lines (DAL) dropped below a 49.55 buy point on Tuesday following the Brussels attacks and continued to slip Wednesday. Shares lost 1% to 48.91, so the stock could still retake the buy point. On Friday and Monday, the shares started to break out from a cup-with-handle base begun in December.A week before Delta's attempt at a breakout, Alaska Air Group (ALK) delivered an uppercut through a 78.55 buy point of a cup-with-handle base and rose most of the way until dipping Tuesday and losing 1.1% to 81.12 on Wednesday. The stock is in buy range until 82.48. As with Delta, Alaska Air Group first began carving out the base in December. The stock still maintains a solid cushion from its 50-day and 200-day lines.Virgin America (VA) shares bolted 13.2% to 34.72 on reports that it might put all or part of itself up for sale, Bloomberg reported. Shares have consolidated since December, when they hit a 52-week high of 39.20.Southwest (LUV) is currently making its way through a cup base. Shares fell 0.3% to 44.43. That's still distant from a 51.44 buy point, though the stock could form a handle and thus create a lower buy area.Hawaiian Airlines (HA) cleared a consolidation last month and has been trading tightly since March 8. Shares rose 0.8%.Low-cost carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), which is based in Ireland and has flight routes throughout Europe, continues to work on a cup-with-handle base with an entry point of 84.71. Shares rose 1% to 83.75.While Tuesday's attacks and concerns about the impact on air travel going forward are negative factors for airline stocks, oil prices fell Wednesday amid higher inventories. That bodes well for carriers' jet fuel costs. S&P Capital IQ analysts see oil staying depressed in a new research note.""We think that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than many investors and experts are currently thinking. ... This is a great cost environment for the U.S. airline industry.""

925,LUV,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) is expected to announce a deal to buy Virgin America (VA) for more than $2 billion on Monday, besting JetBlue (JBLU) in the bidding process, according to several reports.Alaska Air will pay $2.5 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal's prospects on Saturday. Reuters reported Alaska would pay $56-$58 a share for Virgin America, which closed at 38.90 on Friday. It was 30.67 on March 22, before reports that Richard Branson's carrier was putting itself up to sale.Virgin America, which began in 2007, sought to offer substantial amenities and low fares. Few peers sought to provide that combination at the time, and even fewer do now.The deal would move Alaska over JetBlue as the fifth-largest U.S. carrier.It would be the first notable airline merger since American Airlines (AAL) and US Airways combined in 2013. An Alaska-Virgin deal likely would receive close regulatory scrutiny given that the top four carriers -- American Airlines, United Continental (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) -- dominate 80% of U.S. traffic.Delta Air Lines likely will release March traffic figures early this week.

927,LUV,"JetBlue (JBLU) sank Tuesday after the carrier forecast a 7%-8% drop in first-quarter unit-revenue, citing competition from rivals, while two of those rivals -- Southwest (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL) -- also fell after reporting more capacity but struggles in filling seats.The results indicate that even as air carriers have turned out stratospheric profits and tried to temper carrying-capacity growth, investors still aren’t afraid to swat down airline stocks when they see signs of the kind of expansion that intensified competition and caused an airfare war last year. Unit revenue -- how much airlines make per passenger per mile -- is often seen as a way to measure airfare.JetBlue also reported February carrying capacity to have surged 19.6% from a year earlier, but with unit revenue for the month falling 10%-10.5%.The carrier said that load factor, a measure of an airline’s ability to put people into seats, was “solid.” But yields, a measure of how much each passenger pays per mile, were lower, it said.Some airlines, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note Monday, ""have been looking to maintain load factors by stimulating demand with modestly lower fares.""“The Latin region saw more pressure than U.S. domestic,” JetBlue said in a regulatory filing. “We attribute the year-over-year RASM (revenue per available seat mile) decline to a number of factors, including: tougher comparisons, with storms increasing February unit revenue by 2.5% last year, and capacity additions by JetBlue and competitors.”JetBlue shares closed down 9.1% on the stock market today, plunging below their 50-day moving average but off intraday lows of 19.75. JetBlue stock has struggled to get above its 200-day line in 2016. JetBlue sought to break out in early December from a base going back to its Sept. 17 peak of 27.36, but the attempt broke down.Meanwhile, American Airlines said February capacity rose 8%, outpacing a 4.7% increase in passenger traffic and a 2.3% decline in load factor. American said it continued to expect first-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall roughly 6%-8%.Shares dropped 3.2%, falling below the 200-day line but finding support at the 50-day. The stock has been moving sideways in choppy fashion since crashing last May.And Southwest Airlines, whose expansion a year and a half ago forced the bigger carriers to get more aggressive, reported February traffic growth of 13.5%. But that failed to match the 14.7% capacity increase, and Southwest's load factor decreased to 79%.The company said it expects first-quarter operating unit revenue to be roughly flat vs. a year earlier.Shares rose 0.3% after finding support at their 50-day and 200-day lines.Image provided by Shutterstock.

In January, fuel costs for airlines were down nearly 50% vs. September as oil prices plunged 60% from a high in June.Also Thursday, French prosecutors said Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz may have deliberately crashed the plane after locking the captain out of the cockpit. The black box revealed that the pilot tried to break down the door.The FAA required updated security on planes after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The Germanwings Airbus A320 most likely featured a revamped cockpit door that is strong enough to withstand gunfire. If the door is locked from the inside a crew member can unlock it with a a two- to seven-digit code on a keypad. If prosecutors are correct that the co-pilot crashed the Germanwings flight deliberately, the vulnerability of cabin safey systems may weigh on all involved, including investors.The crash is the latest of several high-profile incidents in the last 12 months.

1053,LUV,"Shares of Virgin America (VA) spiked 10.4% Monday after Bloomberg reported that JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) have offered to buy the air carrier.A deal could be announced as soon as next week. But analysts differ broadly on which airline would benefit more.Virgin America stock finished at 37.71 on the stock market today, its highest close since early December and near a breakout from a cup base. JetBlue rose 2.7%, and Alaska Air gained 1.1%.The news comes after Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that Virgin America was considering putting up all or part of itself for sale after receiving ""takeover interest."" Whether others would attempt to buy Virgin America was not known, Bloomberg said Monday, but speculation has swirled over who was among the possible bidders and whether the airline industry was ripe for more consolidation.Many analysts have seen JetBlue as a likely bidder for Virgin, given the carriers' similarities in fleets -- Airbus (EADSY) A320s and A321s -- and other services.""JetBlue would gain access to Hawaii, as Virgin America started flying there in the 2015 fourth quarter,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note last week. ""Alaska Air Group could also play a role in industry consolidation; however, given Alaska relies on the (Boeing (BA)) 737 and loves the aircraft, we believe it is a bit unlikely they would be a bidder for the company.""However, competition in Dallas from Southwest (LUV) has proven to be stressful for Virgin and American Airlines (AAL), which means that it could be stressful for JetBlue.Airline Weekly said in its March 28 issue that JetBlue is ""the most obvious fit on paper, given what a Virgin merger would do to improve its lot on (transcontinental) markets, where the New York-based airline can still use some help. Then again, does it really want a big increase in transcon exposure while inheriting Virgin’s short-haul problems in Dallas and elsewhere?""An acquisition of Virgin by Delta Air Lines (DAL), which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, could boost its operations out of Los Angeles, Becker said. But she and others think the regulatory climate is a bit too frigid for Delta, United Airlines (UAL) or American Airlines to pull off an acquisition. Regulators' resistance could make a private-equity acquisition more likely. VX Holdings and Cyrus Capital Partners hold more than half of Virgin's shares.""United would surely love to eliminate its San Francisco competitor, but antitrust regulators are in no mood to let the Big Three get any bigger,"" Airline Weekly said. ""Southwest or Alaska wouldn’t mind getting bigger in California, but their B737 fleets don’t mesh well with Virgin’s A320s.""Hawaiian Holdings (HA), Becker also noted, ""could be an interesting player, as the company will be taking delivery of A321s beginning in 2017 and will use those aircraft to fly to more cities in the mid-continent area.""Wolfe Research, meanwhile, speculated last week that Etihad, a carrier based in the United Arab Emirates, might be interested in snapping up assets of Virgin America.""Etihad has equity ownership in seven global airlines -- none in the U.S.,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote last week. ""Cyrus Capital Partners owns 24% of VA. Cyrus tried to sell its stake last year but pulled its offering because of a low stock price. A sale of that entire stake to Etihad would be feasible, we believe, given it would comply with foreign ownership caps of 25% of voting stock. Note Etihad also has a 24% ownership stake in Virgin Australia.""Either way, any sale of Virgin America would follow the carrier's plans to boost future carrying capacity, a factor in the industry's merger wave several years ago. It would also come as signs of weakness in Europe's airlines invite more consolidation. And Wolfe Research this month forecast that Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier would eventually merge ""to avoid eating into each other’s growth prospects""""We do not believe U.S. airline industry consolidation is over,"" Becker said in a note on Monday. ""We expect there are likely to be more consolidating events especially at the (ultralow-cost carrier) and regional level. We also expect US airlines to continue to invest in foreign airlines (think Delta's investments in Virgin Atlantic and Aeromexico) as well as entity sales (think slot swaps / transactions).""
"
1054,LUV,"Air travel will reach a record 140 million passengers this spring season, Airlines for America predicted Wednesday, adding that the industry was boosting carrying capacity to accommodate the demand.The trade group's report comes a day after JetBlue (JBLU) warned of a 7%-8% drop in Q1 unit revenue, due in part to capacity growth at the carrier and its rivals. Last month, JetBlue's capacity soared 19.6%.American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) both expect their measures of unit revenue to fall 6%-8% in the first quarter. Delta Air Lines (DAL) sees passenger unit revenue down 2.5%-4.5% for this quarter.""The continued growth in passenger volumes can be attributed to the accessibility and affordability of air travel today,"" said John Heimlich, chief economist at Airlines for America, in a statement. ""To meet the extra demand, airlines are deploying new and larger aircraft on many flights.""Airlines also increased staff last year by more than 10,000 vs. the prior year, according to the group.The airline industry has attempted to tame capacity growth after low fuel prices and Southwest's (LUV) expansion last year drove aggressive competition, pushing down airfares and unit revenue and increasing concern among investors who worried the trend was unsustainable.But many airlines reported higher capacity for last month and lower load factor -- a measure of an airline's ability to fill seats. Capacity growth has largely outpaced traffic growth for many airlines.On Wednesday, Virgin America (VA) said February capacity leapt 21.3% as traffic jumped 20.9%. Load factor dipped to 78.9% from 79.2% a year ago.Shares of JetBlue closed up 0.9% in the stock market today after sinking 9% Tuesday.

1056,LUV,"Stocks remained lower in afternoon trading Tuesday, although the main indexes came off session lows and were attempting to rebound.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell less than 0.5%. A midday bounce faded, but indexes were making a new bid to recover lost ground. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.2%.Selling was more intense in small caps and transportation shares. The Russell 2000 slid 0.9% while the Dow transports skidded 1.2%. Much of the weakness in the sector rested on airlines. Airlines were broadly weaker after a snowstorm hitting the Northeast forced the cancellation of thousands of flights.Notably in the group, Southwest Airlines (LUV) fell below its 50-day moving average in active turnover and is now 10% off its 52-week high.The energy sector dragged the market the most. Drilling, oil machinery, oil field service and exploration stocks were in the bottom of the  day's performance table. The losses extended to oil majors such as Chevron (CVX), which was off 1.5%.The price of U.S.-produced crude fell more than 2% to $47.38 a barrel, touching the lowest level since Nov. 15. Saudi Arabia said it raised its crude output last month. That raised fresh doubts about OPEC's efforts to limit output, and follows news that the Saudis warned oil producers they shouldn't assume that output cuts will be extended.Retail and consumer stocks were performing much better than the general market. Department stores, discount chains, apparel manufacturers and shoe makes were in Tuesday's top 10 industry groups. Wal-Mart (WMT) rallied 1.5% to 71 and climbed back above its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than a week. But scanning through those groups, there were few stocks making big strides, and many remain in depressed charts. Indeed, this is not exactly an area of emerging leadership.Willdan Group (WLDN) gave back 4% but remained extended from the 32.01 buy point it cleared Friday, following the company 260% surge in EPS.The industrial consulting firm is thinly traded, but has been a leading stock since a breakout in August. It now has top Relative Price Strength and Accumulation/Distribution ratings. The company gave a presentation at an investor conference Monday. Finisar (FNSR) slid nearly 4% and broke below the long-term 200-day moving average, an important yet relatively late sell signal.The fiber optics company had already triggered a sell signal Friday, when the stock plunged below the 50-day line in huge volume on disappointing earnings despite a 136% surge in profit, and a weak outlook.RELATED:Oil Falls Again As Saudis Report Output Hike After Warning U.S. Shale FirmsDelta, American, United Drop As Storm Forces Cancellations

1128,LUV,"American Airlines (AAL) reported a drop in January traffic and raised its first-quarter fuel price outlook on Monday, while Southwest said its capacity grew.

Capacity dipped 0.2% to 21.5 billion available seat miles while load factor fell 2.1 percentage points to 78.2%. Shares fell…
"
1129,LUV,"A leading stock that comes from the turnaround camp poses a challenge.
"
1130,LUV,"The individual investor must recognize the improvement quickly enough to get most of the ride up, but not so quickly that he or she is sitting on dead money for months or even years.
"
1131,LUV,"This was the challenge with Southwest Airlines (LUV), a big winner in 2014. How could this stock have been played?
"
1132,LUV,"When looking at a potential turnaround, it's good to remember that not all of them work out. An investor can trim the failure rate with a few key questions.
"
1133,LUV,"• Are there any new factors at work? Southwest had several. The U.S. airline industry was undergoing a consolidation — a trend that began in 2008, when Delta and Northwest agreed to combine. The trend eventually left strong U.S. players in the industry with a bigger share of the pie and the ability to raise prices.
"
1134,LUV,"Another factor was the price of fuel. Crude oil prices began to lose their price momentum beginning in May 2011, when oil ended a virtually straightup move after the 2008-09 recession. Choppy price action followed but that ended with the 2014 meltdown in prices. This trend lowered costs for airlines.
"
1135,LUV,"Also, Southwest's CEO Gary Kelly finally got the payoff for his fight since 2004 against crony business interests. The Wright Amendment had barred Southwest from making direct flights to some choice locations out of Love Field — an anti-market gift to Dallas-Fort Worth airport. Kelly won, and the ban ended in October.
"
1136,LUV,"• Has there been a turnaround in annual earnings? Southwest Air's turnabout in annual EPS began in 2012. After earnings declined 42% in 2011, they rebounded with a 30% gain in 2012 and 100% in 2013.
"
1137,LUV,"If an investor concluded that 2014 would be too late to play the stock, he or she would've been wrong. Southwest's stock fell 34% in 2011, rose 20% in 2012, gained 84% in 2013 and surged 129% in 2014.
"
1138,LUV,"The lesson: Let the stock prove itself.
"
1139,LUV,"• What about quarterly earnings? Southwest's EPS declined on a year-ago basis for four quarters beginning in mid-2011. Clearly, that was no time to buy the stock. In the second quarter of 2012, earnings jumped 140%. One good quarter, though, often isn't enough to drive sustained price gains in a stock.
"
1140,LUV,"The stock broke out in September 2013, when Southwest had additional positive quarters behind it. September 2013 also was the first breakout that was well above $10 a share.
"
1141,LUV,"The lesson: Let the chart prove itself.
"
1142,LUV,"• Is the stock offering second chances? Most quality stocks offer more than one chance to get in. If an investor didn't buy Southwest's September 2013 breakout, new opportunities emerged.
"
1143,LUV,"In January 2014, Southwest cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern (1) at 19.10. Normally, this is a place to add a small amount of shares to an existing position initiated on a base breakout. However, investors are free to reverse the process. A small initial position could've been established while an investor waited for a new base.

1196,LUV,"While many young Hungarians reveled in soccer and pranks, John von Neumann grew up in the realm of the child prodigy.By age 6, he could divide eight-digit numbers in his head.Two years later, at age 8, the boy who back then went by Neumann Janos Lajos spent his time solving differential and integral calculus problems.He mastered several languages, becoming fluent in Latin and ancient Greek by age 9.Von Neumann (1903-57) would use his genius at mathematics to create new ways of approaching economic and business decisions.And his game theories put math to work solving business problems and creating strategies based on the interaction of competitors.Von Neumann benefited from a nurturing Hungarian educational system that produced generations of exceptional scientists, writers, artists and musicians.Sharp KidWhen Gabriel Szego, a Budapest University professor of mathematics and von Neumann's first tutor, returned home from his first encounter with the kid, he broke into tears due to the boy's brilliance.Von Neumann's formal schooling began at the Lutheran School in Budapest in 1914. He spent two years at the University of Berlin, then graduated from a technical school in Zurich with a chemical engineering degree. He simultaneously obtained a doctoral degree in math from Budapest University.By the end of 1929, von Neumann had published 32 major papers on mathematics, including his groundbreaking 1928 theory of games.He married Mariette Kovesi on New Year's Day 1930 in Budapest. They emigrated to America to escape the rising Nazis. Von Neumann then accepted a lectureship in mathematical physics at Princeton University in New Jersey.The von Neumanns had a daughter, Marina, in 1935, but divorced in 1937, the year he received his naturalization papers. He married a second time, in 1938, to another Hungarian, Klara Dan.Along with Albert Einstein, von Neumann accepted a post at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in 1933. He stayed there until 1955, producing 75 papers in those two decades. While his major contributions to math, physics, quantum mechanics, meteorology and biology changed the scientific world, his early work on computing, linear programming, economic theory and game theory transformed business forecasting and strategies.Take Southwest Airlines (LUV). It uses economic forecasting models to figure the direction of oil prices. If jet fuel costs skyrocket, the firm may purchase additional stocks of fuel or commodity futures contracts to protect itself.Such strategies can help Southwest protect against volatile fuel prices and stabilize earnings.Economic HorizonIf one airline cuts prices dramatically and another follows suit to maintain market share, they all lose revenue and profits. Game theory helps companies choose optimum pricing policies, taking into consideration possible competitor actions or counteractions.The ultimate goal of economic forecasting and game theory is to create the most efficient organization, leading to greater profit.Norman MacRae wrote in ""John von Neumann: The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game Theory, Nuclear Deterrence and Much More"": ""He pounced with lion's claws on the new mathematical ideas of other people that did look interesting, and he pummeled them into a shape that was more precise.""""Before von Neumann, mathematics did not play a factor in economics; he revolutionized the whole field. His impact cannot be overestimated,"" Nick Barron, a math and statistics professor at Loyola University, Chicago, and author of ""Game Theory,"" told IBD.""Likewise,"" he added, ""von Neumann's game theory is taught worldwide, and just about every corporate leader worldwide has been exposed to it. It is used every day in option trading, allocation of resources, pricing, optimal scheduling and many other business applications.""Safety NetVon Neumann's 1928 two-person, zero-sum, minimax game theorem sought to contain the worst possible result. In a zero-sum situation, one player's gain is equal to the other person's loss.That original theory sought to minimize the maximum possible loss. Hence, the term minimax.Since the world is more complex than two-person scenarios, von Neumann joined forces with Oscar Morgenstern to write ""Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.""The 1944 book takes into consideration many more possibilities and players.""While game theory has evolved from Neumann's original simple two-player model, he provided the framework for corporate management to make more informed decisions,"" said Michael Cata, strategist for the consulting firm Undercurrent in New York City.Von Neumann's mathematical programming and computer science endeavors proved a major contributor in the design of the first electronic computers.In 1945 he wrote a document called ""The First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC (electronic discrete variable automatic computer).""It detailed principles for an electronic stored-program computer. Using his matrix games as a base, von Neumann expanded on others' linear programming theories to achieve the best possible outcome.Later, his ""Expanding Economy Model"" explained how goods can be produced at the lowest price and the greatest quantity.""Neumann's economic and game theories provided understanding of competing options and the interaction between players,"" said Usha Haley, a professor of management at West Virginia University. ""Yet companies need to be cautious when using simple models in dealing with complex problems. The simplicity of models is not always realistic.""Von Neumann was also in the thick of war strategy.He was a key player in the Manhattan Project, which produced the atomic bomb that ended World War II. And his MAD (mutually assured destruction) idea — developed as an offshoot from his game theory — helped keep the peace in Europe during the Cold War.""Coupled with his sheer genius, his political savvy enabled him to stay on good terms with both sides on crucial issues,"" said his daughter, Marina von Neumann Whitman.The influence of her father is reflected in her own career as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors to President Nixon, chief economist at General Motors (GM) and currently professor of business administration and public policy at the University of Michigan.Her father drew many honors:• The University of Maryland-based Institute for Operations Research & the Management Sciences created the annual John von Neumann Theory Prize.• The New York City-based Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers annually awards a John von Neumann Medal for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology.• The John von Neumann Award of the Rajk Laszlo College for Advanced Studies in Budapest, Hungary, honors professors with top contributions to social sciences.• The Society for Industrial & Applied Mathematics in Philadelphia gives an annual John von Neumann lecture.• President Eisenhower appointed von Neumann to the Atomic Energy Commission in 1955.• Eisenhower presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1956.• The American Mathematical Society presented a symposium on von Neumann's legacy in 1988.• The U.S. Postal Service released a 2005 von Neumann stamp as part of its American Scientists commemorative series.• These were named in his honor:The von Neumann crater on the moon. The John von Neumann Center in Plainsboro Township, N.J. The John von Neumann Computer Society in Budapest.""Neumann was one of the most creative mathematicians of the 20th century,"" said Barron. ""In a century with many geniuses and many breakthroughs, von Neumann contributed more than his fair share. He ranks among the greatest mathematicians of all time for his depth, breadth and scope of contributions. There was hardly any subject that came to his attention that he didn't revolutionize.""Von Neumann died at 53 of cancer.

1220,LUV,"The way a stock acts intraday and at the close can give an investor useful clues.When an investor is studying a stock chart, he or she ought to entertain several questions about the day's action.•Is the stock generally closing high in the day's range?A high close is bullish. Just how bullish depends on the volume and the price gain. A low close is bearish, especially when accompanied by a wide daily range.•Are there positive reversals?When a stock declines, then reverses upward to erase most or all of the loss, buyers are clearly stepping in to take charge.•Are there negative reversals?A stock that rises but can't hold the gain is showing weakness.•Is the daily range wide and loose, or is it tight?Generally, tight action is good, and loose action is bad. Breakouts from bases with loose action often fail. But wide action can be good when a stock gaps up or charges ahead to close high for a big gain. A long line with a high mark for the close is ideal.•Are the ranges and closes on the weekly chart showing a railroad-track pattern?This two-week pattern involves a second week repeating the action of the first week. The closes meet on the chart to form a single line that looks like a railroad tie stretching from one rail to the other. This is a bearish pattern, especially when it occurs after a long run-up.Southwest Airlines (LUV) showed consistently good chart action as it rose from September 2013 to September 2014.Still, chart action doesn't happen in a vacuum. Fundamentals and a stock's story are important.In April 2013, the International Air Transport Association was reporting an industrywide acceleration in global-passenger traffic. In subsequent months, the situation only got better.Meanwhile, mergers in the industry were reducing overall capacity, helping airlines avoid fare cuts.How did Southwest fit this picture?After nine quarters that included six declining or flat quarters in earnings, Southwest found traction. The company boosted earnings 162% in Q3 2013, then 267%, 157% and 84%.Southwest Airlines' breakout on Sept. 19, 2013, emerged from a flat base. The stock cleared a 14.34 entry in twice its usual volume (1) and closed high in the day's range.Days immediately after a breakout are critical. Southwest passed this test, too.The stock showed only one day of hesitation. On Sept. 30, it fell 1.6% below the buy point intraday, but staged a positive reversal to wipe out most of the day's loss (2).From there, it was mostly a smooth flight upward. Southwest notched more than 150 up days during the 12-month run against fewer than 100 down days.Generally, a close within the upper 60% of a day's price range is considered positive. Of Southwest's up days, seven of every eight had closes in the upper 60% of the range.Meanwhile, of the down days, almost one of every three involved positive reversals — a decline that reversed to erase most of the day's loss.From its breakout to its Sept. 18 closing high, Southwest gained about 145%.

1237,LUV,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, most stocks should advance. But investors should look for the true market leaders, such as Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IBD's Screen of the Day, Bolting RS Lines, separates the wheat from the chaff. It focuses on top-rated companies whose relative strength lines are rising to new highs. A rising RS line means the stock is outpacing the benchmark S&P; 500 index.Skyworks has advanced for the past six sessions, rising 2% Monday to a new closing high of 82.48 on the stock market today. Even more impressive, Skyworks has reported nine straight quarters of accelerating earnings per share growth, including last week's Q1 2015 gain of 88%. Sales growth has picked up for four straight quarters.Skyworks shares have been on a tear since finding support just above its 200-day moving average on Oct. 10. Its RS line has been hitting new highs since early November.Skyworks makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy GS5 as well as many other wireless devices and in other industries. Apple reports earnings Tuesday night, with analysts raising iPhone 6 sales targets.Centene (CNC) is a leading health insurer, focusing on Medicaid programs. It's benefited from the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion as well as winning more state Medicaid contracts.Centene said Monday it will buy Oregon-based Agate Resources , which provides some Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and ObamaCare exchange coverage in the state.Q4 earnings likely doubled (101%) in Centene's next report due in early February, accelerating from the prior quarter's 37% advance. Centene shares cleared a short consolidation base last week, hitting a record intraday high on Friday. Its RS line hit a new high ahead of the stock, a bullish sign.Shares rose 1.2% to 111.80 on Monday, a new closing high.Several other health insurers are on the Bolting RS Lines screen — though not in the top 5 — including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI). UnitedHealth earnings beat estimates last week as medical costs remained tame.Next on the Bolting RS Lines' top 5 is Qorvo (QRVO), another RF chipmaker. The name may not be familiar, but it's forged from the recent merger of RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor. The Apple iPhone 6 also boasts Qorvo chips. Qorvo rose to a new high Friday after clearing a 3-week consolidation following a rapid ascent. Qorvo stock fell a fraction Monday.Rounding out the top five are Electronic Arts (EA) and Alaska Air Group (ALK).

1307,LUV,"At the start of the year, the airline industry was ranked 63rd out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, while gold and silver miners were down at No. 189.Today, the airline industry has risen to 15th amid falling fuel prices and an improving economy. But miners remain near the bottom amid weak commodities prices.The 20-stock airline group is up 67% this year, paced by leaders Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Airlines (ALK). In contrast, the 71-stock gold, silver and gem mining group is up 4%.The lesson? Don't buy stocks in beaten-down industry groups on the expectation that a rebound is just around the corner. Instead, look for the leading stocks in strong — and preferably rising — industry groups, as they are the most likely to provide the best returns.IBD helps investors find stocks with the greatest potential for capital gains. Columns such as the Big Picture, Sector Leaders Review and Stock Spotlight focus on leading stocks. Each features a chart that shows the stock's status — whether in buying range, extended or in a base.The charts, as well as the sector tables, give key ratings for each stock, such as the Composite Rating, Earnings Per Share Rating and Relative Price Strength Rating.Furthermore, check the industry tables in IBD each day to find the highest-rated groups. You want to select the stocks with the highest ratings from the top 40 industries, as they're the most likely to possess superior fundamentals. They should have stellar profit and sales growth, high return on equity and wide profit margins.Such stocks typically boast innovative products and services that are either unique or far superior to what the competition offers.In addition, insist on solid chart patterns, and make sure the shares are in demand by mutual funds and other big investors.""The top one, two or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir,"" wrote IBD founder William O'Neil in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""By contrast, a lagging group — and its constituent stocks — can take a long time to turn around. That's why it's dangerous to buy on the way down, as factors behind the decline can persist for months or even years.Often, it takes disruptive new technologies or business models to revive an industry. Discount airlines have upset old business models, fostering innovation and mergers that have helped the industry to rebound from years of falling profits.Spirit Airlines has succeeded by offering cut-rate fares while charging customers fees for services that used to be free. The stock, which has an industry-leading 98 Composite Rating, has tripled this year.Richmont Mines' (RIC) 87 Composite Rating is the highest in the mining group. The stock has tripled this year, but it's still low-priced and thinly traded, which makes it exceptionally risky. Also, many of its other fundamental measures are weak. Furthermore, most of the mining group's institutional-quality stocks have done poorly.As always, it's important to make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend before buying any stock. The stocks that break out of bases first in the early stages of a new uptrend tend to enjoy the biggest gains.

1329,LUV,"To reach those customers, Spirit offers a basic ""bare fare"" option that includes a seat and one piece of carry-on luggage. If you want anything else — even a beverage — it costs extra.
"
1330,LUV,"The company caters to passengers who order and pay for their own tickets, which basically means leisure and small-business travelers. Business-class travelers who work for corporations with large travel budgets are not the target demographic.
"
1331,LUV,"Baldanza notes that what you'll find on a Spirit flight reflects the low fare.
"
1332,LUV,"""If you are paying for the ticket yourself, you tend to be more realistic,"" he said. ""Our planes don't have as much leg room as other airlines, our seats don't recline, we tend to only make one or two flights a day from many markets.""
"
1333,LUV,"That's a compromise, he concedes. ""But what you get is the absolute lowest total price. That's why our planes are very full and why we continue to grow very profitably.""
"
1334,LUV,"Spirit keeps its fares low by keeping its own costs low, Baldanza says. ""We don't have wide-body planes, which add weight. We don't have a sales force. We don't have the kinds of things you need to have to win corporate accounts.""
"
1335,LUV,"In addition, he says, Spirit puts more seats on its planes than competitors, which means that it has more potential customers for each flight, albeit those customers are squeezed in tighter.
"
1336,LUV,"Most Profitable Airline?
"
1337,LUV,"In a recent research note, Morgan Stanley analyst John Godyn said that during the second quarter, Spirit ranked the second most profitable airline in the world based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (or restructuring) costs, or EBITDAR.
"
1338,LUV,"Airline Weekly also cited Spirit as the second most profitable airline in the world for the 12 months ended June 30, based on operating profit as a percentage of operating revenue. The Panamanian Copa Holdings (CPA) was No. 1, while Las Vegas-based low-fare carrier Allegiant Travel (ALGT) ranked No. 3.
"
1339,LUV,"Godyn reckons that Spirit can move to the front of the line based on his metric.
"
1340,LUV,"""Following a strong 3Q result, we forecast SAVE generating about 36% EBITDAR margins in 2015 — a level likely to make it the most profitable airline in the world,"" he said.
"
1341,LUV,"Spirit posted third-quarter earnings of $1.01 a share, up 28% from a year earlier and 3 cents above what analysts expected.
"
1342,LUV,"Revenue for the quarter climbed 14% year over year to $519.8 million, slightly below estimates. Revenue per available seat mile declined 0.8% to 12.45 cents as the company's load factor fell to 87.6% from 89.1% a year earlier.
"
1343,LUV,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 34% in 2014 and another 38% in 2015. Spirit shares moved to a record high above 84 on Friday, amid optimism about the effect of low oil prices on airline profits.
"
1344,LUV,"Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent recently noted that he is ""optimistic"" about Spirit's ability to continue growing profits. He cited several factors, including the company's steady base of target customers as well as ""strong capacity growth and lower oil prices.""
"
1345,LUV,"CEO Baldanza says that he expects Spirit's business model to become more prevalent in the airline industry. ""When somebody creates a better mousetrap, people copy it,"" he said.
"
1346,LUV,"Baldanza points to Europe, where about 20% of travelers fly on carriers similar to Spirit, including Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY). In contrast, Spirit carries just under 2% of the total U.S. air passenger traffic.
"
1347,LUV,"""We don't see anybody doing what we are doing yet, though over time we expect they will,"" Baldanza said.
"
1348,LUV,"Meanwhile, Spirit continues to expand its operations.
"
1349,LUV,"On Nov. 17, it announced plans for nonstop flights to 10 new destinations, including Tampa, Fla.; Baltimore/Washington, D.C.; and Oakland/San Francisco Bay, as well as seven locations in Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. The new flights will begin in the spring.
"
1350,LUV,"Spirit also recently boosted nonstop routes, saying it will soon have a total of ten from Denver and nine from Los Angeles, in addition to its other nonstop and connecting-flight routes.
"
1351,LUV,"The company plans to add five more planes to its fleet by the end of the year and 15 more in 2015.Following a brief dip in October tied to the Ebola scare, airline stocks are trading at their highest point in years as the industry benefits from cheap oil prices and a growing U.S. economy.One of the biggest gainers in recent weeks is Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the low-cost carrier that has made a name for itself by providing a bare-bones flying option for budget-conscious travelers.Its shares have risen nearly 60% since Oct. 13, when IBD's Transportation-Airline group hit an eight-month low as investors worried that a spreading Ebola outbreak might curb air travel.Spirit's stock gain compares favorably with the performance of other airlines highly rated by IBD, such asSouthwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).Shares of Spirit got a lift on Oct. 28, rising 7% after the company beat third-quarter earnings views.""We're very pleased with how the market is responding to our track record and growth story,"" Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza told IBD. ""People like our return on investment and growth profile.""That track record includes years of solid profits despite the ups and downs of the air travel industry. More recently, the airline has run off seven straight quarters of at least double-digit sales and EPS growth.Baldanza's BonanzaSpirit has an all-Airbus (EADSY) fleet of 60 narrow-body planes and operates more than 280 daily flights going to more than 55 destinations in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.The recipe for success is pretty simple, Baldanza says. Spirit offers cut-rate fares — about 40% lower than other airlines on average, according to Department of Transportation data — to travelers who value cost savings over all else.Those travelers represent the majority of the airline market, according to evaluations Spirit conducted.""Our evaluations found that when you ask customers how they pick an airline, more than half say they just want the lowest price,"" Baldanza said.

1352,LUV,"Falling oil prices and a declining energy sector are expected to have dragged down corporate earnings in 2014's fourth quarter, but the overall picture for S&P 500 companies remains strong.
"
1353,LUV,"The difference is remarkable: S&P 500 companies should average solid 4.2% Q4 profit growth. But when excluding energy firms, profits probably rose a brisk 7.2%.
"
1354,LUV,"With both U.S. and Brent crude oil prices falling fast in Q4 — now below $50 per barrel, down about half since the summer — the S&P's energy sector is forecast to post poor fourth-quarter numbers, with an estimated 20% decline in earnings and a 14.2% drop in revenue expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That's a staggering decline from the 11.1% earnings growth analysts had predicted Oct. 1 for Q4.
"
1355,LUV,"As a result, the overall S&P 500 earnings estimate of 4.2% growth in Q4 is the weakest since the third quarter of 2012. Revenue is expected to have grown a measly 1.3% overall in Q4 vs. 3.9% when excluding energy stocks.
"
1356,LUV,"Picture Improves In 2015
"
1357,LUV,"The trend looks similar as the picture improves in 2015. Analysts expect earnings to grow 5.2% in Q1 on revenue growth of 1.6%. Excluding energy, that growth would be 10.5% profit improvement on a 4.7% revenue hike.
"
1358,LUV,"Energy companies are expected to post a 33% decline in Q1 earnings on a 16% drop in revenue.
"
1359,LUV,"The year-end earnings reporting season moves into high gear with all of the big four banks and others disclosing data this week.
"
1360,LUV,"""Really, the picture outside of (energy) is still pretty solid,"" said Gregory Harrison, a senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters. The growth is ""really much better than it appears at first.""
"
1361,LUV,"Powered by biotech, health care companies are leading all industries with earnings up 17.4% and revenue growing 9.4% in Q4, the analysts estimate.
"
1362,LUV,"One of the hottest leaders, Gilead (GILD), is expected to report profit up 298% on sales up 115%. Amgen (AMGN) apparently performed closer to the biotech norm, with profit estimated to have risen 7.5% on sales up 3.5%.
"
1363,LUV,"Telecom Follows The Leader
"
1364,LUV,"Telecom profits come next, expected to have risen 13.8%, followed by utilities, up 11.2%; industrials, up 9.9%; and technology, up 8.9%.
"
1365,LUV,"AT&T (T), with the second-largest market value among telecoms in the U.S., is expected to lag its sector with profit up 7.5% on sales rising 3.5% when it reports Q4.
"
1366,LUV,"Those industrials include transportation, aerospace and defense contractors, expected to report 9.9% earnings growth on 2.4% better revenue as a group. Southwest Airlines (LUV) is one of the leaders, with earnings expected to grow 67%. Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) are forecast to grow earnings 12% and 38%, respectively.
"
1367,LUV,"Making Tech Look Good
"
1368,LUV,"The tech sector's 8.9% earnings growth looks good but not spectacular. Facebook (FB) alone is estimated to have grown Q4 EPS by 55% and revenue by 46%.
"
1369,LUV,"Up next, the S&P's consumer discretionary sector is expected to post 7.9% earnings growth on 4% better revenue as cheaper gasoline means more money for consumers to spend elsewhere. These companies mostly serve U.S. consumers, who drive 70% of the economy.
"
1370,LUV,"Consumer discretionary play Lowe's (LOW) is expected to post 39% earnings growth, while analysts estimate homebuilder Lennar (LEN) to have earned 32% more in Q4. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is expected to have earned 91% more than a year earlier.
"
1371,LUV,"Financials, a powerhouse of growth in most recent years, with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) leading the way, appears to have flattened with forecast 1.3% growth in earnings on a 1.4% gain in revenue.
"
1372,LUV,"Yet, for all the winners from cheaper oil, there are some non-winners that are difficult to call losers because they're still profitable, just less so. ExxonMobil (XOM) is expected to post a 26% profit decline. Analysts anticipate earnings declines of 32% for Chevron (CVX) and 39% for ConocoPhillips (COP).
"
1373,LUV,"Consumer staples are expected to have generated no profit growth.
"
1374,LUV,"Only those energy profits are expected to have fallen harder than the materials sector.
"
1375,LUV,"Materials, which were forecast on Oct. 1 to post 10.1% earnings growth, are now expected to have shrunken profit by 2% in Q4 on a 1% drop in revenue. Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals maker Monsanto (MON), which reported Jan. 7, reduced EPS 30% while revenue fell 8.7% from a year earlier.
"
1376,LUV,"The U.S. economy is being propelled by low interest rates, lower unemployment, higher business and consumer confidence and stocks near record highs, but the rest of the world seems a bit dicey. Europe has fallen into deflation and flirts with recession, Russia wilts under falling oil prices and Western sanctions, and Greece again may exit from the eurozone. China isn't growing as much as its government might like, while Japan and Brazil endure recessions.
"
1377,LUV,"Investors should look to companies' quarterly conference calls to see whether businesses see some improvement, said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research.
"
1378,LUV,"With the stronger dollar affecting U.S. companies with overseas exposure and the large-cap companies in the S&P very exposed to international markets, corporate management teams have become increasingly negative with their Q4 guidance — 5.1 negative pre-announcements for every positive one. The historical average is 2.5:1 and Q3's ratio was 3:1. Yet most companies' pessimism seems unfounded as a significant majority of them beat expectations. Or are their forward-looking statements designed to impress shareholders later?

1432,LUV,"While falling oil prices obviously have had a negative impact on oil and gas stocks — eight of the nine lowest rated IBD industry groups are now in that sector — declining prices also have had a ripple effect on other industries: some for the better, others not so much.
"
1433,LUV,"Following are four other industries that have seen an immediate impact from lower prices at the wellhead and gasoline pump. Three are enjoying the trend, while one of them is not.
"
1434,LUV," Airlines: Considering that fuel is one of the biggest expenses in the airline industry, it's no surprise that falling gasoline prices have been a boon to companies that make their living in the air.

1436,LUV,"Stocks that have set multiyear highs in recent days include pretty much every airline you can think of. These include large commercial carriers such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL) as well as discount carriers Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and regional operations like Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA).

"
1439,LUV," Truckers: Similar to airlines, freight trucking companies spend a lot of money on fuel. When fuel prices fall, costs go down and margins go up.

1440,LUV,"IBD's Transportation-Truck ranks No. 7 of all the industries tracked and has been steadily rising for the past eight weeks. The group touched a record high on Friday and is up 23% since Oct. 13.

1546,LUV,"Major averages ended near session highs Tuesday in an otherwise lackluster session. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE. The S&P 500 notched its first distribution day since a follow-through confirmed a new uptrend Oct. 21. But similar to the Nasdaq's Oct. 29 higher-volume decline, distribution was mild. The Nasdaq lost 0.3% but finished near the top…
"
1547,LUV,"The $1.8 billion Putnam Investors Fund is an old geezer. Its Dec. 1, 1925, inception date makes it the industry's second oldest stock fund.
"
1548,LUV,"But it's acting like a spry spring chicken lately.
"
1549,LUV,"Since Jerry Sullivan took over in mid-2008, the fund's average annual gain is 10.84% through Sept. 30. It tops the S&P 500's 10.02%. And it beats 91% of large-cap blend funds tracked by Morningstar.
"
1550,LUV,"In the same-length period prior to Sullivan's taking charge, the fund's 5.32% average annual gain lagged the S&P 500 and 88% of its large-cap blend peers.
"
1551,LUV,"Sullivan credits his outperformance to an appetite for both growth and value stocks. Also, he targets three types of stocks: ones he's followed for years, those pushed up and down by smart money, and special situations. And he focuses on valuation.
"
1552,LUV,"In addition, he applies lessons learned from his mentor and former boss, former Fidelity Investments superstar Peter Lynch, who ran the now-$16.7 billion Magellan Fund when it sat atop the fund world with strong performance and rapid growth.
"
1553,LUV,"Putnam Investors Fund assets peaked at $16.2 billion in August 2000 and shrank to a low of $1.2 billion by September 2011. Assets have been rising since then.
"
1554,LUV,"Sullivan, who is 54 years old, spoke with IBD from his office in Boston's financial district about how he invests.
"
1555,LUV,"IBD: Is it OK if I mention that you have a distinct Brooklyn accent?
"
1556,LUV,"Sullivan: I was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Long Island. My dad grew up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. I grew up a New York Mets fan because the Dodgers had just moved to L.A. We hate the Yankees. I would relish your mentioning my accent.
"
1557,LUV,"IBD: You have a flexible style, right? You invest in both growth and value stocks.
"
1558,LUV,"Sullivan: I'm the core manager here at Putnam. Investors Fund is a mix of value and growth. So is my Multi-Cap Core Fund (with $109 million in assets), which is four years old. It's the same style, but even more flexible, because it can go up and down the market-cap spectrum. Investors Fund must have at least 75% of its securities in large caps. Multi-Cap cannot have more than 75% in any one category — large, mid or small cap. Stylewise, they're the same.
"
1559,LUV,"IBD: And what are the three types of stocks that Investors Fund buys?
"
1560,LUV,"Sullivan: I call the first bucket my legacy stocks. They're large caps that I researched earlier in my career or even recently. It was in-depth research. Then I gave each one three minutes of research every week for five, 10, 30 years. I refined my understanding of what factors move each stock up or down. That helps me understand when to make a move. It's my most boring bucket but the most important to me.
"
1561,LUV,"The second bucket has to do with smart money. The main factor is insider buying. I follow that closely and have for many years.
"
1562,LUV,"In the early to mid-1980s, when I worked for Peter Lynch, it was the No. 1 factor that he deferred to when looking for the right timing to buy a stock.
"
1563,LUV,"IBD: What was your role at Fidelity?
"
1564,LUV,"Sullivan: In 1985, I was doing research on European chemical stocks like BASF, Imperial Chemical and (Holland's) Akzo Nobel. Big stocks. It was important for Magellan to look for big, liquid stocks.
"
1565,LUV,"It was also much harder to follow insider transactions. You had to check SEC filings on paper. And they could be six to eight weeks old. The rules were looser about when insiders had to file.
"
1566,LUV,"Sarbanes-Oxley moved it to a 48-hour rule. And now you can watch the information flow in on the Internet in real time.
"
1567,LUV,"It doesn't tell me what to buy, but it gives me ideas.
"
1568,LUV,"The third bucket is special situations. One of the most common are follow-on stock offerings. They used to be called secondary offerings. It might be filed at 4 o'clock on a typical day. XYZ company is doing a follow-on. And you've got 45 minutes to decide if you want to play it or not. They'd file at 4:15 and close their books at 5 p.m.
"
1569,LUV,"IBD: What's a recent one you did?
"
1570,LUV,"Sullivan: The latest was HD Supply (HDS), which was part of Home Depot (HD). (Former CEO) Bob Nardelli started building a distributor of big equipment. They IPO'd it after he left. I bought on the IPO, and they did a secondary offering. I put in offers below the asking price.
"
1571,LUV,"IBD: How often does that work?
"
1572,LUV,"Sullivan: CDW (CDW) is a technology distributor. They sell to midsize companies that don't have big IT departments. They went public last year. Please specify that I still own it but I sold a lot of it.
"
1573,LUV,"I was maybe the first institutional investor to meet with them. They were never fast-growing. The underwriter was asking 22, maybe 24. I said, ""I want to buy a lot at 18."" The underwriter said, ""Maybe you missed the (detail) that we're selling at 24."" I said, ""No, I didn't miss it. I like it at 18, not 24."" At 18 it was trading at 12 times earnings. At 18 times earnings it's not warranted.
"
1574,LUV,"Anyway, they went on a road show, had difficulty getting an audience because a lot of guys thought it was overpriced. After two weeks, they came back and said 18 would work. I said, ""OK, but now I only want it at 17."" They went public at 17. Since then, they've met their meager expectations. As they did, they grabbed a larger audience (of investors). The stock has slowly migrated to 30-ish. That's a great special situation.
"
1575,LUV,"IBD: You like to buy stocks on price weakness. Give me an example, please.
"
1576,LUV,"Sullivan: Buying on weakness was an old Peter Lynch rule.
"
1577,LUV,"I bought Southwest Airlines (LUV) two, 2-1/2 years ago, when it was (trading around 8 or 9).
"
1578,LUV,"The rest of the airlines were doing well. They charge for everything. But Southwest didn't, so it got depressed. It was selling below the replacement costs of all their airplanes. I figured it had to climb. And they could always start charging (for individual services like baggage). I loaded up as much as I could. It's gone to around 34.
"
1579,LUV,"IBD: You've added to your Apple (AAPL) stake. Why?
"
1580,LUV,"Sullivan: I started buying Apple again in the June quarter. It had pulled back from its highs. I took it to my biggest position.
"
1581,LUV,"A year and a half or two years ago, both Apple and Google (GOOGL) went to 700. Then they separated. Apple pulled back. Google shot up. When everyone fell in love with Google, I used it as a source of funds. Apple had hair on it because it hadn't come out with anything new. Now it's coming through again. But it's not expensive on earnings. It's a quasi-value name with meaningful growth.
"
1582,LUV,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is trending up again. Did investors decide this biotech was oversold?
"
1583,LUV,"Sullivan: This was one of several large biotechs that I started positioning in more than three years ago. They looked like value names with growth. Now their pipelines are still meaningful. They've got good top- and bottom-line growth. Big pharmaceutical firms don't have that. And on a P-E-to-growth basis, it's still attractive. It's been stronger since the (Q1) sell-off than some biotechs like Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). I added to Celgene during the weakness (earlier in) the year.
"
1584,LUV,"IBD: Facebook (FB) has had a nice run-up since mid-2013. Is it still attractive?
"
1585,LUV,"Sullivan: I'm underweight now. (My weighting is) less than 50 basis points. It's had a good move. It's the place where the eyeballs are. They were slow to get their mobile application to work. But they've done that. It's still a growth story. But it's trading at 40 times next year's (estimated) earnings, so at this point I'm neutral. I don't want to (make my position) bigger unless the stock pulls back.
"
1586,LUV,"IBD: What's your thesis for CBRE Group (CBG)?
"
1587,LUV,"Sullivan: They're a play on a commercial real estate rebound. They're not expensive.
"
1588,LUV,"They're big brokers, maybe the biggest. They manage big office buildings. It's been a dead area, but it's coming back. Nonresidential construction is coming back, and occupancy rates are getting better. We've got them earning $1.70 (per share) this year and $1.80 next year. They're not a fancy name. They're a bit of a sleeper.
"
1589,LUV,"IBD: Gilead's earnings per share growth has exploded. Is Sovaldi, its hepatitis C treatment, the entire story?
"
1590,LUV,"Sullivan: The real attraction is more than that. They've got drugs for liver and heart disease. And a good platform for AIDS. But the real nice thing is that this stock is inexpensive on earnings. They're expected to earn $8 a share this year and $9.50 next year.
"
1591,LUV,"That's very attractive: 11-1/2 times next year's earnings on a company growing in the teens. And we're fans of their whole pipeline.
"
1592,LUV,"IBD: Is Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) driver its no-frills approach?
"
1593,LUV,"Sullivan: Yes, their no-frills approach is their key.
"
1594,LUV,"The interesting thing is that they're not targeted as competition by larger airlines, which is important. It avoids a price war.
"
1595,LUV,"The larger airlines see them as an ultralow-cost carrier. When they go into a new market, they actually expand the market. Big competitors see that. They get people to fly who don't normally: college students, people on tight budgets, people who don't mind flying at midnight, people who don't mind being charged for extra bags or maybe overhead compartments.
"
1596,LUV,"When will the airlines go after each other to get market share? They're not doing it now. The old managements (that engaged in price wars) have disappeared. Airline bankruptcies are fresh in (airlines managers') heads.
"
1597,LUV,"IBD: Where is railcar-maker Trinity Industries (TRN) in its economic cycle?
"
1598,LUV,"Sullivan: Its cycle still continues to work. We're only halfway through.
"
1599,LUV,"They make all kinds of railroad cars. One of the most interesting on margin is cars that carry sand for fracking. The typical well takes 75 to 80 rail cars of this stuff.
"
1600,LUV,"Trinity is one of the few players in this business. The stock is not expensive.The $1.8 billion Putnam Investors Fund is an old geezer.

1970,LUV,"The already struggling airline stocks suffered further blow yesterday when the key sector participant — American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) — trimmed its view for second-quarter unit revenues. The bearish view for the key metric naturally disappointed investors. Consequently, the American Airlines stock was pummelled following the bleak guidance, closing the trading session on Jul 11 at $35.96, down 8.1% over the Jul 10 close.However, the damage was not limited to American Airlines and other key sector participants like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) also felt the heat and declined significantly yesterday. Consequently, the sector tracker — the NYSE ARCA Airline Index — shed 2.4% of its value on Jul 11.What Did American Airlines Say?American Airlines revealed the damaging forecast at an Investor Update. Citing softer-than-expected yields in the domestic market, the airline behemoth trimmed its guidance for total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The carrier now expects the metric to grow approximately between 1% and 3% on a year-over-year basis. The earlier guidance had called for the metric to grow approximately in the 1.5 - 3.5% range. Heightened competition in key domestic markets was primarily responsible for weak prices. Moreover, with oil prices on an uptrend, with a 14% increase in the April-June period, American Airlines increased its second-quarter forecast for average fuel prices per gallon. The metric is now expected between $2.24 and $2.29 (previous guidance: $2.18 - $2.23).Additionally, the carrier expects its pre-tax income to be hurt to the tune of $35 million due to the computer failure at American Airlines’ regional carrier PSA Airlines, last month. The carrier’s operations went haywire as a result of this disruption and it had to call off more than 2, 500 flights.Pre-tax margin is expected in the band of 7.5% to 9.5%.The only favorable part of the update was regarding the second-quarter guidance on cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel and other special items. The metric is now expected to increase in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% year over year. The earlier guidance had called for the metric to grow approximately in the 2.5-4.5 % range. Lower-than-expected maintenance costs primarily led to the new projection.Gloomy Sectoral PictureAmerican Airlines’ bearish projections on TRASM and fuel costs further highlight the fact that the overall sentiment pertaining to airlines is anything but positive ahead of the earnings season. This is mainly because oil prices have been on the rise this year, shooting up more than 20% so far. Apart from geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter — and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices. Since fuel expenses are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are likely to limit bottom-line growth for carrier in the second quarter. Also, capacity-related woes might prevent airlines from flying high in the current earnings season. Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid-2014 despite the recent resurgence.Moreover, airfares have remained low, with the metric declining in April, May and June. Although favorable for passengers, low air fares are a drag for airline companies. Customer-related issues represent another headwind for airlines.For example, the flight 1380 incident on Apr 17 is still hurting Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). In fact, this Dallas-based low-cost carrier trimmed its unit revenue view for the soon-to-be reported quarter mainly due to soft bookings on its flights after the unfortunate mid-air incident, which claimed one life and injured many.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the StrugglesThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #213, which places it at the bottom 17% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Industry Underperformance YTDJudging by shareholder returns so far this year, it seems that headwinds like high fuel costs, capacity-related issues and technological glitches have contributed to investors’ pessimism surrounding the space.The  Zacks Airline industry, which is part of the broader Zacks Transportation Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector year to date.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 18.2%, the Zacks Transportation Sector has gained 3.5% of its value. Meanwhile, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has rallied 4.7% on a year-to-date basis.YTD Price Performance  Dump These Carriers from Your Portfolio NowIn view of the above challenges confronting carriers, we believe the second quarter earnings season can turn out to be more of a disappointment for airline players.Given this gloomy background, we pinpoint four airline players which investors would do well to get rid of. All the stocks have an unfavorable Zacks Rank and have witnessed negative earnings estimate revisions recently.(You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here). Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) is a low-cost carrier based in Ireland. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). This European carrier has been suffering from unrest on the labor front for quite some time. Moreover, rising fuel costs are anticipated to limit bottom-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings moved south 6.8% and 7%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects investor’s pessimism surrounding the stock.  Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of C, which highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. The stock has shed 7.8% of its value in the last three months.  Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), the holding company of Alaska Airlines, is based in Seattle, WA. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). High costs have been putting pressure on the company’s bottom line for quite some time, and the second quarter of 2018 is unlikely to be an exception.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and current-year earnings moved south 6.3% and 7.9%, respectively, in the last 60 days. The stock has shed 18.1% of its value year to date. SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is based in St. George, UT and operates as a regional airline in the United States through its subsidiaries.

1971,LUV,"An earnings season keeps investors busy in comparing estimates with actual outcomes. Prior to the releases, investors look to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations. This is because more often than not, an earnings beat positively impacts the stock price. However, the million-dollar question is how to pick the potential winners?Through this write-up, we intend to help investors zero in on airline stocks that are likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in second-quarter 2018 despite headwinds like increasing fuel costs. We remind investors that airline stocks are an integral part of the Zacks Transportation sector.Notably, the second-quarter earnings season will be kicked off by Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) on Jul 12. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Dull Sectoral PictureThe overall sentiment pertaining to airlines is anything but positive ahead of the earnings season. This is mainly because oil prices have been on the rise this year, shooting up by more than 20% so far. Apart from the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter — and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices. Since fuel expenses are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are likely to limit bottom-line growth for carrier in the second quarter. Also, capacity related woes might prevent airlines from flying high in the current earnings season. Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid-2014 despite the recent resurgence.Moreover, airfares have remained low, with the metric declining in April, May and June. Although favorable for passengers, low air fares are a drag for airline companies. Customer-related issues represent another headwind for airlines.For example, the flight 1380 incident on Apr 17 is still hurting Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). In fact, this Dallas-based low-cost carrier trimmed its unit revenue view for the soon-to-be reported quarter mainly due to soft bookings on its flights after the unfortunate mid-air incident, which claimed one life and injured many.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the StrugglesThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #230, which places it at the bottom 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Not Thorns Alone, Some Roses TooDespite the above-mentioned headwinds, the space is not totally bereft of positives. The airline industry is benefiting from strong demand for air travel. Declining air fares along with a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have provided consumers an added incentive to opt for air travel.The bullish projection by the Airlines for America (A4A) for the ongoing summer season (Jun 1 – Aug 31) confirms the robust demand. The association expects the season to be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel. In keeping with the bullish projection, Delta and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL) transported record number of passengers in June. While Delta carried 17.7 million passengers, 15.2 million passengers flew on United Continental flights in the month.Furthermore, the solid financial health of most carriers has prompted them to indulge in shareholder-friendly activities (dividends and buybacks). For instance, Southwest Airlines raised its dividend payout during the second quarter of 2018. We expect an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities from carriers following the new tax law. This is because with significant reduction in tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.In view of their strong balance sheets, carriers have been making significant investments to upgrade their fleet, to improve the flying experience of passengers. For example, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) recently agreed to buy at least 60 A220-300 jets from Airbus.Airlines Likely to Face Turbulence in Q2The above write-up clearly suggests that the negatives will easily outweigh the positives in the airline space as we head into the second-quarter earnings season. In fact, the above-mentioned headwinds are likely to prevent stocks in the space from flying high this earnings season.However, some airline stocks are still likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings following multiple downward revisions due to the above headwinds may not make earnings beat too difficult for carriers this earnings season.Selection of OutperformersWith the airline space being densely populated, the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one. Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one’s stock-picking prowess, the Zacks methodology might provide some relief.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.4 Airline PicksBased on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on four airline stocks that are likely to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings. In fact, an earnings beat boosts investors’ confidence in the stock, which is reflected in its rapid price appreciation. These stocks should therefore turn out to be great additions to your portfolio ahead of their earnings releases.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) is headquartered in Atlanta, GA. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 1 cent above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76. The favorable combination makes an earnings beat likely in the quarter.Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) is the parent company of Allegiant Air. This Las Vegas-based stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.29%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 3 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72. The favorable combination makes an earnings beat likely for this low-cost carrier, which will unveil its second-quarter earnings report on Jul 25.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) is a Long Island City, NY-based low-cost carrier. The company, which will report earnings on Jul 24, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.74%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 1 cent above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. The favorable combination makes an earnings beat likely in the quarter.LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (LTM  -  Free Report) is the final member in our list of potential outperformers. It is a provider of passenger and cargo air transportation services in South America, North/Central America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The company, which is expected to release its second-quarter earnings report on Aug 16, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +14.29%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1972,LUV,"Shares of several major airline stocks moved sharply lower in morning trading Wednesday after domestic giant American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) lowered its unit revenue and unit cost guidance for the second quarter.American said it expects unit revenue—the ever-important total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) metric—to improve 1% to 3%, down from its previous guidance of 1.5% to 3.5% growth. This would still mark American’s seventh consecutive quarter of TRASM growth, but the company cited lower-than-anticipated domestic yields as the reason for its lowered guidance.Meanwhile, American lowered its outlook for Q2 capacity to 72.9 billion available seat miles from 73.1 billion and increased its estimate for average fuel prices to $2.24 - $2.29 per gallon from $2.18 - $2.23 per gallon.American also said that a technology issue which resulted in one of its regional carriers, PSA Airlines, cancelling about 3,000 flights last month would reduce pre-tax income by about $35 million.Shares of American Airlines were down more than 6% to touch an intraday low of $36.59 in early morning trading Wednesday. Elsewhere, “Big Three” rivals Delta (DAL  -  Free Report) and United (UAL  -  Free Report) were both more than 3% lower.Budget airlines and regional carriers were also affected by the industry-wide slump. Alaska (ALK  -  Free Report) dropped as much as 5%, Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) tumbled about 2%, and Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report) was down roughly 4%.Overall, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) slumped about 2% in morning trading.The airline industry continues to struggle in the face of rising fuel and labor costs, shifting trends, and global economic uncertainty. Nevertheless, investors will hope that some carriers can report strong summer travel results and help motivate a rebound.Want more market analysis from this author?

1973,LUV,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have sunk roughly 8% over the last month in a sign that investors might not expect good things from the U.S. airline company’s second quarter financial results, especially with fuel costs on the rise. But let’s take a look at what they should really expect from Delta on Thursday and see if DAL might be worth buying.Recent News Delta announced last week that it flew a record number of passengers during the month of June, noting that it carried 17.7 million customers across its global network, which marked a roughly 3% climb from the year-ago period. Year to date, Delta has boarded a total of 93.3 million passengers, up 2.5%. Meanwhile, the company’s revenue passenger miles also climbed 3%.Closing the quarter on a strong note should be good news for investors. Coupled with the fact that United (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported record-breaking passenger totals last month at 15.2 million, it could signal that airline companies are set for a strong second quarter. But there are concerns that higher fuel costs will hurt the industry’s bottom line.The fear is that Delta, United, American (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report), and other airlines won’t be able to raise their prices quickly enough to make up for the roughly 55% increase in fuel costs from a year ago.With that said, Delta reaffirmed its Q2 earnings guidance of $1.65 per share to $1.75 per share last week. “We’ve made money at fuel prices at $100 and we’ve made money at $40,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said recently at the National Press Club in Washington. “There’s a resiliency and a stability to our business like never before.”So now let’s look to see what investors should expect from Delta when it reports its Q2 results before the market opens on Thursday, kicking off a wave airline giant’s quarterly earnings releases.Q2 Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Delta’s quarterly revenues to climb by 8.23% to hit $11.68 billion. Meanwhile, its quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 6.71% to reach $1.75 per share.Investors should note that DAL’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—is calling for earnings of $1.76 per share, which is 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Delta has also topped earnings estimates in five out of the last six quarters. We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report, and DAL stock climbed 2.8% last quarter and 7.1% in the fourth quarter following its quarterly earnings release.Price Movement/ ValuationMoving on, investors should want to understand how Delta stock has performed. Shares of DAL have climbed 32% over the last two years, just outpacing the S&P 500’s climb. However, Delta stock is down 7.3% over the last year and has sunk 14% during the last six months. This is good news for investors if they are considering buying DAL stock since it currently sits roughly $10 below its 52-week high of $60.79 per share, and could easily climb if the company posts strong results or guidance. Delta’s recent performance has helped its valuation picture look a bit more attractive at the moment. DAL is currently trading at 8.1X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant discount compared to the S&P 500’s 17.2X and its industry’s average of 9.8X.For further reference, DAL stock has traded as high as 11.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 8.6X and currently sits near its year-long low of 7.8X. It is also currently trading below its five-year median of 9X.Bottom LineDelta is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system and an overall “A” VGM grade. The company is also expected to see both its top and bottom lines expand at relatively solid rates for a company of its age and size.DAL has also seen its shares climb directly following its earnings release in the trailing two periods, which means it might be a stock worth considering before the opening bell on Thursday.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1974,LUV,"Shares of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) have gained 4.2% since the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 17. Also, management’s trimmed capacity growth outlook for 2018 has dismissed fears pertaining to capacity overexpansion.We expect United Continental's top line in the second quarter to be driven by robust growth in passenger revenues owing to solid demand for air travel. Additionally, its projection on unit revenues for the same period is encouraging. The company anticipates pre-tax margin between 9% and 11%. Passenger unit revenues are expected to increase 1-3% year over year. Detailed results are expected to be out later in the month.A glance at the company’s share price performance shows that it has outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has gained 4.1% against the industry’s 19.7% decline.YTD Price Performance  We are also impressed by the carrier’s efforts to modernize its fleet. Evidently, United Continentalis constantly adding more efficient planes to its fleet and removing outdated ones.Additionally, the stock has a  VGM Score of A, which highlights its attractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Despite these key driving factors, we advise investors to wait for a better entry point before buying shares of this airline heavyweight. Here's Why:HeadwindsWe remain concerned about the various setbacks pertaining to customer service at United Continental over the past year. Earlier in 2018, a dog died in one of its flights resulting in severe criticism from all possible quarters. In fact, United Continental earned the dubious distinction of recording the maximum number of animal deaths on its flights in 2017.Furthermore, high labor costs are likely to hurt United Continental's bottom line in the second quarter as was the case in the first quarter of 2018. This apart, increased fuel costs are anticipated to dent this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier’s bottom-line growth in the second quarter. Consolidated average aircraft fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $2.18 and $2.23 in the same period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apart from United Continental, the rise in oil prices is likely to weigh on the second-quarter earnings of other airline operators like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report).The frequent management changes at United Continental also highlight the lack of stability in its management team. Such changes at short intervals generally do not go down well with investors, shaking their confidence in the stock. United Continental’s high debt levels raise concerns as well.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

1975,LUV,"In the past week, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) received good news on the labor front. The low-cost carrier inked a provisional labor deal with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. Notably, the association represents 2,400 of its employees involved in the aircraft mechanics workgroup.However, labor troubles continue at European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report).  The airline pilots, based in Ireland, are scheduled to go on a 24-hour strike on Jul 12 in protest against management’s approach toward transfers between the carrier’s European and African bases. Meanwhile, June load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) at Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) remained flat at 88.5% as both traffic and capacity grew at 3% each, during the month. An expansion-related update from Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, also grabbed headlines over the past five trading days.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Jun 27, 2018)Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Apart from the tentative labor deal with its aircraft mechanics, Southwest Airlines, which is undergoing turbulence due to the Flight 1380 accident earlier this year, was in the news again when it extended its bookable schedule through Mar 6, 2019. As part of its domestic expansion initiatives, the low-cost carrier announced several additional non-stop services connecting North Texas with important cities across the United States. It will also increased frequency to the popular destinations from Dallas Love Field (read more: Southwest to Add Flights for Domestic Expansion).2. While releasing its June traffic numbers, Delta stated that it still expects second-quarter earnings per share in the $1.65-$1.75 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings stands at $1.75 per share. Adjusted pre-tax margin is still anticipated in the band of 13-14% for the same period. Also, fuel price per gallon is projected to be between $2.20 and $2.25. System capacity is envisioned to expand approximately 3.5%. Additionally, total revenue per available seat mile is expected (TRASM) to increase between 4% and 5% year over year.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Tickets are currently on sale with special introductory one-way fares (read more: Hawaiian Holdings Arm to Fly Sacramento-Kahului From 2019).4. Ryanair’s pilots, represented by the Irish Airline Pilots' Association and directly employed by the company, will go on strike next Thursday against management inaction as far as their demands are concerned. The strike, if it materializes, might hamper travel plans of many passengers as Jul 12 marks the beginning of the traditional holiday fortnight in Northern Ireland. What is worse is that more strikes may follow if the labor unrest is not resolved.5. Despite rising fuel costs, average air fares continue to drop in the United States. The metric declined 6.6% year over year in June mainly due to intense competition in key markets. Moreover, air fares in the country are projected to be down 9% year over year for travel on Jul 4, 2018. The figure of $171 round-trip is projected to be the lowest since Jul 4, 2013.  Although favorable for passengers, low air fares are a drag for airline companies.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the last week and during the past six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-0.4%-7.8%UAL1.2%2.4%GOL4.5%-44.8%DAL-2.2%-12.8%JBLU1.1%-10.6%AAL-1.3%-28.3%SAVE4.7%-15.1%LUV2.3%-19.9%CPA3.6%-28.6%ALK2.8%-16.4%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green over the last week leading to a 1.2% increase in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index.

1976,LUV,"Oil prices have been on the rise this year, shooting up more than 20% so far. Apart from the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter — and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices. Since fuel expenses are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.According to the recent commentary by Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), the carrier is likely to incur additional costs to the tune of $2 billion in 2018 due to an increase in oil price.In fact, it is not only Delta but the entire airline space that is likely to suffer due to a rise in fuel costs. In April, another airline heavyweight — American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) — had trimmed its current-year earnings per share projection due to high fuel costs.Rise in fuel costs is likely to dent Delta’s profitability in the second quarter as well. This Atlanta, GA-based carrier slashed its second-quarter earnings per share guidance earlier this month, due to rising fuel costs. The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the previous estimate between $1.80 and $2.Capacity-Related WoesApart from high fuel costs, woes related to capacity overexpansion have also been a thorn in the flesh for airline stocks. Highlighting the capacity-related woes, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers), which is an important indicator of profitability and efficiency for airline companies declined in May for major U.S. carriers, namely Delta and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). A fall in load factor indicates inefficient capacity utilization that creates more vacant seats.Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid-2014, despite the recent resurgence. Moreover, airfares have remained low, with the metric declining in April as well as May. Low air fares are favorable for fliers but a drag on the top line of carriers due to their lesser profits.Other HeadwindsCustomer-related issues have been hurting airlines for quite some time. The unfortunate Apr 17 mid-air engine explosion on a Southwest Airlines Dallas-bound flight from New York resulted in the demise of one passenger and injured many.Computer glitches are also hurting airline operations. American Airlines’ regional carrier PSA Airlines was the latest victim of such disruptions. In June, a computer failure at PSA Airlines adversely impacted its crew scheduling system. As a result of the disruption, the carrier’s operations were thrown haywire as it had to call off multiple flights. Needless to say, the cancellation of flights caused unwarranted harassments to its passengers.Industry Underperformance in 1HJudging by shareholder returns in the first half of the year, it seems that headwinds like high fuel and labor costs, capacity-related issues and technological glitches have contributed to investors’ pessimism surrounding the space.The  Zacks Airline industry, which is part of the broader Zacks Transportation Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector year to date.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 19.5%, the Zacks Transportation Sector has shed 7% of its value. Meanwhile, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has rallied 1.9% in the first half of the year.1H Price Performance  Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the StrugglesThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #230, which places it at the bottom 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been bearish over the past five weeks.What’s in Store in 2H?The bearish forecast by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) on current-year airlines’ profitability highlights the fact that the woes are likely to continue for carriers. The research firm predicts global net profit for the industry to be $33.8 billion, much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, unveiled in December 2017.Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27.5% to $70 per barrel this year. The fuel bill is likely to account for 24.2% of total costs in 2018 (21.4% in 2017). Escalating oil prices apart, labor and interest costs also weighed on the profitability forecast.Dump These Carriers from Your Portfolio NowIn view of the above challenges confronting the space, we have zeroed in four carriers that investors would do well to get rid of from their respective portfolios as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak. This is because, similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns.All the stocks have an unfavorable Zacks Rank and have witnessed negative earnings estimate revisions recently.(You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here).JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) is a low-cost carrier based in Long Island City, New York. The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 2.4% downward in the last 60 days. The JetBlue stock has shed 15% of its value in the first half of the year. Based in Las Vegas, Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) is the parent company of Allegiant Air.

The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 1.8% downward in the last 60 days and has shed 10.2% of its value in the first half of the year.  Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) is an Irish low-cost carrier carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 7.4% downward in the last 60 days and has shed 6.4% of its value in the last three months. Azul SA (AZUL  -  Free Report) is the largest airline in Brazil in terms of the number of cities served. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss for the current-quarter has widened significantly at Azul over the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock, carrying a Zacks Rank #4, has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 38.3% downward in the last 60 days and has shed 31.3% of its value in the first half of the year.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1977,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has announced several additional non-stop services connecting North Texas with important cities around the United States. It will also increase frequency to the popular destinations from Dallas Love Field.The carrier will add a daily non-stop flight connecting Dallas (Love Field) with Charleston, Ft.

1978,LUV,"It is a well-known fact that airline stocks are inversely related to oil prices. This is because expenses on fuel represent one of the most significant input costs for an airline company. Much to the anguish of airlines, oil prices have been on the rise, up more than 20% so far this year. Apart from the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices.Generally, the rise in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of carriers and limits bottom-line growth. According to the recent commentary by Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), the carrier is likely to incur additional costs to the tune of $2 billion in 2018 due to increase in oil prices.In fact, it is not only Delta but the entire airline space that is likely to suffer due to rise in fuel costs. This is quite evident from the International Air Transport Association’s (“IATA”) bearish forecast for current-year airlines’ profitability. According to the research firm, global net profit for the industry is expected to be $33.8 billion, much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, unveiled in December 2017.In April, another airline heavyweight — American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) — had trimmed its current-year earnings per share projection due to high fuel costs.Rise in fuel costs is likely to dent Delta’s profitability in the second quarter as well. This Atlanta, GA-based Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) carrier had slashed its second-quarter earnings per share guidance earlier this month, due to rising fuel costs. The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the previous estimate between $1.80 and $2.In fact, high fuel costs have contributed to the 11% year to date decline in the Delta stock price. Apart from Delta, other carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) are likely to witness bottom-line decline, respectively, due to upsurge in  oil prices.Also, JetBlue and Southwest’s unfavorable Zacks Ranks can be primarily attributed to increase in oil prices.

1979,LUV,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) has been plagued with numerous headwinds, of late. In fact, factors like capacity-related woes, safety-related issues and escalating fuel costs have resulted in the Allegiant stock shedding 10.2% of its value so far this year.YTD Price Performance  Reasons for the Lackluster PerformanceHigh fuel and labor costs have been limiting the carrier’s bottom-line growth for quite some time now and the second quarter of 2018 is likely to be no different. In May, fuel costs at Allegiant were approximately $2.44 per gallon, higher than the April reading of $2.28 per gallon. With oil prices on an uptrend, Allegiant might revise its current-year fuel price guidance of $2.20 per gallon upward in the near future. High labor costs may also weigh on the company’s bottom-line performance.We note that Allegiant is not the sole airline company to suffer from high fuel costs. Other carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) are also being hurt by the rise in one of the largest input costs for any airline.Additionally, capacity-related woes have been hurting Allegiant for quite some time and the company’s May traffic report was no exception. In May, system capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), expanded 10.7% to 1.23 billion. Notably, capacity expansion was more in May compared with 9% in April, giving rise to capacity-overexpansion related fears.Meanwhile, Allegiant is still suffering from CBS News' report, 60 Minutes, alleging that it was facing a number of safety-related issues. The damaging television program was aired on Apr 15. The allegations are being investigated.Furthermore, Allegiant’s high debt levels are concerning. The fact that it is a highly leveraged company is quite evident from the ratio of its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage), which is currently in excess of 100. This compares unfavorably to the figure of 92.6% for its industry.Unfavorable ReadingsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and 2018 earnings moved south 1.8% and 2%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects investor’s pessimism surrounding the stock. Moreover, the company exhibits a Momentum Score of D, which highlights its short-term unattractiveness. Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).However, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our ViewSimilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Allegiant seems to one such stock, which has witnessed downward earnings estimate revisions and has an unfavorable Zacks Rank.Therefore, if you are still holding on to shares of Allegiant in your portfolio, we believe that it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

The service will be expanded to up to five flights a week between the destinations in the above-mentioned period (read more: Hawaiian Holdings Arm to Boost Sapporo-Honolulu Connectivity).3.The lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of New York has accused Southwest Airlines of negligence in providing proper care to its passengers to the point of even risking their lives. Per the claim, Southwest has not made sufficient efforts to repair damaged aircraft and/or replace the unsafe ones for a safer travel (read more: Southwest Bumps Into New Trouble Due to Flight 1380 Incident).4. Delta invited criticism from trainers and users of service dogs, following its decision to prevent a passenger from carrying more than one emotional support animal on a flight. Pit bull dogs will no longer be classified as support/service animals. The new rules, designed to take effect in a fortnight, are in addition to the existing rules on support animals, already effective from Mar 1.On a separate note, Delta inked a deal with Bombardier to purchase 20 CRJ900 planes, in a bid to modernize its fleet. The new planes are expected to be delivered from late 2018 to 2020.5. JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) plans to offer customers more options for travelling to Havana. To this end, the carrier has announced a new service from Boston to Havana. Simultaneously, it will add more flights on the existing route from Fort Lauderdale to Havana.The airline will begin a Saturday service connecting Boston Logan International Airport with Havana’s Jose Marti International Airport from Nov 10, 2018 onward.

Shares of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) have declined the most (11.1%) in the period.We note that the health of airline stocks is inversely proportional to oil prices. The rise in oil price was owing to OPEC’s plans (after intense negotiations in Vienna) for a smaller-than-expected output raise. Macro issues (trade war-related fears) have also been hurting the market over the past week.Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 4.7% in the period. Over the course of the last six months, the sector tracker has lost more than 14% of its value mainly due to high fuel costs and other headwinds. Gol Linhas again was the primary laggard with its shares declining 37.3%.

1982,LUV,"The airline industry is benefiting from strong demand for air travel. Declining air fares along with a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have provided consumers an added incentive to opt for air travel. The bullish projection by the Airlines for America (A4A) for the ongoing summer season confirms the robust demand. The association expects the season to be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel.However, the rise in fuel costs has hurt airline stocks big time. Oil prices have risen roughly 10% year to date. Since expenses on fuel are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.In fact, the bearish forecast by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) on current-year airlines’ profitability highlights the fact that the woes are likely to continue for carriers. The research firm predicts global net profit for the industry to be $33.8 billion, much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, unveiled in December 2017. Escalating oil prices apart, labor and interest costs also weighed on the profitability forecast.Industry Underperforms on Shareholder ReturnsJudging by shareholder returns over the past year, it seems that solid demand for air travel and the improving unit revenue scenario weren’t enough for instilling investors’ confidence as far as the industry’s growth prospects are concerned.Headwinds like high fuel and labor costs, capacity-related issues and technological glitches have contributed to investors’ pessimism surrounding the space.The  Zacks Airline industry, which is a 25-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 12.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Transportation Sector have rallied 13.4% and 0.8%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceAirline Stocks Trading CheapThanks to the industry’s underperformance over the past year, the valuation looks really cheap now. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses.This ratio is essentially utilized by buyers to come to a conclusion regarding the reasonability of a target's valuation.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.07, near the lowest level over the past year. When compared with the highest level of 7.29 and median level of 6.31 over that period, there is apparently plenty of upside left.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is 11.49 and the median level is 11.36.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (TTM) However, as transportation stocks have unique characteristics, a comparison of the group’s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its border sector is probably the best approach. Such a comparison ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Transportation Sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.09 and the median level of 7.66 for the same period are significantly above the Zacks Airline Industry’s respective ratios.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (TTM) Underperformance May Continue Due to Bleak Earnings OutlookThe strong balance sheets of major carriers have enabled them to engage in shareholder and employee-friendly activities. Additionally, strong demand on the back of a buoyant U.S. economy coupled with low air fares may help airline stocks in delivering improved shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The above ratio analysis already shows that there is hardly any value-oriented path ahead and one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects of a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.While the consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Airline industry of $3.59 per share shows a year-over-year deterioration, the trend in earnings estimate revisions is not favorable either.Price and Consensus: Zacks Airline IndustryLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 11.4% downward since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #244, which places it at the bottom 5% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been bearish over the past five weeks.  In fact, the basis of this bearish outlook could be the downward trend, albeit some fluctuations, in top line that airlines have been showing since the beginning of 2015.  Airline Stocks Promise Long-Term GrowthWhile the near-term prospects look unwelcoming for investors, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Airline industry appears upbeat. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth has been showing an upward trend since January 2018 to reach the current level of 13.4%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate In fact, the basis of this long-terms EPS growth could be an increase in free cash flow for the industry since the beginning of the current-year.  The increase in free cash flow bodes well for airline stocks, as far as their dividend-paying capacity is concerned. This is because dividends are paid from a company's cash flow. We note that airline stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) have raised their dividend payouts this year. Moreover, an uptick in such shareholder-friendly activities in the space is likely due to the massive savings resulting from the new tax law.Investors prefer dividend-paying stocks, as these are financially stable and mature, and can also generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions. Therefore, our anticipation that airlines will fly high in the long run is justified.Bottom LineEven though factors like an improving unit revenue scenario, increased demand for air travel, cheap valuation and infrastructural developments to attract more passengers are positives for the sector and might contribute to long-term growth, we believe that that airlines will fly low in the short term mainly due to the surge in fuel costs. According to IATA, jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27.5% to $70 per barrel this year. Fuel bill is likely to account for 24.2% of total costs in 2018 (21.4% in 2017).Overall, the industry might not be able to tide over the challenges in the near term and therefore none of the stocks in our airline universe currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). However, below is a stock that has been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is a regional carrier operating in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 5.2% upward over the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: SKYWAs mentioned throughout, there are a number of reasons to worry about the industry’s performance in the near to medium term. So, it would be prudent to stay away from some weak airline stocks for now. Stocks carrying an unfavorable Zacks Rank are particularly expected to underperform.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

1983,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is faced with a new trouble related to the April 17 flight 1380 incident. Per media reports, a group of eight passengers aboard the Southwest flight in April has filed a lawsuit against the carrier in the Supreme Court of New York.The tragic incident in April forced the carrier to make an emergency landing at the Philadelphia International Airport due to an engine failure causing a fan blade to detach. Consequently, one of the passengers died while seven others were injured.Following the fatal event, Southwest has been put under rigorous scrutiny and the federal regulators are still investigating the events which induced the engine explosion.The lawsuit filed on Wednesday has accused the carrier of negligence in providing proper care to its passengers to the point of even risking their lives. The lawsuit claims that Southwest has not made sufficient efforts to repair damaged aircraft and/or replace the unsafe ones for a safer travel.The defendants in the case are Southwest and the Boeing 737 plane (involved in the fatal accident) manufacturer, The Boeing Company. Companies involved in manufacturing the engine are also defending the charge.Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) inspector general said that it is opening a review of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) oversight of Southwest and is auditing the process. The FAA claims that its oversight system is effectively designed to allow earlier identification of potential risks so that the same does not result in serious issues and ensures that necessary actions are taken.The series of events following the tragic incident undoubtedly places Southwest in a tight spot and raises questions regarding its safety measures. This recent event will aggravate the carrier’s already low demand and worsen its ongoing troubles.

1984,LUV,"On Jun 20, we initiated coverage on SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), which operates as a regional airline in the United States through its subsidiaries — SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet Airlines. Apart from the two scheduled passenger airline operations, SkyWest is the holding company of an aircraft leasing entity.Upbeat Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, SkyWest has performed exceedingly well, handily outperforming its industry. While shares of the company have surged 57.3%, the industry shed 10.9% of its value. Reasons Behind the Impressive Price PerformanceWe are impressed by SkyWest’s efforts to modernize its fleet and streamline operations. The company aims to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft. In line with its fleet transition efforts, SkyWest has witnessed a 4.5% year-over-year decline in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) in the first five months of 2018. Also, the carrier has added 19 new E175 planes to its fleet and removed 71 unproductive/less-profitable aircraft from its fleet since the first quarter of 2017.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and buybacks are also commendable. To this end, SkyWest increased its quarterly dividend payment by 25% to 10 cents per share (40 cents annualized) in February 2018. In terms of buybacks, the carrier repurchased shares worth $10 million (under the $100 million buyback program authorized in 2017) in the first quarter of 2018.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also raised dividend payouts this year.In fact, we believe the new tax law is an added positive for US-based transportation companies like SkyWest. In the first quarter of 2018, effective tax rate reduced to 19% from 34% a year ago. Even though tax rate is expected to be a bit higher in the remaining quarters of 2018, the projected effective tax rate in the 24-25% range is still much lower than the 2017 actual figure. The significant cut in corporate tax rate is anticipated to boost cash flow, which in turn, might aid their bottom-line growth.With the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations. Also, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have added an incentive for consumers to opt for air travel. This bodes well for US-based carriers like SkyWest. Given this buoyant scenario, the ongoing summer season should see SkyWest garnering significant passenger revenues, which is a boon for the carrier.Estimate Revisions & Style ScoreUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. SkyWest scores impressively on this front as well. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings moved north 5.2%, reflecting positive sentiment surrounding the stock.Additionally, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds and the favorable readings, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. The carrier’s bullish Zacks Rank also supports our view.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1985,LUV,"Shares of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.  (EXPD  -  Free Report) have rallied 18.6% so far this year, handily outperforming the industry’s 7.6% rise.YTD Price Performance  Reasons Behind the RallyExpeditors is benefiting from solid yield growth as freight markets remain promising. In fact, the improving freight demand scenario bodes well for the company. Impressive volume growth in the ocean and airfreight divisions is encouraging as well. Expeditors' debt-free balance sheet also raises optimism.Lower tax rates, following introduction of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), are boosting bottom-line growth and should continue to do so moving ahead. Moreover, the company’s initiatives to reward are commendable. To this end, in May 2018, Expeditors raised its semi-annual cash dividend by 7.1% to 45 cents per share (annualized 90 cents per share).In the wake of the new tax law, we expect a further uptick in such investor-friendly activities. Huge savings from the slashed tax rate has boosted Expeditors’ cash flow.

Fuel prices are anticipated to be even higher (between $2.18 and $2.23 per gallon) in the second quarter.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses pertaining to labor are expected to weigh on the bottom line in the second quarter. Consolidated cost per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is anticipated to increase 3.5% in the second quarter of 2018.American Airlines’ high debt levels are added concerns. Apart from American Airlines, the rise in oil prices has also hurt other airline operators like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report).Other Unfavorable ReadingsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and full-year 2018 earnings moved south 8.5% and 7.9%, respectively, in the last 60 days.

Non-fuel unit costs are likely to rise approximately 3% year over year, up from the prior forecast of a climb in the 1-3% range.Due to the cost headwind, the company slashed its earnings per share guidance for the concerned quarter. The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the former estimate between $1.80 and $2 (read more: Delta's Q2 TRASM View Bullish, Costs Guidance Bearish).2.

Seasonally-adjusted ticket prices in the same month decreased 1.9% on a month-on-month basis, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Also, average air fares (unadjusted) in May declined 6.6% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the May reading marks the second consecutive month of a decrease in airfares. The decline in airfares has been attributed to the intense competition in key markets. Even though, low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies.6.

Load factor contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 84.6% in the month as traffic growth was exceeded by capacity expansion.

Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated marginally in the period. Over the course of the last six months, the sector tracker has lost more than 7% of its value mainly due to high fuel costs and other headwinds.  Shares of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A.

As a result, the load factor increased 50 bps to 82.4%. Moreover, passenger count climbed 4.8% to 65.76 billion on a year-to-date basis.Southwest Airlines Co. Price  Southwest Airlines Co. Price | Southwest Airlines Co. Quote With the entire airline industry embroiled in trouble pertaining to high fuel costs, the company recently trimmed its 2018 capacity view for the above reason. The company now projects capacity in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range. Additionally, the company now anticipates second-quarter 2018 available seat mile (ASM) or capacity to ascend approximately 3.5%. Earlier, the company had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric.Further adding to the woes, Southwest Airlines’ demand is still low due to the fatal Flight 1380 incident in April. Hence, the company now expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline around 3% year over year (earlier guidance saw a fall in the 1-3% range). The company cited soft bookings following insufficient marketing initiatives post the unfortunate incident as the reason behind the downside.The fuel cost headwind being a common problem plaguing all airlines, other carriers too seem to follow suit. Most recently, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) lifted its view for fuel costs. It now estimates the same between $2.20 and $2.25 per gallon. The previous forecast came in between $2.07 and $2.12.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSouthwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

1989,LUV,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) issued a revised guidance for the second quarter of 2018 at the Deutsche Bank 2018 Global Industrials and Materials Summit held yesterday.Strong demand for air travel is anticipated to aid the carrier’s second-quarter results. However, rising fuel prices are pushing up costs and are expected to affect bottom-line growth.The company now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase between 4% and 5% year over year in the second quarter. Past outlook had called for a rise of 3-5% in the metric. This upside has been driven by impressive revenues and solid demand across all entities in leisure and business segments.With fuel prices trending upward lately (up 12% since the beginning of the second quarter), the company has raised its view pertaining to the same. It now expects the metric between $2.20 and $2.25 per gallon. Previously, the estimate came in between $2.07 and $2.12. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to rise approximately 3% year over year, up from the prior forecast of a climb in the 1-3% range. However, this view is less than the 3.9% ascent during the first quarter of 2018.Pretax margin is now projected between 13% and 14%. Earlier prediction was in the band of 14-16%. Due to the cost headwind, the company slashed its earnings per share guidance for the concerned quarter. The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the former estimate between $1.80 and $2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings stands at $1.89.The company stated that it takes approximately 6-12 months to recover from rising fuel prices through higher revenues. As a result of trimming its earnings per share guidance, shares of Delta fell significantly during the course of the trading session on Jun 6. However, the stock rebounded to a great extent, closing the trading session at $54.17, down 0.9% over Jun 5’s closing price. The projection for system capacity in the second quarter remains unchanged at 3-4% expansion.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote Delta continues to anticipate non-fuel unit costs, higher by 0-2% for the full year, way below the 5.9% increase in 2017. Additionally, the company hopes to return 70% of free cash flow to its shareholders this year. While in the longer-term, it aims to return 20-25% of free cash flow through dividends.Escalating oil prices being a major headwind of the entire airline industry, other carriers might follow Delta and Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) footsteps in trimming their respective outlooks. We remind investors that a few days back, Southwest Airlines also lowered its capacity view due to the same reason. The low-cost carrier cited high oil prices among other factors behind its capacity outlook cut for 2018. It now expects capacity in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDelta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report).

Per the forecast, approximately 246.1 million passengers (2.68 million fliers per day) will be transported by U.S. airlines this summer, up 3.7% from the 2016 levels.In fact, to meet the surge in travel demand, the U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 116,000 per day. Also, with the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations.Further, declining air fares in addition to a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have provided added incentive for consumers to opt for air travel. Driven by the above reasons, the three-month period is likely to see 96,000 additional passengers taking to the skies per day on various U.S. carriers.6. Ryanair Holdings reported financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 2018 up 10% year over year at €1,450 million despite a 3% decline in average airfares.

1991,LUV,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have gained 32.1% in a year’s time, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 23.1%.Reasons Behind the Impressive Price PerformanceThis railroad operator has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate.We note that a history of positive earnings surprise generally works as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass the estimates. So, investors take it in their consideration while betting on the stock, with an expectation that the company will do the same trick to outpace the estimates in the upcoming release.The most recent earnings beat came last month when this Norfolk, VA- based company reported first-quarter 2018 results. The earnings outperformance apart, it also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues. Both the metrics also improved on a year-over- year basis. Furthermore, its intermodal unit performed very well in the quarter. Intermodal revenues and volumes increased 19% and 7%, respectively.Also,Norfolk Southern’s cost-control efforts are impressive. To this end, the company’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) improved 70 basis points in the first quarter. The company aims to achieve an operating ratio below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.In fact, the lesser the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available with the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.Earlier in 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an 18% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) driven by the new tax law. Norfolk Southern shelled out $205 million as dividends in the first quarter of 2018. Of late, the company also raised its current-year buyback target to $1.5 billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We believe the new tax law is a blessing for Transportation companies like Norfolk Southern. This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also hiked dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1992,LUV,"Last week, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report)   — one of leading players in the airline space — announced a 28% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 16 cents per share (annualized 64 cents per share). The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Jun 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 6.This latest move highlights Southwest Airlines’ commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward. Moreover, a look at past records reveals Southwest Airlines’ stable dividend payment history. Notably, this marks the low-cost carrier's 167th straight quarter of dividend payment.Shareholder-Friendly Measures Highlight Strong Balance SheetsApart from Southwest Airlines, its fellow airline companies like SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have raised their dividend payouts this year. Moreover, Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, started paying dividends from October, 2017.Southwest Airlines’ board of directors also cleared a new share buyback program worth $2 billion. The new program is set to begin on completion of the existing $2-billion share repurchase authorized in May 2017.These investor-friendly measures clearly highlight the financial prosperity of stocks in the airline space. The strong balance sheets of sector participants have made them invest substantially for promoting safety and enhancing productivity.While Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), SkyWest has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Uptick in Shareholder-Friendly Activities LikelyWith the advent of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), the financial health of airline players is likely to improve further. This is because, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others due to the significant reduction in tax bills.Consequently, an increase in the shareholder-friendly measures (dividends, buybacks) is very much in the cards for the airline space. For example, we expect Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) to hike its dividend shortly. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record with respect to dividends/buybacks.Solid Demand for Air Travel Bodes Well with Approaching Summer Airlines’ robust financial health has allowed them to make investments for improving onboard experience. Strong demand has also prompted airlines to add routes. For example, United Airlines — the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — recently added routes from New York/Newark and Washington-Dulles.Given higher demand for travel from New York, the carrier aims to attract traffic on the routes. Improvement in domestic economy has contributed to the upside. With consumer confidence remaining upbeat, more and more Americans are taking vacations.With demand remaining strong, we expect airlines to rake in significant profits in the upcoming summer season despite the rise in oil prices. Summers usually represent a very busy time for airlines and this year is likely to be no different. In fact, despite high fuel costs air fares had declined sharply in April, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Valuation Attractive Despite High Fuel CostsGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio — which is often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.2 (the lowest point in the last six months), which compares favorably with the market at large as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11.2. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1993,LUV,"Shares of Triton International Limited (TRTN  -  Free Report) have gained 17.4% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 14.5% rally.Reasons Behind the UptickTriton International’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments are encouraging. Evidently, in May 2018, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 15% to 52 cents per share (annualized $2.08). In the first quarter of 2018, it paid approximately $36 million in dividends, reflecting an increase of 8.5% year over year. Also, the company’s strong cash flow generation is commendable.Furthermore, Triton International’s initiatives to grow its fleet appear promising. The new tax law is an added positive for the company. In fact, reduction in effective tax rate due to the new law led to bottom-line growth in the first quarter.We believe the new tax law is a blessing not only for Triton International, but all Transportation companies. This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also raised dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law.Notably, a majority of Triton International’s revenues is derived from its equipment leasing unit. Most of its leasing revenues are generated from international containers. To this end, the metric increased a respective 13.8% and 20.3% in the Asian and European markets in the first quarter.We are also impressed by the company's efforts to grow its fleet (CAGR of 8.2% over the 2005-2017 period). Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings moved north to the tune of 7.1% over the last 60 days, reflecting positive sentiment surrounding the stock.Bullish OutlookThe company’s outlook for the rest of 2018 is impressive. It expects gradual increase in adjusted net income for the current year. Meanwhile, demand for the company’s containers is anticipated to remain high, thus boosting growth. Favorable market conditions should also drive results in the remaining quarters of 2018.At its Investor Day on May 31, the company stated that it expects the bottom line to grow moderately in the remainder of the year. Asset growth for 2018 is projected between 7% and 10%. Cash flow before capex is expected to exceed 80% of leasing revenues.Other Favorable ReadingsTriton International's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 12.3% compares favorably with ROE of 8.8% for its industry. This reflects the fact that it is efficient in using shareholders’ funds. Also, Triton International is attractively valued.Going by the EV by EBITDA ratio, the stock doesn’t look expensive at this point.  The measure for the stock is 8.6, which is favorable compared with the S&P 500's 11.4. The stock’s favorable positioning compared to the broader market certainly signals more upside.Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of A, which highlights its attractiveness.

1994,LUV,"United Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary United Airlines announced Gerry Laderman as the acting chief financial officer (CFO) following the resignation of Andrew Levy. United Airlines will soon begin looking for Levy’s permanent replacement.Laderman was hitherto serving as the senior vice president of finance, procurement and treasurer plus a member of the senior executive leadership team. In the past, he held legal and financial positions for around 30 years and will continue working on the company’s financial strategy, cost management, capital allocation as well as balance sheet optimization.Levy joined United Airlines in August 2016, previously having served in the discount carrier Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report). Since the last couple of years, growth of low cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has been posing a threat to the legacy airlines like United Airlines. Given his expertise in low-fare flights, United Airlines introduced air tickets at cheaper rates (Basic Economy Fares) to combat this challenge.It now remains to be seen how Laderman deals with the situation given his lack of experience in the low-fare category.United Continental Holdings, Inc. Price  United Continental Holdings, Inc. Price | United Continental Holdings, Inc. QuoteMoreover, since the past few years, United Airlines has been in a soup, drawing a lot of flak. The April 2017 passenger fiasco, which saw a flyer being offloaded from an overbooked flight, had sparked a large-scale customer criticism and significantly affected the stocks’ value as well. Earlier this March, the carrier was again portrayed in a bad light when three consecutive unpleasant pet-related incidents took place over a short span. One such tragic event caused the death of a passenger’s pet.Despite such setbacks, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has consistently bounced back.

1995,LUV,"Shares of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) have lost 22.2% so far this year, underperforming its industry's decline of 11.1%. Why the Lackluster Price Performance?Southwest Airlines has faced multiple headwinds this year. In April, a passenger on its flight (1380) died due to the mid-air engine explosion. This incident adversely impacted travel demand at Southwest Airlines, resulting in soft bookings.Moreover, Southwest Airlines, like its fellow-airline operators Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report), has been hit hard by the rise in oil prices.This low-cost carrier issued a lackluster view for second-quarter unit revenues due to weak bookings and rising fuel costs. The company expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline around 3% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1-3% range).With fuel prices on the rise, the Dallas-based carrier trimmed its capacity (measured in available seat mile or ASMs) growth view.  It now anticipates second-quarter capacity to increase approximately 3.5%. Earlier, the company had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric.Additionally, the company projects ASM in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range. Also, for the latter half of the year, ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6% year over year, lower than its earlier view of a rise in the low 7% range.Other Unfavorable ReadingsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and full-year 2018 earnings moved south 14.7% and 9%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects investor’s pessimism surrounding the stock. Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of C, which highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1996,LUV,"Shares of GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $75.35 during the trading session on May 16, before retracing a bit to close at $74.31 per share. The closing price represents an improvement of 1.79% from May 15.In a year’s time, GATX has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has rallied 29.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.5%. Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeLast month, this Chicago, IL-based company reported better-than-expected earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018. The bottom-line figure also improved 37.5% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by the Rail North America segment’s robust performance owing to higher gains on asset disposition in the quarter under review. GATX's Rail International unit also performed well, driven by a rise in railcars on lease. Moreover, the company’s efforts to modernize its fleet are encouraging.The company’s efforts to reward its shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments are added positives. Notably, GATX has been paying regular dividends continuously since 1919. In the 2007-2017 time frame, the company has returned approximately $1.7 billion to its shareholders through dividends and buybacks.In January 2018, GATX raised the quarterly dividend by 5% to 44 cents per share. In the first quarter of 2018, it bought back approximately 366,000 shares for $25 million.In fact, the new tax law is a blessing for Transportation companies like GATX. The huge savings, induced by the new law, might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also hiked dividend payouts in May owing to the new tax law.Impressive Earnings Surprise HistoryGATX has a solid earnings surprise history. A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate.In the first quarter of 2018, GATX surpassed earnings estimates for the third time in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 27.5%.We note that a history of positive earnings surprise generally works as a catalyst in driving a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass the estimates. So, investors take it in their consideration while betting on the stock with an expectation that the company will do the same trick to outpace the estimates in the upcoming release.Earnings Estimate Revisions on an UptrendUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism on a stock’s prospect. GATX scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being revised 0.7% and 0.6% upward, respectively, in the last 30 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock also has an impressive projected earnings per share growth rate of 15% for three to five years.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1997,LUV,"The past week was dominated by updates from the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”). The monthly data released by the IATA showcased a 6.2% year-over-year increase in demand for air travel across the globe for April 2018.Another significant update from the trade association emerged recently, when it trimmed its 2018 profitability outlook for the airline industry to $33.8 billion from $38.4 billion anticipated earlier. Notably, high fuel costs were primarily responsible for the view cut. Bulk of the global profits ($15 billion) are expected to come from the North American region.The IATA updates apart, the Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) was in the news by virtue of its May traffic report. In the month, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion.Meanwhile, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) continues to feel the pinch of the deadly accident on its flight in April, which claimed one life. Due to low ticket sales as a result of the accident apart from the spike in oil prices, this low-cost carrier issued a second-quarter unit revenue view, which was at the lower end of its previous forecast. Operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) is anticipated to decline around 3% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1-3% range).Furthermore, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) joined fellow-carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) in revamping its policy pertaining to emotional support animals on its flights.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for May 30, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. At its 74th Annual General Meeting in Sydney, Australia, the IATA stated that due to rising fuel costs and other factors like the ongoing geopolitical tensions, airline companies are expected to be less profitable in 2018 than previously anticipated. Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. However, the top line is projected to increase 10.7% on the back of higher passenger and cargo revenues.Even though, passenger air travel growth in 2018 (7%) is anticipated to be slower than the phenomenal 8.1% growth witnessed last year, it compares favorably to the 20-year average growth rate (Read more: IATA Trims 2018 Airlines Profit Forecast Due to High Costs).Earlier in the week, IATA also released its global traffic numbers for April. Although global travel demand (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) increased year over year, the metric compared unfavorably to the March reading when traffic expanded 9.7% — the highest growth rate in 12 months. With fuel costs on the rise, air fares are likely to increase in the remainder of the year.On a year-over-year basis, traffic growth was evident in both international (4.8%) and domestic (8.5%) markets, which resulted in a rise in the overall figure. Total capacity ((available seat kilometers or ASKs) increased 5.9% in the month. Load factor also improved 20 basis points to 82.3% owing to higher traffic growth. In fact, the reading on load factor was a record as far as the month of April was concerned.2. At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 19.69 billion, up 2.9% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 3.5% to 22.83 billion on a year-over-year basis (Read more: Delta May Traffic Shows a Rise, Load Factor Drops).Meanwhile, Delta and Korean Air extended their codeshare agreement on flights in the United States as both the companies aim to boost traffic in the highly lucrative trans-Pacific market. This customer-friendly move followed the launch of a joint venture partnership between the two earlier this year. A codeshare deal allows sharing of flights, which implies that a passenger has the free will to avail any flight operated by either of the companies under the agreement, irrespective of the flight number.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. Southwest Airlines trimmed its capacity outlooks for second-quarter and full-year 2018 due to increasing fuel prices. The company now anticipates second-quarter available seat mile (ASM) or capacity to rise approximately 3.5%. Earlier, it had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric. Also, for the latter half of the year, ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6% year over year, lower than its earlier view of a rise in the low 7% range (read more: Southwest Trims View on Soft Bookings & Spike in Oil Prices).4. Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) reported solid traffic data for May, courtesy of low air ticket prices. The carrier’s traffic improved 6% year over year in the month. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) rose to 96% from 95% a year ago on the back of decline in air ticket prices. The impressive traffic figures came despite the carrier having to cancel more than 1,100 flights in May due to staff shortages, inclement weather and other factors.5. From Jul 1, passengers will only be allowed to carry cats, dogs and miniature horses as emotional support animals on JetBlue flights. As part of tightening its policy, this low-cost carrier will ask the relevant passengers to provide extensive documentation pertaining to the animal’s health and behavior.In addition, the person has to provide proof related to its vaccinations and other factors within 48 hours before the flight. Under the stricter rules, the concerned passenger will also have to sign a document taking full responsibility for any injury caused by the animal he/she is carrying on the flight.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-0.9%-9.9%UAL-0.9%-1.7%GOL-1.1%-25.5%DAL0.6%-1.5%JBLU-0.8%-3.7%AAL1.7%-14.8%SAVE0.9%-3.8%LUV-0.7%-4.5%CPA-2.4%-4.8%ALK1.1%6.9%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index depreciating almost 1% in the period.

1998,LUV,"Warren Buffett is one of the world’s most respected investors. He and Berkshire Hathaway  have long favored companies that offer reasonable valuations, mixed with growth opportunities, which sounds simple enough. Here’s a look at some of Berkshire’s top holdings to see if they currently present investors solid value.The last time Berkshire disclosed its holdings it boasted a massive $170 billion stock portfolio. The top five holdings represented roughly 68% of the aggregate fair value. The list featured Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) at $40.7 billion, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) at $25.2 billion, Bank of America (BAC) at $21.0 billion, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) at $17.4 billion, and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) at $14.1 billion. The conglomerate’s other holdings included Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), and dozens of other stocks, which they owned much smaller amounts of.So now that we have covered some of Berkshire’s top holdings, let’s take a look at what kind of value Buffett’s top three holdings currently present.Apple Price - Performance/ Valuation Apple is Berkshire’s biggest holding, a spot that is recently took over. In fact, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 the company owned $28.2 billion worth of Apple stock. Therefore, Berkshire bought roughly $12.5 billion worth of shares in a very short amount of time.Shares of Apple have skyrocketed nearly 95% over the last two years, outpacing the S&P 500’s roughly 30% surge. Apple stock has also climbed over 14% since the start of the year, which helped it hit a brand new all-time high on Tuesday.Coming into Wednesday, Apple stock was trading at 15.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, Apple has traded as high as 17.2X, with a one-year median of 14.9X. Apple stock has also traded as low as 13.2X during this time period, yet investors should note that Apple stock is trading at a discount to the S&P 500’s 16.9X. Over the last decade, Apple stock has traded as high as 30.8X. Therefore, it is not much of a stretch to say that Apple’s valuation is far from stretched at this time and remains attractive compared to the S&P while remaining relatively in line with its year-long median.Wells Fargo - Price Performance/ Valuation Shares of the embattled banking giant are up just 35% over the last five years, which is far worse the S&P 500’s 71% surge. WFC stock is up 6.6% over the last year but has sunk 8.4% since the start of the year. With that said, Wells Fargo stock currently presents solid value.WFC is trading at 11.3X, marking the slightest of discounts compared to its industry’s 11.4X average—which includes Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), and other banking powers.Investors should note that Wells Fargo has traded as high as 15.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 12.4X. Therefore, WFC’s current valuation appears more than fair at the moment.Bank of America - Price Performance/ ValuationBank of America has seen its stock price climb nearly 124% over the last five years, which tops the S&P 500’s 71% surge while also beating its industry’s 67% charge. Narrowing the focus a bit more, BAC stock is up over 32% during the last year, nearly doubling its industry’s gains.One might think that these gains would make BAC’s valuation look a little stretch at the moment, but that hardly seems to be the case. Bank of America stock is currently trading at 10.9X, which is just a hair above its year-long low and also represents a discount compared to its year-long median of 12.4X.Investors will note that Bank of America stock is presenting its best value since the fall of 2016. It is also worth pointing out that AAPL, WFC, and BAC are all currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1999,LUV,"Airline stocks have been flying low on the bourses this year with the US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) having lost about 8% year to date (as of Jun 1). The first-quarter earnings season was a mixed bag for major airlines, a tick-up in oil prices being a downer.Oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. Since crude prices have steady this year as evident from the 9.8% year-to-date jump in WTI crude ETF United States Oil (USO  -  Free Report), airlines should be on guard.  Probably, this is why global airlines recently cut their forecast for industry profits in 2018.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated that the industry is expected to register $33.8 billion in profits this year, down 12% from the prior forecast of $38.4 billion. Other factors that led to the guidance cut were increasing interest rates and a spike in geopolitical tensions.Inside the Looming CrisisIATA expects oil price to average $70 a barrel this year, up from $54.90 last year and its earlier guidance of $60. Lower-than-expected crude inventory built, U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela and the result of the ongoing OPEC output cut boosted oil prices significantly this year (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).Per IATA, profit forecast for 2018 will likely be 4.1% of about $750 billion sales. Since 4% is not a compelling margin, IATA believes that the industry is in a delicate condition. Moreover, the ongoing trade tensions are another cause of concern as these could result in a drop in passenger count or air cargo. Notably, the United States and China announced tariffs on each other. Plus, U.S. tariffs on metal imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico were put into effect on Jun 1, as exemption offered earlier in the year lapsed. Needless to say, the United States now needs to be prepared for a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of products (read: Trade War Tensions Flare Up: Must-Watch ETFs & Stocks).Inside Our Earnings PredictionAgainst this backdrop, let’s take a look at how key airline stocks’ earnings prediction is shaping up. According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) stocks are best avoided.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.11%, indicating lesser chances of beating estimates in Q2.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.85%, which diminish the possibility of a beat this quarter.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -11.39%, implying that a beat cannot be predicted this quarter.Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.53%, indicating reasonable chances of a beat.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.31%, again showing higher chances of beating estimates.Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.36%, implying fair chances of an earnings beat in Q2.From the afore-mentioned trend, we clearly see that though challenges linger in the space, all airlines do not face heightened risk. Oil prices need to go much higher before posing a serious threat to the industry. In this regard, investors can take a look at the pure-play airline ETF JETS.JETS in Focus The $98.8 million-fund holds more than 30 securities in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities. United Continental (12.84%), Delta Airlines (12.51%), Southwest Airlines (11.21%) and American Airlines (10.78%) are the top four elements in the basket.

2000,LUV,"U.S. stock markets surged on Wednesday reversing previous day’s broad-based decline. In particular, retail stocks have gained on strong sales data of April and Macy’s first quarter earnings report. Moreover, Russell 2000, the benchmark index for small-cap stocks hits an all-time high. All three major indexes closed in the green as investors appeared to ignore concerns regarding rising yield on the U.S. government bonds and geopolitical tensions.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,768.93, increased 0.3%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.4% to close at 2,722.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,398.30, increased 0.6%. A total of 6.22 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.66 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.92 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers had an edge over decliners by 1.95 to -1 ratio. The CBOE VIX decreased 8.3% and closed at 13.42.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow gained 0.3%. Notably, 18 of the 30-stocks in the blue-chip index closing in the green while 12 traded in the red.  The S&P 500 increased 0.4% led by 1.2% increase of the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB). Notably, 9 out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in positive territory.The Nasdaq Composite also increased 0.6% led by a recovery in large tech stock’s prices.Russell 2000 Achieves a MilestoneSmall-cap benchmark index, the Russell 2000 (RUTX) gained 1% after hitting an all-time high of 1620.64 in Wednesday’s trading. Over the last three months, the Russell 2000 is up nearly 8%.Retails Stocks Gains The Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% for the month of April, at par with the consensus estimate. Retail sales are up for two straight months and also rose 4.7% year over year. Notably, 9 out of a total of 13 industries witnessed an increase in sales in April.Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) surged 10.8% as the retail giant reported strong results in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.36. Net sales of $5,541 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,444 million (Read More).U.S. Government Bond Yields Continue to Rise On Wednesday, yield on 10-year Treasury note extended its gain further to 3.10%, after hitting its seven year high of 3.07% yesterday. A yield of 3% on 10-year Treasury note generally regarded as a psychological barrier at which stage flight of capital takes place from risky equities to safe haven bonds.However, according to several industry researchers, investors are not necessarily to be perturbed as the yield rate crossed the sensitive 3% barrier. At present, both inflation and interest rate are within the target rate of the Fed and stock valuations appeared to be justified.Geopolitical Conflict with North Koreas Intensifies   On Wednesday, Kim Kye Gwan, a senior foreign ministry official and a longtime diplomat of North Korea stated that his country will not take part in a summit with the United States which will focus only on denuclearization of North Korea. Notably, President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un on Jun 12 in Singapore.Trump and Un are likely to discuss about Pyongyang’s denuclearization procedure for an array of economic compensation package. Meanwhile, Kim Kye Gwan stated yesterday that North Korea is not interested to do away with its nuclear weapons simply for some economic benefits.Economic Data The U.S. Federal Reserve reported that industrial production for the month of April rose 0.7%. This was the third straight month of industrial output’s expansion. April’s reading of 0.7% was also better than the consensus estimate of 0.5%. Industrial capacity in April rose 0.4% to 78.0.The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. housing starts dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.287 million units in April.

2001,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has rewarded shareholders with 28% dividend hike and a new share repurchase authorization worth $2 billion on the back of impressive results and a strong cash flow, arising from huge savings on account of the U.S. tax reform. The move indicates the company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.Following this announcement, shares of the company rose 2.5% to $53.01 at the close of business on May 16.The quarterly dividend of 16 cents per share (or 64 cents annually) will be paid on Jun 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 6. The amount has been hiked from the current 12.5 cents, marking the company’s 167th consecutive quarterly dividend.Additionally, the board has announced a new share buyback program of $2 billion in aggregate, set to begin on completion of the existing $2-billion share repurchase authorized in May 2017. Under the existing program, the company has repurchased 19.8 million shares and has $350 million still remaining to be bought back.The recently approved share buyback will be executed per the prevailing laws and is liable to be discontinued at any point of time.Southwest Airlines Co. Price  Southwest Airlines Co. Price | Southwest Airlines Co. QuoteThe company’s shareholder-friendly approach comes in at a time when it is embroiled in a lot of trouble. The successive mid-air flight snags in a month’s time has been hampering the company’s reputation. No wonder that demand for the carrier has declined. The airlines’ April traffic results bear testimony to this dismal situation. Traffic in the month slipped 0.3% on low demand following the fatal engine failure.Moreover, during first-quarter 2018 results, the company provided a bleak outlook for unit revenues in the second quarter citing weak bookings after the fatal Apr 17 incident. It expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to decline between 1% and 3% in the quarter.On Apr 30, the company had announced another $500-million accelerated share repurchase program, possibly to counter this adversity.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSouthwest carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

2003,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has revised its guidance for second-quarter 2018 unit revenues and capacity as well as full-year capacity.For the current quarter, the company expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline around 3% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1-3% range). This downside was primarily due to soft bookings following insufficient marketing initiatives post the Flight 1380 incident in April.Additionally, the company now anticipates second-quarter available seat mile (ASM) or capacity to increase approximately 3.5%. Earlier, the company had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric.Further, high oil prices and slackness in revenue trends have forced Southwest to trim its capacity outlook for 2018. The company now projects ASM in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range. Also, for the latter half of the year, ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6% year over year, lower than its past view of a rise in the low 7% range.This was perhaps much anticipated given the gloomy picture of airlines due to the recent trend of rising oil prices. In fact, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently lowered its forecast for airline profitability in 2018. The research firm predicts the industry’s global net profit to be $33.8 billion, much lower than the 2018 profitability expectation of $38.4 billion, unveiled by the organization last December. The profitability forecast for the current year also compares unfavorably with what the airlines achieved in 2017 ($38 billion).  Price PerformanceThe plight of airlines, thanks to the oil price surge, can be gauged from the Zacks Airline industry shedding 12.9% of its value, way below the S&P 500 index’s growth of 2.3%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksSouthwest carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

2005,LUV,"Shares of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (CHRW  -  Free Report) have outperformed the industry in the last six months. The stock has rallied 27.8% versus the industry’s decline of 0.7%. Reasons Behind the Price SurgeIn January 2017, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 results with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Moreover, both the bottom and top line increased substantially year over year. Price rise and volume growth across most transportation sectors drove the sales. Notably, the company has an impressive earnings history, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 3.6%. The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are also encouraging. In December 2017, the company’s board of directors approved a 2.2% hike in quarterly cash dividend to 46 cents per share (or $1.84 annually).Additionally, C.H. Robinson’s endeavors to expand globally via mergers and acquisitions are a further positive. Last August, it acquired Milgram & Company for around $62 million CAD (approximately $50 million USD). The buyout will likely boost the acquirer’s international presence and be accretive to its portfolio this year.

2006,LUV,"It was a week where billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, continued to show his affinity for airline stocks. In an interview to CNBC, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company, thereby displaying his recent interest in the space once again.Warren Buffett, the world’s third richest man, has stakes in airline heavyweights — Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) — since 2016, after having shunned the sector for years.On the earnings front, Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) performed well in the fourth quarter outperforming revenues and earnings estimates. Moreover, Southwest Airlines featured in the news when a dog reportedly bit a child on one of its flights. In fact, the incident gained prominence as many airlines are considering changes in their respective policies pertaining to carrying animals on flights.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Feb 21, 2018).Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnRecap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

Quarterly revenues also improved 12.4% on a year-over-year basis to $675.6 million and topped the consensus mark of $663.4 million.The year-over-year improvement in the top line was primarily owing to 12.6% growth in passenger revenues. While passenger unit revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) climbed 3.2%, yield per passenger mile inched up 1.2%. Additionally, unit revenue per available seat mile (RASM) improved 2.9%. This apart, operating cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, declined 6.7% in the reported quarter.Passenger traffic (on a consolidated basis) rose 11.3% and capacity was up 9.2% in the quarter under review.

However, the company has not yet found a suitable company to buy mainly due to valuation concerns. An airline company could foot the bill (airline stocks are inexpensive) and might be acquired by the iconic investor. This commentary of one of the most revered investors of all times positively impacted airline stocks.3. According to data released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines fared better in 2017, as far as safety related performance was concerned, compared with 2016. In fact, the all accident rate (accidents per 1 million flights) improved to 1.08 in 2017 from 1.68 a year ago. The comparable figure was 2.01 for the 2012-2016 period.Moreover, the rate for major jet accidents (jet hull losses per 1 million flights) came in at 0.11 in 2017, compared with the 2016 figure of 0.39. The figure also compared favorably with the 2012-2016 rate of 0.33. Additionally, in 2017, there were six fatal accidents (none involving a passenger jet) with 19 fatalities among passengers and crew.This reading, too, is favorable with the 2016 figures of nine fatal accidents and 202 fatalities. In the 2012-2016 period, there was an average of 10.8 fatal accidents and approximately 315 fatalities per year.4. The long-standing pay-related dispute between European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report), and its pilots shows no signs of ending. According to a Reuters report, the European Employee Representative Council — formed in 2016 by pilots of the Irish carrier — demanded the resignation of Ryanair ‘s CEO Michael O‘Leary.The unofficial pan-European body was of the opinion that O‘Leary had failed to tackle the issue effectively, resulting in many pilots quitting the company. Ryanair has, however, dismissed the demand.5. An unfortunate child-related occurred on a Southwest Airlines flight (Phoenix-to-Portland) when a dog bit the girl on the plane. Southwest started reviewing its policy pertaining to onboard service animals, even before the occurrence of incident. In fact, not only Southwest but other carriers like Delta have been in the news recently regarding the issue.Markedly, from Mar 1, 2018 the concerned passengers on Delta flights would need to furnish documents underlining the passenger's need for carrying the animal on the flight.

2008,LUV,"At its Annual General Meeting in Sydney, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) trimmed its forecast for airlines with respect to profitability for 2018. The research firm predicts that the global net profit for the industry to be $33.8 billion. This is much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, which was unveiled by the organization in December 2017.The world’s leading air transport group has attributed the downward revision of the current-year profitability view mainly to the rise in oil prices. Escalating oil prices apart, labor and interest costs have also weighed on the profitability forecast.The profitability forecast for the current year also compares unfavorably to what was achieved by airlines in 2017 ($38 billion).  Moreover, 2017’s profitability figure is much higher than the $34.5 billion that was projected in December.We note that the 2017 figure of $38 billion was a record for airline companies, boosted by one-time items. Due to this reason, IATA believes that the current-year profitability forecast is an impressive one despite being lower than the year-ago figure.2018 Forecast in DetailsPer IATA, bulk of the global net profits ($15 billion) is expected to come from the North American region, which boasts of carriers like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA  -  Free Report). The estimated figure is lower than $18.4 billion in 2017. The unfavorable comparison is again due to high costs.All the above-mentioned carriers, apart from Southwest, carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.European Airlines, which includes the likes of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report), are expected to be more profitable in 2018 ($8.6 billion) than the previous year ($8.1 billion). More extensive hedging by European carriers compared to their North American counterparts have made them less vulnerable to the rise in oil prices.Other regions, namely, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East are expected to generate post-tax net profit of $8.2 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. African carriers are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2018, suffering losses to the tune of $0.1 billion.Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. The top line is however projected to increase 10.7% to $834 billion. The top line is likely to be boosted by higher passenger as well as cargo revenues. Strong demand for air travel has contributed to the 10.8% year over year growth in passenger revenues.Even though, passenger air travel growth in 2018 (7%) is anticipated to be slower than the phenomenal 8.1% growth witnessed last year, it compares favorably to the 20-year average growth rate (5.5%).Capacity is projected to increase by 6.7% in 2018, flat year over year. According to the forecast, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) for 2016 is expected to expand 20 basis points to 81.7% due to capacity expansion being outweighed by traffic growth.Yield and unit costs are projected to increase by 3.8% and 5.8% respectively. Unit revenue growth for 2018 is projected at 4.2%. With unit costs anticipated to outpace unit revenue growth in the current year it is natural for profitability to be hampered.The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $7.80 per passenger in 2018 compared with $9.30 in 2017. The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27.5% to $70 per barrel this year.The expectation is also revised upward from $60 a barrel anticipated, while revealing its expectations in December 2017. Fuel bill is likely to account for 24.2% of total costs in 2018 (21.4% in 2017).High Fuel Costs Likely to See Uptick in AirfaresIn a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. They might pass on the increased costs to passengers to prevent profits from being dented.In fact, American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) CEO, Doug Parker, hinted recently in Sydney that air travel might become more expensive in the long-term in the event of oil prices remaining high.  Some market watchers believe that fuel surcharges may be added to tickets. Capacity growth would also probably be subdued in the era of rising prices.Disappointing Price PerformanceOil prices have been on an uptrend this year, thanks to various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The struggles of airline stocks chiefly due to surge in oil prices can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has shed 12.9% of its value so far this year, whereas the S&P 500 index has gained 2.2% in the same period.ConclusionWhat is worse is that oil prices are anticipated to increase further from the current level of around $65 a barrel, as envisioned by the IATA. With the organisation trimming airlines profitability forecast for the current year mainly due to the upsurge in oil prices, we expect the struggles for airline stocks to continue in the remainder of the year.This is likely to result in an uptick in airfares, as mentioned above. However, some market watchers believe that this phase of higher fuel costs might promote capacity discipline. This a boon for carriers as woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued airlines for quite some time.With so many possibilities in the cards, we expect investors to remain focused on updates from the space as sector participants look to devise ways to eliminate threats from rising oil prices.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2009,LUV,"Citing concerns of rising costs, the global airline association, The International Air Transport Association (IATA), has trimmed its profit cost for 2018.  Per IATA global airlines net income has decreased by 12% to $33.8 billion for 2018, led by factors such as an increase in interest rates, and higher labor and fuel costs.Though a buoyant U.S. economy and rising consumer confidence should boost passenger traffic volumes, other factors such as geopolitical risks, high taxes and strict regulations should be a dampener for the industry that has declined 13% year to date compared with the S&P 500’s growth of 2.3%.Decline in Profit ForecastThe current profit forecast of $33.8 billion translates into a year-over-year decline of 11%, from net income of $38 billion earned in 2017. The industry was a beneficiary of tax credit last year.These profit forecasts translate into thin margins of just 4.1% from sales expectation of $750 billion.Per the IATA director, 4% is not a big number given that the industry is fragile with limited capacity to absorb shocks.High Fuel CostAn increase in oil prices is playing spoilsport for the industry. Per a recent report by Reuters Saudi Arabia, other OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries, and non-OPEC allies led by Russia are likely to abide by a global pact on cutting oil supplies till the end of 2018. However, oil producers will make gradual adjustments in the event of any supply disturbances. News had also circulated that OPEC and Russia are planning to increase crude oil production by 1 million barrels a day to neutralize the effect of shortfall of oil production from Iran and Venezuela, pushing oil price down, for a short while. However, strong international demand for crude oil, tight global oil inventories and stabilization of oil production should boost oil price in the near term.IATA expects an average oil price of $70 a barrel this year, north of $54.90 last year and up from its previous prediction of $60.Increasing Labor CostLabor cost has persistently been on the rise due to lack of skilled workers and qualified pilots. Per IATA, in 2016, labor cost surpassed fuel cost (22% and 21% respectively, of costs). This was a reversal of the earlier trend, when fuel costs accounted for the maximum expense. In 2018, IATA expects labor cost to be 30.9% versus 20.9% for fuel of total cost.Going forward, it would be difficult to control labor cost. Suppliers and personnel are demanding an increase in payments due to strong profitability sustained by the industry in the past three years.Rise in Maintenance CostA recent report by Oliver Wyman stated that cost of maintenance may rise on increasing labor and fuel costs. Operators may face higher costs for maintenance as well, with both wages for aircraft technicians and prices of aircraft parts and replacements on the rise. Thus despite an increase in revenues from a higher number of fliers (passenger demand is expected to grow 7% this year on the back of stronger economic growth), the cost pressure should weigh on the bottom line. With demand staying in the positive zone, the real trick for airline companies will be to effectively manage their costs.Stocks to AvoidAfter several years of record profits the cycle seems to be peaking.

2010,LUV,"On May 31, we initiated coverage on Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (ODFL  -  Free Report). The trucking company primarily offers less-than-truckload (LTL) services on a regional, inter-regional and national basis.Upbeat Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, Old Dominion has performed well, handily outperforming its industry. While shares of the company have surged 76.2%, the industry rallied 41.9%. LTL Unit – A Key CatalystSolid growth at the company’s LTL unit led to its impressive price performance. In fact, LTL service revenues account for bulk of Old Dominion’s top line. Revenues at this segment are being aided by growth in LTL tons and yield.We expect the company’s LTL segment to perform well in the coming quarters as well, thereby driving growth at Old Dominion. Notably, LTL tons per day and LTL revenue per hundredweight improved 15.8% and 6.4%, respectively, in April 2018. With the domestic economy on solid footing, LTL revenues should continue increasing.The fact that this Thomasville, NC-based company is on a growth path is evident from its expected earnings per share growth rate (three to five years) that stands at an impressive 23.3%, which compares favorably with its industry’s 18.4% reading.Other PositivesThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are impressive. In February 2018, Old Dominion’s board of directors approved a 30% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 13 cents per share (or 52 cents annually). The company’s board also cleared a new buyback program recently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also raised dividend payouts lately.Furthermore, the new tax law is a boon to U.S.-based transportation companies like Old Dominion. The significant cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn, mighty aid the bottom line.Moreover, the provision allowing capital expenditures to be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred is also favorable for stocks like Old Dominion. This is because such companies invest significantly toward capital expenditures. Effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 reduced to 25.2% from 38.6% a year ago. The same is projected around 26.2% for the remaining quarters of 2018.The company’s Momentum Score of B further highlights its short-term attractiveness. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

2011,LUV,"Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is an important indicator of profitability and efficiency for airline companies. Higher load factor implies the company is more profitable. This is because a high load factor means that the heavy fixed costs of airlines can be spread across more passengers.Load Factors Deteriorate in AprilThis key metric declined in April for major US carriers, namely United Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) unit, Hawaiian Airlines. Fall in load factor indicates inefficient capacity utilization inducing vacant seats.Each of these stocks except Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Load factor at Alaska Air Group fell 230 basis points (bps) as capacity expansion (8.7%) outpaced traffic growth (5.8%). The same decreased 150 bps, 10 bps, 80 bps and 20 bps at Southwest Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines and Delta, respectively.Capacity over growth due to contraction in load factor often causes lower airfares, thereby eroding revenues and profitability of the airline companies. In fact, air fares in the United States decreased in April per data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Per the report, ticket prices reduced 2.7% on a month-to-month basis, registering the sharpest fall in four years.Apart from declining load factors, let’s have a look at the other headwinds plaguing the airlines.Fuel CostsFuel costs have been on the rise lately due to various reasons such as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices increased 5.6% in April. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from a nuclear deal with OPEC-member Iran has further spiked oil prices.Currently oil prices are hovering at around $71 a barrel. As expenses on fuel comprise a significant portion of airlines’ operating expenses, rise in the metric inflates costs, thereby limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, high fuel costs hurt American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) results substantially in the first quarter, resulting in the stock losing value post the earnings report, despite outperforming on the bottom-line front. Such exorbitant costs are expected to hamper results in the coming quarters as well. Moreover, the company trimmed its current-year earnings guidance mainly due to high fuel costs.Southwest Airlines' bottom line in the second quarter is also likely to be affected on the same ground. Economic fuel costs are projected at $2.20 per gallon, much higher than the year-ago figure. Also, at JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report), fuel cost is anticipated to be $2.23, way above $1.61 reported a year ago.Labor CostsWith labor deals very much in vogue in the airline space, such costs are also on an upswing. The airline employees claim that despite the airlines generating record profits, they lag in terms of employee remuneration. This has in turn propelled frequent new labor deals across the airline industry.Moreover, per International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast, labor cost will comprise the major portion of airline expense this year. Labor costs are predicted to account for 30.9% of total expenses in the year compared with 20.5% of fuel costs. Most recently, JetBlue reached an agreement in principle with its pilots. Final ratification of the agreement by the pilots is still pending. The airline currently estimates non-fuel unit costs between 2% and 4% in the second quarter. The measure is likely to go up following ratification of the new contract. Earlier in March, Spirit Airlines, Inc. ratified its five-year deal with pilots, pertaining to wage increase.In-Flight GlitchesThe airlines have also grabbed headlines of late due to several unpleasant cases on board. Southwest Airlines made maximum headlines in this regard. A tragic incident in April sparked large-scale dissatisfaction among customers with the carrier having made an emergency landing at the Philadelphia International Airport due to an engine failure, which resulted in a passenger’s death with seven others sustaining injuries.Southwest Airlines has been struggling with low bookings ever since this fatal incident. In fact, the carrier issued a bearish view on unit revenues for the second quarter, thanks to the same reason. It expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to decline between 1% and 3%. Similar occurrences took place this May as well. Earlier in the month, the carrier made an abrupt landing when one of its window panes broke.  Further adding to the woes, another Southwest Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing only a few days ago due to a pressurization issue, throwing the passengers in a tizzy.In April, a CBS News report titled ""60 Minutes"" leveled allegations against Allegiant Travel Company that the company is afflicted with a large number of mechanical problems. The report, aired on Apr 15, further stated that the poor safety standard was responsible for around 100 serious mechanical events in the January 2016-October 2017 time frame. The charges are being investigated.United Airlines also kicked up a controversy, resulting in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights in March.These untoward incidents have been dampening the airline companies’ reputation and certainly do not bode well for the sector participants.Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry fared poorly due to the headwinds, massively underperforming the broader market on a year-to-date basis. The S&P 500 index gained 2.1% against the industry’s decline of 12.9%. ConclusionDespite an air of prevalent pessimism revolving around airline stocks, we expect the companies to make a turnaround soon, buoyed by strong demand for air travel and rising air fares. With soaring oil prices, the carriers will most likely pass on the high-cost burden to passengers’ pockets. Notably, during first-quarter 2018 earnings release, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker warned of dearer ticket prices.Thriving U.S. economy augurs well for travel-focused stocks like airlines. With consumer confidence remaining strong, more and more Americans are resorting to vacations. Demand for air travel is expected to remain robust, courtesy of a much-enhanced job market and an increasing disposable income.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2012,LUV,"Shares of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) have declined 20.2% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decrease of 12.5%. Reasons Behind the PlungeSouthwest Airlines has been grappling with numerous challenges right from the onset of 2018. It all started with the winter storm Grayson in January, causing multiple flight cancellations and hurting the company’s top line. The destruction continued unabated with successive nor’easters striking in March, further dampening the situation. The storms resulted in huge revenue loss for the company.The adverse effects were partly witnessed in first-quarter results wherein the low-cost carrier reported lower-than-expected revenues. Also, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) slid in the period.Also, a tragic incident of April resulted in large-scale dissatisfaction among the customers as the carrier made an emergency landing at the Philadelphia International Airport due to an engine failure. Consequently, one of the passengers died while seven others were injured.Southwest Airlines has been struggling with low bookings ever since this fatal incident. In fact, the carrier provided a bearish view on unit revenues for the second quarter due to the same reason. It expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to decline between 1% and 3%. Also, last month’s traffic results were affected by the incident. Traffic slipped 0.3% while capacity expanded 1.5%. As traffic contracted and capacity increased, load factor deteriorated 150 basis points.What's worse is that the impact from the incident is likely to linger for quite some time and recovery of the lost revenues might be a slow process.Similar incidents have happened this May too. Earlier in the month, the carrier made an abrupt landing when one of its window panes broke.  Adding to its woes, another Southwest Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing a few days ago due to pressurization issue, causing massive panic among its passengers.The successive flight horrors will possibly add to the airline’s already low demand, thereby denting profitability and revenues.Another issue having engulfed the entire airline industry of late is the rising fuel costs. The high fuel costs are anticipated to hurt Southwest Airlines' bottom line in the second quarter. Notably, economic fuel costs are projected at $2.20 per gallon, much higher than the year-ago figure.Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report). While GATX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Expeditors and SkyWest sport a Zacks Rank #1.Shares of GATX, Expeditors and SkyWest have gained more than 15%, 11% and 4%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2013,LUV,"Although fuel costs have been increasing, air fares in the United States declined in April according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Per the report, ticket prices decreased 2.7% on a month-on-month basis, making it the sharpest fall in four years.Moreover, in April, average air fares (unadjusted) fell 6.9% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the April reading comes after two successive months of increase in airfares. Even though, low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies.Excessive Competition Pressurize Air FaresThe decline in airfares has been attributed to the intense competition in key markets. In fact, the low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), had cited the competitive fare scenario as a reason for its disappointing first-quarter unit revenues.Moreover, the significant growth of low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines has not gone unnoticed by legacy carriers including American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report). Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. In a bid to combat the threat of low-cost carriers and attract budget-conscious travelers, both the above-mentioned legacy carriers have been selling cheaper tickets (Basic Economy Fares) for quite some time. In a price-conscious economy, it is not just the survival of the fittest, but of the cheapest. Keeping this in mind, big airline players are now looking to attract budget-friendly travelers.Capacity OverexpansionCapacity overexpansion may lead to oversupply in the market and is one of the significant factors behind suppressed air fares. Fears that airline capacity would grow at a rate higher than the U.S. GDP, thereby resulting in an oversupplied market, have been one of the main challenges in the airline space.Moreover, the April traffic reports of most carriers, including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines, United Continental and Hawaiian Airlines, the subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), have revealed that capacity expanded at a higher pace than traffic. Consequently, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined in the month at the above-mentioned carriers.Airfares to Increase in Future?Despite the significant decline in April airfares, we expect ticket prices to go up in the coming months. The obvious reason is the upsurge in expenses on fuel. Oil prices had increased 5.6% in April. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from a nuclear deal with OPEC-member Iran has further boosted oil prices.Currently, oil prices are hovering at around $71 a barrel. It is a well-documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices. This is because fuel costs represent one of the most significant expenses for carriers. Evidently, the rise in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of carriers, thus limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, the first-quarter earnings season, which is over for airlines, witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs. Notably, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period.In a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. Also, American Airlines’ CEO, Doug Parker, has hinted at higher ticket prices. ConclusionGiven the present scenario related to the increase in one of the largest input costs of airlines, we believe that the drop in April ticket prices is an isolated event. In the coming months, air travel in the country is expected to get more expensive as airlines look to pass on the increased costs to consumers, so that their profits are not dented.Whatever be the actual outcome, we anticipate investor focus to remain on this burning issue of air ticket prices, going forward.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2014,LUV,"With the Q1 earnings season at the tail end, April traffic reports from airlines dominated headlines over the past five trading days. Evidently, key airline players like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) unveiled their respective traffic reports during the week.While Latin American carrier GOL Linhas reported an increase in load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion, this key metric declined at its U.S. counterparts — Delta, United Continental and Southwest — due to capacity overexpansion.Another downside over the past five trading days was the decline in the stock price of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines. Shares of the company declined on fears of intensifying competition in Hawaii as Southwest Airlines unveiled a detailed plan to offer flights connecting Hawaii and California. Subsequently, the Dallas-based carrier intends to offer inter-island flights, which will be a bigger blow to Hawaiian Airlines.American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) also dominated headlines by virtue of its decision to discontinue flights connecting Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and Beijing, from October this year.  Lack of profitability on the route led to the carrier’s decision.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for May 2, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 18.26 billion, up 3.7% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 4% to 21.45 billion on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance (mainline) of 86.4% and completion factor (mainline) of 99.7% for April. Approximately, 15.9 million passengers flew on Delta during the period (Read more: Delta's April Traffic Increases, Load Factor Down).2. April traffic growth (5.1%) was outpaced by capacity expansion (6.1%) at United Airlines as well. Consequently, load factor declined 80 basis points to 82.3%. The company posted an on-time performance of 73% and a completion factor of 99.8% for the month.3. American Airlines introduced several other routes, apart from deciding to terminate its Chicago-Beijing service. In a customer-friendly move, the company announced the launch of multiple new flights (seasonal as well as year-round) to the Caribbean and Hawaii. For example, the carrier intends to start seasonal service from Chicago to Honolulu, which will run through the annual spring break season (Read more: American Airlines to Pull the Plug on Chicago-Beijing Service).American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, passenger count increased 6.3% at the carrier in April. Passenger count of this Honolulu County, HI-based carrier may decline drastically in the event of Southwest Airlines entering Hawaii. 5. At GOL Linhas, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), nudged up 1.9% to 2.76 billion. The metric rose 3% on the domestic front, while the international figure declined 7.2%.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) inched up 0.8% to 3.46 billion, primarily on the back of 1.3% growth in domestic capacity. The carrier further witnessed 3.5% increase in passenger count in April (Read more: Gol Linhas' Traffic & Load Factor Increase in April).6. Southwest Airlines has been going through tough times lately. Late last month, the carrier gave a lackluster outlook for the second quarter due to weakness pertaining to bookings following a mid-air tragedy in one of its flights. Continuing the dismal trend, one of its flights was diverted during the week owing to a broken window.Moreover, the carrier reported dismal traffic numbers for April. As expected, traffic for the month declined but capacity expanded. Consequently, load factor declined to the tune of 150 basis to 82.5% in the month.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-10.1%11.4%UAL-0.3%15.9%GOL-7.8%11.6%DAL0.02%6.5%JBLU-0.5%2.2%AAL1.8%-6.1%SAVE2.9%5.2%LUV0.2%-2.1%CPA-1.3%-6.5%ALK-2.8%-1.3%                  The table above shows that majority of the airline stocks traded in the red over the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declining 1.7% in the period.

2015,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) reported disappointing traffic results for April. Traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles or RPMs) slipped 0.3% to around 11.2 billion while capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) inched up 1.5% to 13.57 billion. The decline in traffic is due to softness in bookings following the fatal engine failure last month.Also, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) deteriorated 150 basis points (bps) to 82.5% in the month as capacity expanded while traffic contracted. However, passenger count grew 2.4% to 13.78 billion.In the first four months of the year, Southwest Airlines witnessed a 2.6% rise in RPMs to 41.64 billion.

2017,LUV,"Oil prices have been on an uptrend this year, thanks to various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In fact, oil prices have climbed more than 17% on a year-to-date basis. In line with the upsurge, oil prices jumped above $70 a barrel on May 4 due to concerns pertaining to the economic crisis in Venezuela— a major oil exporter— and the possibility of fresh sanctions on Iran by the United States. This marks a phenomenal turnaround for the commodity, which was trading at around $30 a barrel in 2016. Airlines: Feeling the HeatIt is a well-documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices. This is because fuel costs represent one of the most significant expenses for carriers. Evidently, the rise in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of carriers, thus limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, the first-quarter earnings season, which is almost over for airlines, witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs. Notably, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period.The gloomy picture for airlines in this respect can be gauged from the fact that shares of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) declined after the companies unveiled their respective first-quarter earnings results late last month. This was despite the carriers reporting better-than-expected earnings. High fuel costs were primarily responsible for the stocks shedding value. While average fuel price (consolidated and inclusive of taxes) increased 23.6% year over year at American Airlines, the metric surged 21.5% at Spirit Airlines.Moreover, American Airlines trimmed its current-year earnings projection mainly on high fuel costs. The likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) also saw their respective bottom line contract on a year-over-year basis mainly due to high fuel costs.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Disappointing Price PerformanceThe struggles of airline stocks chiefly due to surge in oil prices can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has shed 10.8% of its value so far this year. Oil Price Surge Likely to Hurt in Q2  The upsurge in oil prices due to the above-mentioned reasons is likely to limit bottom-line growth for airlines in the second quarter as well. This is evident from the forecasts of various carriers on fuel costs for the current quarter.For the second quarter, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) expects average fuel price per gallon (on a consolidated basis) between $2.18 and $2.23, which is higher than the first-quarter figure of $2.11. At Delta, the same is expected between $2.07 and $2.12 in the second quarter, higher than the first-quarter figure of $2.01.American Airlines too expects to incur a higher amount in the second quarter on consolidated jet fuel (inclusive of taxes) compared with the first-quarter figure of $2.10 per gallon. Other carriers like JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also expect to incur significantly higher costs on fuel in the second quarter of 2018.Will Air Travel Become More Expensive?In a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. They might pass on the increased costs to passengers to prevent profits from being dented. In fact, American Airlines’ CEO, Doug Parker, too has hinted at higher ticket prices. Some market watchers believe that fuel surcharges may be added to tickets.Already, Spirit Airlines has increased ticket prices (one-way) to the tune of $3. Also, other carriers are anticipated to follow suite.According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average airfares (adjusted) in the United States have already increased in two successive months this year — February and March. With fuel costs eating into the profits of airlines, fares are anticipated to increase further in the current year.However, according to Parker, even if air fares rise, they will not hurt the strong demand for air travel. An improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been the factors supporting the strong demand in the space. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.This optimism can be gauged from American Airlines' bullish second-quarter outlook on total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues), despite fuel cost woes. TRASM is anticipated to increase in the band of 1.5-3.5%. Moreover, according to some market watchers this phase of higher fuel costs might promote capacity discipline. This a boon for carriers as woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued airlines for quite some time.With so many possibilities in the cards, we expect investors to remain focused on updates from the space as sector participants look to devise ways to eliminate threats from rising oil prices.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2018,LUV,"The Sage of Omaha published his annual letter on Feb 24. He remained bullish on U.S. stocks over the long term. After all, stocks have performed better than bonds in the long run. Inflationary pressure is also brewing looming concern. This will affect bonds more than stocks because of their lower returns.Corporate America, in the meantime, has received a massive permanent tax break, which will further boost profits. Changes to the tax law has already provided the much-needed windfall to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK-B, whose market value rose 21.9% in 2017, edging past the S&P 500’s return of 21.8%.Given the positives, investing in Berkshire’s largest stock holdings seems judicious. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time.Buffett’s Annual Letter to Shareholders: Stay Invested in StocksWorld’s third richest man, Warren Buffett, urged investors to ignore gyrations in the equity market, guidance from market pundits with fancy credentials and resist the temptation to scoop up bonds. He added that investors with long-term goals like pension funds and savings-minded individuals will make a “terrible mistake” if they measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks.As the investor’s investment horizon increases a diversified portfolio of equities do better than bonds. Lest we forget, the S&P 500 that mirrors a huge cross-section of American businesses has returned an average of 10% per year, while long-term government bonds have returned 5% to 6%.Treasury Yields RiseTreasury yields are scaling record highs after a significant rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Federal Reserve will hike rates more times than anticipated.The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Several states have also raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Rise in bond yields, in the meantime, might tempt investors to take money away from equities and invest in bonds. But, Buffett cautioned that long-term bonds tend to generate less return than stocks and with rising inflation, bonds can really become a dumb investment. Needless to say, rising inflation erodes the value of the principal on fixed income securities.Buffet Thanks New Tax Code for Big GainsBuffett told investors that Berkshire got a lift from the new tax code. He wrote that Berkshire made a $65.3 billion net gain in 2017, which increased the per-share book value of both Class A and Class B stock by 23%. However, only $36 billion came from the company’s operations. The rest came from the new U.S. tax code, which slashed corporate taxes and in turn boosted profit margins.The House of Representatives passed the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while any income brought back from overseas is taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).5 of Berkshire’s Largest Stock Holdings to Buy NowAs mentioned above, business magnate Warren Buffet prefers investing in stocks rather than bonds. And why not? Berkshire has registered big gains last year with its stock holdings totaling a solid $170.5 billion in value. Thus, investing in Berkshire's largest stock positions won’t be a bad proposition.The table shows Berkshire’s 15 largest stock holdings.CompanyMarket Value of Position ($ Million)Wells Fargo$29,276Apple$28,213Bank of America$20,664Coca-Cola$18,352American Express$15,056Philips 66$7,545U.S. Bancorp$5,565Moody's$3,642Southwest Airlines$3,119Delta Air Lines$2,974Goldman Sachs$2,902Bank of New York Mellon$2,871Charter Communications$2,281BYD Company$1,961General Motors$1,825(Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2017 Annual Letter)We have selected five sound stocks from the table that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2019,LUV,"With the Q4 earnings season at the tail end, January traffic reports for airline companies have been dominating the headlines over the past five trading days. In fact, key airline players like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) and GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) unveiled their respective traffic reports for the first month of 2018.Although the reports of the likes of Southwest, GOL Linhas and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) were impressive with load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) increasing on traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, JetBlue and United Continental disappointed as traffic declined while capacity expanded.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index was up 1.2% to $115.48 over the past five trading days. Notably, it was the direction taken by the broader market which governed the sector tracker rather than any specific development in the airline space. Also, the U.S. equity market seems to have rebounded over the past few days, after both the Dow and the S&P 500 slipped into correction territory on Feb 8.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Feb 7, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. At GOL Linhas, consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) — increased 5.2% to 4.15 billion in January. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) rose 4.9% to 4.92 billion primarily owing to the expansion of 2.3% and 27.5% in domestic and international capacity, respectively. Load factor improved to 83.5% from 83.2% a year ago as traffic expansion exceeded capacity growth (Read more: GOL Linhas  Reports Robust January Traffic Figures).GOL carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Meanwhile, capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) inched up 1.9% to 12.5 billion. Load factor increased 150 basis points to 77.8% in the month as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. Additionally, passenger count was up 6% to 11.99 billion (Read more: Southwest Airlines Posts Impressive January Traffic Figures).In an employee friendly move, Southwest announced that it will pay $543 million to its employees as part of its 2017 profit sharing plan. This (the 44th consecutive profit sharing arrangement) is in addition to the bonus of $1,000 (to each eligible employee) declared last month, following the introduction of the new tax law. The 2017 payment, to be made on Mar 15, equates to approximately 11.3% of each employee’s earnings in the year.3. Allegiant’s traffic for the total system, including scheduled service and fixed fee contract, increased 9.3% to 877.42 million on a year-over-year basis. System capacity improved 6.1% to 1.1 billion as well. While Allegiant’s passenger count gained 8.7% in January, its system-wide average fuel cost per gallon was approximately $2.23 in the same month (Read more: Allegiant Reports Impressive January Traffic Statistics).4. United Continental reported unimpressive traffic numbers for January, with load factor declining owing to capacity overexpansion. Traffic was 16.33 billion, up 1.8% from the year-ago figure. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity also gained 3.3% to 20.62 billion. However, load factor declined 120 basis points to 79.2%.

Moreover, JetBlue’s completion factor was 94.1% with 65.8% flights on schedule.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, primarily due to softness exhibited by the broader market. Shares of Spirt Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) depreciated the most (3.3%) in the period. On the other hand, shares of Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) gained the most (3.7%) in the period.Over the course of six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline index appreciated 6.5%.

2020,LUV,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) has recently reported traffic numbers for January. Traffic for the total system including scheduled service and fixed fee contract, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 9.3% on a year-over-year basis to 877.42 million. System capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), improved 6.1% to 1.1 billion.With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) rose 240 basis points year over year to 79.9%.Allegiant’s passenger count gained 8.7% in January while its system-wide average fuel cost per gallon was approximately $2.23 in the month.Allegiant Travel Company Price  Allegiant Travel Company Price | Allegiant Travel Company Quote The robust traffic results were released just a few days after the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers with better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. Moreover, both the metrics improved substantially from the year-ago figures. The bottom line was aided by higher revenues while the top line was boosted, primarily by a significant increase in ancillary revenues.For the first quarter of 2018, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company expects average seat miles (scheduled and system) to rise year over year in the 10-14% band. Additionally, it anticipates ASMs (scheduled and system) to grow in the range of 11-15% year over year for the current year.

2021,LUV,"Shares of CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $65.93 on May 30, before retracing a bit to close the session at $65.64. The day’s closing price reflected an improvement of 2.6% over May 29’s close.We note that this S&P 500 member’s impressive performance was not limited to May 30. Notably, the company has performed impressively in a year, gaining 20.3% compared with the S&P 500 Index’s 11.9% rally. Let's delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the impressive price performance.CSX is benefiting from the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, which was implemented by the company’s former CEO — E. Hunter Harrison — who expired in December 2017. The system, designed to improve its operational efficiency, is being backed by CSX’s current CEO Jim Foote. The implementation of the above system resulted in CSX generating efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017. Strong performance of its intermodal segment is also a positive for the stock.Furthermore, improvement in operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) was in tune with the company’s cost control efforts. To this end, the company’s adjusted operating ratio improved 570 basis points in the first quarter. CSX expects to achieve an operating ratio of 60% by 2020.In fact, the lesser the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available with the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks. In February 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced a 10% dividend hike to 22 cents per share.CSX, which bought back shares worth more than $2 billion in 2017, increased the existing share repurchase program to $5 billion. The $5-billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We believe the new tax law is a blessing for Transportation companies like CSX. This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also raised dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law.Other Favorable MeasuresCSX’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Not only has the company’s ROE of 18% gradually increased in a year’s time, it also compares favorably with the ROE of 16.6% for the S&P 500 Index.The company’s Momentum Score of A further highlights its short-term attractiveness. Moreover, CSX’s expected earnings per share growth rate (three to five years) of 13.3% compares favorably with its industry’s 10.6% reading.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Southwest is now sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Next, the hosts recapped the recent earnings announcements of Tesla and Apple.

2023,LUV,"Shares of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, declined 6.5% on May 3 to $38.25 due to fears of intensifying competition in Hawaii as Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) unveiled a detailed plan to offer flights connecting Hawaii and California. Subsequently, Southwest Airlines intends to offer inter-island flights. These flights will be offered by Southwest at much lower prices than those currently operated by Hawaiian Airlines.As Hawaiian Holdings derives a bulk of its revenues from inter-island flights, it is natural that the stock price of this Honolulu County, HI based company was hurt significantly by fears of a decline in the company’s market share.Plan in DetailSouthwest had initially announced its plans last year to fly to Hawaii. The Dallas-based low-cost carrier provided more details on May 3. The carrier said that it will at first offer non-stop flights connecting Hawaii to four California cities — San Jose, San Diego, Sacramento and Oakland. The service will commence following authorization by the Federal Aviation Administration. Tickets are expected to be sold later this year.Southwest intends to initially operate flights connecting Chicago to the following airports in the island — Honolulu, Lihue Airport, Kona International Airport and Kahului Airport. The inter-island flights will take to the skies after the Chicago-Hawaii operations “ramp up.”  Apart from Southwest, American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) had recently stated that it intends to offer flights connecting Chicago and Honolulu in winter. American Airlines’ entry into Hawaii, a popular tourist destination, is likely to intensify competition for Hawaiian Holdings. No wonder, the stock is feeling the heat.Investors would keenly await further updates on this burning issue.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderHawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Southwest is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.

2024,LUV,"Airlines companies reported Q1 earnings in the last 20 days, which came in mixed. The pure-play aviation ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) did not show any improvement in this time frame. Let’s take a look at some of the key first-quarter 2018 earnings results in the industry and see if the fund can attain altitude ahead.Q1 Results in DetailOn Apr 12, Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the first-quarter earnings season in the airline space, with in-line earnings and a top-line beat. Its first-quarter 2018, earnings per share (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 74 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Earnings however decreased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. Operating revenues of $9,968 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,881.2 million. Also, it compared favorably with the year-ago number of $9,148 million.In mid-April, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2018. The company’s earnings (excluding 2 cents from non-recurring items) of 50 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. Moreover, the bottom line climbed 25% year over year owing to higher revenues. Operating revenues of $9,032 million in the first quarter also came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,012.5 million and increased 7.3% year over year. Strong demand for air travel boosted revenues.Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 75 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Operating revenues of $4,944 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,017.6 million. However, the company’s Q2 guidance was bleak.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 36 cents from non-recurring items) of 75 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Quarterly earnings increased approximately 23% on a year-over-year basis despite higher costs. Revenues of $10,401 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,411.9 million. Strong demand for air travel led to the year-over-year improvement in the top line.Low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corporation’s (JBLU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 27 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents. The bottom line also increased 8% year over year backed by higher passenger revenues. However, total operating revenues of $1,754 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,757.6 million. Nevertheless, the top line increased more than 9% from the year-ago figure.Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 11 cents from non-recurring items) of 14 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. However, the bottom line declined 86.7% on a year-over-year basis due to high costs. Revenues came in at $1,832 million, marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,830.6 million. The top line improved 5% year over year.Should You Buy JETS on the Dip?By now, one must have understood from the beat ratios that the fundamentals are mixed. Oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. If oil prices manage to see an uptrend in the coming days on the extension of the OPEC output curb deal, airlines may suffer on profit margins. Rising geopolitical risks related to trade war and chaos in Middle East are the other threats (read: Top Performing Energy ETFs of 2018).Nevertheless, investors having a strong stomach for oil-related risks, faith in the compelling valuation of airline stocks and seeking to play the sector on the expected benefit of the tax reform and “pricing discipline (per Bernstein)”, may target it in the ETF form. Below we highlight the fund in detail:JETS in FocusThe $99.3 million-fund holds more than 33 securities in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities. United Continental (12.54%), Delta Airlines (12.00%), Southwest Airlines (11.53%) and American Airlines (10.51%) are the top four elements in the basket. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue hold the sixth and ninth positions in the fund with 4.38% and 3.97% weights, respectively. The product charges 60 bps in fees. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook (see all industrials ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2026,LUV,"Airline stocks have been laid low this year, mainly due to concerns about rising fuel costs. However, this headwind was put on the back burner last Friday as oil prices declined, resulting in airlines experiencing a field day.It is a well-documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices. This is because fuel costs denote one of the most significant expenses for carriers. Consequently, the fall in oil prices leads to a significant decrease in the airlines’ operating expenses, thereby aiding the stocks’ bottom-line growth.On May 25, oil prices decreased significantly to around $67.88 per barrel following reports that OPEC and Russia were discussing an increase in oil production.  In fact, oil prices had been on the downside over the past four days, thanks to the above issue.Airlines Lead Dow Transports' Rally on FridayThe Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the May 25 trading session at 10,900.06, up 0.4%.  The index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies apart from airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be deemed the true representative of U.S. transportation division.The Dow Jones Transportation Average Index includes six airline stocks, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report)     and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report).The fact that airlines heaved a sigh of relief on May 25 is evident from the index’s top six gainers being airline stocks with shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Alaska Air Group registering the maximum rise of 3.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The above impressive performance resulted in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 2.3% to close Friday’s trading session at $108.81. Additionally, the 34-member U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report), which provide exposure to the global airline industry, grew nearly 2% on May 25, ending the day at $31.19. Oil Price Plunge Follows A4A’s Bullish Summer Travel Projection  The drop in one of the largest input costs for airlines could not have come at a better time for sector participants. This is because the summer travel season is round the corner and marks the busiest time for airlines.According to Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — the largest airline trade association in the United States — the upcoming summer season (Jun 1-Aug 31) is expected to be the most hectic period for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel. Per the forecast, approximately 246.1 million passengers (2.68 million flyers daily) will be transported by U.S. airlines this summer, up 3.7% year over year.In fact, to meet the surge in travel demand, the U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 116,000 each day. Also, with the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations. Moreover, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have added an incentive for consumers to opt for air travel.Driven by the above tailwinds, the three-month phase is likely to see 96,000 additional passengers taking to the skies each day on various U.S. carriers.With the upbeat guidance already in place, the waning oil prices provide further good news to airlines. No wonder, airline stocks concluded the previous week on a high.Valuation Signals More UpsideThe attractive valuation for the Zacks Airline industry suggests that the rally on May 25 is not a one-off phenomenon and that stocks in the space remain attractive investment bets. Going by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio —often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.3 (near the lowest point of 5.8 in a year’s time), comparing favorably with the market at large as the current EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 11.3. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly hints at more upside.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2039,LUV,"The past week, which included a holiday in the form of Presidents' Day, saw the release of data on airfare for January by the Bureau of Transportation Services. Airfares declined in the month, marking the third consecutive month of a drop in ticket prices.Even though, the low air fares are encouraging for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies. Capacity overexpansion by some carriers in key markets leading to intense competition may have resulted in the decline of airfares.On the traffic front, Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) unveiled their respective traffic numbers for January.

2040,LUV,"Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) announced on Valentine’s Day that the company is set to pay out more than $1 billion in profit sharing to its employees as part of its continued program to spread the wealth. Other U.S. airline firms also joined the party, and at the moment, this trend seems to be a sign of strength and stability in the industry.The Atlanta-based airline company noted that this is the fourth straight year it will share over $1 billion with its employees. Delta boasted that its profit sharing program goes far beyond the recent wave of one-time payments that companies such as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and AT&T (T  -  Free Report) made after the new Republican tax reforms were enacted. The airline also noted that its total annual compensation has increased by 80% since 2008.“Our industry-leading profit sharing and compensation philosophy reflects a decision we made a long time ago to share in the company’s success each year with our people who make it possible,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement. “Rather than make a one-off payment like other companies, Delta is invested in highly competitive base pay, an industry-leading annual profit sharing plan, and monthly bonuses each year when the airline performs well.”Delta might be leading the charge to distribute profits across the company, but it is certainly not alone. With that said, let’s take a look at three U.S. airline powers, including Delta, that have been able to share the wealth while maintaining a strong outlook. 1.       Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report)Prior to yesterday’s announcement, Delta employees received $1.1 billion in 2015; $1.5 billion in 2016, which the company cited as the largest corporate profit sharing payout in U.S. history; and another $1.1 billion in 2017. Amid this current tight labor market, Delta’s employee compensation plan could go a long way to securing a strong workforce. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “B” VGM score, which is supported by its “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Investors should note that we have witnessed 10 upward earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside for the company’s fiscal 2018. Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Delta is projected to see its earnings soar by nearly 29% in its current fiscal year. Amid this effort to share the wealth, Delta is also projected to expand its bottom-line at a healthy annualized rate of 11.60% over the next three to five years.2.       Southwest Airlines Company (LUV  -  Free Report)In January, Southwest joined the list of companies that awarded employees bonuses of $1,000. On top of that, the Dallas-based airline announced last week that it would share $543 million through its profit sharing plan, which the company noted is equivalent to more than five weeks of pay. Southwest is currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM grade.The low-cost airline giant also looks poised to continue to expand its bottom line, despite its commitments to spend more money on its employees. Our consensus estimate is moving higher on the back of strong analyst revision agreement for the current fiscal year. Southwest is expected to see its earnings surge 32.79% in the current quarter and 42.86% in 2018. Looking further down the road, Southwest is projected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 11.22% over the next three to five years.3.       American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report)This U.S. airline giant is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Momentum. Like Southwest, American announced that it would pay out $1,000 bonuses to employees, which the company said would cost $130 million. American will also reportedly shell out another $241 million to its employees as part of a profit sharing program.It does not appear that the company’s recent wave of profit sharing will hurt American’s bottom line. The airline firm is expected to see its earnings per share hit $5.80 in 2018, which would mark a nearly 19% increase.

The company announced 44 new domestic routes from seven of its mainland hubs and increased frequency on 11 routes to the Hawaiian Islands. Additionally, the carrier announced 13 new global routes last year.During the same period, the airline took delivery of 19 Boeing aircrafts, including 12 777-300ER, three 787-9 and four 737-800. Also, eight used Airbus aircrafts including two A320 and six A319 were purchased by the company.The carrier has also announced an agreement with Airbus for changes in its A350 order. The contract calls for conversion of the model type from A350-1000 to A350-900, an increase in the order size from 35 to 45 aircrafts and a postponement of the first delivery to 2022. On another agreement announced with Boeing, the company wishes to convert 100 of its existing 737 MAX orders into 737 MAX 10 aircrafts, beginning late 2020.Q118 GuidanceFor the first quarter of 2018, the carrier anticipates capacity to expand between 3.5% and 4.5%.

Consequently, shares of the company were down 6.4% in after-hours trading on Jan 23.Notably, the airline’s move seems prudent as it aims to compete with low-cost carriers. However, it remains to be seen how the low fares affect the company’s bottom line going forward. The move also led to share price decline of other airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) in after market.Additionally, the company expects 2018 earnings per share between $6.50 and $8.50, while capex is anticipated in the range of $3.6 billion-$3.8 billion.Benefits of the Tax ReformThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, put into effect on Dec 22, 2017, is expected to reduce the company’s federal income tax liability this year onward. Notably, the new tax law lowers corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. For 2018, the company projects a tax rate of around 22-24%. Net operating loss carry forwards are anticipated to offset the company’s taxable income and no cash taxes are likely to be paid in 2018.Upcoming ReleaseInvestors interested in the airline space now keenly await fourth-quarter earnings report of Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), scheduled to be out on Jan 25.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2044,LUV,"Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 earnings numbers on Jan 29, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. Also, it has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average of 6.6%.However, the company’s results may suffer in the fourth quarter due to high costs. Let's have a detailed look at the factors likely to influence Hawaiian Holdings’s fourth-quarter result.Unit costs, excluding fuel, are projected to rise significantly in the soon-to-be reported quarter primarily owing to higher labor costs. This, in turn, is likely to hurt the company’s bottom line. Hawaiian Holdings anticipates cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel and special items, for the fourth quarter to be up 6-7%, higher than the prior prediction of a 3.5-6.5% upsurge. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter CASM (ex-fuel) is pegged at $9.60, much higher than $8.80 in the preceding quarter.Also, rising fuel costs are likely to hurt the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fuel cost per gallon stands at $1.80, much higher than the year-ago figure of $1.55. The carrier expects gallons of jet fuel consumed to increase by 7.5-8.5% for the quarter to be reported, up from 5-8% rise forecasted earlier. The revision can be attributed to higher-than-expected payloads.However, the carrier’s performance with respect to unit revenues is encouraging. The metric is expected to register substantial year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is pegged at 12.23 cents, higher than 12.13 cents in the year-ago quarter.Moreover, on the fourth-quarter conference call, we expect a commentary on Southwest Airlines’ (LUV  -  Free Report) decision to start flights to Hawaii. This is because Southwest’s entry will intensify competition for Hawaiian Holdings. Since growth is supported by strong demand for air travel to Hawaii, its stock price might be hurt significantly owing to decline in the company’s market share. What Does our Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hawaiian Holdings is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below. Zacks ESP: Hawaiian Holdings has an Earnings ESP of -0.63% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.09, marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Hawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, a negative Earnings ESP in this case leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) as they possess the right combination of elements to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017.Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +0.47% with a favorable Zacks Rank #1.

2045,LUV,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Southwest Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 22.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Southwest Airlines’ current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 17.1) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Southwest Airlines has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Southwest Airlines’ stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Southwest Airlines has a P/S ratio of about 1.9. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, Southwest Airlines is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Southwest Airlines currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LUV a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Southwest Airlines is just 1.4, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, LUV is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Southwest Airlines might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives LUV a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen nine estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full-year 2017 estimate has seen eight downward and one upward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 9.5% in the past two months, while the full-year 2017 estimate has declined 1.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Southwest Airlines Company Price and Consensus  Southwest Airlines Company Price and Consensus | Southwest Airlines Company QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineSouthwest Airlines is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 37% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2046,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 75 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line however, surged on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenues of $4,944 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,017.6 million. However, the top line improved year over year and was boosted by high passenger revenues accounting for bulk (92.7%) of the same.Operating StatisticsAirline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, nudged up 3.7% year over year to 30.44 billion in the quarter under review. Capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) inched up 1.8% to 37.37 billion. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) came in at 81.5%, up 160 basis points on a year-over-year basis as traffic growth exceeded capacity expansion.Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) slid 1% to 12.27 cents. In the reported quarter, revenue per available seat mile (RASM) was flat year over year at 13.23 cents.Southwest Airlines Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Southwest Airlines Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Southwest Airlines Co. QuoteOperating Expenses & IncomeIn the first quarter, operating income (as reported) came in at $616 million compared with $606 million in the prior-year quarter.

As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had a long-term debt (less current maturities) of $3,227 million compared with $3,320 million at 2017end.While the carrier generated a cash flow of $708 million at the end of the first quarter, it returned $648 million to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Q2 & 2018 GuidanceFor the second quarter of 2018, the carrier expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline between 1% and 3%. This dismal outlook is due to softness in bookings following the recent fatal incident at the carrier.Second-quarter unit costs excluding fuel and oil expense and profit-sharing expense are estimated to increase 1-2%. While economic fuel costs are projected at $2.20 per gallon.For 2018, the metric is anticipated to be flat compared with the 2017 figure. Previously, the metric was forecast to rise 2% year over year.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSouthwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.

2047,LUV,"As if the heart of Q1 earnings season wasn’t informative enough, before Thursday’s opening bell we also see economic headline reads hitting the doorstep — in bulk. Durable Goods Orders, Core Capital Equipment, Advanced Trade in Goods and, of course, weekly Initial Jobless Claims numbers are all out right now, and we await impact of these figures on regular-day trading today.Jobless Claims once again ratcheted down far below our years-long range between 225K-250K, which itself is indicative of a robust domestic labor market. But this morning’s 209K is the lowest read we’ve seen since 1969, the year Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon. This marks a precipitous drop of 24K claims from the slightly revised 233K the previous week.Continuing claims also recede to historic lows, last week reaching 1.837 million from the previous read of 1.866 million, also a very low number. In fact, we haven’t seen continuing claims get anywhere near 2 million for a week since last summer’s dual hurricanes hit the mainland. U.S. employment continues to amaze and astound.Durable Goods came in a tick higher than expected at 2.6% for March, from a strong upward revision from 3.0% to 3.5% for February. However, strip out Transportation costs and that March number plummets to 0%, with non-defense, ex-aircraft actually going negative to -0.1%. Core Capital Equipment Orders sank from a healthy 1.4% in February to 0.9% in March, with the shipments vs. orders ratio at -0.7%. So it would appear new airplane orders had completely covered this economic metric last month.The U.S. Trade Balance surprised to the upside in March to -$68 billion, lower than the -$73.4 billion analysts had been expecting and a revised -$75.9 billion in February. This is relative good news — certainly better than we’d seen earlier in the year — although it’s tough to get excited about a deficit of $68 billion.After the closing bell today, we expect quarterly earnings results from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), among others. But ahead of today’s open, there is such a huge amount of earnings reports hitting the tape that we’re going to keep it to just a few of the Zacks Rank Buy and Sell stocks this morning:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by a penny to $1.86 per share, on quarterly revenues that narrowly missed our $1.12 billion Zacks consensus. Revenues were still up 19% year over year, and the company booked an all-time record 22.2 million orders in the quarter. For more on CME’s earnings, click here.Chicagoland MedTech major Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #2 stock, beat on the bottom line by nearly 13% to 70 cents per share, on $2.68 billion in revenues that surpassed the $2.62 billion expected.

2048,LUV,"Thursday, April 26, 2018As if the heart of Q1 earnings season wasn’t informative enough, before Thursday’s opening bell we also see economic headline reads hitting the doorstep — in bulk. Durable Goods Orders, Core Capital Equipment, Advanced Trade in Goods and, of course, weekly Initial Jobless Claims numbers are all out right now, and we await impact of these figures on regular-day trading today.Jobless Claims once again ratcheted down far below our years-long range between 225K-250K, which itself is indicative of a robust domestic labor market. But this morning’s 209K is the lowest read we’ve seen since 1969, the year Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon. This marks a precipitous drop of 24K claims from the slightly revised 233K the previous week.Continuing claims also recede to historic lows, last week reaching 1.837 million from the previous read of 1.866 million, also a very low number. In fact, we haven’t seen continuing claims get anywhere near 2 million for a week since last summer’s dual hurricanes hit the mainland. U.S. employment continues to amaze and astound.Durable Goods came in a tick higher than expected at 2.6% for March, from a strong upward revision from 3.0% to 3.5% for February. However, strip out Transportation costs and that March number plummets to 0%, with non-defense, ex-aircraft actually going negative to -0.1%. Core Capital Equipment Orders sank from a healthy 1.4% in February to 0.9% in March, with the shipments vs. orders ratio at -0.7%. So it would appear new airplane orders had completely covered this economic metric last month.The U.S. Trade Balance surprised to the upside in March to -$68 billion, lower than the -$73.4 billion analysts had been expecting and a revised -$75.9 billion in February. This is relative good news — certainly better than we’d seen earlier in the year — although it’s tough to get excited about a deficit of $68 billion.After the closing bell today, we expect quarterly earnings results from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), among others. But ahead of today’s open, there is such a huge amount of earnings reports hitting the tape that we’re going to keep it to just a few of the Zacks Rank Buy and Sell stocks this morning:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by a penny to $1.86 per share, on quarterly revenues that narrowly missed our $1.12 billion Zacks consensus.

2055,LUV,"The Q1 earnings season has so far unfolded a promising picture. According to the latest Earnings Preview, this positive scenario is expected to continue in the remainder of the current reporting cycle. The above report also projects S&P 500 companies’ bottom-line growth of 18.3% year over year. Additionally, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are anticipated to end the period with the top line expanding 7.7%.The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the ongoing earnings season with a year-over-year increase in the bottom line. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.    One of those sectors is the Zacks Transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 19%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing companies, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with the new tax law bodes well for the sector participants.Already, key sector participants from Transportation namely, United Continental Holdings, Inc.

Evidently, the same has induced bottom-line contraction of the likes of Delta and the trend is likely to continue for the remainder of the season.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation space will keenly await Q1 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) , Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service, Inc.

2056,LUV,"Airline operations were severely disrupted on Jan 4 as Winter Storm Grayson wreaked havoc. The storm has battered the East Coast, causing heavy snowfall accompanied by wind gusts in excess of 50 mph in the affected areas.Flight Cancellations MountWith the storm disrupting normal life, it is of little wonder that travel plans were thrown haywire as major airline operators had to cancel multiple flights. The severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that the U.S. carriers cancelled more than 4,000 flights, yesterday. Cancellations on Thursday hit operations severely at major airports in Boston, Newark and the New York City.We note that operations at United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) — the parent company of United Airlines — were hit the hardest among legacy carriers as Newark is a major hub for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. This Chicago-based carrier had to call off more than 560 flights on Jan 4 due to the Grayson-induced disruptions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other airline players like American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) were not spared of the miseries either and had to call of multiple flights resulting in significant loss of revenues.Apart from the cancellations, many flights were delayed causing harassments to passengers. In fact, operations were temporarily suspended at New York's Kennedy International airport due to the recent natural calamity. With high costs (labor plus fuel) impeding bottom-line growth of carriers, multiple flight cancellations caused by Grayson has hurt their top lines. Woes to ContinueWhat is worse is that the woes are likely to continue for the next few days as well, resulting in more flight cancellations and revenue losses for airline operators. In fact, more than 1,000 flights into/out of the United States are expected to be cancelled today.In fact, icy cold wind is expected to blow over the weekend in the affected areas confining people to their homes and disrupting travel plans. Apart from the damaging winds, severe power outages are anticipated in some areas along the East Coast.To compensate for the harassment of passengers, who had planned to travel in the affected period, most carriers including United Continental, American Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) are offering travel waivers for the concerned passengers. Natural Calamities Hurt Airlines SignificantlyThis is not the first time that the sector participants have been laid low by a winter storm. Earlier, such acts of nature have thrown the schedules of carriers out of gear, causing multiple flight cancellations.The back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) dented airline operations significantly, hurting results in the third quarter of 2017. Prior to that, winter storm Stella had crippled airline operations considerably by impeding travel. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew had spelt doom for airlines, causing extensive damage. Will Grayson Dampen Airlines Recovery?The emergence of Grayson comes at a time when things are looking up for airline stocks after being laid low for most part of 2017. Moreover, the new tax law is expected to be a godsend for airlines.The bullish scenario is reflected in the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last three months. The industry has rallied 8.7% compared with the S&P 500’s 6.8% gain in the same period.Given this backdrop, it remains to be seen whether winter storm Grayson hurts revenues significantly and spoils the results of the affected carriers in the first quarter of 2018. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2057,LUV,"The biggest overhaul in U.S. tax code in 30 years has been a boon for package delivery giants like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report). The $1.5 trillion package, converted into law (Tax Cut and Jobs Act) on Dec 22, reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid the above-mentioned companies. We note that the effective tax rate at FedEx was 35.4% in the first half of fiscal 2018.Riding on this momentum, shares of FedEx and UPS that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry, hit their respective 52-week high levels on Jan 3, 2018. While FedEx shares scaled a 52-week high of $261.57 during the trading session, the UPS stock touched its highest point of $126.69.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors companies like FedEx and UPS as they invest substantially toward capital expenditure.Naturally, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.Holiday Season – Another CatalystThe holiday season every year presents a big opportunity to companies like FedEx and UPS to boost their revenues. It is normally considered a busy period for such companies as shipping volumes tend to surge.As is the case every year, the companies left no stone unturned to shine brightly in the most recent holiday season. To meet the surge in demand, FedEx hired more than 50,000 seasonal workers this time. Meanwhile, UPS hired around 95,000 seasonal workers.In fact, according to Reuters report both these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies had a highly successful holiday season buoyed by strong e-commerce growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Dividends/Buybacks Attest Solid Financial HealthFinancial prosperity of FedEx and UPS is reflected in the fact that both the companies have hiked their respective dividend payouts in 2017. In February, UPS raised its quarterly dividend by 6.4% to 83 cents per share ($3.32 on an annualized basis).During the first nine months of the year, the company paid approximately $2.1 billion as dividend to shareholders. It also bought back bought back 12.3 million shares for about $1.4 billion in the same period.FedEx hiked its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) in June. Needless to say, as investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. To this end, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Price PerformanceShares of both UPS and FedEx have outperformed the S&P 500 Index in the last six months. While, UPS has gained 14.3%, FedEx has rallied 20%. The S&P 500 Index has gained only 8% in the same period. Will the Rally Continue in 2018?With the tax-bill becoming a law in the final month of 2017, stocks like FedEx and UPS are likely to be huge beneficiaries in 2018. The new tax law is likely to boost their share prices further in the current year.FedEx has already stated that the new tax regime is expected to boost fiscal 2018 (ending May 31, 2018) earnings per share in the range of $4.40 to $5.50 (before mark-to-market year end pension accounting adjustments, primarily due to the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax liabilities).Furthermore, FedEx and UPS are likely to continue with their shareholder-friendly activities in 2018 due to the new tax law. Therefore, a hike in dividends from both the companies can be anticipated in the year.   In fact, the new tax regime is a positive for not only these two companies but the other transportation players as well. Evidently, Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) announced bonuses worth $1,000 per employee, following the tax overhaul.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

2058,LUV,"Ryder System, Inc.’s (R  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 28 cents from non-recurring items) of 91 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. Moreover, the bottom line climbed substantially on a year-over-year basis.Ryder reported total revenues of $1,903.5 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,889 million. The top line also increased on a year-over-year basis with growth witnessed across all segments.Segment ResultsFleet Management Solutions (FMS): Total revenues were $1.24 billion, up 10% year over year. Operating revenues (excluding fuel) came in at $1.04 billion, up 8% year over year. Segmental results were aided by an increase in commercial rental and ChoiceLease revenues.Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS): Total revenues came in at $299 million, up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Operating revenues (excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) rose 4% year over year to $201 million.Supply Chain Solutions (SCS): Total revenues in the quarter under review were $495 million, up 10% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric stands at $1.33.Upbeat 2018 OutlookFor 2018, Ryder anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $5.45-$5.70. Prior forecast had estimated the metric between $5.40 and $5.70. This upside has been driven by an earnings improvement in the quarter as well as the impressive contractual sales performance in all business segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings stands at $5.59 per share.Further, the company expects ChoiceLease fleet growth of 7,500 vehicles for the full year, an increase of 1,000 units from the past projection. Moreover, owing to robust pipeline sales, the company estimates a further upside in the estimate. In fact, with the majority of fleet growth likely to occur later this year (on account of longer manufacturer lead times), the company is well-positioned for earnings and revenue growth next year as well.This apart, Ryder’s recent acquisition of MXD Group to boost its e-commerce portfolio is a huge positive for the company. The transaction is projected to be partly accretive to its earnings this year. However, the company hopes to witness earnings growth from this integration in the coming years.Additionally, the company expects to achieve double-digit revenue growth at both its DTS and SCS segments in the latter half of the year. Also, it assumes a continued volume expansion pertaining to the sale of used vehicles. However, the used vehicle pricing challenge might  persist for the remainder of the year.Upcoming ReleasesInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector keenly await first-quarter earnings reports from key players like American Airlines Group Inc.

2061,LUV,"Shares of C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW  -  Free Report) gained 21.6%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 9% in 2017.What’s Behind the Uptick?The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buy backs are impressive.  In November 2017, the board of directors approved a 2.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 46 cents per share (or $1.84 annually). Also, C.H. Robinson has an impressive dividend payment history.Investors always prefer an income-generating stock. Hence, a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. It goes without saying that investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to put their money on.Furthermore, C.H. Robinson’s efforts to expand globally through mergers are encouraging. The acquisition of Milgram & Company, completed in August 2017, has boosted the company's global presence and will be accretive in the current year. In 2016, it acquired APC Logistics as well. This deal has boosted C.H. Robinson’s presence in the Australia- New Zealand region.New Tax Regime is a PositiveOn Dec 22, President Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cut and Jobs Act). The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid C.H. Robinson, for which the effective tax rate was 34.2% in the first nine months of 2017.Moreover, companies like C.H. Robinson spend significantly for capital expenditures. In the new regime, these companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, which was not allowed earlier. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly owing to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.In fact, the new tax regime is not only a positive for C.H.

2062,LUV,"The New Year brought favorable tidings to the employees of airline heavyweights, American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), as the carriers announced bonuses worth $1,000 per member, following the tax overhaul. Notably, the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package signed into law by President Trump reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%.European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report), also grabbed headlines when it released impressive traffic data for December, 2017. The carrier is benefitting from low air fares and expects it to be even lower in the current year.Meanwhile, issues related to passengers continued to haunt U.S. carriers. Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), was the latest sufferer in this regard when it was reportedly sued by the family of an elderly lady. The lady died last year following a fall in an escalator at the Portland Airport, Oregon.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 27, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair reported a 3% year over year rise in traffic to 9.3 million for December owing to cheap ticket prices. Another important metric, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 1% to 95% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion in the same month. In fact, low air fares helped the carrier record a 10% rise in 2017 traffic to 129 million.2. The tax overhaul is expected to aid airlines significantly. Buoyed by the new tax laws, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines declared bonuses for their respective employees. American Airlines will pay the amount (totaling $130 million) to each of its employee, excluding officers, by Mar 31, 2018. Meanwhile, Southwest will distribute the cash bonus on Jan 8.Apart from the huge drop in corporate tax rate, the fact that the new laws allow companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately has proved to be favorable for airlines as they will be able to invest toward capital expenditure considerably. As a result, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. In this regard, Southwest announced that it will invest significantly toward fleet modernization. In fact, this low-cost carrier converted options on 40 Boeing Max 8s to firm orders. The company also deferred orders for 23 737 Max 7 planes of Boeing until 2023/2024.Following the tax overhaul, Southwest expects to record a non-cash credit in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated in the band of $2-$2.15 in the same quarter.3. The family of a 75- year old lady, reportedly sued Alaska Airlines and the concerned wheelchair contractor following her death after being injured. Apparently, she arrived in Portland after holidaying in Maui. At the airport, she slipped down an escalator. The family has lodged a complaint pertaining to wrongful death against the concerned parties. Currently, Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).

2063,LUV,"Investors in Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 29th 2017 $51.5 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Southwest Airlines, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Southwest Airlines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Airline industry that ranks in the Top 28% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 83 cents per share to 84 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Southwest Airlines right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2064,LUV,"Shares of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have lost 33.6% in a year, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 9.6%.  Reasons Behind the Price PlungeHigh labor and fuel costs have been hurting the company’s bottom line for quite some time. Notably, the company’s earnings declined 46.8% in the fourth quarter due to steep costs. Moreover, the carrier expects first-quarter 2018 cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items to rise approximately 6% year over year. While the metric for 2018 is predicted to increase around 2.5%. Economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated to grow 21% in the first quarter of 2018.Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) also decreased 5.1% year over year. Consequently, such below-par performance of the key metric does not bode well for the company.The company has also been struggling with capacity overexpansion woes. In January, the company reported disappointing traffic results with load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) contracting 230 basis points in the month. This was because of capacity expansion (6.6%) exceeding traffic growth (3.5%).The pessimism surrounding the company is further evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 5.4% downward in the last 30 days. Moreover, the company’s Momentum Score of D also highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Additionally, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) supports our negative stance regarding the stock.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). While Deutsche Lufthansa sports a Zacks Rank of 1, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Deutsche Lufthansa, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have rallied more than 35%, 13% and 12%, respectively, in the last six months.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2065,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.32%. Moreover, its impressive earnings history shows outperformance of the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.05%.However, things are not looking up for the carrier in the first quarter due to multiple headwinds.Let’s delve deeper into the factors likely to influence the stock’s quarterly performance.Factors at PlaySouthwest Airlines’ unit revenues are likely to be hurt due to pricing pressure and lower-than-expected demand for air travel resulting from the timing of the spring break. Notably, the carrier anticipates revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to be flat with the year-ago figure of 13.23 cents. Lower unit revenues might in turn limit top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter passenger unit revenues is pegged at 12.23 cents, lower than 12.50 cents reported in the previous quarter.Additionally, high costs are also anticipated to affect the carrier’s bottom line in the quarter to be reported. The airline estimates operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and oil expense plus profit-sharing expense to rise 0-1%. Additionally, fuel costs are assumed at approximately $2.10 per gallon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel costs also stands at $2.10 per gallon, above $1.96 reported a year ago.Weather-related disruptions have also hampered the carrier’s operations since the beginning of the first quarter. The storms in January and March led to multiple flight cancellations by the airline, possibly inducing a massive adverse impact on the company’s top line.However, the new tax law is a huge positive for the company. The enormous tax savings are likely to boost earnings in the quarter.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Southwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of -2.04% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 73 cents per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents.

2066,LUV,"Last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) kick-started the first-quarter earnings season for the airline space. This Atlanta, GA-based carrier reported better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share. However, high fuel costs contributed to a year-over-year decline in earnings.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the quarter. Results were aided by strong demand for air travel and higher ticket prices. This Chicago-based carrier’s decision to trim its capacity growth plans in the current year is also encouraging.On the non-earnings front, Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) grabbed headlines for a wrong reason. Shares of the carrier tanked following a news report aired on television, which questioned the safety standards on its flights. Currently, the allegations are being investigated by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) invited the attention of regulators, after an engine on one of its planes (Boeing 737-700) exploded mid-air. To make matters worse, one of the passengers on that ill-fated flight expired.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) also featured in the headlines by virtue of its bullish view on first-quarter unit revenues. The company was in the news due to labor-related issues as well. Flight attendants at this low-cost carrier voted in favor of joining the Transport Workers Union. By doing so, they have become the second labor group to be unionized at JetBlue. In 2014, the carrier’s pilots joined the Air Line Pilots Association.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline index increased 1.1% to $113.60 over the past five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Apr 11, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

2067,LUV,"The Q4 earnings season is picking up pace with multiple companies reporting earnings each passing day. According to the latest Earnings Preview, 81 S&P 500 companies will release quarterly numbers during the course of this week .Per the report, the entire S&P 500 fraternity is projected to end the Q4 reporting cycle with bottom-line growth of 10.3% on a year-over-year basis. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 7.1%. These projections compare favorably with the readings in Q3, when revenues increased 5.9% and earnings improved 6.7%.In fact, of the 16 Zacks sectors, 14 are anticipated to end the reporting cycle with earnings growth, one being the widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector. The bottom line for this sector is projected to increase 1.6% compared with the year-over-year decline of 13.9% in preceding quarter.Will Airlines Fly High in Q4?Given that the airline stocks form an integral part of the transportation sector, it is needless to say that companies in this space share the buoyant picture of the broader sector. Notably, the better-than-expected results reported by the likes of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) in Q4 highlight the air of optimism surrounding airlines.The improved unit revenue scenario bodes well for airline stocks as they seem to be back in favor post hurricanes. Evidently, the likes of American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) have issued improved Q4 projections with respect to the metric, which measures sales relative to capacity for a carrier.The favorable scenario supports the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 87 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry. This rank places the companies within the top 34% of the Zacks industries.Buoyed by the bullish sentiment surrounding the airline stocks, interested investors keenly await Q4 reports from key sector participants like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), American Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) on Jan 25.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In the quarter to be reported, we expect high costs to hurt the bottom line of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, similar to the previous quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel cost per gallon is pegged at $2.12, higher than $2 in the third quarter.In fact, our proven model too does not conclusively show that Southwest Airlines is likely to beat earnings estimates in Q4.

As a result, the company expects non-fuel unit costs to be in the range of 8.65 cents to 8.67 cents much higher than 8.45 cents in the year-ago quarter. The increased projection can be attributed to the costs associated with the pay-related deal inked with its pilots.Increased in fuel costs are likely to pressurize the bottom line as well.

Rail freight revenues, accounting for bulk of the top line in the reported quarter, improved 2%.

2069,LUV,"It was a week that saw the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declining 4.1% mainly due to the disappointing unit revenue forecast of low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) for the current quarter. The Dallas-based carrier attributed the downbeat forecast to pricing pressure and lower-than-expected demand for air travel due to the timing of the spring break holidays.Apart from the bleak forecast, airlines were also hurt by the emergence of another nor’easter (Toby) in the Northeast region. In fact, this was the fourth nor’easter to hit the region this month. American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) was also in the news over the past five trading days regarding its fleet upgrade efforts.Moreover, the week saw American Airlines and United Airlines — the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report)    — issuing updates on their plans to add additional flights in a bid to expand their presence.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Mar 21, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. Southwest Airlines now expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to be flat, as against the year-ago figure of 13.23 cents. The projection compares unfavorably to the previous forecast of year-over-year growth between 1% and 2%. However, current customer demand remains strong, according to Southwest. The carrier still continues to expect year-over-year RASM growth in 2018.Further, the company has lowered its outlook for first-quarter operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and oil expense plus profit-sharing expense. Additionally, first-quarter fuel costs are expected to be at approximately $2.10 per gallon (Read more: Airline Stocks Decline on Wednesday's Trading: Here's Why).2. Airline operations were disrupted when Toby hit the Northeast, resulting in multiple flight cancellations. In fact, the current month has reportedly seen more than 10,000 flights being called off due to successive nor’easters. Notably, it is believed to be the worst March in five years time in terms of flight cancellations (Read more: Airline Operations Disrupted Due to Another Nor'easter).3. According to a Reuters report  American Airlines has ended its negotiations with Airbus to buy multiple planes, in a bid to upgrade its fleet. Replacing Airbus, as a potential supplier to American Airlines was The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). American Airlines is reportedly looking to purchase 25-30 new wide-bodied jets. The deal with Boeing might be valued between $7 billion and $8.5 billion.On a separate issue, American Airlines announced its intention to launch flights to four cities — Georgetown, Guyana, Pereira, Colombia, Cordoba, Argentina, Oaxaca, Mexico and Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The association between United Airlines and Air New Zealand was strengthened when the carriers announced their decision to operate flights connecting Chicago and Auckland. The non-stop year-round flights, operated by Air New Zealand thrice a week, will commence from Nov 30, 2018. Moreover, United Airlines announced that its flights connecting San Francisco and Auckland, which currently operate on a seasonal basis, will fly throughout the year (thrice a week) from April 2019. The service has been expanded to cater to the increased demand.5. Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Alaska Airlines — inked a deal with Irish carrier, Aer Lingus, for providing members of its Mileage Plan more opportunities to earn and redeem miles to Europe.

2070,LUV,"Airline stocks have been flying high of late, owing to multiple tailwinds. The new tax law is also a boon for the sector participants. In fact, several airline majors namely United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and  Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) —  recently raised respective unit revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2018.Each stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per the current scenario, carriers are left with huge savings from the reduced corporate tax rate as a result of the enactment of the new tax law. This in turn has prompted carriers like Alaska Air Group, Inc. and SkyWest, Inc. to announce dividend hikes, indicating the companies’ financial prosperity.Price PerformanceThe positive sentiment surrounding airlines can be gauged from the price performance below. While the Zacks Airline Industry has gained 2.5% in a month, the S&P 500 index has lost 1.3%.  Airlines Grounded on WednesdayCurbing optimism, shares of key airline players tumbled on Mar 21 following Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) guidance cut for first-quarter unit revenues. Shares of Southwest Airlines declined 4.8% following the bleak outlook. The damage was not limited to Southwest Airlines, as shares of other carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report), Delta and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) also declined on the day. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index slid 1.2% at the close of trading on Mar 21.Southwest Airlines now anticipates first-quarter revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to be flat year over year. The former forecast was an increase of 1-2%.The view was lowered based on the company’s current booking and revenue trends. The airline’s year-over-year RASM trend for non-peak travel periods during March was lower-than-expected mainly due to a competitive fare environment and reduced travel demand. The carrier has cited the timing of spring break holidays as the reason for lower-than-expected travel demand. Lower air fares continue to pressurize passenger revenue yields. Additionally, the metric along with load factors are also being affected by the airline’s sub-optimal first-quarter 2018 flight schedule on account of the retirement of its Boeing 737-300 Classic fleet.However, per the company, current customer demand remains strong. RASM trends are also favorable owing to the peak Easter travel period.  Southwest Airlines thus continues to expect year-over-year RASM growth in 2018.Further, the company has lowered its outlook for first-quarter costs. It now estimates operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and oil expense plus profit-sharing expense to rise 0-1%. Previous guidance had called for a 0.5-1.5% increase in the metric. Additionally, first-quarter fuel costs are assumed at approximately $2.10 per gallon, lower than $2.10-$2.15 expected earlier.Other HeadwindsThe airline companies have been struggling with persistent high costs and lower air fares, denting their profits in the process. Expanding capacity implies exorbitant labor, fuel and operational costs and cheap air tickets. Though reasonable air fares bode well for customers, it reduces unit revenues of carriers, affecting the top line.It is to be noted that on fourth-quarter conference call, United Continental stated that it will continue to augment capacity in a bid to maintain its market share at major airport hubs to tackle competition from carriers offering discounts. Capacity growth between 4% and 6% year over year is expected in 2018. Moreover, a similar increase in the metric is forecast for both 2019 and 2020.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab PictureThe Zacks Industry Rank of 178 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the negativity revolving around the stocks. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 30% of the Zacks industries.We classify our total 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 using a week’s rebalance.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

In fact, the current month has reportedly seen more than 10,000 flights being called off due to successive nor’easters. Notably, it is believed to be the worst March in five years in terms of flight cancellations.  Another Nor'easter Hits: Multiple Flights CancelledFoul weather continued to hurt airline operations, throwing travel plans haywire, as the fourth nor’easter hit the Northeast this month. Similar to the earlier storms, the current one (winter storm Toby) too has resulted in heavy snowfall accompanied by strong winds in the region.Consequently, travel plans were disrupted causing harassments to passengers. The  severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that more than 4000 flights were cancelled in the United States by various carriers on Wednesday. In fact, flight cancellations hit operations severely at major airports like, LaGuardia, JFK and Newark Liberty, in the New York city area.The Fort Worth, TX-based American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) led the list of cancelled flights, calling off 577 flights on Wednesday. Other airline players like United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) were not spared of the miseries either and had to cancel multiple flights.While American Airlines holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the other carriers mentioned above carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Woes Not Yet OverWhat is worse is that the woes are likely to continue, though not as severely as on Wednesday, resulting in more flight cancellations and revenue losses for airline operators. In fact, more than 600 flights into/out of the United States are expected to be cancelled today.Moreover, gusty wind is expected to blow in the affected areas confining people to their homes and disrupting travel plans. Apart from the damaging winds, severe power outages are anticipated in parts of the Northeast.To compensate for the harassment of passengers, who had planned to travel in the affected period, most carriers including United Continental, American Airlines, Delta, Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) are offering travel waivers.Toby- Related Woes Coincide With Southwest’s Bleak RASM ViewWednesday turned out to be a nightmarish day for airline stocks. This is because, apart from their operations being crippled due to Toby, Southwest Airlines’ disappointing unit revenue forecast for the current-quarter resulted in most sector participants trading in the red.The Dallas-based carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to be comparable with the figure of 13.23 cents achieved a year-ago. The projection compares unfavorably to the previous forecast of year-over-year growth between 1% and 2%. Pricing pressures and weaker-than-expected demand for air travel due to the timing of the spring break holidays contributed to the downbeat forecast.As a result of the weak RASM guidance, shares of Southwest lost 4.8% of their value, ending the trading session on Mar 21 at $57.78. The losses were not limited to only Southwest as other major carriers too felt the heat and declined. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline index decreased 1.2% on the day to $119.97.Headwinds to Hurt Q1?Back-to-back natural calamities had hurt airline operations last year as well. However, the sector bounced back post the calamities. In the last six months, the Zacks Airline industry rallied 14.9%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 8.9%.Given this backdrop, it remains to be seen whether the successive storms this month and Southwest’s bleak current-quarter unit revenue forecast dampens the sector’s recovery. The headwinds might hurt revenues significantly, thereby adversely affecting the carriers’ first-quarter 2018 results, which should be announced next month.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

This indicates that things are looking up for the airline space post-hurricanes.The bullish forecasts were revealed by the companies while disclosing their respective November traffic numbers. While load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased at Southwest Airlines, the metric declined at JetBlue Airways as capacity expansion was surpassed by traffic growth at the Long Island City, New York-based carrier. United Continental also announced an additional buyback program.Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) — also grabbed headlines as it emerged as the most punctual airline in the United States for October. Moreover, the long-standing dispute between leading U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts witnessed a major development in the week. According to a Reuters report, representatives of the United States and Gulf carriers discussed about the issue with officials of the U.S. administration.We remind investors that major U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines and United Continental had complained to the U.S. administration in 2015 that the massive subsidies and other benefits enjoyed by the three state-owned carriers — Qatar Airways, Etihad and Emirates — were unfair as they deny a level playing field to the carriers in the United States.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gained more than 1% to $114.71 over the last five trading days, buoyed by the improved unit revenue views of major sector participants.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 6, 2017).Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

JetBlue also provided an improved guidance for fourth-quarter RASM. The carrier now expects RASM in the range of down 0.5% to up 1.5% (on a year-over-year basis). The revised guidance reflects an improvement from the prior outlook of a decline of 3% to flat year over year. The low-cost carrier now expects hurricanes Irma and Maria to hurt its fourth-quarter results to the tune of approximately 50 basis points. This projection is also an improvement over the previous forecast of one to two percentage points.Meanwhile, load factor declined 120 basis points in the month to 84.2% as traffic growth (2.8%) was outpaced by capacity expansion (4.3%). In the same month, the carrier registered a completion factor (system wide) of 99.7% with 86.5% flights on schedule.4.

Flight cancellations were high in September primarily due to the hurricanes.6. At Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), RPMs increased 17.3% to 2.08 billion in November. ASMs increased 17.1% to 2.55 billion in the month. Load factor improved 10 basis points to 81.4% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. Meanwhile, the carrier registered a completion factor of 89.7% with 99.6% flights on schedule.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months. The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green in the past week resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining.

2074,LUV,"The airline industry is looking up, thanks to the increased demand for air travel. The bullish forecast by Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — a premier trade organization — for U.S. carriers in the current spring season further highlights this trend. According to the forecast, these companies are expected to profit considerably this spring (Mar 1-Apr 30) as travel demand is projected to increase 4% year over year to 151 million.With the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations, resulting in the increased demand referred above. Moreover, ticket prices are still low and this has been an added incentive for passengers who are benefiting from a much-improved job market and rising disposable income.Buoyed the improving travel demand, many carriers including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) – have recently issued improved views for current-quarter unit revenues. All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other key carriers like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) are also expected to perform well with respect to unit revenues in the first quarter of 2018.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to indulge in a comparative analysis of airline heavyweights — Delta and United Continental —  based on certain parameters.Price PerformanceWhen considering price performance in a year’s time, Delta clearly scores over United Continental. Delta has gained 22.9%, higher than its industry’s 20.8% rally. Meanwhile, the Chicago-based United Continental gained only 7.4% in the same time frame.ValuationDelta as well as United Continental are attractively valued. Going by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the stock doesn’t look expensive at this point.Delta currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 5.6, which is favorable compared to the figure of 8.1 carried by its industry. United Continental is even more favorably placed in this respect as its reading is 5.5.Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to service both short-term and long-term debt. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and expresses to that of the current level of liabilities. Here, United Continental is the winner with a current ratio of 0.56, which is a tad lower than the industry average of 0.57 but much higher than Delta’s 0.42.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. Delta scores over United Continental in this respect. The reading for this Atlanta GA- based carrier is 47.39 compared with 144.21 for United Continental and 161.03 for the industry.Earnings Surprise HistoryUnited Continental has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.6%. Meanwhile, Delta has delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters while missing once, generating an average positive earnings surprise of 3.8%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Delta holds and edge over United Continental when considering price performance over an extended period and Debt-to-Equity Ratio. Another favorable factor for Delta is that it is a regular payor of dividends. Its dividend yield is an impressive 2.2%. However, United Continental does not pay dividends. Moreover, Delta’s larger business size (market capitalization of $39.39 B) compared to United Continental ($18.7 B) gives it the gargantuan scale to cope with industry headwinds in a better way.Despite being outperformed, with respect to the above parameters, United Continental holds the edge over Delta in terms of valuation, current ratio and earnings surprise history.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2075,LUV,"Shares of Ryanair (RYAAY  -  Free Report) surged to a new all-time high on Monday amid what has otherwise been a rough day across much of the market. And with no major Ryanair-related news to speak of, now is a great time to look at some of the company’s current fundamentals and latest happenings to see why investor confidence remains sky high.Ryanair’s stock price climbed over 1% to reach a new intraday trading high of $127.59 per share—in contrast to some of the biggest tech companies, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which caused the broader S&P 500 to sink (also read: Why Are Tech Stocks Tumbling Today?).Today’s gains are also part of a much larger move that has seen the discount European airline power’s stock price soar over 50% in the last year, including a 19% surge over the last 12 weeks.Recent News Ryanair released its February traffic results in early March and showed solid customer growth.Traffic grew 5% from the year-ago period to reach 8.6 million customers. Ryanair also reported a 95% load factor and noted that its rolling annual traffic climbed 9% to 130 million customers.Last week, Ryanair announced that it will add Turkey to its roster of destinations as part of a larger European expansion. The country, which had experienced a decline in overall tourism, has seen a recent uptick that Ryanair hopes to capitalize on.The discount airline company also recently rolled out a solution to its German pilot issue that led to a brief strike late last year. This move could prove vital as Ryanair continues its push in Germany.Passenger numbers at the Frankfurt airport are in fact expected to climb by as much as 6%, based on a recent report from German airport operator Fraport. Frankfurt, which is one Europe’s busiest airports, is projected to see its passenger numbers reach a high end of 68.5 million, up from 64.5 million in 2017.The company noted that Lufthansa and Ryanair’s expansion are expected to drive a large portion of this growth.More Fundamentals Ryanair is expected to see its revenues jump by more than 24% this quarter to reach $1.55 billion, based on our most recent Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company is also projected to see its earnings climb by 11.5% to touch $0.29 per share.The airline firm’s full-year sales are expected to hit $8.31 billion, which would mark a nearly 14% climb. Looking even further down the road, Ryanair is expected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 17.3% over the next three to five years. This extended bottom line growth projection should encourage investors as the company looks poised to boost profits while spending money to expand into new markets throughout Europe.Bottom LineRyanair is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock is trading at a 17x earnings, which is a slight premium compared to the rest of the “Transportation – Airline” industry. This seems to be based on investor confidence for long-term growth compared to airlines such as Alaska Air (ALK  -  Free Report), Air France-KLM (AFLYY  -  Free Report), and Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report).The company’s stock price might also seem a little steep as it just reached an all-time high. But comparatively, at its current price, Ryanair’s Forward P/E looks cheap against where it stood as recently as May of last year.With all of that said, now might not be a bad time to scoop up Ryanair as a continued surge could be on the horizon.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks’ has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks. >>

(AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — issued upbeat first-quarter unit revenue views over the past five trading days.We believe that strong demand for air travel contributed to the bullish projections. This apart, quite a few companies including the likes of United Continental’s subsidiary — United Airlines, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) revealed respective traffic data for March.  American Airlines’ $12 billion fleet modernization deal with The Boeing Company was another highlight of the week.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Apr 04, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to increase between 3% and 4% year over year in the first quarter of 2018 (previous guidance anticipated the metric to grow in the 2-4% band). Strong demand for air travel coupled with improving yields might have led to the bullish view.Pre-tax margin (excluding special items) is now anticipated between 4% and 5%, reflecting an improvement from the previous guidance of 2-4%. Despite the bullish views, the stock lost value owing to the surge in oil prices (Read more: Here's Why American Airlines Lost Ground Despite Upbeat View).4.

2077,LUV,"Shares of Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) have gained 9.8% since its erstwhile competitor Island Air ceased operations on Nov 10. Island Air had filed for bankruptcy protection in October due to financial woes. Naturally, the exit of Island Air has strengthened Hawaiian Holdings’ foothold in the region. Now, Hawaiian Holdings’ subsidiary — Elliott Street Holdings — has reportedly agreed to buy the operating certificate and other assets of Island Air for $750,000. Of the total consideration, $45,000 will be shelled out by the company for buying the defunct carrier’s operating certificate. The amount would immediately be utilized to pay Chapter 7 administrative expenses. The purchase price for other assets of Island Air like ground-service equipment is $30,000.However, the transaction has to be cleared by Robert Faris — judge in the federal bankruptcy court. According to reports, preliminary approval pertaining to the sale has already been granted by Faris. Final hearing on the issue is scheduled for Jan 5, 2018.The sale, on materialization, would allow the carrier “to assume oversight of operations currently provided under contract by Empire Airlines”. Even if Island Air's assets are ultimately purchased, we believe Hawaiian Holdings should be mindful of competition intensifying in Hawaii as Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) has announced its intention to fly to the region.  Naturally, investors would await updates on the issue.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2078,LUV,"Warren Buffett’s impeccable knack for investment has enabled him to beat markets most of the time since 1964, when he took over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A, (BRK.B  -  Free Report). This makes Buffett the unrivaled investment guru, widely followed by equity investors across the world.His investment acumen is evident from the way Berkshire Hathaway has grown into a conglomerate, piece by piece, over the years as a result of numerous small and big acquisitions. Now, Berkshire Hathaway houses more than 90 subsidiaries, selling everything from ice-cream to insurance under one roof.Buffett manages a huge portfolio of equities, cherry picked by himself and invested in float primarily generated from Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance business. Buffett eyes bargain stocks and mostly considers the intrinsic value (fair value of a stock calculated by its future earnings power) of a stock for making investment.His investment apart from value also includes understanding of the business, competitive advantages and capable management. These iron clad rules of value investing and his prowess to read Wall Street like a book has earned his securities portfolio impressive returns on investment for the past several years, a trend which continued this year too despite markets’ bull run.How Have the Markets Been This Year?The bull run of the U.S equity markets is now 9 years old, the second-longest in recent financial history. The 2017 boom was marked by Donald Trump’s take over of the White House, which pushed major indices to multiple highs on several occasions. The indices were favored by Trump’s pro growth policies to boost the economy and corporate profits, cut taxes, loosen regulations, increase spending and inflation.Trump promised to double the pace of economic growth from 2%, create 25 million jobs over 10 years, and make the domestic economy the strongest in the world. The positive sentiments sent the stock markets rallying.Performance of Buffett’s Equity PortfolioDespite equity markets’ strong rally, Buffett was able to emerge as a winner. The value of his investment portfolio as of Dec 31, 2017 was $157.65 billion, up 29% from Dec 31, 2016, which compared favorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 17.2% during the same time frame. The top five positions account for nearly 60% of the portfolio: Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz Co., Apple Inc., (AAPL  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola and Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report).5 Stocks That OutperformedWhile Buffett’s portfolio includes equity investments in several publicly traded companies, some of them like Coca Cola, Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz Co. and Philips 66, which reserve big chunks, gave sub-par returns.Nevertheless, the portfolio returns outshone the markets.

2079,LUV,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have lately been on an uptrend. The stock has registered gains of 14.5%, comfortably outpacing the Zacks Airline industry’s 9.5% growth over the last three months.Continuing the trend, this Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth presented a rosy picture at its Investor Day, particularly with respect to passenger unit revenues. The stock gained 2.9% on Dec 14, to close the trading session at $5516, after the update.The carrier issued an encouraging outlook for passenger revenue per available seat miles (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter and expects the metric to improve by approximately 4% (the earlier outlook on the metric had called for an improvement in the band of 2% to 4%). Delta expects to perform well on this front in 2018 as well, with PRASM growth estimated in each quarter. We note that Delta is not the only carrier to unveil a bullish unit revenue view for the fourth quarter. Fellow airline players like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) have done the same recently.Delta, however, said at the event that due to high fuel costs, the company expects operating margin for the fourth quarter to be approximately 11%, the lowest point of its previously guided range of 11% to 13%. Fuel price per gallon, inclusive of taxes and refinery impact, are now projected between $1.92 and $1.97 (the previous view had projected the metric in the band of $1.82 and $1.87).The carrier expects normalized non-fuel unit costs, including profit sharing expenses, in the band of 5% to 5.5% in the current quarter mainly due to “continued investment in our people and product combined with accelerated depreciation of aircraft retirements.” The metric was earlier projected to grow in the range of 4% to 5%. Capacity is expected to grow in the band of 2.5% to 3% in the final quarter of 2017.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier also sounded confident about performing well in 2018. It expects to end 2018 with earnings per share in the band of $5.35 to 5.70. The projection is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.41 per share. The tax reforms, on materialization, are likely to boost Delta’s 2018 bottom line in the range of $1-1.25. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The carrier expects to bring down the non-fuel unit cost growth to the range of 0% and 2% (excluding profit sharing) in 2018, thereby aiding its bottom line. Through its prudent cost management, the carrier intends to reduce the growth of the metric below 2% over the long term.Delta also stated that it remains focused on rewarding its shareholders with dividends and buybacks. The carrier expects to return approximately $2.4 billion to its shareholders this year. Moreover, it intends to return at least 70% of free cash flow to its investors in 2018. Over the long term, the carrier aims to return 20% to 25% of free cash flow to its investors through dividends.Moreover, the carrier is constantly looking to modernize its fleet. To this end, it announced the decision to buy 100 Airbus A321neo narrow-body planes. Delta has the option to buy 100 more similar jets under the deal. Delivery of the new entrants to Delta’s fleet is expected to start in the first quarter of 2020, continuing till 2023. In fact, Delta expects capital spending levels of approximately $ 4 billion in 2018, up from the estimated $3.7 billion in 2017, with the lion’s share being spent on aircraft.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

2080,LUV,"In a move to further enhance shareholders' wealth, JetBlue Airways Corporation’s (JBLU  -  Free Report) board of directors approved a new share repurchase program. This latest move reflects the company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.The new authorization permits JetBlue to buy back its common stock worth up to $750 million. The duration of the program, which commences from Jan 1, 2018, is of two years. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately 327.8 million shares outstanding. This low-cost carrier ended the third quarter of 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $394 million.Notably, management’s new authorization comes after JetBlue completed its previous $500 million share repurchase program in September, 2017. We note that the program had commenced on Jan 1, 2016.The latest buyback program, announced by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is in sync with its impressive record of rewarding shareholders. On the third-quarter conference call, JetBlue stated that the company has returned in excess of 7% of its average market capitalization to its shareholders in a year. The figure is the second best among airline stocks, according to JetBlue.

We believe such initiatives not only enhance shareholders’ return but also raise the market value of a stock.Through share repurchases and dividend payouts companies bolster investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2081,LUV,"Earlier this month, Airlines for America (A4A), the industry trade organization for the leading U.S. airlines, issued a report saying that 51 million passengers are expected to fly globally on U.S. airlines during the upcoming 21-day winter holiday travel period.An additional 1.7 million people are expected to travel during this period (Dec 15 through Jan 4) compared to last year’s 49.3 million people, representing an increase of about 3.5%. The higher demand reflects an improving economy as well as affordable airfares.According to A4A, 91,000 additional seats will be made available by airlines every day across their networks so that the additional 80,000 daily passengers can be accommodated during this period. Airlines expect to use larger planes and add more flights during the upcoming holiday season. December 21, December 22 and December 26 are expected to be the busiest travel days of the winter holiday season while December 16, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve are expected to be the lightest travel days.With the third quarter of 2017 being challenging for the airline industry due to competitive pricing actions, higher fuel costs, Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and the earthquake in Mexico City, focus will remain on how the industry fares during the holiday season. Here is a look at five U.S. airline stocks that will remain in focus during the 21-day winter holiday season.American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report): American Airlines, together with its wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, operates an average of almost 6,700 flights daily spanning 350 destinations across more than 50 countries. The Fort Worth, TX-based company has hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, DC.The company is investing in new aircraft and also working on driving efficiencies. American Airlines expects cost savings of $1 billion by 2021 on the back of increased use of technology, changes to process and procedures and further elimination of post-merger redundancies.Shares of American Airlines are up 7.3% year to date, compared to the 11.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report): Dallas, TX-based Southwest Airlines is a major passenger airline providing scheduled air transportation in the United States and near-international markets. At the end of the third quarter, the company had 687 aircraft in its fleet, reflecting the third quarter delivery of six new 737-800 aircraft from Boeing, nine new 737 MAX 8 aircraft from Boeing, and six pre-owned Boeing 737-700 aircraft from third parties. The company, which is replacing its old aircraft, expects to take delivery of 11 new 737-800 aircraft, five new 737 MAX 8 aircraft, and four pre-owned 737-700 aircraft during the fourth quarter. Southwest Airlines expects to exit the year with a fleet of 707 aircraft with the number expected to increase to 750 by the end of 2018.Southwest Airlines reported a 3.4% increase in revenue passenger miles in November 2017 from the year-ago period and said that it now expects fourth quarter 2017 operating revenue per available seat mile (“RASM”) to increase in the 1-2% range from the year-ago period. The company had previously said (on the third quarter conference call) that fourth quarter RASM would be up slightly to up 1.5% year-over-year.Shares of Southwest Airlines are up 26.7% year to date, compared to the 11.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.United Airlines (UAL  -  Free Report): Chicago, IL-based United Airlines operates about 4,500 flights a day to 337 airports spanning five continents through United and its regional carriers. The company’s hubs in the United States include Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark/New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. While 751 mainline aircraft are run by United, the airline's United Express carriers operate 489 regional aircraft.The company recently reported that consolidated traffic (revenue passenger miles) increased 5.1% in November 2017. Moreover, the company witnessed the fewest cancelations of any month in its history and also set a new record with its best ever on-time arrival rate.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report): Atlanta, GA-based Delta serves more than 180 customers every year. Delta and the Delta Connection carriers offer service to 306 destinations across 52 countries on six continents. Over the last five years, Delta has invested about $2 billion to build a franchise with some of the best airline brands around the world including Virgin Atlantic, AeroMexico, GOL, China Eastern with the latest being an investment in the Air France-KLM group. Key hubs and markets include Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-JFK, New York-LaGuardia, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Amsterdam, London-Heathrow, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, and Tokyo-Narita.Shares of Delta are up 9% year to date, compared to the 11.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report): JetBlue provides air transportation services across the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America with an average of 1,000 flights per day. Known as New York's Hometown Airline, JetBlue is the leading carrier in Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Los Angeles (Long Beach), Orlando, and San Juan. The company said that traffic in November increased 2.8% from the year-ago period.JetBlue also updated its outlook for the fourth quarter with RASM year-over-year growth expected to range between minus 0.5% and 1.5%. This compares favorably to the previously issued guidance of a decline between minus 3% and 0%. The company also expects the negative impact from the recent hurricanes to be less than what had been previously forecasted.While the stocks discussed above are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2082,LUV,"It seems that airline stocks are back in favor after facing multiple challenges for the greater part of 2017. Sector participants have been hampered by a number of headwinds like disruptions from back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico, issues related to customer dissatisfaction and high costs (labor as well as fuel).The lackluster performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below. The chart clearly indicates that the Zacks Airline Industry had underperformed the S&P 500 Index in the above-mentioned period. While the S&P 500 index gained 11.9%, the industry rallied 8.8%.Airlines Laid Low in Q3It is a well-documented fact that airline stocks struggled in the third quarter of 2017 due to the negative impacts of the recent natural calamities. Even though most sector heavyweights like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates, the outperformance was primarily owing to the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In this context, let’s consider the case of American Airlines. In the third quarter, the consensus estimate for the carrier’s earnings was pegged at $1.39, much lower than the year-ago figure of $1.68. The conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate has made it easier for transportation companies to surpass them in the quarter.In fact, higher costs led to a decline in quarterly earnings on a year-over-year basis for most carriers, thus revealing the sorry state of affairs for the sector. While the bottom line fell 7.6% and 5.4% at Delta and Southwest Airlines, respectively, at United Continental the metric was down 28.6%. American Airlines also reported a significant reduction in earnings in the same time frame.Moreover, multiple flight cancellations and continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the recent natural calamities hurt third-quarter results. For example, United Continental’s pre-tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately $185 million.Improved Unit Projections Hint at Brighter Q4Post-hurricanes, things are looking up for stocks in the airline space. This is evident from the fact that major players in the sector like Southwest Airlines and United Continental issued improved unit revenue views for the fourth quarter on the back of buoyant demand for air travel and improving yields.United Continental now expects fourth-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the band of down 2% to flat on a year-over-year basis. The projection compares favorably with the earlier view that the metric might drop in the band of 1% to 3%.Southwest Airlines expects operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to increase between 1% and 2% (earlier view had called for the metric to be up slightly to 1.5 %) in the final quarter of 2017. Hawaiian Holdings anticipates fourth-quarter RASM to improve between 1.5% and 3.5%, up from the previous view of down 1% to up 2%.Dividends/Buybacks Attest Solid Financial HealthFinancial prosperity of the sector participants is reflected in the fact that the likes of Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year.Carriers have also indulged in share buybacks that substantiates their solid financial health yet again. For example, United Continental recently announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program. The company’s previous $2 billion share repurchase program announced in July 2016 is expected to be completed by 2017-end.In addition to the existing $100 million authorization, Hawaiian Holdings unveiled a new share repurchase program worth $100 million through Dec 31, 2019.Notably, the robust financial health of most carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving flying experience for travellers, in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space.Bullish ProjectionsOf late, the bullish projections revealed by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and Airlines for America (A4A) for 2017 profitability and the upcoming winter holiday season (Dec 15-Jan 4), respectively, further highlights the optimism surrounding the space.According to A4A, the winter holiday season is expected to be a busy one for U.S. carriers. The organization expects 51 million passengers to opt for air travel during the period, reflecting a 3.5% increase from the 2016 figure.An improving domestic economy and affordable air fares have resulted in the bullish forecast for this year. The rosy projection for the winter holiday period comes close on the heels of the robust performance of U.S. carriers in the Thanksgiving holiday period.Even on the global front, the picture seems to be a bright one for airlines. This is signified by the bullish projection issued by the IATA with respect to the profitability level for 2018. The research firm predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of $34.5 billion (increased from the $31.4 billion predicted in June). The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $8.90 per passenger in 2018 compared with $8.45 in 2017. Additionally, the improved projection for full-year 2017 by Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOL  -  Free Report) is indicative of the improving Latin American economy.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 47 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 18% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankAirline Stocks Should Grace Your Portfolio- Our ChoicesThe above write-up clearly suggests that the overall outlook for the sector has improved significantly.

2083,LUV,"After a promising start to 2018, major stock indexes forfeited their yearly gains over the past few weeks amid heightened concerns about a looming trade war between the U.S. and China. Now, as investors look to rebound from what has been a tough stretch for many, it could prove prudent to dig deep into the tried-and-true strategies of Wall Street’s top figures.One of those top performers is, of course, the legendary Warren Buffett. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha” for his decades of success, Buffett has amassed billions of dollars through a meticulous brand of value investing that touts patience and confidence. Simply put, Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) firm are icons of the investing world.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. This portfolio is tracked by a large swath of investors looking to mimic the success of Berkshire’s legendary CEO.But not even Berkshire Hathaway has made it through 2018’s early volatility unscathed, and with most of the public lacking the patience of Buffett, some followers of the portfolio might consider ditching some of its worst-performing stocks. Let’s take a closer look.Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report)Commercial banking giant Wells Fargo has been marred by a fraudulent account scandal that tracked back to upper management, calling the company’s business practices into question and damaging its public reputation. More recently, interest rate uncertainty has caused headwinds for the finance sector. Shares of WFC have slipped more than 13% so this year, lagging the S&P 500’s nearly 2% drop.Buffett has been forced to publicly defend Wells Fargo at times, with the bank remaining one of Berkshire’s largest holdings. On top of that, Wells Fargo has underperformed from an earnings standpoint, missing consensus EPS estimates in the previous quarter and inspiring a significant selloff.The company has an opportunity to turn things around with its new report on Friday. Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting that Wells Fargo will post earnings growth of 7%, but revenue is expected to be down year over year and could add more pressure to the situation.Still, earnings estimates have trended slightly higher throughout the quarter, indicating that the company’s fortunes could be improving. WFC is holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) heading into its report date. Meanwhile, shares are trading at just 10.9x forward 12-month earnings, which is a discount to the stock’s median Forward P/E of 12.5 displayed over the past year.The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report)Kraft Heinz remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings, but the stock has underperformed amid a continued shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. The stock has tumbled more than 21% so far this year, and shares are hovering just above their 52-week low.These headwinds are putting pressure on Kraft’s earnings outlook. Within the past 60 days, the company has witnessed seven revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. Analysts now expect the company to post earnings growth of 8% on net sales growth of 1%.This negative estimate revision activity has earned KHC a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Still, the Zacks Rank is only designed to be a one- to three-month indicator, and Kraft’s dividend yield of 4.1% is likely to keep buy-and-hold investors on board.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report)Southwest was one of Berkshire’s 10-largest holdings at the end of 2017, followed shortly by fellow airline company Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report). Unfortunately, industry-wide headwinds—including lower-than-expected demand for spring travel—have punished these stocks. Heading into the day, LUV was down more than 17% on a year-to-date basis.Management has a bearish view on unit revenues for the first quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile to be flat, down from the previous forecast of growth between 1% and 2% from the prior-year quarter.This negative outlook has put a damper on analyst sentiment for Southwest. Over the past two months, LUV has witnessed six negative revisions to its full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement among revising analysts. This negative revision activity has given the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want more market analysis from this author?

2084,LUV,"The latest fiasco at United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), which resulted in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights on Mar 12, 2018, has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers in the United States.According to a Reuters report, U.S. senators — John Kennedy and Catherine Cortez Masto —  have introduced a legislation aimed at preventing airlines from putting live animals in overhead bins. The senators have also proposed the imposition of fines on violations of the animal-friendly measure.Following the dog fiasco, shares of United Continental have lost 2.6% of its value this week versus the 0.7% decline of its industry.   Reasons Behind the Proposed Bill The senators filed the bill (christened Welfare of Our Furry Friends Act) following the public outcry prompted by the puppy’s death on an United Airlines flight (1284) from Houston to New York. The carrier, however, apologised the next day (Mar 13) for the tragic incident, which is currently under investigation. Also, it has promised to issue bag tags for carriers of animals to avoid a repetition of the same incident. We note that United Airlines is the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental.The owner of the bulldog puppy was reportedly  insisted by a flight attendant to put the bag containing the animal in an overhead locker. As a result of this inhuman instruction, the dog died by the time the flight landed in New York's LaGuardia Airport.The Chicago-based carrier, however, said that the flight attendant was unaware of the dog in the bag.Whatever, be the real story, it cannot be denied that United Airlines’ track record with respect to customer service over the past year is not one to be proud of. It all started with the infamous David Dao incident on Apr 9, 2017.Animal Deaths: Highest on United Flights in 2017The death of the puppy further highlights the troubles faced by animals on flights of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier. This is because the highest number of animal deaths among U.S. carriers in 2017 occurred in United Airlines’ flights.According to data released by the Department of Transportation, 18 of the 24 animal deaths on U.S. carriers were related to United Airlines flights. On the flip side, other legacy carriers — American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) — reported only two animal deaths each in 2017. The data also revealed that 138,178 animals were transported on United Airlines flights in the same year.Notably, the highest number of animal deaths on United Airlines flights prompted Kennedy to shoot off a letter to the carrier’s President Scott Kirby demanding an explanation regarding the issue.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Animal-friendly Measures on Flights in FocusEven before the death of the French puppy, the issue of carrying animals on flights was very much in focus. In fact, Delta had announced a change in its policy pertaining to onboard service animals from March. Risks related to untrained animals in planes due to lack of regulations led to the change in policy.At Delta, the concerned passenger onboard would need to furnish documents underlining the need for carrying the animal on the flight. Also, the person has to provide proof related to its training and vaccinations within 48 hours before the flight. Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is also reviewing its policy pertaining to onboard service animals.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2085,LUV,"It was a week where key airline players like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc.

(HA  -  Free Report) — unveiled bullish unit revenue views for the first quarter of 2018.While Delta and United Continental revealed their projections at the J.P.

Hawaiian Airlines raised its guidance for first-quarter operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM).

2086,LUV,"The robust U.S. job data for February bodes well for the domestic economy. In fact, American businesses have recorded the strongest jobs growth in a year and a half in February. Factors like warmer-than-normal weather conditions and Trump’s business-friendly tax reform contributed to the impressive numbers.While the economy is currently basking in the glory of the February job data, it is worth noting that market participants were gripped by fears of inflation only a month back. Notably, both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 had entered into the correction territory on Feb 9. In fact, the significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) highlighted the heightened volatility in the market at that time.Given the fluctuating nature of the U.S. equity market, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends seem to be a prudent strategy right now. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Airlines: A Sector to ConsiderA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having airline stocks. Infact, airlines have rebounded nicely after having laid low by hurricanes last year. Markedly, the financial prosperity of airline stocks has contributed to their shareholder-friendly attitude. This is well-reflected by its healthy price performance over the last six months. The Zacks Airline industry has gained 13.7% in the period, outperforming the S&P 500’s 11.9% rally.Factors like healthy demand for air travel and improving unit scenario have contributed to the bullish sentiment surrounding airlines. The Zacks Industry Rank of 97 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the attractiveness of airlines. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 38% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankMoreover, the fact that Warren Buffett — one of the most revered investors of all time — continues to show his affinity for airline stocks bodes well for the sector. Last month, the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" in an interview to CNBC, did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company, thus showcasing his interest in the space.More Dividend Hikes Likely Under the New Tax LawThe new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for airline stocks. This is because it is likely to boost cash flow and in turn improve the bottom line of carriers. Moreover, the fact that the likes of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) declared bonuses ($1,000 per member), following the tax overhaul, highlights the optimism on stocks pertaining to this measure.Meanwhile, the likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018. We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Notably, huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.Valuation Signals More UpsideGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio — which is often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.9, which compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 12.2. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside.Dividend Paying Airlines Should Grace Your PortfolioIn view of the tailwinds mentioned above, we believe that stocks from the airline space should be present in one’s portfolio. Moreover, dealing with dividend stocks is a prudent strategy during uncertain times like the current scenario. Markedly, the best dividend stocks that pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects are less susceptible to market downturns.Given the significant reduction in taxes, we expect the already cheap airline stocks to fly higher, going ahead. Consequently, we have zeroed in on three stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Moreover, each of the selected stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States as well as internationally. The company, based in Atlanta, GA, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.The company has a dividend yield of 2.18%. Also, Delta has been consistently rewarding its shareholders through dividends since 2013. Notably, it has hiked dividend pay-outs significantly for four consecutive years since then. The latest hike was announced in May 2017, when the company’s board of directors approved a 50.6% dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 30.5 cents per share. We expect the company to raise its dividend this year too.American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, is another established name in the airline space paying regular dividends. This Zacks Rank #2 legacy carrier has a Value Score of A. The company has a dividend yield of 0.71%.International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (ICAGY  -  Free Report) based in Madrid, Spain, was founded in 2010. The carrier has a Zacks Rank #1.

2088,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Company (LUV  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25 before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. Moreover, the company has an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 2.5%.However, things are not looking up for the carrier in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to multiple headwinds.Let’s delve deep into the factors likely to influence the stock’s quarterly performance.Factors at PlayHigh costs are likely to hurt the carrier’s bottom line in the fourth quarter like the previous one. Unit costs (excluding fuel and oil expenses, special items and profit-sharing expenses) in the period to be reported are expected to be flat up to 1.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel cost per gallon is pegged at $2.12, higher than the reported base of $2 in the last quarter.The winter storm Grayson has of late disrupted the airline operations prompting it to cancel multiple flights. This is also likely to have a bearing on its fourth-quarter results.Additionally, a computer glitch in November 2017 hampered the company’s operations. Since expenditure on technological infrastructure is a major cash outflow for the airlines, this may also hurt the carrier’s profitability in the quarter.However, in December 2017, the carrier unveiled an improved view pertaining to the operating revenues per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) for the fourth quarter of 2017. The company now anticipates fourth-quarter 2017 operating revenues per ASM (RASM) to increase 1-2%, higher than the previous guidance of slight growth up to 1.5%. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter passenger revenues per available seat mile (PRASM) stands at 12.55 cents, above the reported base of 12.15 cents in the preceding quarter.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Southwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 76 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise  Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise | Southwest Airlines Company QuoteStock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW  -  Free Report) stocks for possessing the right combination of elements to beat estimates in their next releases this time around.Allegiant has an Earnings ESP of +1.09% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company will release fourth-quarter earnings numbers on Jan 31.SkyWest has an Earnings ESP of +7.80% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter results on Feb 1.

2089,LUV,"Its earnings time again! This is the time when the investor community is busy comparing estimates with actual outcomes. Prior to the releases, investors would look to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the quarter. This is because an earnings beat positively impacts the stock price. Given this backdrop, the obvious question is how to find potential winners?Through this write-up, we aim to help investors find airline stocks that are likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Notably, airline stocks are an integral part of the Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).The fourth-quarter earnings season will be kicked off by Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Jan 11. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The overall sentiment pertaining to airlines is quite positive ahead of the earnings season. This is because airline stocks seem to be back in favor after struggling for most of 2017 due to multiple headwinds like the back-to-back hurricanes and unit revenue issues, among others.Contrasting Price Performances Signal ImprovementPost hurricanes, things are looking up for airline stocks. This is evident when comparing the price performance of the Zacks Airline industry with the S&P 500 Index in the first nine months and the last three months of 2017.While the industry gained only 1.8%, the S&P 500 index rallied 12.6% in the first nine months.  However, the industry handily outperformed the S&P 500 index in the final quarter of 2017, rallying 12.9% compared with the S&P’s gain of 6%.Why the Bullish ScenarioThe improving scenario can be made out from the bullish fourth-quarter unit revenue forecasts from key sector players like Delta and Hawaiian Holdings (HA). Moreover, the likes of United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) announced new share buyback programs during the same quarter. These shareholder-friendly initiatives bear testimony to the solid financial health of carriers.Furthermore, the robust financial health of most carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving the flying experience for passengers, in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space. Also, high fuel costs, which might limit bottom-line growth, are likely to boost the top line by raising ticket prices.Impressive performances of carriers in the Thanksgiving travel period and the winter holiday season are likely to boost their top-line performances as well. In fact, strong demand for air travel on the back of an improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income is likely to aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Favorable ScenarioThe improving scenario for the airline space is well reflected by the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 83 carried by the 24-member Zacks Airline industry. Notably, the favorable rank places the industry in the top 32% of the 250+ groups. The positioning indicates a positive outlook. We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half outpaced the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The Zacks Industry Rank for this sector has improved immensely, given the industry’s 200+ rank only a few months ago.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankGiven the favorable backdrop, it is very much likely that airline stocks will perform well in Q4. Naturally, it is a prudent idea to add such stocks to one’s portfolio for handsome returns.Selection of OutperformersWith the airline space being densely populated, the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one. Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one’s stock-picking prowess, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Airline PicksBased on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on five airline stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in Q4.

2090,LUV,"The International Consumer Electronics Show, known simply as “CES,” is one of the biggest events in the world of technology. CES has grown in prominence and importance every year since it began back in 1967, and the 2018 iteration is already off to a hot start.Game-changing products, including Bill Gates’ introduction of Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox in 2001, have made their debuts in previous years.

2091,LUV,"It is a well-documented fact that woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued stocks in the airline space for quite some time. In this context, we note that United Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) shares had declined significantly in January 2018, even after reporting better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter due to its commentary related to capacity expansion.United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In such a scenario, investors fear that capacity expansion might lead to oversupply in the market even as oil prices are well below the highs touched in 2014. Low ticket prices in the United States also hint at the capacity overexpansion issue. While low air fares attract fliers, it dents profits for carriers.February Traffic Reports Offer a Glimmer of HopeDespite the above-mentioned headwinds, February traffic reports of most carriers seem to be encouraging, thus hinting at a decline in capacity-related woes in the airline space. This is because load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) has decreased at each of the above-mentioned carriers as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion in the month.At Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), load factor improved 40 basis points year over year to 81.5% in February, with traffic increasing 3.8% and capacity expanding 3.4%. Higher traffic growth in the same month also led to 200 basis points, 340 basis points, 140 basis points and 190 basis points increase in load factor at Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report), United Continental and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines, respectively.In fact, Southwest’s load factor expansion to 81% is a record figure for February.Price Performance in FebruaryIn view of the favorable load factor readings, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry outperformed the broader market in February. While the S&P 500 Index gained 3.7%, the industry rallied 4.8%.The impressive February traffic reports are likely to keep the long-standing capacity-related fears at bay, at least for now. Let’s take a look at some of the other factors which highlight the attractiveness of the sector.Impressive Unit Revenue Projections For the first quarter of 2018, unit revenue views are impressive, highlighting the solid demand for air travel. For example, American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) growth between 2% and 4%. Meanwhile, United Continental envisions consolidated passenger unit revenue to be flat to up 2% year over year.Delta anticipates total unit revenues (excluding refinery sales) to increase in the band of 2.5-4.5% (on a year-over-year basis) for the current quarter. In fact, the company expects to perform well on this front throughout 2018, with passenger unit revenue growth estimated in each quarter.Dividends/Buybacks Bode WellThe likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018. We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act).Notably, huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

2092,LUV,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) reported impressive traffic numbers for February. Traffic for the total system — including scheduled service and fixed fee contract — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 14.6% on a year-over-year basis to 937.28 million. System capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), improved 11.1% to 1.14 billion in the same month.With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) improved 250 basis points year over year to 82.2%. Strong demand for air travel contributed to the increase in load factor. In fact, this Las Vegas-based carrier transported 999.16 million passengers in the month, reflecting an increase of 15.7% on a year-over-year basis.Impressive Price PerformanceIn the past three months, shares of Allegiant have outperformed the industry  it belongs to. The stock has rallied 18.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 2.1%. Notably, the impressive traffic report for February should boost the stock further.High Costs Remain a BaneDespite the impressive traffic numbers driven by the strong demand for air travel, escalating costs (labor as well as fuel) are expected to continue hurting the company’s bottom line going ahead. In the fourth quarter of 2017, cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, increased 20.2% backed by the new pilot agreement, among other factors.Labor costs are likely to be high in the first quarter of 2018 too, thereby limiting bottom-line growth. The rise in fuel costs, which was $2.19 per gallon in February, also does not bode well for the stock.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAllegiant carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2096,LUV,"Last week the pilot fiasco at American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) was the most eye-catching event in the airline space. A scheduling error allowed its pilots to take leave during the upcoming winter holiday period. The prospect of an acute pilot shortage during the busy travel period caused panic among passengers. Some of them also contacted the company to be sure that their travel plans will not be hampered.Alarmed by the situation, the company finally signed an agreement in principle with its pilots’ union — Allied Pilots Association (APA) — to ensure that it operates the flights during December smoothly.On the traffic front, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings’ (HA  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines — revealed their respective November traffic numbers in the week. Additionally, Hawaiian Airlines provided an improved outlook on operating revenue per available seat miles (a key measure for unit revenue) for the fourth-quarter as well as 2017. The carrier also revised its fourth-quarter forecast for economic fuel cost per gallon, in line with the scenario of increasing fuel prices.Furthermore, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and Airlines for America (A4A) provided forecasts for 2017 profitability and the upcoming winter holiday season (Dec 15-Jan 4), respectively.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Nov 29, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. In a bid to avoid flight cancellations during the busy winter travel period, American Airlines had offered pilots 150% of their normal hourly pay to operate unassigned flights. However, this measure did not find favor with the APA and it reportedly filed a grievance. According to APA, the company had violated its labor contract. The crisis was resolved over talks between the two parties, prompting APA to withdraw its protest.Though details of the talks were not disclosed, labor costs are likely to spike further and hurt the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier in the fourth quarter of 2017.

At Delta, November consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — came in at 16.15 billion, up 3.5% year over year. This upside was driven by a 3.9% increase in international RPMs. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also rose 2.9% year over year to 18.91 billion, primarily owing to 4% rise in domestic ASMs. Moreover, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 40 basis points to 85.4% in the month on the back of traffic growth exceeding capacity expansion. (Read more: Delta Air Lines Reports Strong November Traffic, Stock Up).3. At Hawaiian Airlines RPMs increased 6.3% to 1.33 billion in November on a year-over-year basis. Load factor improved 10 basis points to 85.9% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion (6.2%) for the month. The carrier now anticipates fourth-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon between $1.80 and $1.90 (previous guidance had estimated the metric between $1.75 and $1.85). Operating unit revenue for the fourth-quarter is also anticipated to grow between 1.5% and 3.5% (previous guidance had estimated the metric to vary between down 1% to up 2%).For 2017, the metric is estimated to grow between 5.5% and 6.5% (previous guidance had called for growth between 5% and 6%). The company also painted a bright picture for long-term growth at its investor day presentation.4. The IATA unveiled a rosy view for carriers with respect to the profitability level for 2018. The research firm predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of $34.5 billion (increased from the $31.4 billion predicted in June). The bright projection despite increased costs can be attributed to the strong demand for air travel. The bulk of the global profits in 2018 is expected from the North American region ($16.4 billion). The estimated figure is higher than $15.6 billion expected in 2017.Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4.7% in 2018 from 4.6% estimated in 2017. The top line is projected to come in at $824 billion next year compared with $754 billion projected in the current year. Cargo revenues are forecasted to increase to $59.2 billion for 2018 (estimated revenues for 2017 are $54.5 billion).According to the forecast, air travel growth of 6% is expected in 2018 compared with 7.5% growth in 2017. The estimated figure for 2018 is, however, above the average growth of 5.5% in the last 10-20 years. Capacity is projected to rise by 5.7% in 2018. According to the forecast, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for the next year is expected to touch record levels of 81.4% as capacity expansion is likely to outweigh traffic growth. According to the report, yields are expected to improve 3% in 2018.The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $8.90 per passenger in 2018 compared with $8.45 in 2017. The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 12.5% to $73.8 per barrel next year. Fuel bill is likely to account for 20.5% of total costs in 2018 (18.8% in 2017).However, labor costs are likely to be higher. They are expected to account for 30.9% of total expenses in 2018. Total unit costs in 2018 are expected to grow 4.3% (much higher than the 1.7% increase in 2017). Unit revenue growth for 2018 is projected at 3.5%.5. According to A4A, the winter holiday season is expected to be a busy one for U.S. carriers. Moreover, the organization expects 51 million passengers to opt for air travel during the period, reflecting a 3.5% increase from the 2016 figure. The forecast reflects an increase of 80,000 passengers per day from the comparable figure last year. Passenger volumes (on a daily basis) is projected to be in the range of 2 million to 2.7 million.Notably, the busiest days for the holiday period are expected to be Dec 21, Dec 22 and Dec 26 while the lightest travel days are projected to be Dec 16, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve. To meet the surge in travel demand, U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 91,000 per day. The bullish forecast was backed by an improving domestic economy and affordable air fares.6. Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) has announced the addition of 11 new routes, starting next spring. The carrier’s move is a prudent one as it is likely to boost traffic on the new routes, thereby driving the top line.

Stocks were buoyed by the prospect of a massive corporate tax cut as the Senate cleared its version of the tax reform bill.

2097,LUV,"Shares of the major transportation companies surged on Dec 4. The uptick was primarily due to the Senate’s approval of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades by a 51-49 vote in the early hours of Dec 2.Consequently, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the day 1.8% higher, thereby closing at 10,368.58. The Index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies, apart from the airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be considered as a true representative of the U.S. transportation division.With the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index performing exceptionally well, it was no surprise that most participants had a field day. In fact, stocks like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry gained 3.6% and 2.8% on the day, thereby hitting their respective 52-week highs of $239.05 and $123.02.Other notable gainers from railroads include — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) (up 4.4%) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) (up 1.7%) — and from airlines — Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) (up 3.5%), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) (up 3.1%) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) (up 2.1%).All the above-mentioned stocks with the exception of FedEx and Alaska Air Group carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax BillWith the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill, President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office. We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid-November. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year-end, following resolution of the differences in the two versions.As various market watchers seem to debate over the pros and cons of the tax reform bill, we expect transportation stocks in the United States to be a major beneficiary. The optimism was reflected by the buoyant performance of the sector participants in the stock market on Dec 4.Both versions propose to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20%. On materialization, this huge reduction will naturally benefit transportation stocks in the United States. Most sector participants book a significant part of their revenues, domestically. Therefore, the 15-point cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn will aid their bottom lines.The proposal aims to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate than they otherwise would’ve shelled out. Currently, if foreign income is repatriated, it is taxed at 35% with a full credit of the local levies.Capital ExpendituresTransportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors transports and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Picture for AirlinesApart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space also are expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should aid carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.In fact, most market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low-cost carriers like Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways more than the legacy carriers. This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago. Consequently, their current incomes are still being offset by prior losses. Naturally, they do not stand to be benefitted immediately (tangibly) by the tax cuts. However, their smaller rivals like JetBlue are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they were paying higher taxes till now.Price PerformanceFollowing the recovery from the negative effects of the back-to-back natural calamities stocks in transportation space have been performing well recently. Additionally, an  improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.The fact that things are looking up for transports can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last month. While the industry rallied 4.4%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 2% in the same period. With the corporate tax cut likely to become a reality, transports are expected to gain further in the coming days. Naturally, investors will keenly wait for further updates on this burning issue.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2098,LUV,"American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) is one of the most well-known names in the airline industry. However, the company has been in the news for wrong reasons of late. Pilots at the carrier will be on vacation during the busy Christmas week, thanks to a scheduling glitch.As a result of the computer failure, the pilots’ union — Allied Pilots Association (APA) — estimated that approximately 15,000 flights are likely to be affected during the Dec 17- Dec 31 period. This is because they do not have assigned pilots. It is feared that flights from some of the carriers’ biggest hubs like Chicago's O'Hare and New York's LaGuardia airports are likely to be pilot less, thanks to this bizarre problem.According to a Yahoo Finance report, the Trip Trade app, which is used for assigning flights to pilots, malfunctioned due to a computer glitch. As a result of the scheduling error, the system apparently showed that the requisite staffing was available at the carrier to operate the scheduled flights during the period, even though it was not actually the case.Naturally, the news of pilot shortage at the largest U.S. carrier caused panic as the travel plans during the Christmas holiday period will be thrown hay aware in the event of the forecast coming true. Consequently, some customers had to apparently contact the carrier in a bid to get assurance that their travel plans will not be hampered.American Airlines Swings into ActionAmerican Airlines is leaving no stone unturned to deal with this issue of pilot shortage to avoid the inconvenience likely to be caused during the holiday period. According to media reports, the carrier had taken measures like using standby pilots and offering them 150% of their normal hourly pay in order to avoid flight cancellations during the busy travel period. In December, American Airlines plans to operate 200,000 flights.The carrier said that apart from about “a few hundred” there are pilots to operate the rest. This was probably directed to mitigate fears of travel-related disruptions among its passengers. However, the above view of American Airlines differs from that of the APA which stated that “Thousands of Flights Still Unassigned.” Consequently, a conflict between the carrier and the APA on the issue in the coming days cannot be ruled out.Also, customer-related issues had hurt the industry quite significantly this year. The infamous David Dao incident at United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), which earned it worldwide criticism, was one such issue. Meanwhile, measures taken by American Airlines, substantiates the fact that this carrier is certainly planning to avoid a similar fate in the coming days. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) had also been affected by customer-related issues this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Whatever the final outcome, the measures taken by American Airlines to combat this unwarranted crisis are likely to push up labor costs even further. With fuel costs also on the rise, the bottom line is likely to be significantly hurt in the fourth quarter due to escalating operating expenses.Computer Glitches not UncommonAmerican Airlines is not the only carrier to suffer from a scheduling glitch.  A similar issue in September had hurt European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report). According to a CNBC report, the carrier had to cancel 2,000 flights resulting in significant customer harassments.Technical glitches, in fact, have been a great nuisance for carriers. Earlier in 2017, British Airways, the largest carrier in the UK (in terms of on fleet size), encountered a major IT system failure resulting in cancellation of flights and untold miseries to the concerned travellers. Additionally, a computer glitch recently disrupted operations at Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report). Since expenditure on technological infrastructure is a major one for airlines, their profitability might be hurt in the event of such malfunctions.Will the American Airlines Issue Hurt the Industry's Recovery?Airline stocks seem to be back in favor again, after being laid low for most part of the year due to multiple headwinds ranging from the back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico and high costs.Evidently, the Zacks Airline Industry had underperformed the S&P 500 Index in the first nine months of the current year. While the S&P 500 index gained 11.9%, the industry rallied 8.8%.However, the industry seems to be limping back to normalcy as indicated by the upward share price movements at major carriers like JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) (up 15.6%) and Delta (up 9.1%) since the beginning of the current quarter.Also, the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index on a quarter-to-date basis. While the industry rallied 7.8%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 5.3% in the same period.The Zacks Industry rank of 63 carried by the 26-member Zacks Airline Industry also highlights the fact that airline stocks are back in favor. The favorable rank places the industry in the top 25% of the 250+ groups enlisted. The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there have been 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017.The improving scenario for the airline space can be well gauged from the fact that the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely, given the industry’s 200+ rank only a few months ago.However, the latest customer-related issue at American Airlines might prove to be a dampener, as far as the recovery of airlines is concerned. The fears are likely to turn into reality in the event of the Christmas holiday travel plans of passengers being hampered due to pilot shortage. Naturally, investors interested in the airline space are anticipated to keenly await for updates on this burning issue.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2099,LUV,"It was a week where there were quite a few updates in the airline space. The most eye-catching development was Delta Air Lines Inc.’s (DAL  -  Free Report) upbeat unit revenue forecast for the first quarter of 2018. Strong demand for air travel coupled with increasing yields contributed to the bullish forecast from this Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth.Airlines received another piece of good news, when the sector participants scored impressively on the punctuality front in January 2018, per the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The DOT was also in the news when it granted tentative permission to five U.S.-based carriers to operate new scheduled flights to Havana. The decision became necessary as many carriers had terminated their operations between the nations due to lower-than-expected demand.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, was another news maker in the week that had a day less of trading owing to Good Friday. Notably, the company’s new chief executive officer (CEO), Peter Ingram, is reportedly unperturbed by Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) decision to commence service to Hawaii soon.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Mar 28, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. According to the Air Travel Consumer report, most U.S. carriers were more punctual in reaching their destinations in January compared with the year-ago figure. Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), secured the top spot with 88.9% of its flights arriving on time in the same month.Moreover, the findings suggest that fliers were pleased as the number of complaints decreased during the month on a year-over-year basis (Read more: Airlines Kick Off 2018 With Impressive Punctuality Data).2.The DOT has proposed that Delta will operate an additional round of daily flights connecting Miami and Havana. American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), which already operates four daily flights between the cities, has also been granted tentative permission to conduct an additional roundtrip on the route.Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report), which already has a significant Cuban presence, has been permitted to operate additional flights on the Fort Lauderdale-Havana route (six times a week), apart from launching service between Boston and Havana on Saturdays.The new allocations, however, have to be implemented within three months of the receipt of the final clearance from the government. Following final approval, Southwest will operate additional daily flights connecting Fort Lauderdale and Havana.Finally, United Airlines and its code-share partner Mesa Airlines have received a tentative approval from the DOT to extend its Houston-Havana Saturday service to a daily operation. However, the decision led to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot (Read more: Why Airlines Tanked After DOT's Tentative Cuban Clearance).3. Delta issued an encouraging outlook with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the first quarter of 2018 and expects the metric to improve by approximately 5% (the earlier outlook on the metric had called for an improvement in the band of 4-5%).The company still envisions first-quarter earnings per share to lie between 65 cents and 75 cents. While pre-tax margin is anticipated to increase in the range of 6.5-7.5%, capacity expansion is still expected to be around 3% for the quarter. The carrier expects higher costs to pressurize its bottom line in the quarter due to weather-related expenses and wage hikes, among other factors.Consequently, the company increased its first-quarter projection for non-fuel unit costs. The metric is now projected to increase around 4% on a year-over-year basis (the highest point of its previously anticipated range of 3-4% increase).On a separate note, Delta reported an increase in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for March. The metric was up110 basis points to 86.9% in the month as traffic growth (4.3%) outweighed capacity expansion (3%). Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance of 86.9% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99%.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

According to Hawaiian Airlines’ CEO, Peter Ingram, that the company is making constant efforts to modernize its fleet. The carrier is also looking to expand its Asian operations. Ingram also stressed on the need to make its presence felt among investors in a bigger way. This is because it operates from remote Honolulu. Moreover, he believes that though airlines are now in a better financial health, they are still vulnerable to economic downturns. 5. European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report), reported encouraging traffic data for March backed by cheap ticket prices. The carrier transported 10 million customers in the month, up 6% year over year. Load factor increased 100 basis points to 95%.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA 4.3% -2.4%UAL1.4%7.3%GOL1.4%39.5%DAL-1.4%4.2%JBLU0.4%4.2%AAL0.6%1.5%SAVE-0.1%4.7%LUV-1.3%-4.1%CPA 0.0%-1.4%ALK-2.2%-25.6%                  Stock prices of airlines fluctuated immensely during the week.

2100,LUV,"The airline companies heaved a sigh of relief post Monday’s dramatic fall. This is because shares of key airline players rose yesterday, signaling a big upside and a healthy first-quarter 2018.Sector participants, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report), et al saw a substantial rise in respective stock prices at the close of business on Apr 3. As a result, the sector tracker, NYSE ARCA Airline Index, climbed 3% on the same day.While United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the other above-mentioned stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We remind investors that the likes of Delta, American Airlines, United Continental, Alaska Air Group and Southwest Airlines had suffered sharp declines in stock prices on Apr 2. This downfall was due to fears of intense competition in the Havana route following the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) decision to grant five U.S.-based leading carriers a tentative approval to operate new scheduled flights in the popular tourist spot.Let’s delve into the factors leading to the stocks’ recovery:The Bounce BackThe price surge of major airlines on Tuesday followed after Delta provided an impressive guidance for the first quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase approximately 5%, i.e, in the high end of its previously guided range of a rise between 4% and 5%. The upside has been driven by strong demand and higher yields. Positive results from all geographic entities and the outperformance of international unit revenues over Delta’s domestic counterpart also contributed to this positive scenario. Additionally, the carrier expects tax rate of around 23% for the first quarter.However, cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and profit sharing is now anticipated to expand around 4%. The earlier view had called for 3-4% growth in the metric. The downside has been attributable to wage increases in April 2017 and a rise in depreciation on aircraft retirements. Weather-related expenses also weigh on costs to the tune of 0.5 points.The airline maintains its projection for first-quarter earnings per share between 65 cents and 75 cents. Also, its outlook for pre-tax margin remains unchanged at an expansion of 6.5-7.5%. The carrier’s capacity forecast is fixed at 3%. While its prediction for average fuel price per gallon is unaltered at $2-$2.05.Robust March TrafficSimultaneously, the airline reported encouraging traffic statistics for March. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 18.95 billion, up 4.3% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 3% to 21.8 billion on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers augmented 110 basis points to 86.9% as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion.Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance of 86.9% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99% in the month.In the first three months of 2018, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 49.28 billion (up 2.8%) and ASMs of 59.46 billion (up 2.7%). Thus, load factor remained flat at 82.9% in March compared with the year-ago figure.The Near-Term ProspectThe airline industry took off to a bumpy start in the first quarter. Bad weather conditions played a spoiler from the very beginning of the year. Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January, successive nor’easters in March largely crippled airline operations due to multiple flight cancellations.Weather-related disruptions have continued in the current month as well with a snowstorm forcing airlines to call off many flights. In fact, 466 flights in/out of the United States were cancelled on Monday in the wake of the storm.Moreover, Southwest Airlines’ recent guidance cut for first-quarter unit revenues lead to tumbling of other industry players’ shares. Also, in January, United Continental’s commentary on fourth-quarter 2017 conference call that it will continue to increase capacity for the next three years in order to hold market share in the industry caused a decrease in share prices of other sector players.However, steep demand for air travel and the likely solid first-quarter results are anticipated to ease the pessimism revolving around the industry in the near-term.Notably, first-quarter results will possibly benefit from a shift in the timing of Easter this year. This is because demand for travel is usually high during the Easter week. Last year, Easter celebrations fell in mid-April.Impressive Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry has gained 1.7% in the last six months, marginally outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 1.3% appreciation. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2101,LUV,"Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) has confronted multiple headwinds due to the recent hurricanes and escalating costs like many of its fellow airline operators so far in 2017.Consequently, shares of the company have declined 24.2%, significantly underperforming the Zacks Airline industry’s rally of 15.1% on a year-to-date basis.Lets have a deeper look into the headwinds.Alaska Air Group’s performance with respect to passenger unit revenues is concerning.  This is because passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) decreased 4.2% and total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) declined 6.1% in the third quarter of 2017.Last year, Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America. Though positive on the deal, we note that this transaction has integration risks attached to it. In fact, merger-related costs contributed to the 44% rise in total operating expenses (on a reported basis) in the third quarter of 2017. Labor costs too increased backed by the company’s pay-related deal with its pilots.The increase in fuel costs are also limiting bottom-line growth. For example, fuel price increased 13.9% to $1.80 per gallon in the third quarter.Moreover, Alaska Air Group like its fellow airline operators such as United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) has been hit hard by the back-to-back hurricanes this year. Additionally, Alaska Air Group’s high debt levels raise concerns.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreTaking into account the above-mentioned headwinds, we believe that investors should stay away from the stock right now. Alaska Air Group’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) also supports our view, indicating that the stock is likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of F highlights its short-term attractiveness.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

2102,LUV,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Delta operates 10 domestic hubs:Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportJFK International AirportNew York City’s La Guardia AirportBoston Logan International AirportLos Angeles International AirportMinneapolis-St. Paul International AirportSalt Lake City International AirportSeattle-Tacoma International AirportAnd three international hubs:Amsterdam Airport SchipholTokyo Narita International AirportParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport Frontier AirlinesFounded in 1994, Frontier Airlines is a popular, privately-held, ultra-low-cost carrier headquartered in Denver Colorado. It recently announced a huge route expansion, and Frontier is adding 21 new destinations and 85 new routes to its network. Additionally, Frontier is adding dozens of non-stop flights between other cities that it already serves. With this network increase, Frontier’s route map will grow to 82 cities by next summer. The airline operates out of one main hub:Denver International AirportAnd seven focus cities:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportCleveland Hopkins International AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportLas Vegas’ McCarran International AirportOrlando International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportTrenton-Mercer Airport JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)JetBlue is a popular low-cost airline option headquartered in Long Island in New York City. It serves 97 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. JetBlue was founded in 1998, and primarily uses Airbus and Embraer aircraft. JetBlue utilizes the old0fashioned point-to-point system, which carries passengers short distances with few connecting flights, the airline operates out of six domestic focus cities:JFK International AirportFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International AirportBoston Logan International AirportLong Beach AirportSan Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International AirportOrlando International Airport Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report)Touted as the world’s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines was launched in 1967 and is known for its Rapid Rewards frequent-flyer program. Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. While Southwest does not use the hub and spoke transportation model (it prefers the point-to-point system like JetBlue) the airline still operates out of 10 major domestic cities:Chicago Midway International AirportBaltimore-Washington International AirportMcCarran International AirportDallas Love Field AirportDenver International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportHouston’s William P. Hobby AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportOrlando International AirportLos Angeles International Airport United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chicago, United Continental Holdings is an airline holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which formed in a merger back in 2010. Operating more than 700 mainline aircraft, United Continental needs a lot of hubs. The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2103,LUV,"A higher number of Americans are gearing up for Thanksgiving travel by road or air this time encouraged by a healthier economy, rising income, higher consumer confidence and cheap fuel. The frenzy for trips during the Thanksgiving weekend is far more than the other years. Orlando, FL is expected to be the top destination, followed by Anaheim, CA and New York City, NY.According to travel service provider American Automobile Association (AAA), Thanksgiving holiday travel is expected to hit levels not seen in 12 years. As many as 50.9 million Americans will travel this Thanksgiving holiday period (Nov 22-Nov 26), up 3.3% from last year. Of them, 45.5 million will go on a road trip with a 3.2% rise in automobile travel, 3.95 million will fly, and the rest will travel by trains and other modes (including buses and cruises) (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Though the road trip is expected to rise 3.2% over last year, drivers are expected to pay the highest gas prices since 2014. This year, national average price is $2.54, which is 37 cents more than last Nov 1-14.Another report from the U.S. airlines group Airlines for America (A4A) shows that a record 28.5 million passengers will fly over the 12-day Thanksgiving holiday travel period (Nov 17-Nov 28), up 3% from last year. Travelers taking to the skies will pay the lowest average in five years for a round-trip flight for the top 40 domestic routes, per AAA’s Leisure Travel Index. Airfares are likely to drop 23% year over year to $57 on average.In order to accommodate an increased number of passengers, U.S. airlines will increase the number of seats. A4A expects airlines to offer 86,000 more seats, 3.2% higher than the last Thanksgiving (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Huge travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for airlines and railroads, thereby leading to higher share prices.

2104,LUV,"Airline stocks made a nightmarish start to this week with key companies like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report),United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) witnessing steep declines in stock prices on Apr 2. Naturally, the sector tracker — NYSE ARCA Airline Index — also decreased significantly (to the tune of 3.3%) on the same day.Why the Downturn?While continued fears of a U.S.-China trade war and the tech sell-off played a significant role in the Monday mayhem, there was a sector-specific issue as well. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) recently awarded (tentatively) five U.S.-based leading carriers to operate scheduled flights to Havana.The DOT decision to allocate new US-Havana frequencies became necessary, following the decision of many carriers like Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) to terminate operations between the nations due to lower-than-expected demand. Spirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, the decision led to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot. In fact, in a bid to attract customers, a price war may emanate between the U.S. carriers.  To match the low fares of carriers like JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest, legacy carriers namely Delta and American Airlines might follow suit which is likely to trigger a price war.The Award The DOT has proposed that Delta will operate an additional round of daily flights connecting Miami and Havana. American Airlines, which already operates four daily flights between the cities, has also been granted tentative permission to conduct an additional roundtrip on the route. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways, which already has a significant Cuban presence, has been permitted to operate additional flights on the Fort Lauderdale-Havana route (six times a week), apart from launching service between Boston and Havana on Saturdays.Following the final approval, Southwest will operate additional daily flights connecting Fort Lauderdale and Havana. Finally, United Airlines and its code-share partner Mesa Airlines have received a tentative approval from the DOT to extend its Houston-Havana Saturday service to a daily operation.The new allocations, however, have to be implemented within three months of the receipt of the final clearance from the government. Notably, the DOT had to reject other applications for additional flights to Havana as the agreement between the United States and Cuba allows only 20 daily roundtrip flights between the nations.Other Headwinds Plaguing Airlines This YearApart from the fears of competition intensifying on the Havana routes, stocks in the airline space have hurt been by other headwinds as well.  Foul weather has been hurting airlines since the beginning of the year. Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January, successive nor’easters in March disrupted airline operations significantly due to multiple flight cancellations.Weather-related disruptions have continued in the current month too with a snowstorm forcing airlines to cancel many flights. In fact, 466 flights in/out of the United States were cancelled yesterday due to the storm.  Southwest’s bleak view, with respect to operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM), for first-quarter also dented stocks in the space.So far this year, the Zacks Airline industry has declined 6.1% due to the headwinds.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

But investors should note that most of the stocks have a good Value Score of A or B. This makes the space a value play.  However, oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. If oil prices manage to see an uptrend in the coming days on an extension of the OPEC output curb deal, airlines may suffer on profit margins (read: Q3 Earnings to Drive Energy ETFs Higher).Nevertheless, investors having a strong stomach for oil-related risks and faith in the compelling valuation of airline stocks, may play the recent dip in the space.

2110,LUV,"The Q3 earnings season is in full flow with earnings reports available from more than 135 S&P 500 companies. In fact the current week is an extremely busy one with 722 companies (including 180 S&P 500 players) slated to unveil their numbers during its course.Per the latest Earnings Preview, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are projected to end Q3 with their top and bottom lines expanding 5% and 2.6%, respectively. In fact, seven of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness their bottom line expand on a year-over-year basis.Rough Ride for Transports in Q3?The Zacks Transportation sector, does not share this rosy picture with the sectoral earnings projected to contract 14.9% due to higher costs and the recent hurricanes. In fact, the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) have contracted 7.6% and 28.6%, respectively, in Q3 on a year-over-year basis.Notably, the unfavorable projection for this widely-diversified sector highlights the fact it has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico). For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues.In fact, the negative impact of the hurricanes is also well reflected in the key transportation earnings reports available thus far. Evidently, United Continental Holdings had to cancel 8,300 flights in the quarter and consequently its third-quarter pretax income reduced to the tune of approximately $185 million.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines, leading to rapid increase in freight costs. Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs has hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of Q3.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 26Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q3 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) that are scheduled for Oct 26.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.American Airlines Group, headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, operates more than 6,700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe. Of late, this carrier also underwent a turbulent phase like the other airlines, mainly due to the hurricanes.Consequently, the company called off approximately 8,000 flights in the third quarter. Also, increased costs (fuel and labor) are expected to hit the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price per gallon (including taxes) is pegged at $1.59, much higher than the $1.48 reported a year ago.Despite the disruptions, the scenario with respect to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) is an improved one from the year-ago quarter, courtesy better-than-expected yields. For the third quarter, American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to grow between 0.5% and 1.5%.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter TRASM is pegged at 14.98 cents, higher than 14.73 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter yields is pegged at 15.56 cents, higher than 15.27 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016.However, the chances of this legacy carrier beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q3 are less, even though it has an Earnings ESP of +0.53%. This is because American Airlines’ Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) acts as a spoiler.In fact, our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier as well. Previously, when we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +1.41%, while the Zacks Rank remained the same.

The same for International Package revenues is pegged at $3,076 million, below the figure of $3,163 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Also, high costs are likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.According to our proven model, the chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in this quarter are less, despite its Zacks Rank #3.

These natural disasters have forced the airline to cancel approximately 5,000 flights. Owing to the multiple flight cancellations, the company expects the quarters’ operating revenues to be hurt to the tune of $100 million.Increased costs are expected to hurt the bottom line as well. Cost per available seat miles, excluding special items, is estimated to increase between 3% and 4%. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $2.00 and $2.05 in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price is pegged at $2.00 per gallon, higher than $1.93 reported in the second quarter of 2017.According to our proven model, the chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in this quarter are less.

2111,LUV,"On Feb 26, billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, continued to display his affinity for airline stocks. In an interview to CNBC, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company, thereby displaying his recent interest in the space once again.Last year, the U.S. airline suffered significant losses due to a plethora of headwinds like back-to-back hurricanes and higher fuel costs. However, the industry recovered in the last quarter of 2017 after struggling for most of the year. The resurgence of airline stocks is evident from the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 11.1% over the last 60 days.Persistent demand for air travel outpacing the overall economic growth and the latest trend of airline operators adding capacity are likely to keep the momentum high in 2018.Growth-Induced PolicesPresident Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 21% is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years. A large part of airline operators book much of their revenues within the United States. Consequently, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by airliners would be immediately accretive to cash flow.Bullish IATA Forecast for 2018In December 2017, the International Air Transport Association (""IATA"") provided an encouraging outlook for the global airline industry. IATA predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry in 2018. This is much higher than the profitability forecast of $34.5 billion for 2017. This bright projection can be attributed to strong demand for air travel.Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4.7% in 2018 from 4.6% estimated in 2017. The top line is projected at $824 billion in 2018 compared with $754 billion expected for 2017.Optimism surrounding the air cargo business also improved. Cargo revenues are forecasted to increase to $59.2 billion in 2018 (estimated revenues for 2017 are $54.5 billion). Per the forecast, air travel growth of 6% is expected for 2018. The estimated figure for 2018 is above the average growth of 5.5% in the last 10-20 years.Moody’s Maintain Stable 2018 OutlookIn December 2017, Moody’s Investors Services maintains 2018 outlook for the global airline industry as stable. This stable outlook is driven by projections for 8.5% to 10% operating margins for Moody’s-rated airlines through 2019, with U.S. carriers remaining the most profitable. Moody’s projects industry revenues to grow about 4%, offsetting higher labor and fuel costs. Steady global economic growth will support rising demand for air travel over the next 12 to 18 months.Our Top PicksThe Transportation Services industry is currently in a strong position from the Zacks Industry Rank perspective. The industry is currently in the top 40% (102 out of 256) of the Zacks Categorized industries, suggesting it is well-positioned. Historically, the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.A thriving and improving economy also supports the overall bullishness of the airline industry, as it implies that more passengers and cargos are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects and sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped this industry recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent. Easily available credit also strengthens the situation.Given this scenario, we suggest investors add these five airline stocks to their portfolios, each of which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report): The company has expected earnings growth of 28.6% for current year.

2112,LUV,"In the last five trading days, pilots at Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) ratified the tentative five-year contract pertaining to a pay raise. As costs are likely to increase following the ratification, the low-cost carrier revised its current-quarter and year projections.On the traffic front, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines — reported impressive numbers for February. Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) increased at both carriers as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. Additionally, Hawaiian Airlines was in the news owing its fleet modernization efforts.Alaska Air Group Inc.’s (ALK  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Alaska Airlines — also hit the headlines by virtue of its codeshare agreement with Fiji Airways — Fiji's national carrier. Furthermore, due to winter storm, U.S. carriers had to cancel multiple flights during the week, which might hurt revenues in the current quarter.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Feb 28, 2018). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 14.69 billion, up 3.8% year over year.

For example, cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, is expected to decline 3% in the quarter compared with the prior projection of 5.5-6.5% (Read more: Spirit Airlines Revises View Post Pilot Contract Ratification).3. Airline operations were severely disrupted for a couple of days from Mar 2, 2018 due to the deadly nor’easter in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast of United States. Notably, this winter storm impeded travel plans and caused harassments to passengers. It caused heavy snowfall accompanied by hurricane-force winds in excess of 120 kilometers per hour in the affected areas (Read more: Nor'easter Cripples Airline Operations: What Lies Ahead?).4 Alaska Airlines entered into a bilateral codeshare agreement with Fiji Airways.  Per the deal, Fiji Airways can place its ""FJ"" code on Alaska Airlines operated flights from San Francisco to two popular destinations in the United States — Seattle and Portland. Additionally, the contract provides extended and seamless connectivity between flights of the two carriers. In fact, by inking this deal, Alaska Airlines and Fiji Airways have expanded their partnership (Read more: Alaska Air Group Arm to Share Codes With Fiji Airways).5. In a bid to upgrade its fleet, Hawaiian Airlines executed a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) for buying 10 Boeing Dreamliners.  The first of the fuel-efficient, lightweight Boeing 787-9 aircraft is expected to join its fleet in the first quarter of 2021.  Moreover, Hawaiian Airlines has options to purchase 10 more such planes.On a separate issue, February load factor at Hawaiian Airlines increased 190 basis points to 84.8% as traffic growth (7.4%) outpaced capacity expansion (4.9%) in the month. PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, though the losses were muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline index decreased 1.7% in the period. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline index appreciated 10.5% backed by robust gains at the likes of Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors look forward to February traffic reports from the likes of Southwest Airlines Co.

2113,LUV,"It is a well-established fact that the widely-diversified transportation sector including airline companies, railroads, truckers, shippers to name a few, has struggled for the better part of 2017. Sector participants have been plagued by a number of headwinds like disruptions from back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico, declining automotive volumes, issues related to customer dissatisfaction and high costs (labor as well as fuel).The lackluster performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below. The chart clearly indicates that the sector has climbed only 8.8%, underperforming the S&P 500 Index, which appreciated 12.6% over the same period.Uptrend Over the Last Few MonthsHowever, matters have been changing for the better over the past few months on the back of several tailwinds. We are optimistic about the fact that the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a month. It has gained 6.8% compared with the S&P 500 index that advanced 3.5% over the same time frame.Railroads Poised for a Great 2018Railroads have been benefiting since the beginning of 2017 after struggling for the past couple of years. The prime factors contributing to this improved scenario are increased coal and intermodal revenues.Particularly with President Donald Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is seeing better days. The President is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations, which were hurting its prospects.The rise in natural gas prices is also favorable to boosting demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will increase in 2018. Since revenues from coal contribute significantly to the railroads’ top line, any positive development for the commodity means good news for the sector.Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads and intermodal, has improved by leaps and bounds this year. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to grow 4.2% in 2018. This in turn will drive the top line for railroads.Moreover, railroads like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year, indicating their financial prosperity. The solid financial status of these companies bodes well for 2018.Recovery of the U.S. economy is also likely to pave the way for railroads. Notably, U.S. GDP is expected to increase by 2.4% in 2018, higher than what was achieved in the last two years. Generally, a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States.The improved economic scenario is evident from the fact that in the third quarter of 2017, the domestic economy expanded at an impressive annual rate of 3%, per the latest report from the Commerce Department. The reading was above the consensus estimate of 2.6%.Trump’s Tax Overhaul — A BoonThe biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years is a positive for the transport companies and should propel the sector’s growth in 2018. Corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% as a result of this move.Transportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately, per the U.S. tax overhaul. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors transports.As and when the companies are able to reduce capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will in fact leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Notably, FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) has already indicated that it will increase spending on its various logistics and delivery businesses with the windfall payout the tax cut will grant. Apart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space  are also expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should assist the carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.Airlines’ Profitability to Rise in 2018The International Air Transport Association unveiled a rosy view for carriers with respect to the profitability level for 2018. The research firm predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of $34.5 billion (increased from the $31.4 billion predicted in June). This bright projection despite increased costs can be attributed to the strong demand for air travel.The top line is predicted to come in at $824 billion next year compared with $754 billion, forecast in the current year. Cargo revenues are likely to increase to $59.2 billion for 2018 (estimated revenues for 2017 are $54.5 billion).Per the forecast, 6% air travel growth is expected in 2018 compared with 7.5% rise in 2017. This estimated figure for 2018 is however, above the average growth of 5.5% in the last 10-20 years.The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $8.90 in 2018 compared with $8.45 in 2017.Declining air fares have been hurting the top lines of carriers. Although low airfare brings good news for flyers, it is a bane to the airline companies. However, air fares are expected to rise in 2018, thanks to the likely oil price surge of 10.7% to $60/barrel for Brent Crude. High air fares will boost the top lines of carriers.Moreover, the bullish unit revenue forecasts projected by several carriers in the recent times reflect their easing revenue related woes. Notably, in December, JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) provided a raised guidance for the fourth quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company now expects RASM in the range of down 0.5% to up 1.5% (on a year-over-year basis). The revised view reflects an improvement from the prior outlook of a decline of 3% to flat year over year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) now anticipates operating revenues per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) for the fourth quarter of 2017 to increase 1-2%, higher than the previous guidance of a slight rise of up to 1.5%.  The progress in the condition of the sector is highlighted by the upgrade in the Zacks Industry Ranks of most components in the transportation space. For instance, the Transportation-Airline division carries a bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 72 (out of 250 plus groups). This favorable rank places the companies within the top 28% of the Zacks industries.With things looking up for the transportation sector, we have zeroed in on four stocks with potential to outperform in the upcoming year.4 Prominent PicksGiven the vast size of the sector, it is no mean task to zoom in on the likely outperformers for the coming year. This is where the Zacks Rank, justifying a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, the stocks have a sound VGM Score. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows you to streamline your search and eliminate the negative aspects of the stocks to select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM score, the stocks also possess large market capitalizations to their credit.  This is because focusing on such stocks is considered safe. Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions.Deutsche Lufthansa AG , commonly known as Lufthansa is one of the largest German airlines and is headquartered in Cologne, Germany.

2114,LUV,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) has faced multiple headwinds due to the recent hurricanes, Las Vegas mass shooting and escalating costs so far in 2017. Consequently, shares of the company have declined 8.5%, significantly underperforming the Zacks Airline industry’s rally of 15.1% on a year-to-date basis.Lets have a deeper look into the headwinds.The company's fourth-quarter guidance for total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) is concerning. TRASM for the quarter is anticipated to decline between 0.5% and 3%. Hurricane Irma and the Las Vegas mass shooting are expected to hurt the metric.As the company has a significant exposure to Florida and Las Vegas, its bookings for the fourth quarter might be hurt, as well. Furthermore, Irma and the Las Vegas mass shooting are expected to have a negative impact on TRASM between 3 and 3.5 percentage points.Additionally, the decline in the third-quarter load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) at the company remains concerning. The metric was down in October too as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion. Moreover, high fuel costs are potent threats.High labor costs are also hurting the bottom line. For example, in the third quarter cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, increased 16.7% driven by the new pilot agreement, transition costs among other factors. For the fourth quarter, the company expects CASM (excluding fuel) to increase between 7% and 9%. The metric is anticipated to rise in the band of 11% to 12% for 2017.Furthermore, Allegiant like its fellow airline operators such as United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) has been hit hard by the back-to-back hurricanes this year. Its high debt levels also raise concerns.Not a Broker FavoriteAllegiant’s earnings estimates reflect the pessimism surrounding the stock. The company has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 27.6% downward, in the last 60 days. Also, the current-year earnings estimates have moved down 7.6% in the same time frame.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreTaking into account the above-mentioned headwinds, we believe that investors should stay away from the stock right now. Allegiant’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) also supports our view, indicating that the stock is likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months.Furthermore, the company’s VGM Score of C highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2115,LUV,"Stocks in the airline space faced multiple challenges in the first three quarters of 2017. The space was hit by disruptions from back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico and high costs.Evidently, the Zacks Airline Industry had underperformed the S&P 500 Index in the first nine months of the current year. While the S&P 500 index gained 11.9%, the industry rallied 8.8%.Turbulent Q3 for AirlinesThe third quarter of 2017 was a huge victim of the difficulties facing airlines. However, major companies like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the quarter. The outperformance with respect to the bottom line can be mainly attributed to reduced expectations.All the above-mentioned companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Earnings per share, however, decreased on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs. While the bottom line fell 7.6% and 5.4% at Delta and Southwest Airlines, respectively, at United Continental the metric was down 28.6%. American Airlines too reported a significant reduction in earnings in the quarter.Also, multiple flight cancellations as well as continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the recent natural calamities hurt third-quarter results. For example, United Continental’s pre-tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately $185 million.Brighter Q4 Awaits Airlines?The worst seems to be over for airline stocks as its operations are back to normal. This is evident from Delta’s bullish view for the final quarter of 2017 particularly on passenger revenues per available seat miles (PRASM: a key measure for unit revenues). In fact, this airline behemoth expects the metric to increase in the band of 2% to 4% (on a year-over-year basis) in the same period. The projection compares favorably with the 1.9% increase in PRASM recorded in the third quarter.At American Airlines, total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) improved only 1.1% in the third quarter of 2017. However, the fourth-quarter TRASM view is much brighter. The metric is expected to increase between 2.5% and 4.5% in the final quarter of 2017.Based on the bullish views, we expect airlines to perform better in the final quarter compared with the turbulent third quarter. Notably, strong demand for air travel backed by cheap ticket prices are expected to support the sector participants.Will Airlines Stocks Fly High on Thanksgiving Holiday Period?The resurgence of the key players in the airline space is evident from the bullish outlook provided by the Airlines for America (“A4A”) in the ongoing Thanksgiving holiday period (Nov 17–Nov 28).Per the guidance, approximately 28.5 million passengers are expected to avail the U.S. airlines’ services in the current holiday period this year, up 3% year over year. The forecast translates into 2.38 million fliers per day during the period, which is an increase of 69,000 from the comparable figure last year.Passenger volumes (on a daily basis) is projected to be in the range of 1.61 million to 2.88 million. The bullish forecast was primarily owing to cheap ticket prices. Consequently, the carriers had to add more seats to meet the surge in demand.Factors Supporting Turnaround in the Airlines SpaceAn improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.Despite the recent rally, oil prices are still hovering around the $58 a barrel, a long way off the highs of mid-2014 when the commodity had traded in excess of $100 a barrel. As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies, the lower the oil prices, the better it is for sector participants. In fact, lower oil prices imply greater financial well-being for airlines by virtue of massive savings.Moreover, a hike in dividend payouts this year by Southwest Airlines and Delta Air reflects financial prosperity in the airline space. In addition, Hawaiian Holdings’ (HA  -  Free Report) recent decision to reward shareholders with dividend payments is indicative of strong financial health.Impressive Stock Price performance so far in Q4Shares of JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report), Delta and American Airlines are up 7.1%, 3.9% and 2.2%, respectively, on a quarter-to-date basis. This reflects that things are looking up for airlines.Also, the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index on a quarter-to-date basis. While the industry rallied 4.5%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 3.6% in the same period.Improving Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Industry rank of 87 carried by the 26-member Zacks Airline Industry also highlights the fact that airline stocks are back in favor. The favorable rank places the industry in the top 34% of the 250+ groups enlisted. The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there have been 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017.The improving scenario for the airline space can be well gauged from the fact that the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely, given the industry’s 200+ rank only a few months ago. Valuation Signals More UpsideGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry doesn’t look expensive at this point. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.1, which is favorable compared to what the industry saw in the last year. The ratio is below the high end of 8.5 during the period.Additionally, the reading compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11.3. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2116,LUV,"It is a well-known fact that companies in the airline space have been facing challenges due to multiple headwinds. Stocks in this space have been hurt by high costs (labor and fuel), disruptions caused by the recent hurricanes, capacity overexpansion, among others.Evidently, United Continental Holdings’ (UAL  -  Free Report) third-quarter pre-tax income was affected to the tune of approximately $185 million due to the storms. As a result, the company cancelled 8,300 flights in the same period.Additionally, the massacre (described as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history) in Las Vegas on Oct 1, 2017, pushed back airline stocks, particularly those with exposure to Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport. For instance, bookings at Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) for the fourth quarter have been hurt. The company now expects total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) to decline between 0.5% and 3% mainly due to Irma and the Las Vegas mass shooting incident.In view of the above struggles, it is of little surprise that the Zacks Airline industry has underperformed the broader market year to date. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.6%, the industry rallied 11.4%.Warren Buffett Still Rooting for Airlines – A Positive SignDespite the sector’s recent struggles, Warren Buffett — one of the most revered investors of all time — still continues to support the airline stocks. According to a third-quarter filing by Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett still has stakes in American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and United Continental. Initially Buffett had shown interest in the sector last year, after staying away from it for a long time. In fact, his last investment in airlines was in the 1980s.Buffett’s investing style has always remained simple: buy shares in great companies and hold them for a significant period of time. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time.As one of the greatest investors ever is still showing faith in airlines despite the recent turbulence, it is obvious that airline companies fit into his scheme of long-term sustainability. Therefore, it can be safely concluded that all is not lost for the sector and one should remain focused on them.Dividend-Paying Stocks to the RescueCompanies with strong fundamentals are generally payers of dividends. Such companies are financially stable and mature and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market and sector conditions.In fact, dividend stocks are a safe bet to create wealth as the payouts generally act as a hedge against uncertainty and simultaneously provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis.Three Airline Stocks in FocusIn view of the virtues associated with dividend paying companies, we have zeroed in on three airline stocks, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, they have raised their dividend payouts in the last 12 months.Delta Air Lines is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States and around the world. The company, based in Atlanta, GA, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has a dividend yield of 2.45%. Also, Delta has been consistently rewarding its shareholders through dividends since 2013. Notably, it has hiked dividend pay-outs significantly for four consecutive years since then. The latest hike was announced in May 2017, when the company’s board of directors approved a 50.6% dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 30.5 cents per share.Southwest Airlines with a Zacks Rank #3, is based in Dallas, TX. In May 2017, this low-cost carrier raised its cash quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 25% over the previous quarterly payout of 10 cents per share. The company has a dividend yield of 0.91%. Moreover, its past records substantiate the fact that Southwest Airlines has a stable dividend payment history. The company with a Value Score of B, has made dividend payments for more than 160 consecutive quarters.SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) operates a regional airline in the United States through its subsidiaries. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B. The carrier, with a dividend yield of 0.64%, has paid dividends for more than 80 quarters in succession. In February 2017, the company’s board of directors approved a 60% dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 8 cents per share.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

2117,LUV,"Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) wholly-owned subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, recently announced that its CEO Mark Dunkerley will retire in March 2018. He will be succeeded by Peter Ingram, the airline’s Chief Commercial Officer.Having joined the company in 2002, Dunkerley served the post since 2005 and his tenure has been one of the longest in the airline industry. Previously, he worked as an Executive at British Airways.Credit goes to Dunkerley for bringing about great changes to the company. A major step was expanding its international footprint across Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Earlier, the carrier depended primarily on demand from the U.S. mainland and the Hawaiian islands. Now international travel fetches around one-fourth of the airline’s revenues.Under Dunkerley’s leadership, the Hawaiian Airlines’ stock price increased six-fold from 2014 through 2016. The carrier’s net income has also risen in each of the preceding three years. Per FactSet survey, it is expected to be around $300 million this year.Notably, Ingram joined the company as Chief Financial Officer in 2005. Since 2011, he has been looking after marketing, sales and network planning among other operations.Once assuming office as a CEO, Ingram will be faced with a new challenge. For, Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) plans to begin service to Hawaii either in 2018 or 2019. This will pose stiff competition to Hawaiian Airlines in its key market.Investors seem to be skeptical about the news, evidently impacting the company’s shares.

2118,LUV,"GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) has reported lower-than-expected earnings but better-than-expected revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017.The company’s earnings per share (excluding 23 cents from non-recurring items) of 24 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents. While in the year-ago quarter, the company had reported a breakeven earnings figure.The bottom-line miss seems to have disappointed investors.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. QuoteOperational StatisticsTotal revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), measure of revenues generated per kilometer per passenger, climbed 8% year over year. While international RPK increased 9.2%, the metric on the domestic front gained 7.9%.Consolidated available seat kilometers (ASK), measuring an airline's passenger carrying capacity, expanded 3.5% year over year. This upside was attributable to 9.6% growth in international ASK. The same was up 2.8% on the domestic front.During the reported quarter, this Latin-American carrier’s total load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) was 81% compared with 77.6% a year ago, owing to capacity expansion outweighing traffic rise.Average fare at this Sao Paulo-based airline increased 4.9% while average yield per passenger improved 3.1%. Net passenger revenue per available seat kilometers (PRASK) rose 7.6% while net operating revenue per available seat kilometers (RASK) was up 8%, aiding the top line.

Both total volume of departures and seat strength available inched up 1.6% on a year-over-year basis.2018 & 2019 OutlookThe company expects capacity to rise between 1% and 3% in 2018 while the metric is projected to increase 5-10% in 2019. Additionally, total fleet size is estimated at 118 in 2018 and for 2019, between 122 and 124. Also, the volume of departures is anticipated to grow between 1% and 3% for the current year.

Going forward, we expect the company’s focus on capacity discipline to result in increasing its yields.Operating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin, a measure for the company's earnings ability, is estimated at around 11% this year whereas 13% for the metric is predicted next year. While EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin is anticipated at approximately 16% in 2018, the metric is likely to be around 18% in 2019.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGOL Linhas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2119,LUV,"Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) has recently provided an update on first-quarter 2018 and full-year guidance. The revised view comprises the estimated increased costs pertaining to the recently ratified pilot contract.Capacity measured in available seat miles (ASMs) is projected at an approximate rise of 21.7% in the first quarter, up from the previous outlook of 21.5% growth. Full-year outlook for the metric remains unchanged at an expansion of around 23%.Adjusted cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel is anticipated to fall 3% in the quarter under review from the prior projection of a decline between 5.5% and 6.5%.

2122,LUV,"The past week in the airline space was mostly about numbers, with several airline companies like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) reporting their respective third-quarter 2017 earnings results.Markedly, the common trend in the quarterly reports of the above-mentioned companies was the year-over-year decline in earnings due to higher costs. Apart from high labor costs, rise in oil prices also hurt the bottom line as fuel-related expenses increased. In addition to high costs, back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and the earthquake in Mexico also distorted the earnings picture.Despite the headwinds, most sector participants reported better-than-expected earnings per share in Q3. In view of these headwinds, the earnings per share estimates have been trimmed over the past few months.With the bar (pertaining to earnings estimates) being lowered significantly, courtesy the drastic downward revisions, it is of little surprise that most carriers have managed to beat the (highly conservative) Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter.Moreover, the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 4.5% to $106.42 over the past five trading days. This further substantiates the fact that the series of earnings beat in the airline space have failed to cheer investors.The only notable update on the non-earnings front came from the Airlines for America (“A4A“). The leading trade group, predicted that 28.5 million passengers will opt for air travel in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday period (Nov 17 – Nov 28), implying a 3% increase from the 2016 figure. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Oct 25, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

The bottom line, however, declined 5.4% on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenues of $5,271 million lagged the consensus mark of $5,296.6 million but improved 2.6% year over year.

In the reported quarter, total revenue per available seat mile decreased 6.3% (read more: Spirit Airlines Up on Q3 Earnings & Revenues Beat).5. Allegiant Travel Company’s third-quarter earnings per share came in at $1.39 per share, 2 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line, however, contracted 49.5% on a year-over-year basis, due to high costs.

According to a forecast by A4A, approximately 28.5 million passengers are expected to avail the services of U.S. airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday period this year, up 3% year over year. The forecast translates into 2.38 million fliers per day during the period, which is an increase of 69,000 from the comparable figure last year.Passenger volumes (on a daily basis) is projected to be in the range of 1.61 million to 2.88 million. The busiest day for the holiday period is expected to be Nov 26. The lightest travel day is expected to be the Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 23, 2017.

2125,LUV,"American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. It also has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 19.1%.However, this Fort Worth, TX-based carrier is likely to face turbulence in the third quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including the back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) have hurt the entire space.The above hurricanes caused the company to call off approximately 8,000 flights in the third quarter. This negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings being revised 20.6% downward over the last 90 days.Consequently, the stock has underperformed the Zacks Airline industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of American Airlines have gained 11.2% compared with the industry’s rally of 14.9%.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact American Airlines’ third-quarter results.Owing to multiple flight cancellations, the company expects third-quarter pre-tax earnings to be affected to the tune of approximately $75 million. The carrier expects pre-tax margin, excluding special items, in the range of 9-11%. Increased costs (fuel and labor) are expected to hit the bottom line. Cost per available seat miles, excluding special items, is estimated to increase at approximately 4.5% in the third quarter owing to salary and benefit increases to employees. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $1.64 and $1.69 in the quarter.Despite the disruptions, the scenario with respect to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) is an improved one from the year-ago quarter, courtesy better-than-expected yields. American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) for the third quarter to grow between 0.5% and 1.5%.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter TRASM is pegged at 14.98 cents, higher than 14.73 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter yields is pegged at 15.56 cents, higher than 15.27 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016.Apart from American Airlines, other carriers like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) are likely to be hurt by the natural calamities.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model also does not show conclusively that American Airlines will beat on earnings in third-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2127,LUV,"JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) reported unimpressive traffic data for the month of September. The low-cost carrier also provided an update pertaining to the expected impact of the devastating hurricanes (Irma and Maria) on its results for the third as well as fourth quarter of 2017.Notably, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — decreased 4.4% year over year to 3.28 billion. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) contracted 0.9% to 4.09 as well.Another important metric, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) decreased 300 basis points (bps) to 80.2% as the traffic contraction was more than that of capacity, thus leading to empty planes.Moreover, the company registered a completion factor (system wide) of 90.7% in September with 70.1% flights on schedule. On a year-to-date basis, this Long Island City, NY-based carrier posted a 3.7% increase in RPMs while ASMs rose 4.2%. Nonetheless, load factor fell 40 bps year over year to 84.8% as capacity expansion outweighed traffic growth.Hurricanes Likely to Dampen Q3 Results  JetBlue expects its top line to be hurt to the tune of $44 million in the third quarter of 2017, results of which are scheduled to be revealed on Oct 24. Additionally, operating income is likely to be adversely impacted in the range of $30 million to $35 million.

Owing to the weather-related setbacks ASMs have been trimmed to the tune of approximately 2.7 percentage points.Also, revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) is anticipated to increase approximately 0.9% in the quarter under review (the metric has been positively impacted to the tune of approximately 0.3 percentage points owing to the hurricanes).Furthermore, the hurricanes have increased the projection for unit costs, excluding fuel, to the tune of approximately 2.75 percentage points. The metric is expected to grow between 2.75% and 3.25% for the quarter. Fuel cost per gallon is projected to be $1.71.Irma and Maria to Mar Q4 Results tooJetBlue has significant exposure to Florida with two hubs in the state — Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, besides a hub in Puerto Rico. Naturally, the company’s operations have been significantly hurt by Irma and Maria. As a result, its fourth-quarter results are likely to be dampened due to the disruptions.Currently, the low-cost carrier expects the negative impact of the hurricanes on its top line to vary between $70 million and $90 million in the final quarter of 2017.  Operating income is also likely to be adversely impacted between $50 million and $70 million. The fourth-quarter bottom-line is expected to be hurt in the band of 10 cents to 13 cents.Capacity growth is trimmed to the tune of approximately 3 percentage points, owing to less flights to the Caribbean region following the calamities. RASM growth is expected to be hurt between 1% and 2% in the final quarter of 2017, mainly due to Irma’s impact.Notably, JetBlue is not the only carrier to be hurt by the natural calamities. Operations of fellow-carriers like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) have also been disrupted by the turbulence.Price PerformanceJetBlue has been hurt by multiple headwinds like high costs apart from the recent natural calamities. Consequently, the stock has underperformed its industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have declined 8.4%, as against its industry’s rally of 16.3%.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderJetBlue carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

2128,LUV,"The third-quarter earnings have drawn to a close for the airline companies. Notably, most carriers have managed to surpass estimates in the reported period, despite back-to-back natural calamities, primarily owing to reduced expectations.However, the broader scenario does not seem so bright for the companies with earnings having declined massively on a year-over-year basis. Q3 ResultsThe third quarter of 2017 saw major airline companies like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) topping earnings estimates. However, earnings decreased on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs. At Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines, the bottom line declined 7.6% and 5.4%, respectively, while at United Continental, the metric decreased 28.6%. American Airlines too reported a significant reduction in earnings in the quarter. The hurricanes have significantly disrupted operations of the airlines. The multiple flight cancellations as well as continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to Hurricane Harvey have hampered the companies’ top line. Southwest Airlines’ Passenger revenues per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) slid 1.4%, while RASM (revenues per available seat mile) was down 0.5% year over year.United Continental’s top line also slipped 0.4% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which had to cancel 8,300 flights in the quarter under review due to weather-related disturbances, reported a 3.7% fall in PRASM. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.High Costs Hitting AirlinesPersistent high costs pertaining to fuel and labor have been hurting the bottom-line growth of airline stocks for quite some time now. Further, adding to the woes, Harvey contributed to an increase in oil prices. Higher fuel prices are expected to limit the earnings growth of the carriers in the fourth quarter as well. Also, with most carriers inking multiple labor deals, such costs have been on a rise of late. In fact this downside has been denting the earnings picture for the airlines over the past few quarters and the fourth quarter is likely to be no exception.Bearish Q4 and Full-Year View Several airline companies have provided a grim outlook for the final quarter of 2017 as well as the full year. United Continental expects consolidated PRASM to decline between 1% and 3% (year over year) in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, the company anticipates unit costs (excluding Fuel, Profit Sharing & Third Party business costs) to increase in the band of 2.5-3.5% due to higher labor and fuel costs. Average fuel price per gallon (consolidated) is projected between $1.80 and $1.85. For the fourth quarter of 2017, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) expects consolidated operating cost per available seat mile (excluding fuel) to grow in the band of 5-7%. For 2017, the metric is projected to grow in the 4-5% range. RASM is anticipated to grow in the range of (3%) to 0% on a year-over-year basis.Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) anticipates total revenues per available seat mile (TRASM) to decline 4-6% in the fourth quarter.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) predicts CASM (cost per available seat mile), excluding fuel, to rise significantly for the ongoing quarter, primarily due to higher labor costs. Fuel cost per gallon (economic) is anticipated in the range of $1.75-$1.85 for the fourth quarter, whereas the metric is expected in the $1.65-$1.75 band for 2017.Price PerformanceThe dull outlook for the airlines is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline Industry has underperformed the broader market in the last three months. While the S&P 500 Index has gained 4.1%, the industry has declined 2.1%. Zacks Industry Rank Denotes the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 201 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the woes of the airlines. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 21% of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Using a week’s rebalance for over 10 years now, the top half has been beating the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankZacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

2129,LUV,"Last week, Latin American carriers — GOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings (CPA  -  Free Report) — reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for the third quarter of 2017. This outperformance was attributed to improvement in the Latin American economy. The results were also aided by strong demand for air travel.On the non-earnings front, the major airline players like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) revealed their respective October traffic numbers in the previous week. While load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined at JetBlue and United Continental due to capacity overexpansion, the metric improved at Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines as capacity expansion was outweighed by traffic growth in the same month.Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) decision to end flights to Cuba also invited attraction. On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index was almost flat at $104.98 over the last five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Nov 08, 2017). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. GOL Linhas’ earnings per share of $1.49 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents, aided by higher revenues. In the year-ago quarter, this Latin-American carrier had reported breakeven earnings. Net sales, comprising of cargo and passenger revenues, came in at $858.8 million (R$2.7 billion) surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $783.3 million.The top line expanded 13.2% on a year-over-year basis on the back of strong demand for air travel. Additionally, it provided an upbeat outlook for 2017 (read more: GOL Linhas Beats on Q3 Earnings & Revenues, Stock Up).2. Copa Holdings’ third-quarter earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $2.38 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16. The bottom line came in ahead of the year-ago figure of $1.30 per share. Quarterly revenues improved 15.6% on a year-over-year basis to $657 million and also topped the consensus mark of $633 million.The year-over-year increase in the top line was primarily due to a 16.5% improvement in passenger revenues. While passenger unit revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) improved 3.1%, yield per passenger mile advanced 1.3%. Unit revenue per available seat mile (RASM) improved 2.4%. Operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, declined 1.2% in the quarter.Passenger traffic (on a consolidated basis) rose 14.9% and capacity was up 13% in the same quarter. Load factor expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 85.7% as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  3. Alaska Air Group was the latest U.S.-based carrier to terminate its operations to Cuba. The carrier will operate its last Los Angeles-Havana flight on Jan 22, 2018. The tweaked Cuba policy announced by President Trump earlier this month might also have played a part in Alaska Air's decision. The new policy prohibits individual travel to the island nation among other things. Meanwhile, the likes of American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways have already trimmed their services to the nation. Also, lower-than-expected demand caused the likes of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines to terminate their flights to Cuba. 4. At Spirit Airlines, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — came in at 2.1 billion, up 21.6% on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also expanded 21.2% to 2.53 billion.Load factor increased to 83.2% from 82.9% recorded in October 2016. The improvement was owing to traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion for the same month (read more: Spirit Airlines' October Traffic and Load Factor Increase). 5. While revealing its October traffic data, United Continental reiterated its fourth quarter guidance for passenger unit revenues. The metric is still expected to decline in the band of 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. The carrier suffered a decline in load factor for the month as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth (read more: United Continental's October Traffic Up, Load Factor Down). 6. JetBlue Airways reported a 3.7% increase in October traffic. Load factor decreased in the month as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion (6.8%). The low-cost carrier still expects RASM for the fourth quarter of 2017 in the range of a decline of 3% to flat year over year (read more: JetBlue Airways' October Traffic Rises, Load Factor Falls).7. October traffic at Southwest Airlines improved 1.9%, while capacity expanded 1.7%. Load factor increased 10 basis points to 85.8% in the same month. On a year-to-date basis, Southwest Airlines witnessed a 3.5% rise in RPMs. Also, ASMs grew 3.9%. As a result, the load factor decreased 30 basis points to 83.8%.

2130,LUV,"The last week saw key airline players like JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) announcing their respective third-quarter 2017 numbers. While JetBlue and United Continental outperformed with respect to both earnings and revenues, Hawaiian Holdings reported mixed results. This Honolulu County, HI-based carrier reported better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenues.Despite the earnings beat, shares of United Continental fell approximately 12% on Oct 19. The lack of clarity provided by the company, on the conference call, pertaining to its efforts to check costs and boost revenues disappointed investors. Consequently, the stock tumbled, registering its biggest one-day percentage decline in eight years.European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) also grabbed headlines by virtue of its dispute with pilots. Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), featured in the news by virtue of the decision to expand its San Diego service.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 2.4% to $110.24 in the past five days, mainly due to the issues related to United Continental.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Oct 17, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

The company’s earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) came in at $2.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. Earnings were, however, 28.6% lower than the year-ago figure due to higher costs (read more: United Continental Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates).2. JetBlue Airways’ third-quarter 2017 earnings of 55 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.  Quarterly earnings, however, declined 5.2% from the year ago figure due to higher costs. The recent hurricanes also hurt results. Operating revenues came in at $1,813 million, just ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,809.3 million. In fact, the top line increased 4.7% from the year-ago figure (read more: JetBlue's Q3 Earnings Top, Fall Y/Y on High Costs).3. Hawaiian Holdings’ third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.92 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85. Quarterly revenues of $719.6 million, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $720.6 million. While earnings per share were flat, revenues increased on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenue per available seat mile in the quarter climbed 5.8% year over year. However, the metric is projected to be down 1% to up 2% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2017. For full-year 2017, the same is forecasted to grow in the band of 5% to 6%.Capacity is projected to grow between 4% and 6% in the final quarter of 2017. CASM, excluding fuel, is also projected to rise significantly for the ongoing quarter primarily due to the higher labor costs. Fuel cost per gallon (economic) is anticipated in the band of $1.75-$1.85 for the fourth quarter. The metric is expected in the band of $1.65 to $1.75 for full-year 2017.4. According to a Reuters report, most pilots at the company’s largest base rejected the offer from the management pertaining to better pay and working conditions. This marks a setback for the company as it grapples with pilot shortages. The issue had disrupted operations, leading to multiple flight cancellations in the last few weeks.5. In a bid to expand further along the West Coast, Alaska Airlines started operating new daily non-stop flights to Albuquerque from October 18. Markedly, Albuquerque is sixth new non-stop destination from San Diego since August for this low-cost carrier.

2132,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In the second quarter of 2017, the carrier’s earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) of $1.24 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20. The bottom line also improved 4.2% on a year-over-year basis. Operating revenues of $5,744 million was marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,733.2 million.However, this Dallas-based low-cost carrier is likely to face turbulence in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s third-quarter results are expected to be hurt due to the recent hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and the earthquake in Mexico. These natural disasters have forced the airline to cancel approximately 5,000 flights. Markedly, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has moved down 22.3% over the last 90 days.Consequently, the stock has struggled so far this year underperforming the Zacks Airline industry  over the last six months. Shares of Southwest Airlines have gained 5.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 5.9%. Let's delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Southwest Airlines’ third-quarter results.Owing to the multiple flight cancellations, the company expects third-quarter operating revenues are likely to be hurt to the tune of $100 million. Moreover, the carrier expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) in the quarter to be flat to down 1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter passenger unit revenues is pegged at 12.33 cents, lower than 13.03 cents reported in the second quarter of 2017.Increased costs (fuel and labor) are expected to hurt the bottom line. Cost per available seat miles, excluding special items, is estimated to increase between 3% and 4%. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $2.00 and $2.05 in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price is pegged at $2.00 per gallon, higher than $1.93 reported in the second quarter of 2017.Apart from Southwest Airlines other carriers like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) are also likely to be hurt by the natural calamities.We are, however, appreciative of the company's efforts to enhance its shareholders‘ wealth through dividends and share buybacks. At its annual meeting of shareholders, Southwest Airlines announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase program worth $2 billion. Notably, share repurchases benefit a company’s earnings per share by lowering outstanding share count.What Does Our Model Say?Our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Southwest Airlines in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. However, this is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Southwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of -0.61%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Southwest Airlines’ Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.A Transportation GemWith Southwest Airlines likely to disappoint, investors interested in the broader transportation sector may consider Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) as our model shows that it possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the current reporting cycle.Norfolk Southern has an Earnings ESP of +0.59% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2134,LUV,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers.

The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2135,LUV,"Shares of United (UAL  -  Free Report) sunk over 11% on Thursday after the airline announced it will continue to expand its flying capacity amid a rise in overall operating expenses.United, one of the largest U.S. airline companies, reported third-quarter earnings and revenues that beat expectations on Wednesday—in the face of the recent series of tropical storms and hurricanes that forced the company to cancel thousands of flights (also read: United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates).United canceled 8,300 flights due to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, which cost the company an estimated $185 million and helped lead to a 0.4% decline in revenues. On top of that, the company’s earnings plummeted 29.6%, while net income sunk 34%.Tropical storms clearly damaged the Chicago-based airline giant’s bottom line. But what has investors worried isn’t the wave of hurricanes, it’s the increased competition that has forced the airline company’s costs to rise.United’s operating expenses climbed 6% to $8.8 billion in the third quarter, while consolidated unit cost per available seat mile rose 3%. The company cited higher labor expenses and fuel costs as a reason for the big jump in these costs.The company’s passenger revenues per available seat mile also fell well over 3%. And United now projects its unit revenues will sink between 1% and 3% in its fourth quarter.Consequently, United will reportedly bump up capacity by 3.5% in the fourth quarter, in order to maintain its market share at major airport hubs.The move comes amid shrinking profits as low-cost airlines, such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), drive down ticket costs and lure passengers away from larger, more expensive carriers.Investors now fear that United will have a harder time boosting its bottom line as it spends more to fight off the new wave of competition. Shares of United fell on Wednesday and now rest about 28% below their 52-week high. United is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Other Airlines United’s struggle to increase profits amid greater competition caused turbulence throughout the U.S. airline industry—where even its new, low-cost opponents sunk on Thursday as the fight for passengers heats up.Shares of Spirit tanked over 3.70%, while fellow budget-minded carriers JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) saw their stock prices dip marginally. Big U.S. airline companies Delta (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) sank 1% and 2%, respectively. The US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) suffered a 1.30% decline.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2136,LUV,"Shares of Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) surged on Tuesday after the company announced in a SEC filing that it raised its third-quarter revenue per available seat mile guidance.The low-cost airliner now expects to experience a roughly 6.5% year-over-year decline in RASM in its third quarter, instead of Spirit’s previously projected guidance of a roughly 7% to 8.5% drop off.Spirit upped its guidance for the highly important metric in its 8-K filing yesterday based in part on improved “ticket and non-ticket yields and better-than-expected load factor.”Spirit offered up its previous RASM projection of up to an 8.5% decline in September amid concerns that the wave of hurricanes would hurt the airline more than it now expects.The company’s adjusted cost per available seat mile without accounting for the cost of fuel is projected to be flat or fall only marginally, compared to its previous estimate of up to a 3% decline.Still, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria greatly impacted Spirit. The storms forced the airline to cancel over 1,650 flights, which cost Spirit about $40 million. In September alone, Spirit canceled approximately 1,400 flights. Yet September revenue passenger miles jumped by 5.9% based on an 8.9% gain in overall capacity. In its third quarter, the company announced that it raised total available seat miles by 18%.This updated projection, coupled with a big increase in overall capacity, helped send shares of Spirit up over 8% on Tuesday morning. The company’s stock price has slipped back a bit since then and now hovers around 5% higher. Even with today’s gains Spirit stock sits roughly 42% below its 52-week high of $60.40 per share. The company is set to report its third-quarter results Tuesday, Oct. 24.Other Airlines Spirit’s updated quarterly guidance helped lift other airline stocks as well. The renewed faith that the massive tropical storms and hurricanes might not have impacted airlines as much as previously expected has seen JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report) stock gain 0.50%, while United (UAL  -  Free Report) popped just over 0.50% as well.Shares of Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) gained over 2.70%, while Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) saw much more marginal gains. Shares of the US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) climbed slightly.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2137,LUV,"Stocks in the airline space have been going through tough times of late. Major airline companies are severely hurt from the consecutive impacts of Harvey and Irma. Consequently airline stocks have lowered their guidance for the upcoming quarter.The airline companies are expected to reveal third-quarter 2017 earnings numbers next month. With the tropical storms bearing heavily on the airline companies, the scenario for future looks very grim.Bleak Third-Quarter ForecastsSeveral airline companies have trimmed their third-quarter outlook, primarily due to natural disasters.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, the worst hit from Harvey has reduced views with respect to pre-tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter. The carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3% and 5% year over year (the earlier guidance provided in July had called for the metric to be in the range of +1% to -1%).The carrier currently expects pre-tax margin between 8% and 10% (previous outlook had called for the metric to be in the range of 12.5-14.5%). Higher fuel prices are also estimated to hamper the bottom line in the third quarter. Fuel price per gallon is now projected in the band of $1.72-$1.77 (earlier view: $1.56-$1.61). Cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, profit-sharing, third-party business expenses and other special items are now projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% (earlier outlook had called for a rise in the 2-3% range).The Chicago-based company now expects capacity to grow between 3% and 3.5% compared with the approximate 4% expansion projected earlier.Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) with significant exposure to Houston expects the top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to natural calamity. Currently, Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the current quarter to fall between 7% and 8.5% (the earlier guidance had called for a drop in the band of 2-4%). Aggressive competitive pricing in key markets also contributed to this bleak forecast.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) also trimmed outlook for the third quarter due to stiffer competition and higher fuel costs. The carrier now estimates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to improve in the range of 2-3%. Past view had called for growth in the 2.5-4.5% band. The airline also raised outlook for fuel prices to $1.68-$1.73 from the earlier $1.55-$1.60 bracket on the back of upsurge in market price, which began in late July.Apart from the above carriers, the likes of JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also cut their respective unit revenue views for the third quarter. American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) expects TRASM to grow at a slower pace in the third quarter due to difficult year-over-year comparisons.High Labor CostsSteep labor costs have been hitting the airline stocks for quite some time now. In fact, the future scenario also seems dull and the metric is expected to affect the third-quarter results as well.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 202 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the plight of the airlines.

2138,LUV,"Declining air fares have hurt airline stocks for quite some time now. In fact, the ticket prices decreased in almost every month of 2016, with the sharpest decline recorded in July. The same has been weak in 2017 as well.Markedly, the August reading on air fares in the United States further highlights the scenario. Even though, the low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies.What the Data SaysAccording to data released by the Bureau of Transportation Services, in the United States average air fares (adjusted) in August fell 3.2% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the August reading marked the second successive month of price weakness. Also, air fares decreased 6.1% (unadjusted) in the same month on a month-on-month basis.According to research firm Hopper, air fares (roundtrip) in the United States are likely hit a low of $216 in October. The reading in the current month is projected to be $217, down 2.1%, from the August figure.Price War Between Legacy and Low-Cost CarriersThe emergence and subsequent success of low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) have rung alarm bells as far as the likes of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) are concerned. In fact, the price war has contributed to the softness in ticket prices.Furthermore, in a bid to attract budget conscious passengers, American Airlines and United Continental had introduced Basic Economy Fares (low-priced tickets) earlier in 2017. Recently, American Airlines expanded the offering in order to compete more effectively with low-cost carriers.In fact, United Continental acknowledged the price war with discount carriers like Spirit as one of the reasons behind trimming its passenger unit revenue guidance for the third quarter.Capacity OverexpansionCapacity overexpansion may lead to oversupply in the market and is one of the contributing factors behind suppressed air fares.The August traffic reports of the likes of JetBlue, Spirit and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) revealed that capacity expanded at a higher pace than traffic. Consequently, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined in the month at the above- mentioned carriers. Currently, Allegiant Travel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The July traffic reports also unveiled declining load factors for most carriers.International Air Transport Association’s (“IATA”) forecast for 2017 further highlights the declining air fares in the United States. The association predicts capacity expansion of 4.4% in North America to be higher than 4% projected growth in passenger demand.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnOil Prices Still WeakDespite the recent surge in oil prices, which might be due to affects of Harvey, the commodity is still trading at around $50 a barrel. We note that the level is way below the over $100 a barrel mark witnessed in 2014.According to Hopper, even though Jet fuel prices increased 8.5% in August to $1.54, the reading was approximately half the high witnessed in February 2014. Soft oil prices are being cited as one of the main reasons for declining air fares.Falling Airfares Contributes to Busy Labor DayThe sharp fall in air fares is an encouraging piece of news for fliers. In sync with this, soft ticket prices made air travel more affordable on Labour Day, thus attracting many fliers. This was, in fact, evident from the bullish Labor Day forecast by Airlines for America. According to the organization, approximately 16.1 million passengers were expected to be transported through U.S. airlines during the Labor Day holiday period this year, up 5% year over year.Per the IATA, inflation-adjusted airfare had fallen 1% on a year-over-year basis in the first half of 2017, which further substantiates softness in ticket prices in the United States.ConclusionGiven the present backdrop, we don’t expect an upsurge in ticket prices in the next few months. This, in turn, is likely to hurt the top line of airline stocks, thereby adding to the woes of carriers, which are already reeling under multiple tailwinds like high costs and weather-related disruptions. Whatever be the outcome, we anticipate investor focus to remain on this burning issue of air ticket prices, going forward.New Report: An Investor’s Guide to CybersecurityCyberattacks have become more frequent and destructive than ever.

2142,LUV,"Last week, airline behemoth Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) issued an outlook with respect to passenger unit revenue and operating margin for the third quarter of 2017, showing a less severe-than-expected impact of the Hurricane Irma. The stock gained on issuance of the view.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) issued a grim outlook for the third quarter owing to the hurricanes and the earthquake in Mexico. These natural calamities also forced the airline to cancel approximately 5,000 flights.Notably. American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) also featured in the headlines by virtue of its bullish Investor Day presentation.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased 4.9% at $112.69 over the past week, on the back of Delta’s encouraging commentary.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1 Delta expects passenger unit revenue to increase approximately 2% in the third quarter of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. The guidance includes a negative impact of Irma to the tune of 1 point. Operating margin for the third quarter is projected between 15.5% and 16.5% Hurricane Irma is likely to impact the metric to the tune of approximately 120 million.In September 2017, Delta had projected passenger unit revenue to increase between 2% and 3%, and operating margin was forecast in the 16.5%-17.5% range. Those projections were made before Irma disrupted its operations leading to cancellations of 2,200 flights at Delta.Consequently, the fresh projections, though numerically weaker than the previous ones, pleased investors as the impact of Irma on the company’s financials was softer than expected. Fuel price per gallon in the third quarter of 2017 is expected between $1.68 and $1.73. Delta unveiled the projections while releasing its traffic data for the month of September.While traffic (total system) increased 0.3% year over year, capacity expanded 0.6% for the month. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined 20 basis points to 84.4% in the month as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion. 2. Southwest Airlines expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to be flat to down 1% year over year. The metric was earlier projected in the range of down 1% to slightly up. Operating revenues in the third quarter are likely to be hurt to the tune of $100 million owing to the natural disasters.This low-cost carrier expects capacity in the third quarter to expand approximately 3% on a year-over-year basis. The metric is now expected to increase between 3.5% and 4% from the earlier projected increase in the 4% to 5% range. Fuel price (economic) per gallon is still projected between $2.00 and $2.05. Unit cots (excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing costs) are projected to increase between 3% and 4%.3. American Airlines stated at its Investor Day that it expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) in the third quarter to grow at 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. The company projects third-quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items, to vary between 8.5% and 10.5%. Prior view was in the range of 10%-12%.However, its long-term view was very encouraging. The carrier’s efforts to modernize its fleet are impressive as well. The company is on track to introduce 496 new planes in its fleet by the year-end.4.  The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in Las Vegas on Oct 1, 2017.

2143,LUV,"The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in Las Vegas on Oct 1, 2017.The massacre at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino reportedly claimed 59 lives apart from injuring many. The shooter, identified as Stephen Paddock from Nevada, opened fire from the 32nd floor at the audience of the music concert.Initial reports suggest that the Las Vegas gunman, who is also dead, did not bear allegiance to any terrorist organization and acted alone.  However, the indiscriminate shooting, is an act of terror according to laws in the state of Nevada.Airlines Swing Into ActionFollowing the gruesome incident, flights to and from Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport were temporarily halted. However, services have been resumed and the airlines that have exposure to the McCarran International Airport have swung into action.Allegiant Airlines, owned by Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report), was offering free flights to victims and their families. Shares of the company, which offers flights connecting Minot and Las Vegas, naturally took a hit and declined 1.3% on Oct 3. Currently, Allegiant Travel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The likes of United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) Virgin America and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) reportedly allowed waivers (with conditions attached) on travel charges for those intending to delay and rebook Las Vegas trips.What’s in Store for Airlines?It is a well-documented fact that acts of terrorism have the potential to ground airline stocks due to the possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears. In this regard, travel to Las Vegas is likely to be hurt in the next few days, thus impacting tourism as Las Vegas is a favorite tourist spot. As a result, travel-focused stocks, which include airlines, are likely to be on the back foot.Unfortunately, acts of violence are on the rise and airline stocks were badly hurt previously. The Orlando mass shooting in June 2016 led to airline stocks crashing. Other acts of terror across the globe like 2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 Brussels attacks also spelt doom for airlines.Against this backdrop, we expect U.S. airline stocks to shed value due to waning travel demand to Las Vegas, at least in the short term. This will result in decline in top line. However, only time will tell the extent to which revenues are actually hurt. Therefore, we expect investor focus to remain on the issue, going forward.Airlines Already Reeling Under Multiple HeadwindsWhatever the final outcome, the timing of the mass shooting could not have been worse as airline stocks are already struggling due to various other factors. Evidently, back-to-back natural calamities (Harvey and Irma) disrupted airline operations significantly. Rising fuel costs are also hurting airlines. The headwinds are likely to adversely impact the third-quarter results of carriers.In fact, many U.S. carriers including the likes of American Airlines, United Continental, Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) have already trimmed their unit revenue views for the third quarter owing to the headwinds.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 233 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the plight of the airlines. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 9% of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over a decade, using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankPrice PerformanceThe dim outlook of the airlines is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline Industry has underperformed the broader market in the last three months. The industry has declined 4.7% against the S&P 500's gain of 3.7%With stocks in the airline space already struggling, the Las Vegas shooting incident might hamper the travel plans to one of the most attractive tourist spots, which is a matter of concern for the sector participants.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2144,LUV,"Fuel costs account for a major chunk of an airline's operating costs. Hence, decline in fuel costs are a boon for any airline company. In such a scenario, operating expenses of carriers are significantly reduced, thereby boosting their bottom line through huge savings.However, fuel costs are on the rise lately, with oil prices crossing the $50 a barrel threshold mark. This upsurge can be attributed to the improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks. This upsurge, however, does not spell good news for carriers.Fuel Cost Outlook Raised by CarriersIt is a well-documented fact that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had disrupted airline operations significantly. Harvey contributed to an increase in oil prices due to gasoline shortages caused by the storm. Higher fuel prices are expected to limit earnings growth of carriers in the third quarter. United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) projects fuel price per gallon between $1.72 and $1.77 (earlier view: $1.56 to $1.61).Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) also lifted its forecast for fuel prices. The low-cost carrier expects fuel price (economic) per gallon between $2.00 and $2.05 (earlier projection was in the band of $1.95 and $2.00). Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) also raised its outlook for the same to $1.68-$1.73 from the earlier $1.55-$1.60 bracket, backed by rise in market price that began in late July.Labor Costs As noted above, decline in fuel costs over the last few years had been a boon for airlines. Evidently, the financial health of carriers had improved significantly by means of huge savings induced by low fuel costs.The financial prosperity of carriers had not gone unnoticed by their employees, who too were eager to get a share of the pie. This, in turn, propelled frequent new labor deals across the labor-intensive airline industry, thus increasing labor costs.This had dented the earnings picture for airlines over the past few quarters and the third quarter is likely to be no different. With upsurge in fuel costs, the bottom line of airline stocks are expected to dent further this time. Top Lines Likely to Be HurtMajor airline players like United Continental and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) had to call off multiple flights due to Harvey and Irma. This is likely to hurt their top line in the third quarter. Markedly, the airline companies like United Continental, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) also trimmed their unit-revenue outlook for the quarter, stung by these headwinds.As a result, Spirit Airlines expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $8.5 million. This view takes into account the multiple flights cancelled by the company as well as the continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to Harvey. Weak airfares are likely to pressurize revenues.ConclusionThe above commentary clearly suggests that turbulence is likely to affect airlines in the third quarter. Furthermore, the rise in fuel costs has proved to be a bane for carriers. In fact, according to the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), oil price in 2017 is projected at $54 per barrel for Brent Crude that is above $44.6 per barrel in 2016. This significant increase in the input costs for airlines highlights the gloomy days ahead for the sector participants.4 Stocks to Watch After Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

2145,LUV,"Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) posted a significant rise in air traffic for the month of August. Traffic – measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) – came in at 2.34 billion, up 20.6% on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also expanded 21.9% to 2.71 billion.However, load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers decreased to 86.2% from 87.1% recorded in August 2016. The decline was due to traffic growth, which was outpaced by capacity expansion.In fact, this low-cost carrier registered a completion factor (system wide) of 96.6% for the month with 76.9% flights on schedule. Notably, for the first eight months of 2017, Spirit Airlines registered a 13.5% increase in RPMs to 16.52 billion and a 16.4% rise in ASMs to 19.6 billion, both on a year-over-year basis. But load factor fell 210 basis points to 84.3% in the period.Earlier in September, the carrier trimmed its current-quarter outlook for total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM:  a key measure of unit revenue). Currently, this Miramar, FL-based company anticipates TRASM to decline between 7% and 8.5% (the previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 2% to 4%).Per Spirit Airlines, 100 basis points of the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey. Also, aggressive competitive pricing in its key markets contributed to the company’s bleak forecast.Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price  Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price | Spirit Airlines, Inc.

2146,LUV,"The airline industry has been struggling of late, especially from the back-to-back impact of Harvey and Irma. The airline stocks are lying low as investors begin to worry over their ability to recoup losses incurred from the onslaughts of successive calamities.Another source of pessimism surrounding the stocks comes in the form of persistent high labor costs. The rise in fuel costs is also worrisome for airlines.Harvey & Irma ImpactsHurricanes Harvey and Irma have had devastating effect on the airline industry. Thousands of flights were canceled and fuel costs inflated. As was widely expected, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, was the worst hit from Harvey as Houston is the carrier’s second-largest hub. More than 7,400 flights were called off at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, with operations suspended at the airport due to the inclement storm for more than four days.With the onset of Irma on the other hand, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) is expected to be the worst hit. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has two hubs at Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, apart from Puerto Rico. Following Irma, the carrier cancelled more than 860 flights. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bleak Third-Quarter ForecastsSeveral airlines companies have trimmed their third-quarter outlook, primarily due to the impact of the natural disasters.Most recently, American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) lowered guidance for the third quarter due to Irma’s devastating strike. The company now anticipates third-quarter 2017 total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) in the range of flat to up 1% year over year. Previous projection had called for a 0.5-2.5% rise in the metric. Due to higher fuel costs for the quarter, the company currently estimates third-quarter 2017 pre-tax margin, excluding special items, to vary between 8.5-10.5%. The prior view was in the range of 10-12%.Other major airline companies like United Continental Holdings, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation and Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have also reduced projections for the third quarter.Persistent High Labor CostsSteep labor costs have been hurting the airline stocks for quite some time now. In fact, the future scenario also seems grim and might hurt the third-quarter results as well.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 160 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the woes of airlines. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 38% of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankPrice PerformanceThe dull outlook of the airlines is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline Industry has underperformed the broader market in the last three months.

2148,LUV,"The International Air Transport Association released airline passenger demand metrics for the first month of the summer travel season late last week, and the results proved to be strong.However, the airline industry has fluctuated so far this summer. So let’s take a look at some of the biggest airline stocks as the vital summer travel season nears its end.Traffic DataIATA reported global passenger traffic data and demand for June on August 3. The firm announced that global passenger demand soared by 7.8% year-over-year based on passenger traffic data. According to previous reports, demand rose 7.7% in May.On top of June gains, the industry reached a 12-year high in traffic growth at 7.9% for the first six months of the year. The industry’s first half 80.7% load factor, a full flight measurement, reached an all-time high.Overall June capacity, measured in available seat kilometers, rose by 6.5%, while load factor gained 1% to 81.9%.“A brighter economic picture and lower airfares are keeping demand for travel strong,” IATA’s CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement. “But as costs rise, this stimulus of lower fares is likely to fade. And uncertainties such as Brexit need to be watched carefully. Nonetheless, we still expect 2017 to see above-trend growth.”June airline demand climbed 4.4% in North America and capacity rose 4.1%, while load factor grew marginally to 84.5%. Travel to North American was up, but travel to and in international destinations rose far more. European airlines traffic jumped 8.8% in June, and the region’s load factor rose 1.8% to 85.9%, which is the highest overall. Asia-Pacific, Latin American, and African airlines’ traffic all skyrocketed over 9% in June, with Africa posting the highest jump at 9.9%.With all of this increased traffic airline companies must be doing well, right?AirlinesDelta (DAL  -  Free Report), Air France-KLM (AFLYY  -  Free Report), Lufthansa , and Ryanair (RYAAY  -  Free Report) are all currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, and the airline transportation industry currently ranks in the top 7% of the 256 different industries that Zacks tracks.U.K. based Ryanair rests only slightly below its 52-week and all-time high. Lufthansa currently sits just $1 below its 52-week high water mark. However, the airline industry as a whole has suffered since mid-July.Some of the biggest U.S. airlines, Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report), United (UAL  -  Free Report), and American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), all fell less than 1% on Tuesday as part of a growing downward trend. Smaller carriers Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report), JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report), and Hawaiian (HA  -  Free Report) also dipped slightly.The US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report), which tracks the airline industry as a whole, fell as well. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) stock was also dragged down slightly along with the airline companies.July and August flight metrics won’t be reported for a while. But June flight demand, traffic, and load increases have not seemed to help airlines at the moment. So for now, investors might have to see if airline companies can turn heightened demand into soaring stock prices.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2151,LUV,"Stocks in the airline space have been struggling lately due to multiple headwinds like higher fuel costs and the havoc created by Harvey. However, major sector participants breathed a sigh of relief as the impact of Irma was not as severe as forecasted in Florida. In fact, Irma has been downgraded to a tropical depression.Carriers Fly High Led by American AirlinesBuoyed by the weaker-than-expected impact, most airline stocks flew high on Sept. 11 after being grounded lately. Major gainers included the likes of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report).With a high proportion of sector participants trading in the green, it was of little surprise that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index had a field day. The sector tracker ended the trading session at $107.69, up 2% from the closing price on Sep 8. In fact, the rally was not limited to airline stocks as major indices gained handsomely. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% to close the trading session at a record 2,488.11 with American Airlines leading the show. The Dow Jones Industrial average treaded past the 22,000 mark for the first time since mid-August. The Nasdaq Composite Index also closed at 6,432, gaining 1.1%.The surge was mainly owing to the change in course of Irma. Consequently, Miami and Orlando escaped the projected extreme devastation as the storm moved westward. Markedly, American Airlines, which has significant exposure to Florida and operates multiple flights from Charlotte and Miami on a daily basis, was naturally a big benefactor. The stock gained 5.2%, ending the trading session at $45.86.Delta and American Airlines Bullish on Q4In September 2017, many airline stocks including the likes of United Continental and Southwest Airlines had trimmed their respective unit revenue projections for the current quarter with the Harvey-induced revenue loss being the main culprit. The rise in fuel costs, which again may be Harvey-induced, also has not helped matters.However, airline heavyweights — Delta and American Airlines — sounded bullish regarding their prospects in the final quarter of the year.Last week, at the Cowen Global Transportation Conference, American Airlines had declared that it expects to perform better with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the fourth quarter compared with the current quarter.Moreover, the carrier forecasted lower year-over-year growth with respect to another key metric — cost per available seat miles — excluding fuel and other special items. The metric is expected to grow at approximately only 3% in the final quarter compared with the 5% growth projected in the current quarter.Delta also appeared to be optimistic about a rebound in the fourth quarter at the same investor conference, on the back of healthy demand for leisure travel. The bullish commentary of two of the biggest airline players in the United States bodes well for the sector, indicating that all is not lost with a rebound possible from the recent struggles.Both Delta and American Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Industry Rank Holds Out HopeThe Zacks Industry Rank of 87 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the fact that despite the recent struggles, the sector remains an attractive investment option. Notably, the favorable rank places the companies in the top 34% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankValuation Signals More UpsideThe impressive Zacks Industry Rank is well supported by the segment’s attractive valuation. Going by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry doesn’t look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 7.6, which is better than what the industry saw in the last five years. The ratio is almost near the low end of 5.1 during the period.Additionally, the reading compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 10.9 and the median level is 9.4. The industry’s favorable positioning compared to the overall market certainly signals more upside as well. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1.1% to close at 2,488.11. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,432.26, rising 1.1%.

This marked its biggest percentage gain since Apr 24. All of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors ended in the green, led by financials. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) advanced 1.7%.The financial sector gained from bullish sentiments following weaker than expected impact of Hurricane Irma. The hurricane was initially categorized as a Category 5 hurricane but lost strength after hitting the coast of Florida over the weekend. It has since been degraded to a tropical storm as the impact has been significantly lesser than what had originally been expected by the National Hurricane Centre.Biggest contributors to such gains were stocks of leading insurers..

Early last week, reports surfaced from South Korea that Pyongyang would test another missile over the weekend to celebrate its foundation day. In the event of North Korea not going ahead with the test, geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington were eased and markets were back to normal.Meanwhile, the United States urged the Security Council of the United Nations to impose fresh sanctions on North Korea. The Trump administration wants the United Nations to impose an oil embargo on Pyongyang. This gave rise to fresh tensions as North Korea reacted by saying that the U.S. would eventually pay a ‘due price’ for backing the imposition of sanctions on the Asian country.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

The House of Representatives passed the Bill on Friday, extending the debt-ceiling deadline through Dec 8, 2017. The legislation includes $15.25 billion for the relief of victims of Hurricane Harvey. The amount also provides for possible recovery efforts in case of any casualties after Hurricane Irma’s expected landfall over the weekend.On the economic data front, wholesale inventories for the month of July increased 0.6% from the previous period, whereas the consensus estimate was an increase of 0.4%.Weekly UpdateFor the week the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq declined 0.9%, 0.6% and 1.2% respectively. Reports from South Korea indicated that Pyongyang would test another missile over the weekend to celebrate their foundation day. Such news led investors to rotate out of financial stocks into bonds, leading to broad based losses. President Trump reached an agreement with key members of Congress to extend the debt ceiling deadline. This was done to aid the relief funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey. Meanwhile, Fed’s Vice Chairman announced his plans to retire in mid-October, citing ‘personal reasons’ behind his decision. Meanwhile, the ECB decided unanimously that interest rates would remain unchanged.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

2154,LUV,"The Q2 earnings season is in full swing with a deluge of companies reporting their financial numbers each day. The picture to have emerged so far is a rosy one with many companies reporting better-than-expected earnings per share. Moreover, the growth rate with respect to the bottom line is also a healthy one.In fact, this healthy picture is unlikely to fade, with our latest Earnings Trends report suggesting that stocks in the much sought-after S&P 500 Index will end the current reporting cycle with bottom-line expansion of 8.6%. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 4.7%.Notably, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to end Q2 in the green as far as bottom line expansion is concerned. One such sector is the highly diversified Transportation sector. The participants from this space are likely to end this quarter with the top and the bottom line expanding 9.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Both these figures compare favorably with the readings in Q1, when revenues grew 6.9% and earnings contracted 17.8%.Significantly, multiple tailwinds like an improved economy, a better job market scenario and better unit revenue trends have contributed to this bullish picture for the sector. Already, this space has seen strong Q2 earnings reports from key players like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) that have outperformed on both the fronts.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation sector eagerly await the Q2 earnings releases by major sector participants like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (ODFL  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) on Jul 27.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dallas-based, Southwest Airlines is a low-cost carrier, which have lesser chances of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in this quarter despite its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -1.67% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.18 per share is pegged at 2 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier as well. When we issued its Q2 earnings preview article, the company carried a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while the Earnings ESP remained the same.

2155,LUV,"In basketball, when a player hits a few shots in a row, he is said to have a “hot hand.” In finance, we call it “momentum.”Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks (i.e. stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times) to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift.At the core, momentum investing works on the principle of “Buy High, Sell Higher.”Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for momentum strategy to work. For instance, we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hoping that they will spring back to their original prices. On the other hand, many investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things gain clarity, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Also, unlike other investment styles, momentum premium has stood the test of time, remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s. This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums (like size and value) becomes known to public, the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes.Obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play. Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets, and we have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains.Our screen will help you take advantage of both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #150: This item selects the top 150 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks.

2156,LUV,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.In the first quarter, this low-cost carrier saw a negative earnings surprise of 1.61% owing to high labor costs. Operating revenues of $4,883 million marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,894.1 million. Revenues, however, increased 1.2% on a year-over-year basis. Let’s see what awaits the stock in the second quarter.Factors Likely at PlayWe note that labor costs have spiked due to the recent labor deals inked by the company. This, in turn, is expected to hurt the bottom line in the second quarter as well similar to the previous quarter. In fact, Southwest Airlines expects CASM – excluding fuel and oil expenses, special items and profit sharing expenses – to increase approximately 6% in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis.Currently, labor deals are in vogue in the airline space. Not only Southwest Airlines, but other players in the space like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have signed deals with various labor groups over the last few months. Additionally, rising fuel costs might also limit bottom-line growth at Southwest Airlines in the quarter.The company expects operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM) to increase in the band of 1% to 2%. In fact, we are optimistic about the company's efforts to enhance its shareholders’ wealth through dividends and share buybacks. Evidently, Southwest Airlines announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase program worth $2 billion.Simultaneously, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 25%. We expect an update on this issue at the second-quarter conference call.Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise  Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise | Southwest Airlines Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Southwest Airlines in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. However, this is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Southwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of -1.67% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.18 per share is pegged at 2 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Southwest Airlines currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.A Stock to ConsiderWith Southwest Airlines likely to disappoint, investors interested in the Airline sector may consider American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), since our model shows that it possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its next release.American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +2.19% and a Zacks Rank #1.

2157,LUV,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Delta operates 10 domestic hubs:Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportJFK International AirportNew York City’s La Guardia AirportBoston Logan International AirportLos Angeles International AirportMinneapolis-St. Paul International AirportSalt Lake City International AirportSeattle-Tacoma International AirportAnd three international hubs:Amsterdam Airport SchipholTokyo Narita International AirportParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport Frontier AirlinesFounded in 1994, Frontier Airlines is a popular, privately-held, ultra-low-cost carrier headquartered in Denver Colorado. It recently announced a huge route expansion, and Frontier is adding 21 new destinations and 85 new routes to its network. Additionally, Frontier is adding dozens of non-stop flights between other cities that it already serves. With this network increase, Frontier’s route map will grow to 82 cities by next summer. The airline operates out of one main hub:Denver International AirportAnd seven focus cities:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportCleveland Hopkins International AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportLas Vegas’ McCarran International AirportOrlando International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportTrenton-Mercer Airport JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)JetBlue is a popular low-cost airline option headquartered in Long Island in New York City. It serves 97 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. JetBlue was founded in 1998, and primarily uses Airbus and Embraer aircraft. JetBlue utilizes the old0fashioned point-to-point system, which carries passengers short distances with few connecting flights, the airline operates out of six domestic focus cities:JFK International AirportFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International AirportBoston Logan International AirportLong Beach AirportSan Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International AirportOrlando International Airport Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report)Touted as the world’s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines was launched in 1967 and is known for its Rapid Rewards frequent-flyer program. Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. While Southwest does not use the hub and spoke transportation model (it prefers the point-to-point system like JetBlue) the airline still operates out of 10 major domestic cities:Chicago Midway International AirportBaltimore-Washington International AirportMcCarran International AirportDallas Love Field AirportDenver International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportHouston’s William P. Hobby AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportOrlando International AirportLos Angeles International Airport United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chicago, United Continental Holdings is an airline holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which formed in a merger back in 2010. Operating more than 700 mainline aircraft, United Continental needs a lot of hubs. The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2158,LUV,"Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. But the question here is why? This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!This metric is also considered the most significant variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a vital role in determining share price movement.Earnings Estimates Shape Stock PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.So, what does earnings estimates symbolize? Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost controls. Thus, earnings estimates are a valuable tool for investors.

2159,LUV,"In the past week, airline behemoth Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) issued a bleak outlook with respect to passenger unit revenue and operating margin for the third quarter of 2017. Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) also unveiled a bearish current-quarter view with respect to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) mainly due to the disruptions induced by Harvey.Additionally, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report) unveiled its London schedule for the summer of 2018 in the same period. The Irish carrier, however, reiterated its Brexit-related fears.The week also saw a customer-friendly announcement from Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, because the company aims to form a codeshare agreement with Singapore Airlines.As if the disruptions caused by Harvey were not enough, Hurricane Irma has offered a fresh challenge to the airline companies. In fact, this latest natural calamity already resulted in cancellation of multiple flights to Caribbean cities.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined almost 1% at $105.06 over the past week, which was a day short on trading owing to the Labor Day holiday on Sep 4.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Aug 30, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair Holdings unveiled a busy London schedule for the summer of 2018, even as it reiterated Brexit-related fears. The schedule announced by the low-cost carrier features a record 68 routes. The carrier aims to transport 24.8 million customers from the three London airports — Stansted, Gatwick and Luton (read more: Ryanair Issues 2018 London Summer Roster Amid Brexit Fears).Meanwhile, the carrier also unveiled impressive traffic numbers for August. Traffic climbed 10% and load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 1% to 97% on the back of lower air ticket prices.Currently, Ryanair holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Spirit Airlines expects its top line to decline to the tune of approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to Harvey. This view takes into account the multiple flights cancelled by the company as well as the continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the natural calamity.In the current quarter, the company anticipates TRASM to decline between 7% and 8.5% (the previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 2% and 4%). In fact, per the company, 100 basis points of the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey. Also, aggressive competitive pricing in its key markets contributed to the bleak forecast.On a brighter note, the company revised its unit cost (non-fuel) guidance for the current-quarter favorably owing to better operational performance. Spirit Airlines now expects adjusted cost per available seat miles (CASM ex-fuel) to decline between 2% and 3% on a year-over-year basis (the previous guidance had projected the metric in the band of -1% and +1%).3. Delta reported a 6.9% rise in air traffic for August, while capacity expanded 2.7% for the month. Meanwhile, load factor increased 350 basis points to 87.9%.However, the carrier has lowered guidance for the third quarter of 2017 citing reasons like higher fuel costs and soft yields. Delta now anticipates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to increase in the band of 2-3%. Previous guidance had called for an increase in the 2.5-4.5% range. Operating margin is expected to improve in the range of 16.5-17.5% from the former 18-20% band. The airline, however, raised its outlook for fuel prices per gallon from $1.68 to $1.73 from the earlier $1.55 to $1.60 band. The uptick was driven by an increase in market price that began in late July.4.  Alaska Airlines stated that from Sep 27, members of Alaska Mileage Plan and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer loyalty programs will begin earning miles on the flights. Additionally, the carriers will form a codeshare partnership, subject to government approval. Notably, a codeshare deal allows sharing of flights. This implies that a passenger can avail any flight operated by either of the companies covered under the agreement, irrespective of the flight number (read more: Alaska Air Group Arm-Singapore Airlines Deal to Aid Flyers).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-0.5%-16.2%UAL-6.7%-16.2%GOL17%37%DAL-3.3%-6.2%JBLU-1.3%-5.6%AAL-3.5%-3.1%SAVE-13.1%-39.4%LUV-0.2%-10%CPA6.5%22.5%ALK-2.2%-22.4%                  The table above shows that all airline stocks barring GOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings traded in the red in the past week mainly due to the bearish events mentioned above.

2160,LUV,"Airline companies have been undergoing turmoil of late due to the recent extensive devastation caused by hurricane Harvey. It’s small wonder that the natural calamity has impeded travel globally, disrupting the airline operations. In fact, Harvey led to multiple flight cancellations. Further adding to the woes, airline stocks have been struck by an additional headwind.Reasons Behind The Stocks’ PlungeShares of major airline companies declined following Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s (DAL  -  Free Report) traffic report for August. Also, theNYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 1.4% at the close of business on Sep 5. Delta’s shares have dipped 3.5%, while shares of its peers namely, American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Company (LUV  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have sunk substantially.Delta reported a 6.9% rise in air traffic for August, while capacity expanded 2.7% for the ongoing month. On the other hand, load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers, increased 350 basis points to 87.9%.However, the carrier has lowered guidance for the third quarter of 2017 citing reasons like tougher competition and higher fuel costs. Surprisingly, it made no claims on either Hurricane Irma or Harvey having a bearing on the current scenario.The carrier now anticipates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to increase in the band of 2-3%. Previous guidance had called for an increase in the 2.5-4.5% range. Operating margin is expected to improve in the range of 16.5-17.5% from the former 18-20% band. The airline however, raised its outlook for fuel prices to $1.68-$1.73 from the earlier $1.55-$1.60 bracket on the back of upsurge in market price which began in late July.Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) too trimmed its view for revenue per available seat mile. The carrier estimates the metric to reduce to 7-8.5% in the third quarter of 2017. Prior guidance had anticipated a drop of 2-4%. The below-par guidance was mainly due to disruptions induced by Harvey.Other Headwinds On another warning note, airline companies feel skeptical about Hurricane Irma, that has already resulted in multiple flights to Caribbean cities being cancelled. The impact of the latest natural calamity on airline stocks is likely to increase further in the coming days .The decision of Warren Buffett, one of the most revered investors of all times, to cut his stakes from three airline heavyweights — Delta, United Continental and American Airlines — also points at the cloud of uncertainty looming over this key sector.Apart from recent challenges, high labor costs have hurt airlines for the last few quarters. With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups, it is of little surprise that expenses on this front are escalating, limiting bottom-line growth.Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry fared poorly due to the headwinds, thereby significantly underperforming the broader market in the last three months. The S&P 500 Index nudged up 1.5% as against the industry’s decline of 6.5%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

2161,LUV,"Even before the country could heave a sigh of relief post Hurricane Harvey, another storm started brewing in the open Atlantic Ocean. The new threat called Hurricane Irma has been accredited the Category 5 status (the highest degree) and is feared to be more disastrous than Harvey. It is expected to ravage the Caribbean islands and Florida this week. Florida announced a state of emergency.Below we highlight a few potential ETF and stock winners and losers from Irma.LosersInsurance Severe destruction is likely in Florida. Insured losses could be as high as $125 billion to $130 billion, as per an analyst at Barclays, quoted on Bloomberg. Property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Insurance stocks normally fall over 1% in the month, following the disaster caused by a Category 3 storm. So, the impact of Hurricane Irma on insurance stocks is anybody’s guess. Already, shares of property and casualty homeowners insurance companies like Universal Insurance Holdings Inc. UVE, Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc. HRTG and HCI Group Inc. HCI plunged about 14.6%, 17% and 20% on Sep 5. Reinsurers XL Group Ltd XL and Everest Re Group Ltd. RE too lost about 5.8% and 6.9%, respectively.Insurance companies like Chubb Limited CB, Allstate Corporation ALL, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU and Progressive Corp. PGR are also likely to be hit hard. Naturally, the insurance ETFs iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Fund (IAK  -  Free Report) andSPDR S&P Insurance ETF KIE will feel the brunt (see all Financials ETFs here).Transportation As per an article published on CNBC, a severe impact from Irma could roil rail and container activity, and crush infrastructure for transportation. Airlines started considering Florida airports for their Hurricane Irma change-fee waivers. American (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report), and Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) are some of the airlines doing this.As per the policy, “they permitted customers to make one change to their itineraries without paying change fees that can cost $200 or more per passenger.” Naturally, transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS may feel the pressure ahead.Cruise LinesSince Caribbean islands are famed for cruise trips, cruise stocks and ETFs deserve a special mention in this case. Operators are abandoning trips that haven’t left port.Carnival Corp. CCL, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) lost about 3.1%, 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, on Sep 5.  With this, PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment (PEJ  -  Free Report) and iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Discretionary ETF (CNDF) could feel a slight adverse impact as these funds have certain exposure to cruise lines (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).RestaurantsAnalysts are apprehensive that restaurants may see considerable sales reduction and destruction due to Irma. A Canaccord analyst said that some restaurants have considerable exposure to Florida. Among these, Fiesta Restaurant Group Inc. FRGI (37% exposure), Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. (RUTH) (21% exposure), Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) (19% focus), BJ's Restaurants BJRI (12%), Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) (11%), Ruby Tuesday Inc. (RT) (10%) and Brinker International Inc. (EAT) (10%) have a double-digit focus. These stocks lost in the range of 0.4% to 5% on Sep 5. USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund  would thus be on high alert.GainersAgriculture Three agricultural commodities, namely orange juices, cotton and lumber, saw price rises in recent trading. Key cotton-producing areas around the Gulf Coast have already suffered from flooded fields caused by Hurricane Harvey. Crops in parts of Georgia and South Carolina will also be at risk of yield losses from Irma, as per MDA and quoted on Bloomberg. As a result, cotton prices rallied. iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN jumped about 7.3% on Sep 5.Lumber prices surged on apprehensions of damage. This should act as a tailwind foriShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD  -  Free Report) while orange prices skyrocketed as Florida is key growing region of oranges.Home Retailers The condition of houses in an area ravaged by a massive storm with 180 mile-per-hour winds can well be imagined. So, home improvement retailers like Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) (up 1.43% on Sep 5) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW) (up 1.4%) are in a bright spot. ETFs like Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) and PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction (PKB  -  Free Report) should also benefit (read: Home Retailer ETFs Set to Gain After Harvey).Infrastructure First Harvey, and now Irma should shower gains on infrastructure stocks as re-building will push up their demand. So, companies dealing in building materials should see a surge. The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) have high chances of outperforming.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2162,LUV,"The past week saw Latin American carriers – GOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings (CPA  -  Free Report) – reporting their respective earnings numbers for second-quarter 2017. Even though GOL Linhas reported better-than-expected earnings per share, the bottom line contracted on a year-over-year basis due to elevated costs. Copa Holdings topped expectations, both with respect to earnings and revenues.On the non-earnings front, the last week saw premier trade organization – Airlines for America (A4A) – revealing a bright forecast for U.S. carriers. It is anticipated that the U.S. airlines will make hay during the upcoming Labor Day travel period (Aug 30-Sep 5), with travel demand projected to increase 5% on the back of low air fares and improving disposable income.Moreover, the likes of American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) announced their respective July traffic numbers. While American Airlines and JetBlue witnessed a decline in their respective load factors (percentage of seats filled by passengers), the measure improved at Southwest, as capacity expansion was outweighed by traffic growth for the month at the Dallas-based low-cost carrier.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index decreased marginally to $110.18 over the past week. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Aug 09, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. GOL Linhas’ second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 24 cents per share compared favorably to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 60 cents. However, the bottom line plummeted 51.02% on a year-over-year basis due to higher expenses on aircraft fuel. Net revenue, comprising cargo and passenger revenues, came in at $696.2 million (R$2.2 billion), up significantly year over year. While cargo revenues increased 16.7%, passenger revenues improved 5.3% (read more: GOL Linhas Q2 Earnings Decline, Revenues Rise Y/Y).This apart, the carrier reported air traffic numbers for the month of July. Consolidated traffic – measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) – increased 6.3% to 3.65 billion in July 2017 from 3.44 billion, recorded a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 7.9% to 4.46 billion, thanks to the rise of 7.9% and 8% in domestic and international capacity, respectively (read more: GOL Linhas' July Traffic Rises, Load Factor Falls).2. According to a forecast made by A4A, approximately 16.1 million passengers are expected to avail services of the U.S. airlines on Labor Day this year. The report states that approximately 15.4 million people were estimated to have taken to the skies in the Labor Day travel period last year. To meet the surge in demand, carriers are looking to expand their capacity, with 133,000 seats projected to be added per day. According to the report, Sep 1 is expected to be the busiest day for air travel in the period, with Aug 31 and Sep 4 projected to come in second and third respectively.3. Copa Holdings’ second-quarter earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $1.48 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42. Earnings also came well above the year-ago figure of 51 cents per share. Quarterly revenues improved 16.8% year over year to $578.1 million. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $548 million.The year-over-year increase in the top line was primarily due to a 17.5% improvement in passenger revenues. Passenger unit revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) improved 8.2%, whereas yield per passenger mile advanced 3%. Operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, increased marginally in the quarter. Unit revenue per available seat mile (RASM) improved 7.5%.Passenger traffic (on a consolidated basis) climbed 14.1% and capacity was up 8.6% during the quarter. Load factor expanded 390 basis points (bps) to 82.2% as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  4. American Airlines witnessed a 0.8% rise in traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), for the month of July to 21.9 billion. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) inched up 1.9% to 26.0 billion.  However, the load factor decreased to 84.3% from 85.2% recorded in July 2016, as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth (read more: American Airlines' July Load Factor Falls, Stock Declines).5. Southwest Airlines posted a 6% rise in July traffic to around 12.4 billion. Capacity increased 5.5% to 14.2 billion. Load factor improved 40 basis points (bps) to 87.3% in July. The company continues to expect third-quarter 2017 RASM growth of around 1% (read more: Southwest Airlines July Traffic Rises, View Intact).6. JetBlue Airways posted a significant rise in air traffic for July. Traffic improved 5.1%, while capacity expanded 5.9%, leading to a decline in load factor for the month.

2163,LUV,"Last week witnessed that quite a few key airline players including the likes of United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) trim their respective projections on current-quarter unit revenues. This was mainly due to weather-related disruptions and the rising fuel prices.Notably, Irma gradually has been losing intensity and the damage caused by it has been less severe on Florida than projected. The likes of Alaska Air Group ALK and American Airlines also unveiled their respective traffic data for August during the week. Also, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) grabbed headlines by virtue of its expansion related update.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index climbed 4.7% to $108.59 over the past week as airline stocks regained strength following Irma’s loss of steam. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Sep 06, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. United Continental Holdings, the parent company of United Airlines, has been the worst hit as Houston is the carrier’s second-largest hub. In fact, more than 7,400 flights were cancelled at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, with operations suspended at the airport, for more than four days.The company trimmed its views with respect to pre-tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter mainly due to Harvey at the Cowen and Company Global Transportation Conference.The Chicago-based carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3% and 5% year over year (the earlier guidance provided in July had called for the metric to be in the range of +1% to -1%). In fact, Harvey has impacted the current-quarter PRASM to the tune of approximately 150 basis points. Also, the carrier anticipates pre-tax margin between 8% and 10% (previous guidance had called for the metric to be in the range of 12.5% to 14.5%). Higher fuel prices are further expected to hurt the bottom line in the third quarter (read more: Harvey Impact on Airlines: United Continental Hit the Most).On a separate note, United Continental announced its intention to start nonstop flights operating daily between its Houston hub and Sydney from Jan 18, 2018. The service once operational, should be warmly welcomed by passengers as it broadens their options of reaching Sydney from Houston. The flight, first connecting Houston to Australia, will be the second-longest for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier spanning 8,596 miles. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Delta Air Lines will collaborate with partner Air France to introduce a nonstop trans-Atlantic service from Indianapolis to its European hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle. The service is expected to be operational from May 24, 2018. Additionally, the company will operate flights connecting Indianapolis and Paris on a Boeing 767-300ER aircraft (read more: Delta Air Lines to Initiate Indianapolis-Paris Service).3. At Southwest Airlines, traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 5.3% in August. Load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 30 basis points to 84.9% in the same month as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion (4.9%). The Dallas-based carrier, which had to call off approximately 2,800 flights due to Harvey, now expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) in the range of down 1% to slightly up, on a year-over-year basis. The metric was earlier projected to increase approximately 1% from the year-ago quarter. (read more: Southwest Airlines August Traffic Up, Q3 RASM View Bearish).4. While traffic at American Airlines improved 3.7% in August, capacity expanded 3.2%.  Load factor increased 40 basis points to 86.3% as capacity expansion was outpaced by traffic growth. In fact, the company that has significant exposure to Florida including its hub at Miami International Airport had to cancel multiple flights due to Irma. The natural calamity also caused it to trim its current-quarter total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) view.Consequently, the key unit revenue metric is now expected to be approximately flat to up 1% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for an increase between 0.5% and 2.5%). With fuel costs on the rise, the carrier anticipates pre-tax margin (excluding special items) in the band of 8.5% to 10.5% for the third quarter compared with the previous guidance of 10% to 12%. American Airlines expects to perform better with respect to TRASM in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the current quarter.5. Traffic at Alaska Air Group increased 5.8% to 4.78 billion in August. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity rose 5.5% to 5.55 billion. Also, the load factor improved to 86.2% from 85.8% recorded in August 2016, as traffic growth exceeded capacity expansion (read more: Alaska Air Group Delivers Impressive August Traffic Data).6. August traffic at Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) — inched up 1% while capacity shrunk 1.1%. Load factor increased 180 basis points to 86.2% in the same month as traffic expanded and capacity contracted (read more: Hawaiian Holdings Arm Posts Impressive August Traffic Data).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-3.8%-18.9%UAL4%-12.3%GOL-0.1%46.9%DAL8%3.6%JBLU4.3%-1.3%AAL4.2%9.3%SAVE7.5%-31.9%LUV6.3%-1%CPA3.4%24.3%ALK6.2%-21%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green in the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index’s significant gain.

2164,LUV,"On Sep 8, we issued an updated research report on key low-cost airline, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report).The stock has performed disappointingly so far this year. The stock lost 16.6% while its industry gained 7.8% on a year-to-date basis.Why the Slide?JetBlue has been hurt by multiple headwinds leading to the above underperformance. High costs are expected to negatively impact the bottom line in the third quarter. Also, while releasing its second-quarter results in July this year, the company stated that unit costs, excluding fuel, are expected to grow in the band of 1.5% to 3.5% for the same period.Adding to its woes, the carrier recently provided a bearish view on operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM) for the third quarter. JetBlue now expects RASM in the band of -1% to +1% (on a year-over-year basis). The earlier projection had called for the metric between -0.5% and + 2.5%. The company attributed the reduction in the guidance to the prevalent competitive pricing environment. JetBlue also trimmed its capacity growth projection to the range of 6% to 7% range from 6.5% to 7.5%, projected earlier.Moreover, Irma is likely to hit JetBlue hard because it has significant exposure to Florida with two hubs in the state, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. The company also has a hub in Puerto Rico. Notably, JetBlue is not the only one to slash its unit revenue forecast. Fellow-carriers like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) have trimmed their respective current-quarter unit revenue forecasts.Certainly Not a Broker FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, it is natural that the stock is not a brokers’ favorite right now. The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 3.2% downward over the last 30 days. Also, for full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved down 1.5% in the same time period.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Some Positives RemainJetBlue's efforts to expand its popular premium service (Mint), however, raise optimism in the stock. The carrier intends to operate 70 Mint flights by Dec 31, 2017. In fact, it aims to offer the service for approximately one out of 14. We are also impressed by the company's efforts to modernize its fleet.Efforts to reduce debt levels are also encouraging. Furthermore, the carrier's deal with Goldman Sachs for implementing an accelerated share buyback program is another positive.Due to the positives, we believe dumping the stock now will be foolhardy despite its recent struggles.Additionally, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carried by the stock is a confirmation that investors should currently hold on to the stock as it is expected to perform in line with the broader market over the next one to three months.Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the airline space may consider SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.SkyWest witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.9% upward over the last 60 days.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2165,LUV,"Thanks to a strong economy, low unemployment and relatively low fares, last-minute trips during the Labor Day holiday are palpably more this time than any year. This is especially true given that air travel is poised to hit another record with 16.1 million passengers expected to fly over the seven-day Labor Day holiday (Aug 30 to Sep 5), up 5% from last year, per the report from U.S. airlines group, Airlines for America (read: ETFs & Stocks to Gain Height on Busy Air Summer Travel).In order to accommodate higher travel demand, U.S. airlines increased the number of seats available for their late summer getaway by about 133,000. The addition of capacity will fuel traffic numbers as industry capacity is at its highest since 2007.The busiest travel day of the weekend is projected to be Sep 1 followed by Aug 31 and Sep 4 while Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta, LAX in Los Angeles and O’Hare International in Chicago will likely be the most active U.S. airports.However, this Labor Day holiday might not as cheap as it was last two years. Gasoline prices at pumps in some states have increased due to Hurricane Harvey. Analysts had expected about a 10% jump in prices, but the forecasts were revised up as worries over supply shortage increased. Nearly one-third of U.S. refining output was affected by Harvey and its extreme rainfall and flooding. Per CNBC, drivers could have to pay as much as $2.60 per gallon nationally during summer’s last big travel weekend (read: Gasoline ETF Jumps on Storm Harvey).That said, investors seeking to tap huge air travel demand during the Labor Day weekend should focus on the airline ETF — U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report).JETS in FocusThis fund provides exposure to the global airline industry, including airline operators and manufacturers from all over the world, by tracking the U.S. Global Jets Index. In total, the product holds 34 securities and is heavily concentrated on the top four firms — American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report). These account for at least 11% share each while other firms hold less than 4% share.In terms of regional exposure, North America accounts for 78% of JETS, followed by Europe at 11%. Other regions like Asia-Pacific, Asia, Latin America and Middle East make up for a low single-digits in the portfolio (read: Hurricane Harvey Puts These ETF Areas in Focus).The fund has gathered $115.4 million in its asset base while sees moderate trading volume of nearly 61,000 shares a day. It charges investors 60 bps in annual fees and has gained 2.9% so far this year. JETS has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook.What Lies Ahead?Not only will strong Labor Day weekend travel fuel growth in JETS, the month of September is historically kind to the ETF given the outperformance of some of the big holdings in the portfolio. Per Schaeffer's Investment Research, Delta Airlines has finished higher 70% of the time with an average gain of 6% over the past 10 Septembers while United Continental has finished to the upside nearly two-thirds of the time over the last 11 Septembers with an average gain of 5.1%. Both stocks account for a combined 22.3% share.Additionally, the International Air Transport Association expects another solid year of performance for the airline industry, suggesting good tidings for the stocks and ETF. It expects global airlines to post $31.4 billion in profits this year buoyed by stronger demand in both cargo and passenger business. However, it is well below the 2016 profit of $34.8 billion. As such, airlines are expected to retain net profit of $7.69 per passenger, down from $9.13 in 2016 and $10.08 in 2015 (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).Cargo demand is expected to grow 7.5%, more than double 3.6% growth seen in 2016 while passenger demand is expected to grow 7.4%, the same as that of 2016.Regionally, North American carriers continue to be the “powerhouse of industry profitability” with expected profits of $15.4 billion and accounts for more than half of the global industry profit. European and Asia-Pacific carriers would add $7.4 billion each to the industry profit. Latin America and Middle East carriers are expected to earn $800 million and $400 million respectively, but airlines in Africa are expected to post a $100 million loss.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2167,LUV,"Hurricane Irma has already hammered some of the Caribbean and is currently on a collision course for Florida, with landfall expected this weekend. Many people have already fled the area, and airline stocks are moving lower as investors begin to worry that they won’t be able to recoup the losses caused by Harvey and Irma.Irma UpdateHurricane Irma has already killed at least 10 people in the Caribbean and caused massive power outages in Puerto Rico.

2168,LUV,"Harvey, which wreaked havoc on Houston — America’s fourth-largest city — with heavy rainfall has negatively impacted airline operations causing multiple flight cancellations. In fact, air travel was hurt with two Houston airports, George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), reportedly remaining closed for a few days (since the noon of Aug 27) due to Harvey-induced heavy rainfall. The airports are, however, currently operational.Bleak Third-Quarter ForecastsThe picture pertaining to the extent of impact on sector participants is becoming clearer with many of them unveiling fresh forecasts for the third quarter of 2017. As was widely expected, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, has been the worst hit as Houston is the carrier’s second-largest hub. In fact, more than 7,400 flights were cancelled at IAH, with operations suspended at the airport due to the unprecedented storm, for more than four days.The company trimmed its views with respect to pre-tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter mainly due to Harvey at the Cowen and Company Global Transportation Conference. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3% and 5% year over year (the earlier guidance provided in July had called for the metric to be in the range of+1% to - 1%).In fact, Harvey has impacted the current-quarter PRASM to the tune of approximately 150 basis points. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The carrier now expects pre-tax margin between 8% and 10% (previous guidance had called for the metric to be in the range of12.5% and 14.5%). Higher fuel prices are also expected to hurt the bottom line in the third quarter. Fuel price per gallon is now projected in the band of $1.72 and $1.77 (earlier view: $1.56 to $1.61). Cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, profit sharing, third-party business expenses and other special items, is now projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% (earlier view had called for an increase in the band of 2% and 3%).The Chicago-based company now expects capacity to grow between 3% and 3.5% compared with the approximately 4% expansion projected earlier. These forecasts regarding key metrics hurt the United Continental stock badly on Sep 6. The stock closed the trading session at $60.33, down 1.3% from the Sep 5 closing price.Apart from United Continental, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also revised its outlook for the third quarter at the same investor conference. The Dallas-based carrier had to call off approximately 2,800 flights due to the storm. Operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) is projected in the range of down 1% to slightly up year over year. The metric was earlier projected to increase approximately 1% from the year-ago quarter.Following the Harvey impact, the low-cost carrier trimmed its current-quarter capacity growth projection. The metric is now expected to increase between 3.5% and 4% from the earlier projected increase in the 4% to 5% range. Fuel price (economic) per gallon is now projected between $2 and $2.05 (earlier projection was in the band of $1.95 and $2).Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), which has significant exposure to Houston, expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to the natural calamity. Currently, Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the current quarter to decline between 7% and 8.5% (the previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 2% and 4%). In fact, per the company 100 basis points of the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey. Also, aggressive competitive pricing in its key markets contributed to the bleak forecast.Another low-cost carrier, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) has also revised its third quarter view on key metrics. JetBlue now expects RASM in the band of -1% to +1% (on a year-over-year basis). The earlier projection had called for the metric between -0.5% and +2.5%. The company attributed the reduction in the guidance to the prevalent competitive pricing environment. JetBlue also trimmed its capacity growth projection to the 6% to 7% range from 6.5% to 7.5% projected earlier.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) also trimmed its passenger unit revenue outlook for the third quarter on Sep 5, while releasing its August traffic report. American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) expects TRASM to grow at a slower pace in the quarter due to difficult year-over-year comparisons. In fact, the metric is expected to perform better in the final quarter of 2017 compared with the current quarter.Hurricane Irma: What’s in Store?As if the disruptions caused by Harvey were not enough, Hurricane Irma has offered a fresh challenge to the airline companies. In fact, this latest natural calamity already resulted in cancellation of multiple flights to Caribbean cities.Meanwhile, a controversy has erupted regarding ticket prices for flights from Florida where Hurricane Irma is fast approaching. Naturally, investors would keenly await updates on the issue and the impact of Irma on airline stocks.In fact, stocks in the airline space have been hit hard by other headwinds like high labor costs too. The disastrous impact of Harvey has further complicated matters. Now, with Hurricane Irma emerging there seems to be little respite for the sector in the near-term going forward.Price PerformanceIn view of the above headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry underperformed the broader market in the last three months. The S&P 500 Index gained 1%, as against the industry’s decline of 5.8%. One Simple Trading Idea Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2169,LUV,"WOW Air, an Iceland-based low-cost airline, announced on Wednesday that it will expand into four Midwest cities, causing major airline stocks to tumble.The Icelandic company known for its cheap tickets to Europe is adding service to St. Louis, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Detroit. This will bring the company to a total of 12 U.S. destinations.One-way tickets to Iceland will start at $99.99 from all four cities. Connecting flights to WOW’s other European locations will begin at $149.99.When asked if there was enough demand in the Midwest for the new non-stop flights to Iceland, WOW Air founder and CEO Skuli Mogensen said yes. “With those kind of prices, we have seen in other markets that we enter that we have stimulated the market significantly.”“Our unique opportunity is to use Iceland as a hub. We can then distribute to our main destinations in Europe, be it London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Berlin, Copenhagen, etc.,” Mogensen said. “That’s really the key. Instead of having a single point-to-point flight, we actually give you a very affordable flight to multiple destinations.”In reaction to this news, major airline stocks fell. Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) stock closed 2.06% lower at $46.18.  American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) stock tumbled 3.17% to $43.97. Meanwhile, shares of United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) tumbled 2.89% to $62.83, and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) stock went down 3.22% to $51.72.WOW’s new routes will launch in the spring, with tickets going on sale Wednesday.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2170,LUV,"The past week saw key airline players like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) revealing updates on their intention to add additional flights in a bid to expand their presence.On a more sombre note, the week also saw two terror attacks on two Spanish cities that claimed multiple lives apart from injuring many. Naturally, travel-focused stocks, which include airline players, lost value in the aftermath.According to many market watchers, the impact of the terror attacks in Spain is likely to be short term. This is in keeping with the trend that market weakness resulting from such anti-social incidents is usually short lived, especially when the frequency of occurrence is rapid as has been the case of late.In another major development, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake in three major U.S. carriers — Delta, American Airlines and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) — in the second quarter of 2017. On the traffic front, Latin American carrier Copa Holdings (CPA  -  Free Report) unveiled its traffic data for the month of July.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 4.2% to $106.1 over the past week due to the terror attacks in Spain apart from the market pullback following concerns pertaining to recent actions of the Trump administration. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Aug 16, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Delta has announced plans to begin flights to Lagos, Nigeria from the airline’s New York-JFK hub. Scheduled to operate thrice a week, the service is expected to start from Mar 24, 2018 and will complement the existing one to Lagos from Atlanta. The current flights from Atlanta ply four times a week. We note that Delta already has an impressive presence in Africa, serving four cities (read more: Delta Air Lines to Launch Flights to Lagos From New York).2. American Airlines has announced new flights to Europe, catering to high customer demand for Europe travel during summer. The carrier will offer special summer services to Budapest and Prague from Philadelphia, plus an additional one to Venice from Chicago, beginning May 4, 2018. Budapest and Prague will be extra destinations on the airlines’ travel route (read more: American Airlines Summer Service to Expand European Base).3. In a bid to expand, JetBlue Airways aims to expand its Atlanta service to three of its focus cities. To this end, the low-cost carrier announced the date for commencement of flights connecting Hartsfield – Jackson Atlanta International Airport with three of the airline’s focus cities. The service is expected to start from Mar 8, 2018. Following this, JetBlue will double the number of daily flights in Atlanta (read more: JetBlue Airways to Add New Flights With Focus on Atlanta).4. On Aug 17, a van went through a crowd of tourists in Barcelona, killing at least 13 and injuring many. Such an inhuman act was followed by a second attack in the coastal town of Cambrils, located approximately 120 kilometers south of Barcelona.Reportedly, the five terrorists involved in the Cambrils attacks were shot dead by the police. Both the incidents have claimed the lives of at least 14 and have left 130 others severely injured. Such acts of terrorism affected airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security concerns.In fact, the timing of the attacks could not have been worse as the three-month period between June and August has been predicted to be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel.5. Copa Holdings revealed impressive traffic numbers for the month of July. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMS), improved 17.2% year over year 1,913 million. Load factor increased 150 basis points to 87.6%. This was because traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion (15.1%) in the month for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier.

According to the 13-F filing by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in the second quarter, the company reduced its stake in three major U.S. carriers. Reportedly, the Omaha, NE-based company reduced its stake in Delta, American Airlines and United Continental by 4.6%, 3.5% and 2.6%, respectively, on a sequential basis. Moreover, the Oracle of Omaha’s investment in low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co.

2171,LUV,"Millions of Americans flocked to high-visibility locations on Aug 21 to catch a glimpse of the first solar eclipse in 99 years to cross the entire U.S. continent.Stock markets have historically gained momentum after such solar eclipses. Such a once-in-a-lifetime event provides great business opportunity to travel and leisure companies. This calls for investing in solid stocks from such areas.Stocks Rally on Solar EclipseLPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick stated that “history has shown us that since 1900, any time a total solar eclipse has been seen in the U.S., equity prices have gone up”. According to him, one year after the last 15 other total solar eclipses visible in the U.S., equity prices have gained an average of 17.2%. Stocks have, in fact, gained a whopping 39.6% after the eclipse in June 1954, while the markets rallied nearly 32% after one eclipse in June 1918.Detrick also figured out that the broader markets tend to rise an average 0.9% in the month following an eclipse, while it climbs 7.2% over the next six months. On a lighter note, he added that “it appears our biggest worry isn’t what stocks might do, but whether those glasses we bought online are officially approved by NASA!”Of course, there are other drivers that correspond with the solar calendar including robust quarterly earnings and economic conditions gaining traction at a steady pace. The Q2 earnings season has almost come to an end, with 474 S&P 500 members having reported quarterly results so far. Total earnings for these companies are up 10.6% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.9% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% surpassing the revenue mark (read more: No Shortage of Positive Retail Sector Surprises).Americans, in the meanwhile, have spent more in the spring driving the U.S. economy beyond the $19 trillion mark for the first time. Real gross domestic product rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the preceding quarter (read more: US GDP Crosses $19TN for the First Time: 5 Best Gainers). Here is LPL’s full breakdown of past performance, post-eclipse:Date of EclipseS&P 500 (1-Month Return)S&P 500 (6-Month Return)S&P 500 (12-Month Return)06/08/19184.9%4.5%31.8%09/10/1923-5.6%4.5%10.6%01/24/1925-0.3%10.7%29.9%06/29/19278.5%20.5%22.6%08/31/1932-3.7%-17.4%32.7%02/04/19435%11.5%10.8%07/09/1945-3.5%22.1%20.1%06/30/19545.7%22.4%39.6%10/02/19590.4%-2.9%-6.7%07/02/19635.1%13.4%23%03/07/19700.0%-7.3%11.8%07/10/1972-1.3%10.5%-2.4%02/26/19794.9%11.2%16.7%07/22/1990-9.4%-6.8%7.8%07/11/19912.7%10.8%9.9%Average0.9%7.2%17.2%% Positive53.3%73.3%86.7% Solar Eclipse Gives Public Companies Hopes of Better BusinessAs the total solar eclipse bisected the United States on Aug 21, some of the firms are expected to benefit immensely. CEO and COO Larry D. De Shon of car rental company, Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) said that eclipse helped push rental prices higher. Maven, the on-demand car sharing brand from General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), had offered a $10 discount code ECLIPSE for travelers to move towards the eclipse lookout point.  And with millions of Americans hitting the road to catch a glimpse of the once-in-a-century solar eclipse, such a move will surely lift the company’s margins.Financial and bank holding company, First Interstate Bancsystem Inc (FIBK  -  Free Report) has more than 120 offices in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Wyoming and Washington. These are some of the key states that experienced the total solar eclipse and with millions flocking to these states, the bank’s business will surely get a shot in the arm.Many brands also geared up to cash in on this rare event. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL aptly named its cruise Total Eclipse, where Bonnie Tyler sang “Total Eclipse of the Heart”. And for those who haven’t traveled, Discovery Communications Inc’s DISCA Science Channel gave live eclipse coverage all through the day.Solar Eclipse a Bonanza for Airlines, HotelsAirlines have largely benefitted from this once in a lifetime event, as many traveled to large parts of the country that are typically rural regions and don’t see much tourist traffic. In fact, Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report) organized for invitation-only flights for “astronomy enthusiasts” who wanted a sighting of the eclipse in the skies. Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) also earmarked certain flights that helped travelers view the eclipse from high above the clouds.CNBC’s Eric Chemi noted that hotel bookings in some parts of the country, which were mostly along the eclipse path, skyrocketed 400%. Representatives from online marketplace and hospitality service, Airbnb declared that the site logged more than 40,000 guest bookings as of Jul 31.Many hotel chains like Marriott International Inc (MAR  -  Free Report) offered packages to commuters who head to cities in the path of the eclipse. The company reported that the number of rooms booked in 16 locations was up 60% from last year. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT  -  Free Report) is another firm that tried to entice customers with special offers, while InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), another large hotel chain, said last month that two of its three Nashville, Tennessee, hotels were sold out.Top 5 WinnersWith solar eclipse primarily being a boon for airlines, cruises and hotel industries, investing in fundamentally sound stocks from such areas seems prudent.

2172,LUV,"When video emerged online showing a passenger being dragged off a United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) flight earlier this year, consumers, analysts, and investors alike reacted in horror. Shares of the Chicago-based carrier took a huge hit as a result of the incident, and the legacy airline’s market cap lost upwards of $950 million.In a statement, United said four crew members needed to get to a flight departing from Louisville otherwise it would be canceled, and passengers were asked to voluntarily give up their seats. However, no one volunteered, and four passengers were then selected at random, including David Dao, the man who was forcibly removed.What happened onboard in April was not United’s last PR mess that surfaced. Soon after, the airline barred two teenage girls from boarding a flight after a gate agent decided the leggings they were wearing were inappropriate. The incident was first reported by a fellow passenger on Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), and subsequently went viral.But the girls were apparently “pass travelers,” a company benefit that allows United employees and their dependents to travel for free on a standby basis; leggings violated this specific dress code, since pass travelers are “representing” the airline.Incidents like these began popping up all over the Internet and traditional news sites, detailing the poor customer service experienced on flights across the industry. From an American Airlines’ (AAL  -  Free Report) crew member yanking away a mother’s stroller and almost hitting her child to the death of a giant rabbit named Simon on a United flight, viral stories about flying nightmares were nonstop.Industry OutlookDespite one public relations disaster after another, the airline industry kept chugging along, and right now, Transportation-Airline sits in the top 8% of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank; the sector has also returned over 10.5% year-to-date, which is on par with the S&P 500, and 36% over the past 12 months.Historically, airline stocks were—and they still are—a turbulent investment, closely tied to fluctuating oil prices. But during periods of low oil prices and steady economic growth, like the type of environment we’re in now, airlines see their profits rise. Since 2014, U.S. airline stocks as a group have gained almost 90%.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects the global airline industry to bring in $30 billion in profits this year, with 4 billion projected travelers. The earnings represent a 4.1% net profit margin on top of total revenue of $736 billion.Even Berkshire Hathaway  CEO Warren Buffet, who publicly denounced airline investments in the past, sees promise in the industry. Last year, the famous investor bought stakes in all four major U.S. carriers: United, American, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), and Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report).Given this overall bullish sentiment, let’s take a look at three airline stocks investors should consider for their portfolio.SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) operates one of the larger regional airlines in the U.S., and provides passenger and air freight services. The carrier sits at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and boasts a VGM score of ‘A,’ with individual Style Scores of ‘A’ in Value and Growth.SkyWest expects year-over-year earnings growth of 18.59% for the current year, and three analysts have revised their estimates upwards in the last 30 days compared to none lower. The company has an average earnings surprise of nearly 13%, while SkyWest has also beaten expectations in the past four consecutive quarters. In the past one year, SKYW has given its investors a solid return of over 30%.Delta is one of the country’s fastest growing international carriers, and has added more international capacity than all other U.S. airlines combined. Sitting at a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Delta also has a Value Style Score of ‘A,’ with an overall VGM score of ‘B.’The Atlanta-based airline anticipates year-over-year earnings growth of about 3.6% for the current year, with three positive estimate revisions in the last 30 days compared to only one negative revision in the same time frame. Delta has beaten expectations in three of the past four consecutive quarters, and has an average earnings surprise of almost 2%. Shares of DAL have surged over the past year, gaining over 35%.Despite its many PR setbacks, United is actually looking to be a pretty promising pick. The airline is one of the largest in the world, and is the holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines. United is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and has a VGM score of ‘A,’ with Value and Growth Style Scores of ‘A’ and ‘B,’ respectively.While United expects earnings loss of about 9% for the current year, the airline’s earnings do appear to bounce back next year, with United projecting year-over-year growth of over 12.5%. This, however, does not come as a surprise, as the airline was hit hard financially earlier this year. Historically, United has beaten earnings in the past four consecutive quarters, and has an average earnings surprise of 5.4%. Over the past 12 months, UAL has gained almost 39%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2173,LUV,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Southwest Airlines Company (LUV  -  Free Report)  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Southwest Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.38, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.85. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Southwest Airlines’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.89. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Southwest Airlines has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.13, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Southwest Airlines stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Southwest Airlines has a P/S ratio of about 1.57. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.13 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years, , suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Southwest Airlines currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Southwest Airlines a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Southwest Airlines might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C. This gives LUV a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging. The current quarter has seen one estimate going higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the full year estimate has seen three upward and three downward movements in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 6.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Southwest Airlines Company Price and Consensus Southwest Airlines Company Price and Consensus | Southwest Airlines Company QuoteThis unfavorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineSouthwest Airlines is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 13%) bolsters its growth potential. In fact, over the past one year, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

2174,LUV,"Thanks to decent jobless claims figures and a plethora of strong earnings reports, stocks moved higher almost across the board early Thursday. With Q2 earnings season panning out well for most, there’s an even harsher spotlight on the few companies—like Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), and MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report)—that disappointed investors this morning.Interestingly enough, all of the aforementioned companies actually surpassed earnings estimates, but their share prices are slumping for a variety of other reasons. For example, Twitter’s loss of two cents per share was significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents, but investors were more focused on the company’s stagnant user figures.MAUs in the quarter were 328 million, which was unchanged from the first quarter of 2017 and up just 5% year-over-year. DAUs were up about 12%. Total revenues slumped about 4.7% to $573.8 million, although that result did surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $536.8 million (also read: Twitter Q2 Loss Narrows, Stagnant User Base Hits Stock).Despite beating on both the top and bottom line, shares of Twitter opened at $17.36 on Thursday, nearly 11.5% lower than Wednesday’s close. The stock dipped to an intraday low of $16.85 per share in morning trading, and investors will hoping to avoid a double-digit loss on the day will now need quite the mid-day bounce.Southwest was also able to post a double beat, with earnings of $1.24 per share and revenues of $5.74 billion surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.20 and $5.73 billion. Revenue per available seat mile—the ever-important RASM figure—was up a respectable 1.5% year-over-year.Southwest’s problem was its outlook for the third quarter, a period that includes most of the busy summer travel season. The company is expecting RASM growth of just 1%, and unit costs—excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing—are expected to increase about 2% to 3%. Higher costs and sluggish unit revenue is, of course, not a great combination for an airliner (also read: Southwest Airlines Beats on Q2 Earnings).Shares of Southwest opened about 5% lower on Thursday, eventually hitting an intraday low of $53.77 in morning trading. However, the stock has already started to bounce back a bit; shares were down less than 3% heading into the afternoon.Casino giant MGM Resorts also reported on Thursday morning. The company posted earnings of 31 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents, but revenues of $2.64 billion lagged our consensus estimate of $2.66 billion.Improvements in Las Vegas helped MGM’s profits growth more than 19% year-over-year, but weak results at MGM China contributed to its revenue miss. MGM China’s net revenue fell 1% year over year to $449 million due to lower revenues from main-floor table games, which isn’t the best result considering the overall improvement of the Macau region (also read: MGM Resorts' Q2 Earnings Beat on Higher Revenues).MGM shares quickly slumped to an intraday low of $32.31, a drop of more than 4.6% from yesterday’s close. The stock has since recovered slightly, but it is unlikely to win over too much investor favor given the relative strength of its competitors’ earnings reports so far.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2177,LUV,"Normal life has been disrupted with the tropical storm Harvey wreaking havoc, and is expected to cause further damage. In fact, the storm caused severe devastation throughout the weekend with Houston – the fourth largest city in the country -- experiencing the worst hit.Meanwhile, the city has been witnessing unprecedented rainfall, resulting in multiple causalities. Also, the flooding is expected to continue as Texas is battered by heavy rains due to the storm.Notably, Harvey, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm from a category-four hurricane, is expected to remain over Texas until mid-week.Flight Cancellations at Large Due to HarveyIn view of the extensive damage, it is of little wonder the natural calamity impeded travel disrupting operations of airlines. In fact, Harvey resulted in significant travel disruptions over the weekend leading to multiple flight cancellations/delays at the George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby airports, resulting in untold miseries and harassments to passengers.According to a Bloomberg report, operations at United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) were significantly crippled due to the natural calamity as it relies extensively on its hub at Houston, causing it to cancel a huge number of flights therein to ensure the security of its passengers. Currently, United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other carriers like Southwest Airlines Co.

According to The Wall Street Journal, American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) had to cancel 110 flights on Aug 27 due to the calamity, majority of them to and from Houston.Moreover, in a bid to mitigate the harassments of passengers, most carriers including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) have made offers to passengers who are rescheduling their travel dates. These passengers will be able to do so without paying any additional charges. Markedly, with the two Houston airports - George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport - closed as heavy rainfall continues to hit Houston, air travel is expected to be hurt further this week.Evidently, weather-related issues have hurt airlines previously too. In March 2017,operations at carriers were disrupted big time by winter storm Stella. Moreover, this January, an icy winter storm ravaged the Southeast U.S. cities. It also disrupted the flight schedules of airlines, thereby causing undue harassment. Last year, Hurricane Matthew had also caused extensive damage in the affected areas.In fact, such acts of nature throw the schedules of carriers out of gear, causing multiple flight cancellations.Other Headwinds Hurting Airlines LatelyApart from the Harvey-related disruption in operations, airlines have been laid low lately by quite a few other happenings.The twin terror attacks in Spain, earlier in the month that claimed multiple lives apart from injuring many, caused travel-focused stocks include airline players to lose value. Such acts of terrorism might cause travel demand to dwindle due to security fears. Naturally, airline stocks are hurt by this anticipation.Moreover, fears related to capacity overexpansion were re-ignited with July traffic reports of most carriers exhibiting a fall in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers). The downturn was due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth.Generally, carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth. While low air fares are favorable for fliers, it is a drag on the top lines of carriers with their profits being hurt.Also, the decision of Warren Buffett, one of the most revered investors of all time, to trim his stakes in three airline heavyweights – Delta, United Continental and American Airlines – also points at the fact that all is not well with this key sector.Price PerformanceIn view of the above recent headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks industry fared worse than the broader market in the last one month. The S&P 500 Index contracted 0.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 3%.High Labor Costs Remain a DragIn addition to the recent challenges, high labor costs have hurt airlines for the last few quarters. With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups, it is of little surprise that costs on this front are increasing, which is limiting bottom-line growth.The situation on this front is not expected to improve in the third quarter as well. Delta expects non-fuel unit cost (including profit sharing) to increase approximately 4%. Additionally, consolidated cost per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is anticipated to increase 5% at American Airlines. Again, Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) expects cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, to increase in the band of 16-18%.Bottom LineWith airline companies already grappling with multiple headwinds, the emergence of Harvey has only added to the woes of stocks in the space. Consequently, investors are expected to remain glued to the updates, as stocks strive to return to their winning waysMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The company’s earnings as well as revenues surpassed expectations, despite recent natural calamities. While this Atlanta, GA-based company’s top line expanded on a year-over-year basis, the bottom line contracted owing to higher costs.On the news front, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) provided an update pertaining to the expected impact of the devastating hurricanes (Irma and Maria) on its results for the third as well as fourth quarter of 2017. The low-cost carrier unveiled the predictions while revealing its September traffic data.Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) also featured in the news when it put to rest speculations regarding its ambitions to fly to Hawaii. While confirming the rumours, this Dallas-based carrier announced that it intends to sell tickets for its flights to Hawaii next year. Consequently, hurting shares of the Honolulu County, HI-based Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report).

JetBlue expects its top line to be hurt to the tune of $44 million in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, operating income is likely to be adversely impacted in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The adverse impact of the hurricanes is not restricted to the third quarter only. The carrier expects the negative impact of the hurricanes on its top line to vary between $70 million and $90 million in the final quarter of 2017 (read more: JetBlue's September Traffic Falls, Hurricanes to Mar Q3 & Q4).3. The board of directors of Hawaiian Holdings approved an initial quarterly dividend of 12 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on Nov 30 to its shareholders as of Nov 17, 2017. We believe that the dividend initiation not only highlights Hawaiian Holdings’ commitment to create value for shareholders but also underlines the carrier’s healthy financial condition and confidence in its business going forward. Meanwhile, the company has already been rewarding its shareholders through buybacks. Hawaiian Holdings has returned more than $218 million to investors since 2015.4. In a bid to expand further, Southwest Airlines announced that it will operate flights to the favorite tourist destination of Hawaii from next year. In order to fulfil its objective, this low-cost carrier intends to shortly commence the process of gaining the necessary approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for operating flights between the mainland and the Hawaiian Islands. In fact, the carrier will release its third-quarter results on Oct 26 and intends to utilize Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes, equipped with all modern facilities, for the new service.5. Alaska Air Group reported a decline in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for the month of September. The metric fell to 82.9% from 84.2%, recorded in September 2016 as capacity expansion (10.1%) outpaced traffic growth (8.4%).At the end of the first nine months of 2017, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles — improved 6.6% year over year to of 39.07 billion while capacity — measured in available seat miles — expanded 6% to 46.17 billion. Load factor stood at 84.6% compared with 84.2% in the first nine months of 2016.6. The Bureau of Transportation Services revealed that average airfares in the United States declined 3.1% from the comparable figure a year ago. Also, the price of air tickets decreased 0.1% (unadjusted) in the same month on a month-on-month basis. The decline was owing to higher capacity in air fares.According to research firm Hopper, air fares (roundtrip) in the United States are likely to decline 1.1% on a month-on-month basis to $208, in October. Domestic capacity is projected to expand 3.4% on a year-over-year basis in the same month.7. Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) reported a decline in load factor for the month of September. The metric fell 230 basis points to 78.6% as capacity expansion (8.9%) outpaced traffic growth (5.9%).At the end of the first nine months of 2017, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles — improved 12.7% year over year to of 18.29 billion while capacity — measured in available seat miles — expanded 15.6% to 21.85 billion. Load factor stood at 83.7% compared with 85.8% in the first nine months of 2016.The carrier had to cancel 1,650 flights owing to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the third quarter of 2017. Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the third quarter to decline approximately 6.5% (the previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 7% and 8.5%). The brighter view is due improving yields (ticket and non-ticket) and better-than-expected load factor. The low-cost carrier expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $40 million due to the natural calamities and the pilot dispute. Operating margin is expected to be hurt to the tune of approximately 450 basis points. Spirit Airlines now expects third-quarter adjusted cost per available seat miles to be flat to down 1% (the previous guidance had projected the metric to decline between 2% and 3% on a year-over-year basis).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-2.9%-19.4%UAL2.6%-3.1%GOL-6.1%47.9%DAL3.6%21.8%JBLU3.1%-2.4%AAL-0.5%25.9%SAVE-5.1%-37.4%LUV0.8%8.4%CPA2%12.9%ALK-0.1%-6.8%                  The table shows that airline stocks exhibited a mixed price performance over the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining marginally to $112.12 in the period.

Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analyst Jamie Baker upgraded American Airlines to “neutral” from “overweight” in a note to clients on Tuesday. Baker also increased his price target for the airline company to $61 per share from $52 per share—which represents a jump of over 20% from Monday’s close.American Airlines shares gained 2.3% premarket, but the stock is now only up marginally through morning trading. The airline has had an up and down year and sits roughly $3 below its 52-week high of $54.48 per share, which it reached in mid-July.American Airlines beat both earnings and revenue estimates when it reported its second-quarter earnings on July 28. But the positive report didn’t send the stock soaring.The U.S. airline industry suffered as a whole from less than stellar second-quarter earnings reports—United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) were both down more than 10% in July. Yet, today, American Airlines is up because J.P. Morgan’s Baker notes that the industry could be prepared to turn things around overall.""Cost convergence, fare unbundling, widespread consolidation, diminished new entrant activity, and return-oriented management teams have combined to form an industry that is actually managing itself for the first time we can recall,"" Baker wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We believe the US airline industry will continue to take steps to ensure profitability and continued balance sheet repair.""The analyst also raised American Airlines 2018 earnings per share estimate to $6.20 per share from $5.47 per share.""American is in the midst of several revenue accretive initiatives including an expansion of Basic Economy and higher paid load factors in the domestic premium cabin, and we believe these initiatives will drive higher returns and stronger unit revenue,"" he continued.American Airlines is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an “A” grade for both Value and Growth, as well as a “B” for Momentum in our Zacks Style Score system.Airline Industry Today’s American Airlines upgrade has helped some of the rest of the sector as well.

However, this simplistic approach of only inspecting the dividend yield could be overlooking some key areas that are actually very important to consider.Chief among these are considering other financial activities, such as share repurchases or debt retirement, and the impact these data points have as well. And, if you combine all of these together, you get a much more complete picture of a company’s true yield prospects, in what is often referred to as ‘shareholder yield’.Why Shareholder Yield?To explain how and why to use this concept in a bit greater detail, we have Meb Faber, the CIO of Cambria Investments to discuss the topic with us on this week’s Dutram Report. Meb literally wrote a book on shareholder yield, so it is pretty safe to say he knows a thing or two about the concept and why it might often a more holistic approach for yield-focused investors.Meb goes over the main points of this strategy, how income investors might feel about the approach, and the ever-increasing popularity of share buybacks these days. Meb also makes the case for why this technique might be worth investigating, and the importance of free cash flow to great outcomes too.We then discuss the main way for investors to target this market in ETF form with the Shareholder Yield ETF (SYLD  -  Free Report), and how this portfolio is constructed. Top holdings right now include Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Green Dot (GDOT  -  Free Report), and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), but check out the podcast for additional information on how this actively-managed portfolio is built and maintained.The Rest of the LineupWe also talk about how this strategy works internationally. There are some important considerations to keep in mind for a foreign approach, including which countries tend to be more well-represented for this metric in their Foreign Shareholder Yield ETF (FYLD  -  Free Report), and if there are enough quality companies in the emerging world when using this technique for their Emerging Market Shareholder Yield ETF (EYLD  -  Free Report) too.Finally, we also discuss two of Cambria’s other funds, and what these might bring to the table. The company has a Tail Risk ETF (TAIL) which invests in out of the money put options to mitigate downside risks, while it also has a Core Equity ETF (CCOR) that uses options trading to produce capital appreciation. But check out the podcast for additional information on this duo, as well as the shareholder yield lineup from Cambria.Bottom LineBut what do you think about shareholder yield?

2188,LUV,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for a short horizon investor to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage”, which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of “A” or “B” to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which operates as a homebuilding company, has a VGM score of “A” and an expected EPS growth rate of 16.7% for 3–5 years.

2189,LUV,"In the Global Week Ahead, the headlines are already set to print. Multi-national quarterly earning reports will be the focal points for U.S. and international markets.All week long, USA traders focus on the latest S&P 500 reports.Seventy-two S&P 500 firms release earnings. Names include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, Bank of New York Mellon, Visa, Capital One, Microsoft, eBay, Netflix and American Airlines.Traders have been confirming: the bullish story remains intact. As of Friday, July 14th, 6% of the S&P 500 companies had reported Q2 results. 80% beat their mean EPS estimate. And 83% have beaten the mean sales estimate.Each beat lifts overall S&P 500 earnings growth for Q2, which is being revised upwards. The latest EPS growth rate for the S&P 500 rests at +6.8%. On June 30th, this was +6.6%.Expect nine of 11 S&P 500 sectors to hand in earnings growth for Q2, led by the Energy sector. Five sectors have higher growth rates (compared to June 30th) due to upside earnings surprises -- led by the Financials sector.Where does the S&P 500 valuation stand? It’s rich! There’s no room for error.The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.6. This P/E ratio is well above the 5-year average (15.4) and the 10-year average (14.0). The price-to-trailing earnings yield sits at 21.6 times. Again, that’s hardly cheap. To wrap this richly priced story up, S&P 500 stock prices trade at over three times book value.In the week ahead, U.S. macro data reports look sparse. Housing starts and permits for June arrive on Wednesday. Forecasts there look good.Late in the week ahead, European markets key in on the latest European Central Bank (ECB) meeting.This happens on Thursday. The WSJ has reported ECB President Mario Draghi will attend the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium in mid-August. In the press statement out this week, consensus thinks Draghi will reinforce confidence in the Eurozone’s recovery and suggest there is less need for QE stimulus.It’s a “Goldilocks” scenario on the continent. Growth is improving, but consumer inflation is still at bay.Also happening Thursday, Asia’s Bank of Japan (BoJ) meeting should build on the positive ECB line.Expect Governor Kuroda to stay the course with his deeply accommodative policy, including a negative (-0.1%) interest rate. Traders might see the BoJ modestly revise its GDP growth forecast upwards.Also on Thursday, the central bank of Indonesia should stay pat at 4.75%, where its policy rate has sat since October. Core Indonesian inflation has dropped to +3.1% y/y. This is well under the 5% peak -- back in ancient 2015. This central bank is within its 4% (+/-1%) inflation target zone.Nobody, anywhere, is seeing consumer price inflation do anything but recede.  Hence, the bullish stock story endures. Rates can stay low, for longer -- everywhere.While the bond market cat is away, the stock market mice will play!Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report): This is the darling of semiconductor stocks, and it is now a $98B market cap big hitter. But the Zacks VGM score is D. The shorts are awake to the rich valuation.???Southwest Air (LUV  -  Free Report): Can U.S. plane stocks pick up speed? A long-term Zacks VGM score of A is showing up here.Micron (MU  -  Free Report): Hunt and you shall find. This is another semiconductor stock, and it is priced much better, still. The long-term Zacks VGM score is A.Want the message? Keep a close eye on individual stock price valuations.Key Global/Macro Data and Events—Make it eight!On Monday, Mainland China’s real GDP came in at +6.9%. In the prior seven consecutive quarters China’s GDP growth rate clocked in at the 6.7 to 6.9% range. Before that, the key growth rate was 7.0% a couple of quarters.What remarkable stability! And never revised. The figures are always perfect the first time. Oh, and the quickest release time of pretty much any significant economy.In comparison, preliminary U.S. Q2 GDP estimates don’t come out for 10 more days, or until July 28th.On Thursday, the big monetary policy meetings, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB, along with the Bank of Indonesia, happen.On Monday, China’s industrial production came in at +7.6% y/y, beating estimates for +6.5%. China’s real GDP grew +6.9% y/y, in line with the prior +6.9% y/y reading. China’s retail sales came in at +11.0% y/y, above the prior +10.70%. This is solid expansion data.Later on Monday, the Eurozone will report in on the all-important HICP consumer inflation rate there. The prior reading was +1.3% y/y.On Tuesday, the German ZEW indexes come out. Current conditions rested at 88 in a prior reading. Look for 89. Economic sentiment was 18.6. Look for 22.0.The U.S. NAHB Builders Survey comes out. The prior was 67.On Wednesday, U.S. building permits are forecast at 1.21 million, housing starts at 1.19 million. Both are well above the prior readings.On Thursday, the Bank of Indonesia sets its policy rate, the reverse repo rate. The prior was 4.75%.The Bank of Japan (BoJ) issues its Policy Statement and Outlook Report and sets its Overnight Rate, which is now at -0.10%. There will be a Governor Kuroda press conference.The Australian unemployment rate is 5.5%.European Central Bank (ECB) President Draghi holds a press conference following his latest interest rate announcement. The ECB deposit rate is -0.4%, the refi rate is 0.0%, at the moment.Brazil reports in about its IBGE inflation rate (consumer inflation there). The forecast is for +3.02% y/y, down from a prior +3.52%.On Friday, Canada reports on its consumer price inflation (CPI). The y/y rate has been +1.3%. It also reports retail sales. The ex-auto number has been +1.5% y/y.Mexico’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate comes out. The prior was 3.5%.
