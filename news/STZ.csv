1,STZ,"Canadian medical marijuana producer Tilray on Monday said it had launched an initial public offering after its application to list on the Nasdaq. That would make it the latest pure-play pot company to join marijuana stocks Cronos Group (CRON) and Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) on a major U.S. exchange.Tilray said it would offer 9 million shares with an expected price range at $14 to $16 a share. The company supplies marijuana in Canada and parts of Latin America, Europe, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, according to regulatory disclosures.Tilray filed for the IPO last month. The company, founded in 2013, says it plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""TLRY.""Tilray is a subsidiary of Privateer Holdings, a cannabis-focused investment firm founded in 2010 in Seattle. Privateer Holdings acquired the cannabis review and information website Leafly in 2011.As the legal market in nations like Canada transforms backwoods growing operations into full-blown weed corporations, North America's marijuana industry has carved out ways to expand its shareholder audience in both Canada and America — while avoiding U.S. legal barriers. Companies in Canada have tried to raise money and consolidate ahead of recreational legalization, which takes hold in October.Cronos Group, another pot producer in Canada, in February became the first marijuana stock to list on the Nasdaq. Canopy Growth, also a Canadian marijuana company, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in May. MedMen, a marijuana cultivator and retailer in the U.S., went public in Canada in May. High Times is planning an IPO for later this year.Among marijuana stocks and related plays, Cronos Group closed down 0.1%, while Canopy lost 1.5%. the stock market today. Corona parent Constellation Brands (STZ), which has invested in Canopy Growth and is weighing legal ways to gain exposure to the U.S. marijuana business, picked up 1.6%. Tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMBBY), which said it was investing in a marijuana company, added 0.6%.The company has also filed a preliminary prospectus for a proposed IPO in Canada in every province except Quebec, it said in a statement. The company did so, it said, ""to qualify the offering of securities in Canada and to ensure that purchasers in Canada are not subject to restrictions on resale."" The company said it doesn't intend to list on any Canadian exchange.BMO Capital Markets and Cowen are acting as book-runners for Tilray's proposed IPO, Tilray said. Cowen is managing those duties in the U.S., and BMO is handling them in Canada.Roth Capital Partners is acting lead manager of the IPO in the U.S., Tilray said. Northland Capital Markets is co-manager. Eight Capital is acting as lead manager for the IPO in Canada. Tilray said the offering would be made via a prospectus.Tilray said it stood out from rivals due to its global distribution network and deep research capacity. Canopy Growth has also set its sights on the global marijuana market, saying Germany would be the market to watch in Europe over the next year. Medical marijuana became legal in Germany in 2017.Tilray reported a net loss of $7.8 million last year, with revenue of $20.5 million, a 62% jump, according to a registration statement filed with the SEC. The company also warned about roadblocks ahead in the recreational market.""Legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada may have a significant negative effect on our medical cannabis business and there is no guarantee that we will be able to participate or effectively compete in the adult-use cannabis market in Canada,"" Tilray said in the SEC filing.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?Will Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?How Bitcoin's Boom Created This Obstacle For Marijuana Companies Going PublicMarijuana Stocks To Buy And Watch

2,STZ,"Beer giant Molson Coors (TAP) is reportedly considering whether to offer marijuana-infused drinks via a partnership with a Canadian marijuana producer. An analyst said such a move would give Molson ""meaningful exposure"" to the North American cannabis market and some of the biggest marijuana stocks.A cannabis push could echo attempts by rival Constellation Brands (STZ) to head off the plant's perceived threat to alcohol sales. And it could accelerate the race of U.S. companies into Canada — and Canadian companies into the U.S. — following a vote in Canada last week to legalize recreational marijuana.Molson Coors has held talks with companies as Aurora Cannabis and Aphria, according to BNN Bloomberg. The brewer has been exploring whether to ""invest in (the companies) and collaborate on future cannabis-infused beverages,"" the report said. Molson has been in talks with the those companies and others over the past six months, the report said.A Molson spokesman, when reached for comment, said ""we don't comment on rumor or market speculation."" Aurora Cannabis was not immediately available for comment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast year, Molson Coors CEO Mark Hunter said the company had a team to gauge the ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the marijuana industry. Molson this spring told IBD that it was ""working actively"" to understand cannabis' potential impacts on its business, and would ""take our time and get it right.""A few weeks ago, at the company's Investor Day, Hunter said ""we have assembled a team in Canada to actively explore the risks and opportunities of entering the cannabis space in that market, where it will be federally legal by this fall.""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that recreational legalization will take hold on Oct. 17. Legalization of edibles and other ingestibles — which have grown in popularity — will come later.U.S.-traded marijuana stocks, like Canopy Growth (CGC) and Cronos Group (CRON), jumped after Canadian lawmakers approved the legislation, but then sold off Friday.Marijuana stocks retreated on Monday. Canopy Growth, which began trading in the U.S. in late May, sank 5.1% in the stock market today. Cronos stock, which began trading in the U.S. in February, slid 4.7%. But it's still above its 50-day line. ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ), an exchange-traded fund with exposure to the marijuana industry, retreated 2.8%, piercing its 200-day line.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, in a research note on Friday, said any Molson Coors move into the cannabis industry by Molson would likely resemble the one Constellation made with Canopy Growth last year.In that deal, Constellation Brands took a 9.9% stake in Canopy to help ""identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics."" The companies also agreed to share ""knowledge and expertise."" Constellation aims to collaborate with Canopy on cannabis-infused drinks.Andy Thomas, the CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose brands include Red Hook, told IBD this spring he would consider making or selling cannabis drinks if pot were federally legalized.On Friday, Constellation Brands, which sells Corona Beer as well as other alcoholic beverages, reports quarterly earnings.Constellation Brands stock fell 1.5% Monday. Molson Coors stock rose 1.1%.Azer said the report from Bloomberg was not a surprise. She said that Molson Coors ""has meaningful exposure to the North American cannabis market (as the No. 2 participant in beer in both Canada and the U.S.).""She also said that a potential partnership with Aurora or Aphria ""makes sense to us as they are two of the more sizable competitors in the market.""

3,STZ,"Nike fueled a big rally in the Dow Jones Friday as major stock indexes looked poised to end the second quarter on a high note.Biotech stocks in the Nasdaq 100 outperformed with names like Vertex (VRTX), Celgene (CELG) and BioMarin (BMRN) up nicely. Shares of Vertex soared 14% after a competing cystic fibrosis drug from Galapagos (GLPG) didn't do well in a mid-stage trial.The Dow was up 0.9% near midday; the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% and 0.5% respectively. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Thursday's levels.In stock market results today, Nike (NKE) was the hands-down winner in the Dow after the company reported strong earnings late Thursday. Shares surged 11%. Headed into the report, Nike was still in buy range from a 70.35 entry and getting support at the 50-day moving average.Also in the Dow, American Express (AXP) rose more than 2%. A flattening yield curve hasn't been good news for the financials in recent weeks. But the sector outperformed nicely Friday after the Federal Reserve gave the go-ahead to several banks to increase dividends and initiate share buybacks. American Express increased its dividend 11% to 39 cents. It also announced plans to buy back up to $3.4 billion in stock.Elsewhere, shares of Constellation Brands (STZ) slumped 5% on an earnings miss. The large-cap name was in a solid technical setup ahead of the results but not any more. Constellation gapped below its 200-day moving average but was well off session lows.Inside the IBD 50, Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) continued its low-volume ascent, rising 2%.

4,STZ,"On the leading edge of the flourishing marijuana industry is MedMen's West Hollywood cannabis dispensary, which resembles an Apple (AAPL) store crossed with an upscale ski lodge. Touch-screen tablets on large, hazelnut tables display the buds' names and their prices. Clear, snowglobe-sized pods containing pot samples have a small latch at the top that customers can open to take in the fragrance. A staff member, one of many in a red MedMen T-shirt, relays customer orders via a small, clip-on microphone to a pickup counter.Big money is pouring into the legal cannabis market, potentially steering more U.S. consumer spending toward weed. And as the marijuana industry evolves into everyday consumerism, struggling beer and tobacco companies might find an avenue for new business in some of the increasingly popular products in Med Men's store: the cannabis drinks stacked in a refrigerator near the corner, or the sleek vaping devices and tins of prerolled joints, showcased in the tables' inset, fluorescent-lit displays.The trend has spurred Constellation Brands (STZ), the parent of Corona beer, to place a bigger bet on cannabis drinks. The creator of Blue Moon, the wheat beer owned by Molson Coors (TAP), wants to make THC beer. Former beverage execs have switched to the marijuana business. As for big tobacco companies, vaping devices alone could hand them a huge chunk of the pot market, a top Wall Street analyst says.Such moves face obvious obstacles. Pot is still federally prohibited, forcing shops to deal strictly in cash, even as California, the biggest marijuana market on the planet, and other states break away to legalize recreational use. Mixing alcohol with THC is also illegal. Less obvious obstacles include creating a cannabis drink that tastes like the alcoholic beverages we know and not, say, a weed fiber supplement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Andy Thomas, CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose beer brands include Red Hook and Kona, told IBD that pot is ""potentially one of the most disruptive factors"" to the beer industry, whether it's smoked, vaped or swallowed.""I think regardless of what kind of path you take, you can't help but say it's going to be another one of those forces that changes the way people socialize,"" he said.""You have to look at it as an opportunity,"" he added later. ""Otherwise I think we're kind of putting our head in the sand.""This month, Cowen & Co. estimated U.S. marijuana business could reach $75 billion by 2030 if fully legalized, indicating explosive growth. Its forecast two years ago put 2026 sales at $50 billion. That projection also compares with some estimates for current annual cigarette sales of $77 billion and beer sales of $110 billion, both of which are on the downtrend.Baby Boomers, seeking pain relief, are already buying more pot in general. So are more women, as cannabis products become easier and safer to buy in legal states. A report from the marijuana delivery platform Eaze, which operates in California, found that monthly marijuana spending last year among its thousands of users increased to $179-$189 from $125-$152 in 2016. An average-size pot dispensary draws more average yearly sales per square foot than a Whole Foods, and slightly less than a Costco (COST), research from Cowen and Marijuana Business Daily has shown.As the marijuana business shakes off threats from the Trump administration, MedMen, which has stores and other facilities in California, Nevada and New York, is trying to undo the stereotype of the pot dispensary as a windowless, cavernous weed deli.The company's stores have a bright, browsing-friendly atmosphere with staff who recommend cannabis products based on customers' preferences. In MedMen's store in downtown Los Angeles, shelves of creams, pet meds and Gummi candy line one wall. Near the checkout, wooden bins loaded with joints, packs of tea and other edibles, make up what spokesman Daniel Yi likened to an impulse-buy display.""Just the same way you shop at BevMo for your favorite Cab, the consumer wants to experience the store,"" he said during an interview in March.He said then that cannabis products that come in alternate forms — rather than the dry stuff people have been grinding, packing and rolling themselves for generations — could soon make up a majority of legal cannabis sales.Amid the influx of new marijuana users and shifting consumption habits, alcohol and tobacco companies have particular reason to take notice.As of 2016, the monthly rate of binge drinking was around 13% lower in states that had fully legalized pot than in states where it was illegal, Cowen's research this month shows.Meanwhile, Canada has been grooming itself to be a global leader for the cannabis industry. Toronto-based Cronos Group (CRON) has listed on the Nasdaq. Others, like Aurora Cannabis, plan to follow.""Ultimately, I see no reason why the global cannabis industry won't be as large as the brewing industry,"" said Cam Battley, chief corporate officer of Aurora.In May, Canopy Growth (CGC), which already trades in Canada, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. MedMen followed that same month, with a listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange that came via a reverse takeover deal.However, tobacco companies like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI), which includes Reynolds American, might have an easier time carving a way forward.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, big tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""She estimated then that big tobacco companies could nearly double their underlying growth via the cannabis market and grab around a fifth of the overall share of the marijuana industry by 2036 in a fully-legal U.S.Rather than try to snuff out the marijuana industry threat, beer giant Constellation agreed in October to take a minority stake in Canopy Growth. Bruce Linton, CEO of Canopy, said the investment followed nearly a year of conversations. Canopy, he said, was inspired to reach out after Constellation expressed interest in the cannabis market.""That was the very opposite of most of the other liquor, alcohol, wine guys, which was: 'How do we get rid of this problem?'"" Linton said. ""And so we thought that's the kind of guy we want to talk to.""The Canopy investment further chipped away at a longtime barrier between the beer and marijuana industries. But for other companies to make a similar move, they'd need to create an affiliate or subsidiary in Canada, and repatriating earnings from cannabis sales could still be difficult. Constellation Brands did not respond to requests for more detail about its investment in Canopy.The ongoing federal ban on pot is just one obstacle for the burgeoning marijuana industry, though the Trump administration last week signaled it wouldn't crack down on weed in states that have legalized it. Another is getting a precise, consistent dose that delivers a predictable high.Some bars already serve cocktails containing cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive but often-mellowing component of cannabis. CBD beer already exists. But the substance is unlikely to ease big alcohol companies' worries about people swapping booze with pot.""To really solve for the substitution issue, it's going to need to be THC,"" Azer said, referring to the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol.But unlike tequila shots or bong rips, after which you generally know where you stand, edibles or THC coffee might take an hour or two.""People who consumed or who have kind of boomeranged to cannabis probably had a really bad story and experience with an edible, where they didn't know the dosing, or what's in it,"" said Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's director of communications. ""Education is really the key to that.""Eaze, she said, has tried to be upfront about products' THC and CBD levels, so that people can figure out how they react to a milligram or two. Lower-dose edibles, with two milligrams of THC, were popular last year, she said.Even so, achieving consistent taste in edibles and beverages — let alone one that doesn't resemble a rubberized, liquefied version of weed – has been another hurdle.""There have been a lot of folks in our space, the edibles space specifically, that have had trouble with uniformity throughout their products, making sure that one bite and one sip is the same as the next, or discoloration, cloudiness in the case of beverages and food, it can clump up and just taste funky,"" said Alex Howe, co-founder and president of Rebel Coast winery, which is making a THC-oil-infused, alcohol-removed sauvignon blanc.Chip Forsythe, Rebel Coast's winemaker and CEO, said he chose a sauvignon blanc because of the wine's citrusy, lemon-grass notes. And he said it tasted better than other wines when the alcohol is removed, while lending itself to some  characteristics of cannabis.But even as people look to avoid hangovers and alcohol's side effects, making that wine, he said, is far more difficult than letting the grapes sit around while yeast eats the sugar. And he said people still like the taste of the grape-based stuff that has existed for thousands of years.""We did a lot of trials in the beginning thinking that marijuana infused-wine should taste like wine and smell like marijuana,"" Forsythe said. ""We've ruled that out just from getting a tremendous amount of customer feedback on it. People really wanted something that tasted like wine, looked like wine and smelled like wine.""Thomas, of Craft Brew Alliance, said his company has held focus groups and conversations with people in the marijuana industry. He said he would consider making or selling cannabis-infused beverages and other products if federal prohibition were lifted. But he notes that pot regulations differ from state to state, and that competition can differ from product to product.""Trying to compete with weed at something that's predominantly in edible form is a very different animal than trying to compete with weed as something that's part of an ingredient form, is probably totally different than competing with weed, which is kind of an inhalable,"" Thomas said. ""And I think until we really know a lot of that it will be challenging for us to figure out what to do.""None of those products seems likely to wipe out demand for buds. Canopy's Linton likes the odds for marijuana beverages, which combine drinking rituals with the high that comes from smoking.""I've never had somebody say, 'Do you want to come over for Gummi bears?'"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?These Marijuana Stocks With Second-Hand Exposure May Surprise YouHere's How Enormous Marijuana Business Could Get With LegalizationThe Apple Store For Weed Partners With Nasdaq's First Pot Stock

6,STZ,"Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) on Friday said it was looking closely at what it could and couldn't do within the U.S.' growing marijuana industry — saying that if a legal opportunity surfaced, ""we will do it.""""We're looking at it pretty carefully,"" CEO Rob Sands said on a call to discuss Constellation Brands' fiscal first-quarter earnings. ""If we see that opportunity within the confines of what we can legally do, we will do it.""The remarks came in response to an analyst question about Sands' broader thinking about the cannabis market, and to what extent Constellation Brands saw an opening to enter the marijuana business in states like California.Recreational marijuana sales became legal in California in January. Constellation Brands last year invested in Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) a Canadian pot producer. Canada is legalizing recreational pot use, starting in October. Sands on Friday said Constellation had recognized gains of more than $700 million since it invested in Canopy, which recently listed in the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLegalization has raised concerns about how the marijuana industry might cut into alcohol sales. It's also spurred speculation over how it could change the way people socialize.In an effort to get ahead, Heineken (HEINY)-owned Lagunitas, a brewer in California, said this week it will launch a THC-infused sparkling water in California dispensaries on July 30. Sands said Constellation was ""pretty interested"" in what Lagunitas was doing, and how it was doing it.Lagunitas' cannabis beverage, Hi-Fi Hops, stems from a collaboration with AbsoluteXtracts, which is part of CannaCraft, a California marijuana producer.Pot is still illegal on a federal level in the U.S. Making a cannabis-infused beverage directly would put brewers' licenses to make beer at all at risk, according to a story from the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat.Under the collaboration, however, Lagunitas supplies the sparkling water, while CannaCraft handles the THC-infusion process.Molson Coors (TAP) is also reportedly weighing whether to partner with a Canadian marijuana company to offer cannabis-infused drinks. U.K. tobacco company Imperial Brands (IMBBY) this week said it was investing in a medical marijuana research company.Constellation Brands skidded 5.55% in the stock market today, after its earnings per share and full-year profit outlook missed analyst estimates. The company blamed marketing expenses, bad weather, and higher transportation costs.Elsewhere during the call, Sands said its Toronto-based affiliate, Greenstar, was working ""diligently"" with big advertising, marketing and consulting firms to figure out how to take advantage of the cannabis industry. He said the Canopy collaboration aims to develop products ""for the world market.""Canopy in June also said Greenstar had bought up 200 million Canadian dollars' worth of its convertible debt.

The company went public via a reverse takeover deal with Ladera Ventures.In a reverse takeover deal, or RTO, a private company takes control of a public one. Such deals have become the preferred way to go public for marijuana companies. The shell companies used in those deals have become popular enough with cannabis and blockchain companies for some to worry about a shortage.Cassels Brock, a law firm that served as counsel to MedMen for the listing, said in a recent report that due to ""the large number cannabis and blockchain companies choosing to go public by way of RTO, the demand for these public shell companies has skyrocketed.""MedMen has more than 800 employees and 18 licensed marijuana facilities in California, Nevada and New York.

16,STZ,"U.S. pot sales could reach $75 billion by 2030 if the nation fully legalized recreational use, an analyst said in a report Wednesday, potentially making the industry bigger than the U.S. wine market is today.XThe new forecast for the marijuana industry, from Cowen & Co., arrives amid growing support for legalization in the U.S. Expanded recreational access across more U.S. states — including California, the world's biggest legal pot market — and the coming recreational legalization in Canada this year has drawn more newcomers. In the process, those new customers have also begun to transform the way people consume the plant.The $75 billion projection by 2030 compares with current annual U.S. wine sales of about around $60 billion, according to a chart in the report that cited company reports, Cowen's own research and Marijuana Business Daily Factbook 2017. Cigarette sales held at $77 billion and beer sales at $110 billion.Cowen's new projection also assumes soaring growth in just a handful of years. In 2016, Cowen said the recreational cannabis industry could be worth $50 billion by 2026. However, the firm on Wednesday said that ""new forecasts suggest that the market is already that size.""Corona parent Constellation Brands (STZ), for one, estimates that the current size of the cannabis market, including both legal and illegal sales, is at around $50 billion, according to the Cowen report.Alcohol appears likely to be the big loser from pot legalization. The new research from Cowen finds that the monthly level of binge drinking in states where recreational pot use was legal as of 2016 was 13% lower than in states where cannabis was completely illegal.Companies like Brown Forman (BFB), the maker of Jack Daniel's, and others have worried that legal use could dent sales.""This work builds on our prior assertions that cannabis acts as a substitute social lubricant for consumers,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in the report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs the pot industry draws new customers, particularly women and Baby Boomers, demand for products other than loose, dry buds has increased.Monthly spending among women increased 20% last year, amid ""improved access and safety"" and an increase in products targeted toward them, the marijuana delivery platform Eaze said in a report in January.Ready-to-use products, such as buttonless vaping pens, edibles and prerolled joints, have become more popular. Interest in cannabidiol, or CBD, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana, has also grown, as more consumers seek relief from physical pain and anxiety.Jim Patterson, the CEO of Eaze, said that flower, the industry's preferred term for buds, accounted for around 32% of its total sales in the most recent month of available data, according to a separate research note from Cowen. That's well down from around 85% of sales when the company, which operates in California, first started out.Cowen said that Constellation, which owns Corona beer but also caters to craft-beer enthusiasts and people willing to pay more for wine, is best equipped to handle any potential changes in the way people socialize.The company, Azer said, has ""outsized exposure to more affluent, multicultural and gender-diverse consumers"". Constellation was also the first publicly traded alcohol company to gain exposure to cannabis, via its investment in Canopy Growth, a Canadian pot producer.Constellation last week said it had recognized $453 million in total pretax gains from its investment in Canopy.Constellation shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today, Molson Coors (TAP) rose 0.6%, Anheuser Busch (BUD) added 0.4% and Brown-Forman gained 1.4%. Cronos Group (CRON), a Canadian marijuana company that listed on the Nasdaq in February, reversed higher to finished up 0.2%.Cronos Group last month also said it would partner with MedMen, a cannabis retailer and producer in the U.S., to create MedMen Canada.

The deal also would combine the retail knowledge of MedMen and Cronos' 350,000 square feet of production facilities. MedMen Canada will also be focused on research and development, the release said.The joint venture's research and development efforts would go toward developing new products, Daniel Yi, a MedMen spokesman, told IBD.As derivatives of the cannabis plant – from infused pretzels to vaping concentrates to bath products – become more widely available and draw new customers or bring back old ones, they have made up a greater share of cannabis products overall.""People still prefer flower, because that's what they know,"" Yi said, referring to the term often used in the industry to describe loose, dry buds. ""But they're also discovering new products – the edibles and the concentrates – and the trajectory shows that pretty soon, if it hasn't happened already, the non-flower products will constitute a majority of the market sector.""MedMen, a Los Angeles-based company, has 18 facilities across the U.S. and employs nearly 700 people. The company's stores — whose display tablets and clean, minimalist layout resemble an Apple (AAPL) Store for marijuana — are located in California, Nevada and New York.

31,STZ,"Management at Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC), one of the first U.S.-listed marijuana stocks, expects that at least half of the nation's illicit pot market will go legit within the first year of recreational marijuana legalization. The Canadian marijuana producer also called out the pot market in Germany as one of particular promise.Those remarks came Wednesday during the company's first earnings conference call as a U.S.-listed marijuana stock. They also came a week after Canada voted to legalize recreational cannabis.Here are a few highlights:Recreational pot legalization in Canada takes hold on Oct. 17.

Trials are on track to start this summer.Still, Canopy said it expects to have at least 18 retail cannabis stores open in Canada by Oct. 17.While much of Europe has shown signs of embracing legal weed, Linton singled out Germany. The nation, he said, would be ""the market I would keep an eye on over the next 12 months in Europe.""Germany legalized medical marijuana last year. Canopy during the fourth quarter racked up $2.3 million in sales in Germany, amounting to nearly 10% of the company's overall sales.Linton called the rapid sales gains in Germany ""the beginning of the beginning of the beginning.""Linton said he expected half of the illegal pot market to switch over to the legal one within the first year of legalization. That turnover, he said, was likely to accelerate in 2019 as more novel products, like edibles and vaping devices, become legal in the nation.The key to that transition, he said, will be tax revenue and enforcement.""I mean, now, our provinces and the feds actually care,"" he said, ""and to some extent local police care because of the tax dollars.""Canopy Growth shot up 10.7% in the stock market today, bouncing back from an 11% drop on Wednesday on earnings. Cronos Group (CRON) was up 3.9%, after tumbling 9% Wednesday.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG), which has a hydroponics business, edged up 1.6%.Corona beer maker Constellation Brands (STZ) bought a stake in Canopy last year.

38,STZ,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year.

Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion.

Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization.

Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue.

40,STZ,"Marijuana stocks Canopy Growth (CGC) and Cronos Group (CRON) were mixed on Friday, even after President Trump said he would ""probably"" back marijuana-friendly legislation in the U.S. and Canada's senate voted a day earlier to legalize recreational marijuana — with conditions.XBut one analyst suggested the slide in some marijuana stocks could be simple profit-taking following the clearing of a big obstacle in Canada.Trump on Friday made the remarks outside the White House in response to a question from the media on whether he would support a bill that would keep the federal government from intruding on states' efforts to regulate marijuana. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., introduced the bill on Thursday.""I support Senator Gardner,"" Trump said, according to Politico. ""I know exactly what he's doing, we're looking at it. But I probably will end up supporting that, yes.""Trump's remarks put him at odds with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who once said ""good people don't smoke marijuana."" Sessions in January rescinded Obama-era guidance that essentially instructed the federal authorities to take a more laissez-faire approach to states that voted to legalize usage of the plant. Some analysts, and much of the industry, at least publicly, shrugged off the move.The bill from Gardner and Warren could help speed expansion of the marijuana industry in the U.S., where pot is still federally forbidden.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) CEO Jim Hagedorn last month called for more ""states' rights"" as patchwork regulations, particularly in California, weigh on its hydroponics business.In particular, he called for ""a solution that allows the players in the space to have adequate access to banking and to pay a fair tax rate like other businesses.""Banks have to comply with federal regulations. But since the federal government outlaws pot, many marijuana businesses operate on cash, or depend on good relationships with the banks that will take them.U.S. marijuana producer MedMen, in a recent regulatory filing in Canada, noted that its banks ""are fully aware of the nature of the Company's business and continue to remain supportive of the Company's growth plans."" MedMen's dispensaries currently accept cash and debit cards.The company, which has been valued at $1.65 billion, went public in Canada last week.On Thursday, Canada's senate voted 56-30 to legalize recreational marijuana use, amid resistance from the nation's conservative lawmakers. The bill cleared by the senate came with some four dozen amendments that now need to be weighed by the House of Commons.The House of Commons will consider the amendments to the bill and send it back to the Senate.Legislation to legalize recreational marijuana in Canada was first introduced last year. It would allow users to have 30 grams of marijuana. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada.The amendments in the measure cleared by the senate, among other things, placed tougher advertising constraints on marijuana businesses. Marijuana companies would not be able to advertise on T-shirts, hats and other items under that amendment.Another would let Canada's provinces decide whether people can grow their own marijuana at home. Young adults would also get a ticket for sharing small amounts of weed with a minor.""On a longer-term basis, as the market develops, we would expect these rules to be relaxed as unintended consequences do not materialize (which largely has been the case in the U.S.), and the market ultimately migrates more toward an alcohol model,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in a research note dated Friday.The bill, if passed, would give Canada's marijuana businesses a leg up on the U.S. Already, the marijuana industry in Canada has seen a wave of consolidation, as companies try to position themselves for recreational legalization.Canopy Growth, a big Canadian pot producer whose shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange last month, fell intraday but closed up 0.4% at 30.40 in the stock market today. Canopy trades in Canada under the ticker WEED.Cronos Group, another such producer in Canada, lost 5.6%. Cronos listed on the Nasdaq in February, after trading in Canada.""Our publicly traded cannabis stocks have reflected significant strength heading into this announcement,"" Azer said. ""We are not surprised to see modest profit taking with this catalyst largely behind us."" Cowen covers Canopy, MedReleaf and Kush Bottles.Marijuana-focused exchange-traded fund ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ) lost 0.85%. AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), which also has exposure to cannabis, ticked up 1.1%.U.S. and Canadian marijuana companies have found new ways to raise money as they chew away at the legal barriers at their shared border. But areas that have relaxed their marijuana laws have stumbled as they try to bring their sales and business infrastructure online.Scotts Miracle-Gro climbed 1.5% Friday.

41,STZ,"Cannabis tech and infrastructure outfit TILT Holdings is ""absolutely"" considering listing on a U.S. exchange after the company merges, its CEO said, adding to the list of available and potential marijuana stocks to invest in.XThe possible move comes as marijuana companies in the U.S. and Canada show less inhibition about striking cross-border deals to expand and raise money. Such deals are likely to become bigger and more complex, as the industry finds more creative routes around legal roadblocks in the U.S., where marijuana is federally illegal.TILT Holdings is the product of four cannabis companies — one in Canada, three in the U.S. Those four companies announced plans to merge into TILT Holdings last week. The merger, one that appears to be unique in the industry, brings together companies specializing in analytics software, cultivation-related services and logistics for dispensaries and other parts of the marijuana industry.Alex Coleman, TILT's CEO, said he expects the deal to close around mid-August. In a follow-up interview on Monday, he said the company started the process of pursuing a U.S. listing ""in earnest"" last week. Additional details, like which U.S. exchange the company might try to list on, weren't clear yet.He said on Friday that as a company with some business that directly involves handling the plant, ""the United States is still a challenge on the U.S. market.""""But our interest is to continue to trade on other markets as they become available to the company,"" he added later.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCanadian marijuana producer Cronos Group (CRON) in February became the first pure-play marijuana stock to list on the Nasdaq. But more U.S. marijuana stocks are on the horizon.Canopy Growth Corp. said last week that it had applied to list on the New York Stock Exchange. Canopy trades under the ticker ""WEED"" in Canada. It would carry the ticker ""CGC"" on the New York Stock Exchange.Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) took a stake in Canopy Growth last year. Aurora Cannabis, another big Canadian cannabis company, has also expressed interest in a U.S. listing.Similarly, U.S. companies are looking northward to draw money from capital markets in Canada, where recreational legalization is set to kick in this year. Last Monday, Green Thumb Industries, a marijuana producer and dispensary operator in Chicago, detailed plans to go public in Canada via a reverse takeover.U.S. marijuana dispensary chain MedMen, meanwhile, plans to go public in Canada via a reverse takeover deal with Ladera Ventures. Ladera trades on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada. Ladera announced the reverse takeover deal last month. MedMen also has agreed to form a joint venture with Cronos.Meanwhile, there are more indirect marijuana stocks to invest in, such as Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG), which sells hydroponic equipment used in growing weed. GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) makes seizure-fighting drugs containing cannabidiol.And Marijuana-focused ETFs, like ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ) and AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) track the cannabis industry.The TILT Holdings deal arrived the same week as Aurora announced plans to acquire MedReleaf. That tie-up would create a company with a footprint in Canada, Brazil, Australia, Denmark, Italy and Germany.Unlike other marijuana mergers geared toward churning out more pot, the TILT deal focuses more on industry services. The three U.S. companies in the deal are Denver-based software company Baker Technologies; Boston-based Sea Hunter, which offers cultivation, retail and capital support to the industry; and Briteside, in Bend, Ore.The Canadian company is Sante Veritas Holdings, which is trying to get a cultivation license. The combined company will have offices in Denver, Boston and Toronto. It expects to pull in more than $200 million in sales next year.""Aurora acquiring MedReleaf on Monday was a massive headline deal in the Canadian market, more of a play in terms of the production side of the business,"" said Jonathan Sherman, an associate at Cassels Brock, a law firm that advises cannabis businesses, including Canopy Growth.""The TILT transaction seems to be looking at pulling together some of the ancillary aspects of the cannabis industry into one holding company,"" he continued.The deal could be unique in other ways. It's the first Sherman heard of that brought together that many companies in a cross-border deal. The marijuana industry largely subsists on a patchwork of software, from a slew of startups. TILT could help smooth out the software systems marijuana businesses use.""Initially, as the markets evolved both in Canada and the U.S., there hasn't been a platform where there's a real solid integration of softwares,"" said Beau Whitney, senior economist at New Frontier Data, a cannabis research firm.The company intends to offer a ""more holistic solution to the industry,"" Joel Milton, CEO of Baker Technologies, said in a statement on Tuesday announcing the deal.He said TILT will offer ""greater access to capital and resources."" The company also expects to make more acquisitions.""Due to the conflict between federal and state law, the industry still faces numerous challenges that are impeding the ability of businesses to effectively deliver products and services to a large and growing demand base,"" Coleman also said in that statement.Cronos Group rose 3.85% in the stock market today, just under its 50-day line.

And it brings to a close a dispute between the companies over the terms of a takeover.CanniMed had said that an earlier takeover attempt from Aurora — an offer for 24 Canadian dollars a share — had undervalued the company.Under the deal announced Wednesday, Aurora would acquire all the outstanding shares that it did not own. CanniMed stockholders would get 3.4 shares of Aurora for each CanniMed share, or a combination of cash and shares.""We are very pleased to have come to terms with CanniMed on this powerful strategic combination that will establish a best-in-class cannabis company with operations across Canada and around the world,"" Aurora CEO Terry Booth said in a statement.The merger agreement comes as the marijuana business begins to look more like any other legal business.

The Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) CEO said: ""What's going on definitely will come to a bad ending.""Talk about a fresh start for the new year. A cannabis-focused exchange traded fund is soaring as more states legalize marijuana sales.But it's not a newly minted ETF. ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJX) has run up 16.4% so far this year through Jan. 9, according to Morningstar Direct, far ahead of the S&P 500's 2.8% gain. The fund hit a new intraday high Tuesday. It perked up with a 3% jump Dec. 26, when MJX began trading with a new objective and ticker, and has soared 30% since then.Before that date, MJX traded under the ticker LARE and was the Tierra XP Latin America Real Estate ETF. In late October, ETFMG notified investors it would change the Latin America index to Prime Alternative Harvest Index and track marijuana stocks instead.MJX now boasts $317.6 million in assets and owns Canadian pot stocks such as Cronos Group, Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis. It also has positions in medical companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH), a U.K.-based developer of marijuana-derived drugs to treat cancer and other diseases, and Insys Therapeutics (INSY), whose products target cancer pain.A handful of tobacco makers including British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Altria Group (MO) round out the 30 holdings in the portfolio.Since the fund began trading under the new objective and ticker two weeks ago, there isn't really a track record. It's currently extended from any buy point. MJX carries a 0.75% expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) isn't a pure-play marijuana fund. As the name implies, it's a broader theme. As of Dec. 13, cannabis stocks accounted for 20% of its portfolio, while alcohol and tobacco made up the remaining 49% and 32%, respectively.ACT has attracted $15.1 million since its Dec. 12 launch. Its top holdings include alcoholic beverage producer Constellation Brands (STZ), drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV) and agricultural chemical firm Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG).Constellation Brands rose more than 2% Tuesday on news related to its work with Canopy Growth Corp., a Canadian medical marijuana company, to develop nonalcoholic cannabis drinks. The beer and wine giant in October announced it would take a 9.9% stake in Canopy.ACT is flat this year and bears a 0.75% expense ratio.Tuesday's picks, iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD), remain just below their respective buy points.RELATED:Pot Stock Plays Fall, But Here's Why Jeff Sessions May Not Matter MuchStock Market Closes At Record High; Is Bitcoin No Longer A Fraud?Stocks Move As Nvidia, Tesla Drive Techs; Bitcoin, Ripple Dive

51,STZ,"The major market averages looked to extend their 2018 winning streak to four trading sessions early Friday, despite a miss in jobs data. The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in Decembers, compared to a 191,000 estimate.X The tech-heavy Nasdaq moved up 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.3% apiece. All three set record highs, as they looked to cap off the opening week of 2018 with solid gains. The Nasdaq moved almost 3% this week, while the other two major indexes held weekly gains of around 2%.Among the Dow Jones industrials, Microsoft (MSFT) extended a win streak to four trading sessions — up 1.1% — which has seen the stock regain its 86.30 flat-base entry and hit a new high. Shares are still squarely in buy range.Elsewhere in the Dow, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) briefly surpassed its 100.23 flat-base entry in early Friday trade before trimming gains.

The graphics-chip maker is approaching a 218.77 cup-shaped base buy point after regaining its 50-day line in heavy volume earlier this week.Memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) fell 2%, but the stock's over-12% advance this week has propelled it back above its 50-day line. Shares are forming the right side of a potential base formation.Inside the IBD 50, Planet Fitness (PLNT) looked to snap a four-day losing streak, rising 1.2%. Shares remain well-extended from a 27.32 flat-base buy point.Elsewhere in the IBD 50, PayPal (PYPL) moved up 1.7%, as the payment processor etches the right side of a flat base.

54,STZ,"Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) on Friday said it has started building a team in Canada to work on marketing and research efforts with Canopy Growth Corp., a Canadian medical marijuana company it is investing in to develop non-alcoholic cannabis drinks.X While management said that investment would continue, what those drinks might look like and taste like — and when they might debut in Canada — remains unclear. Part of the company's uncertainty stems from how it's interpreting marijuana laws in Canada, particularly over whether Canada's government considers beverages ""edibles.""CEO Rob Sands said during Constellation's third-quarter earnings conference call that it was ""kind of unclear whether they're lumping beverages"" into the edibles category. Recreational usage of marijuana in Canada is set to become legal this year, possibly this summer. Edibles become legal in 2019.Even though no firm details were available on the kinds of products the companies roll out in Canada, Sands said that Tweed, a cannabis company that Canopy owns whose website showcases a small-town aesthetic, had ""a lot of potential."" Canopy would likely handle more of the sales side in Canada, Sands said.Constellation as of now does not have plans to invest in other cannabis companies, Mike McGrew, vice president of corporate communications at the company, said in an interview.Constellation's earnings come amid speculation about how marijuana, which more states have legalized in recent years, might affect beer sales. But when asked about how recreational legalization in California changed the landscape, Sands downplayed the possible impact.""We don't really expect to see any impact from that,"" Sands said. ""I think that one of the things that people don't necessarily appreciate is that cannabis has been generally available as medical marijuana and pretty accessible to almost everybody for 16 years.""The company reported mixed fiscal third-quarter results Friday and approved a new $3 billion share repurchase. Earnings per share rose 2% to $2, topping estimates for $1.87, while sales fell 1% to $1.799 billion, shy of expectations for $1.863 billion.Constellation also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $8.40-$8.50, with the midpoint above consensus for $8.43. Full-year beer sales are seen up 9%-11%.Management said the guidance didn't reflect the impact of the tax reform bill that President Trump signed into law last month. But they said they expected good things, generally, from the bill.Shares sank 2.75% to 219.59 on the stock market today, moving further from an end-of-year breakout buy point but closing above the 50-day moving average.Molson Coors (TAP) gained 1.1%, while Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) added 1%. Brown-Forman (BFB), the maker of Jack Daniel's, inched up 0.2%.Among pot-related stocks and ETFs, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJX) advanced 2.8%, and AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) dipped 0.6%. Cannabidiol drug developer Insys Therapeutics (INSY) popped 8.5% while Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG), which has been bulking up its hydroponics business, rose 1.4%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.Constellation in October said it would take a 9.9% stake in Canopy Growth Corp, and on Friday said it had a $217 million unrealized gain in reported basis results from that investment. Constellation would not sell products in the U.S. or any other area unless it was legal at all levels of government. Canopy Growth said Friday it won't operate in the U.S.And what, exactly, legal pot might mean for the alcohol industry got a lot cloudier on Thursday. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded instructions, issued during the Obama years, that advised U.S. authorities to lay off states that opted to make marijuana legal, as long as they kept it within the state and away from minors, gangs and criminal groups.""In deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute under these laws with the Department's finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,"" the memo said.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said the decision wouldn't radically alter the situation in states where marijuana is legal, with some states' attorneys general unlikely to crack down.And while legalized recreational use of cannabis is seen as a threat to alcohol consumption, Azer has argued Constellation is the least vulnerable, saying it is able to ""play across wine and spirits,"" which comprise roughly 30% and 5% of the company's sales, respectively.She added that its beers like Corona appeal more to Hispanic consumers — who, research shows, were found to be less likely to use cannabis than whites and African Americans — and to women, who were found to be less likely to use it than men.""We see this as an emerging global trend that has been emerging for years,"" McGrew said of the cannabis market, ""and we don't see that going back.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:This Beer Giant, Like Constellation Brands, Is Eyeing The Pot MarketStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

55,STZ,"February's stock market performance serves as a reminder that volatility can still take a bite out of market leaders like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). After a stunning 2017 in which everything worked, the market entered January with aggressive buying, sending the major indexes to all-time highs.X But February started with a shocking reversal. The market experienced its first correction, defined as a 10% drop, in two years. The S&P 500's 10.2% decline was as swift as it was dramatic. It lasted just nine days, ending Feb. 8. But the damage was done.Despite bouncing back the last three weeks, the benchmark ended the month down 3.89%. It's first monthly loss since March 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.3% in February, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 3.61% according to Lipper Inc. Surprisingly, S&P 500 Index funds beat the index by 18 basis points, down 3.71%, according to Lipper.General domestic taxable bond funds average a loss of 0.8% in February and were down 0.75% year to date.""The past month has been a snapback of the previous month,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds. In January investor sentiment turned aggressive, especially in technology, buying went a little too far too fast, Hackett said. Then at the beginning of February it reversed, partly triggered by the specter of rising interest rates.""It was indiscriminate selling,"" said Hackett. ""Even the names you would think of as safe havens didn't work because people thought of the defensive stocks, like telecom and utilities, as bond proxies and sold them. The fact we had a correction is not the slightest bit unusual and actually a healthy thing. You get a pressure valve release, so things don't get overheated and people don't get too complacent.""David Joy, the chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said he wasn't surprised the market recovered quickly, ""because there was no change in the fundamental outlook. We think the economy will be quite strong and that we're going to get growth close to 3% this year.""The February bounce back came because of two events from Washington, the spending bill and tax reform, which combined should increase gross domestic product over the next two years by 50 basis points, said Lawrence Kemp, the portfolio manager of the BlackRock Capital Appreciation Fund (MAFGX). The fund was up 6.75% year to date going into Friday vs. the S&P 500's return of 0.49%, according to Morningstar.""That's positive for additional money for the consumer to spend and for corporations to invest and to increase dividends and buy back stock,"" said Kemp. ""It's a very positive tailwind regarding U.S. fundamentals and for very strong earnings growth.""We're overweight in technology,"" said Kemp. ""Financials will benefit from a rising rate environment.""Among the fund's top 10 holdings are five technology stocks, Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline Group) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).His top financial picks are Visa (V) and Bank of America (BAC). He also said he thinks the health care sector and consumer discretionary stocks will do well this year. He likes UnitedHealth (UNH) and Constellation Brands (STZ), a beer and wine company.Hackett and Joy agree that technology and financials are likely to do well. Other technology companies to look at are the ones repatriating income back to the U.S., such as Apple (AAPL), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).As for financials, they say look at the large money center banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).  They both also see potential in late-cycle winners like industrials. This would include Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX)) and 3M (MMM).The names that were down because of interest rates have not bounced back nearly as much. Hackett said real estate is down 9% year-to-date, telecom is down 8% utilities are down 7% and consumer staples are down 7%, Names that were defensive and that you would expect to perform well in a volatile period to perform have not and are not viewed as defensive but as interest rates sensitive, and are suffering because of that.""We're also constructive on the international markets,"" said Joy. ""We like equity market in most parts of the world, developed and emerging, as there is a global recovery. There are not too many countries where the economies are not expanding. You still get very accommodative central bank policies in Europe and Japan and cheaper valuations.""""Even with huge upside in the U.S., we think foreign markets are one of the best places to be at this point, with the dollar weakening, the rest of the world lags the U.S. by two or three years,"" said Hackett, who said optimal international equity exposure would be 40%.RELATED:See What Leading Stocks Are Driving This American Century Growth FundNew To Stock Investing?

61,STZ,"General Motors (GM), Kansas City Southern (KSU), Constellation Brands (STZ) and other U.S. companies with big Canada and Mexico stakes lurched lower Wednesday afternoon on renewed worries that President Trump could pull out of Nafta.X Two Canadian government sources told Reuters the country is bracing for Trump to announce that the United States will pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. president has often derided the landmark 1994 treaty as harming the interests of American factory workers.But while Trump seeks a better trade deal, U.S. multinationals such as GM and Ford Motor (F) fret that potential changes to trade terms could disrupt international supply chains and raise the prices of key goods, such as automobiles, for Americans.On the stock market today, shares of GM turned sharply lower after the news broke out around 2 p.m. ET and closed down 2.4% at 43, testing support at the 50-day moving average. Kansas City Southern sank 3.6% to 106.54, breaching the 50-day line. Constellation lost 1.2%, losing support at the 50-day. Ford slipped 0.4%.Exchange traded funds holding baskets of Canadian and Mexican stocks also turned sharply negative. IShares MSCI Mexico (EWW) slid 2.2%, slicing below the 50-day, and iShares MSCI Canada (EWC) gave up 1%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is a curated list of potential stock market winners.GM and Ford have invested heavily in auto plants in Mexico in recent years. Constellation is the leading importer of Mexican beers into the U.S., including popular brands such as Corona and Modelo, which account for a hefty portion of its revenue. Kansas City's extensive rail network crisscrosses several Southern and Midwestern states and reaches deep into Mexico.The Canadian sources told Reuters they expect Trump to make his move when officials from the three Nafta countries meet Jan. 23-28 for talks in Montreal to update the treaty.But they added a U.S. withdrawal could be merely a negotiating tactic to win concessions, doubting that the U.S. Congress would back such a move.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Rise Modestly, As Curious Trend Re-Emerges Hot Companies In Hot Sector To Report: Investing Action Plan

63,STZ,"Spirits have chipped away at beer's popularity for several years, but executives at Brown-Forman (BFB) see an even faster-growing kind of booze than spirits: straight-up hard liquor.X The owner of Jack Daniel's, Herradura tequila, Chambord and other kinds of liquor also ratcheted up its full-year profit and underlying net sales guidance and easily topped fiscal second-quarter forecasts on Wednesday. The results, as one analyst suggested during the company's earnings call, stood out as other companies in the consumer-staples industry struggle.CEO Paul Varga attributed that success, in part, to what the company has been doing for decades.""Our categories, where we're focused – American whiskeys, bourbons, increasingly tequilas, Irish – these are categories today that are growing ahead of even the distilled spirits category in the United States,"" he said during the company's earnings call. ""We think we're particularly well positioned.""The premium ends of those kinds of liquor, he said, tend to be the categories that are growing ahead of the market.Management also said that it was positioning its new Tennessee Rye for ""long-term success,"" and expected it to help sales for the rest of the year.That strategy could echo the way it has treated its Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and its cinnamon-flavored Tennessee Fire — both of which have been rolled out in recent years in attempt to draw millennial drinkers. Varga said ""it was a conscious choice to treat those more like brands,"" rather than novelty flavors.The company, in a statement, attributed the gains in the second quarter to ""improving economies in the emerging markets,"" and the appeal of Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Herradura tequila. Growth in Poland and Mexico was strong. Varga, during the call, singled out what he described as the rapidly-increasing popularity of Herradura Ultra in Mexico, where tequila isn't exactly in short supply.While the company suggested it was satisfied with its strategy to drive tequila sales, management said it might need to refine how it sells its single-malt scotch, which tends to be sold more uniquely, and at a higher price, than other kinds of liquor.The company said its Scotch brands aren't performing up to plans right now due to hiccups related to timing on bringing them to market.Shares were up 6.5% at 65.82 on the stock market today, a record close after surging as much as 9.6% intraday.IBD'S TAKE: On the search for even more stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more. Brown-Forman's fiscal Q2 earnings per share jumped 23% to 62 cents, while reported net sales rose 10% to $914 million. Wall Street expected EPS of 53 cents and revenue of $868 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.The company boosted its full-year EPS outlook to $1.90-$1.98, up from a prior view of $1.85-$1.95, with the midpoint above the consensus for $1.92. Brown-Forman now sees underlying net sales growth of 6%-7%, up from an earlier view for 4%-5%. The EPS forecast was helped by better sales, a slightly lower tax rate, and expectations for lower inventories.The company said it expects more modest growth in emerging markets for the rest of the fiscal year.Brown-Forman faces stiff competition from other big booze companies like Constellation Brands (STZ) — whose portfolio includes Corona, Kim Crawford wines and other spirits — and Diageo (DEO), whose brands include Smirnoff, Tanqueray and Captain Morgan. News surfaced earlier this year that Brown-Forman rejected a takeover offer from Constellation.But shares of Brown-Forman have climbed since late August, when the company raised its full-year EPS forecast and delivered estimate-topping first-quarter earnings, marking what Zacks analysts called a rebound from a ""dismal"" prior quarter.A lower tax rate and an easier foreign exchange environment influenced the full-year forecast at that time, but the company also held to its sales outlook despite troubled economies outside the U.S.Brown-Forman's results also arrive as the alcoholic beverage industry tries to figure out what to do with marijuana, around which a rapidly growing industry has formed as more U.S. states legalize the plant.Constellation in October said it agreed to take a 9.9% stake in the Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth, while Molson Coors (TAP) said last month that the company had a team to gauge ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the cannabis industry.Brown-Forman last month said it was ""continuing to monitor"" the cannabis industry's development, without offering further detail. The subject did not come up during Wednesday's conference call.RELATED:Monster Beverage Tumbles Below Buy Point On Low-Energy EarningsAs Investors Eye Marijuana Industry, These Products May Go Mainstream

65,STZ,"Stocks and exchange traded funds tied to cannabis, from Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) to ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJX), skidded on Thursday on news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions will roll back the measure that has encouraged more states to legalize using and selling the plant.X The move comes just days after recreational marijuana became legal in California, the biggest potential market for cannabis. And it comes as scores of small businesses — increasingly confident that Sessions wouldn't crack down on the plant despite his vocal disdain for it — open up shop to sell marijuana candy, cannabidiol tinctures, THC coffee, and lighting, security and technology products related to the plant.While the move by the Trump administration may make federal prosecutors take a harder stance, Cowen analyst Vivien Azer shrugged it off by noting that state and local officials in top cannabis markets remain more open.""We don't view this as terribly disruptive, as enforcement decisions will seemingly be left to state-level AGs,"" she said in a research note. ""In legal adult use cannabis states, given the tax revenue generation, we believe local governments and AGs are largely onboard with legalization.""Lawn-care company Scotts Miracle-Gro, which has been bulking up its hydroponics business, closed down 2.3% in the stock market today, but had dropped as much as 5.2% earlier. Insys Therapeutics (INSY), whose shares jumped late last month after the FDA gave fast-track designation to a cannabidiol drug it was developing, plunged 26%. Cannabidiol, or CBD, has been used broadly as a relaxant.ETFMG Alternative Harvest, an ETF tied to such stocks as GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) and Canopy Growth Corp., tumbled 6%. AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), which allocates 20% of its holdings to the cannabis industry, reversed higher to finish up 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.The Justice Department said it plans to rescind 2013's so-called Cole Memo, which essentially said the federal government would take a lighter enforcement approach to states that legalized marijuana, provided they kept the market under control. The Associated Press reported the move earlier.U.S. prosecutors in states that have legalized the plant will determine how much they want to enforce federal law. Marijuana is still illegal on a federal level.Cowen & Co. has estimated that cannabis could become a $50 billion market by 2026, potentially threatening the beer and wine industry and helping the fast-food industry — particularly restaurants concentrated in California.But alcohol companies like Constellation Brands (STZ) and Molson Coors (TAP) have signaled interest in pot-related products.Meanwhile, Jack in the Box (JACK) will be working with Merry Jane, a cannabis-focused media company co-founded by rapper Snoop Dogg, to launch a campaign to promote a late-night ""Merry Munchie Meal"" this month in parts of Southern California.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:This Beer Giant, Like Constellation Brands, Is Eyeing The Pot MarketThese Hard Liquors Are Gaining Popularity Now As Tastes Shift

66,STZ,"Energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) reported mixed third-quarter results Wednesday after the market close.Estimates: Earnings per share growth of 21% to 40 cents, on revenue of $901 million, a 14% pop.Results: EPS rose to just 38 cents. Net sales rose 15% to $909.5 million.Stock: Monster Beverage fell 5.5% to 54.80 in after-hours trading, suggesting the stock will undercut a flat-base 57.35 entry. During the regular session, shares closed up 0.1% at 58 in the stock market today.Wall Street will likely be looking for signs indicating whether the company can keep growing internationally. Results in the U.S. could also be a focus as that segment laps easy comparisons.Monster's biggest growth prospects lie outside the U.S., analysts say, in large part through the expanded access to Coca-Cola's (KO) bottling and distribution network that the company gained via a deal announced in 2014.The company earlier this year began distributing through Coca-Cola bottlers in parts of the Caribbean and in nations like Jordan and Pakistan. In August, Monster said it would expand in Africa and that it continued to ""make progress"" toward a relaunch in India planned for this year.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said she'd be watching for updates on those regions as well as plans to begin distribution via Coca-Cola bottlers in Taiwan and Vietnam. Trends surrounding Mutant, an ultra-caffeinated response to PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew, and Hydro, an ultra-caffeinated response to water, are also points of interest.Monster's results also come as soda demand wanes amid a wellness boom. Cannabis also appears likely to grow as a rival to alcohol and caffeine in the beverage industry. Some companies already use THC and CBD in coffees, teas and sports drinks. Cowen cites ""emerging access to legal cannabis"" as an investment risk for Monster.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.Some alcohol companies have begun to stir as marijuana-related startups proliferate. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) late last month announced plans to buy a portion of a Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth. Molson Coors (TAP) said last week it had a team in place to gauge the ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of cannabis.Constellation Brands rose 1%.

Constellation CEO Rob Sands said the investment was part of its plans to identify ""early stage consumer trends.""IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.THC and CBD — the components in cannabis that make people feel what they do when they consume it — already appear in coffee, tea, candies, honey and other edibles and drinkables.

He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

99,STZ,"Three highly rated stocks -- Constellation Brands (STZ), Acuity Brands (AYI) and Ollie's Bargain Outlets (OLLI) -- are all on tap to report this week. Here's what to expect:The distributor of Corona beer in the U.S. has a Q4 earnings call scheduled for Wednesday morning. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting 11% earnings growth to $1.14 a share on a 12% revenue rise to $1.52 billion.While the anticipated profit results would mark a slowdown for Constellation, which also sells Svedka vodka, Robert Mondavi wine and Arbor Mist, revenue forecasts signal an expected return to double-digit sales growth after five straight quarters of mid- to high-single-digit gains.Shares, which changed little Tuesday, have been forming a cup base with a 155.78 entry point for the last two months, with the stock edging closer to that buy point since retaking support at its 50-day line in mid-March.Constellation stock has a 91 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it has outperformed 91% of all other publicly traded stocks on a mix of technical and fundamental factors.Constellation Brands stock fell just 1 cent to 151.45 on the stock market today.The lighting company, which also reports early Wednesday, is expected to grow its Q2 earnings by 40% to $1.51 a share. Revenue is seen climbing 22% to $752.3 million.Acuity's stock rose 2.2% to 225.05 in strong volume breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 222.95.Its brands include Lithonia Lighting, Holophane, Winona and others. The stock has earned a 96 IBD Composite Rating.Recent new issue Ollie's undercut the bottom of end of its buy range after forming a wide cup-with-handle base with 22.63 entry point.Shares fell 3.6% to 22.49.The value retailer, which has 204 stores across 17 states in the Eastern part of the U.S., reports Q4 and full-year results after the close on Wednesday. Wall Street expects 28 cents a share on $239.1 million in revenue from the company, which went public last July.Ollie's holds a 99 IBD Composite Rating.

100,STZ,"The stock market opened sharply lower Tuesday, hurt by more weak manufacturing data out of China along with a sell-off in European stock markets.The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average all fell around 1%.Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by about 4 to 1. The ratio was 3 to 1 on the Nasdaq.Gold added to recent gains as the dollar weakened again. It edged higher to just under $1,300 an ounce. Money flowed into bonds as the 10-year Treasury yield crashed 8 basis points to 1.79%.In the stock market today, early gainers in the Dow included Pfizer (PFE). The drugmaker jumped 2% to 33.61 on earnings. It's been working its way higher in a long consolidation, finding a new home above 32 and its 200-day moving average.Who are the leaders in Pfizer's Medical-Ethical Drugs group? Consult IBD Stock Checkup to find out.Meanwhile, after eight straight declines, Apple (AAPL) rallied 0.8% in the early going.Inside the IBD 50, a couple of defensive stocks continued to trade tightly and hold near highs. Prestige Brands (PBH) added a penny to 57.61. Constellation Brands (STZ) eased 0.2% to 157.45.A couple of growth names are set to report earnings after the close today: AmSurg (AMSG) and Paycom (PAYC).

102,STZ,"With no shortage of uncertainty surrounding the world economy, acceleration in a company's earnings-per-share growth can be a reassuring sign while deceleration may point to a plateau.Now that the first quarter has ended, here's a look at some of the IBD 50's bigger potential accelerators, which include Facebook (FB) and some of the companies whose earnings are seen as slowing, such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Broadcom (AVGO) and beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ).Even as Twitter (TWTR) struggles to draw in enough users to satisfy investors, Facebook has benefited from improvements to mobile ads and videos.The company's news-centric, Twitter-esque modifications to its user feeds haven't hurt, either. Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus Rift could also help lead future sales growth and keep the company at the forefront of developments in media-sharing and virtual reality, analysts say.Analysts expect Facebook's Q1 EPS to rise 48%. That's up from 46% in Q4 and 33% in Q3, and marking the fourth consecutive quarter of EPS growth.Facebook shares appeared to be on the verge of breaking out or forming the handle of a cup base with a 117.69 buy point. The base began its formation early last month. The company's three-year EPS growth rate has outpaced both Apple and Alphabet.Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet's Q1 EPS growth is seen slowing to 23% from 28% in the prior quarter.The tech giant has grown on the strength of mobile ads, but Facebook has beaten the company in app downloads, and it faces continued scrutiny in the European Union and struggles in some of its non-search offshoots.Alphabet holds its Q1 conference call on April 21. The stock is currently making its way through a cup base begun in February with an 810.45 buy point.Broadcom's fiscal Q2 EPS growth is expected to grow 12%, but that's down from 15% growth in the prior quarter and 26% in the quarter before that.The Q2 estimates, if they hold up, would mark the fifth straight quarter of slowing EPS growth for the chipmaker. The Apple supplier, like other chipmakers, has faced concerns over weaker iPhone demand.Among other top tech names, Chinese web portal NetEase (NTES) will see EPS growth slow to 30% from 60%, and graphics chip company Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to report a 3% EPS decline, down from a 21% gain.Beer-and-wine company Constellation Brands faces its third straight quarter of EPS growth deceleration when it reports Q4 results on Wednesday. The stock is close to breaking out of a cup base with a 155.78 buy point.Analysts see EPS gaining 11%, but that's down from 15% in the prior quarter and would be the fifth straight quarter of deceleration.The company last year bought craft brewer Ballast Point, following years in which smaller breweries have broadened customers' options and taken business away from larger mass producers. That acquisition, along with Constellation's Mexican beer offerings, should also help drive sales, Reuters noted.Some of the biggest EPS growth acceleration, however, could come from the REIT sector.CoreSite Realty’s (COR) Q1 EPS is seen surging 295%, building up from 52% growth in the quarter before. The company reports Q1 results April 28. Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS), whose Q1 earnings conference call is set for April 19, is seen boosting its EPS for the quarter by 181%, in contrast to 17% in the prior quarter. Store Capital’s (STOR) Q1 EPS is set to climb 147%, up from 38%.

106,STZ,"Stocks were mixed and mostly unchanged early Wednesday, with oil prices and mixed quarterly earnings reports driving a good amount of the action.The Nasdaq added 0.2%, the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2% and the S&P 500 barely budged.The stock market today heads into its midweek session with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 toting losses for the week -- with the Nasdaq down 1.4% and the S&P 500  off 1.3%. Maybe more important, the Nasdaq headed into Wednesday's session below its 200-day moving average after retaking that line of support a week ago.The S&P 500 and the Dow remain comfortably above their 200-day lines. The small-cap Russell 2000 Index, down 2% this week, has traded below the 200-day level since August.The 2 p.m. Eastern release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's March 16 meeting will provide an economic center point for the session.

Gold edged below $1,227 an ounce. The dollar gained. Bonds slipped, trimming the 10-year yield 3 basis points to 1.75%.  Overseas market closed narrowly mixed in Asia, with Europe's markets showing similar action near midday.Pfizer and Allergan (AGN) formally announced plans abandon the $160 billion deal that would have shifted Pfizer's headquarters to Ireland and provided the company an overseas tax shelter. Such tax inversion deals were the focus of Treasury Department rules unveiled on Monday.Pfizer was concerned that any effort to salvage the deal would provoke new rules from Treasury, according to Reuters. Pfizer reportedly will pay Allergan a $150 million termination fee. Allergan edged higher on the news while Pfizer added around 1%.Oil and energy-related stocks posted the best gains among S&P 500 stocks.Among IBD 50 stocks, Acuity Brands (AYI) soared 9% in early trade.  The Atlanta-based lighting distributor reported a heavy fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings beat and a 200 basis point increase in its gross margin.

109,STZ,"The bigger the debt, the harder it is for borrowers to dig out of the hole. The same often holds true for companies too.""Rule 1 for all competent investors and homeowners is never ever borrow more than you can pay back. Excessive debt hurts all people, companies and governments,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""IBD uses the long-term debt-to-equity (LTD-to-E) ratio to determine if a company is showing too much borrowing risk. The ratio is simply a company's long-term debt divided by shareholders equity, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage figure.A ratio of 100% or more implies that a firm is borrowing at an aggressive pace to fuel its expansion. It could also indicate a company is overreaching and not growing in a disciplined manner. By the same token, if a company's LTD-to-E ratio is falling year to year, it might be worth a second look. ""A corporation that's been reducing its debt as a percentage of equity over the last two or three years is worth considering,"" O'Neil wrote. ""If nothing else, interest costs will be sharply reduced, helping to generate higher earnings for share.""So when comparing two stock candidates for purchase, assuming they are in the same industry and all else being equal, pick the company with the smaller LTD-to-E ratio.Some industries require heavy spending to grow, so it may be natural for companies in those industries to borrow heavily. Firms in the telecom, heavy construction, and oil and gas exploration fields tend to carry heavier debt. Yet in other industries, the best-run companies may carry zero long-term debt. So be sure not to compare stocks from different industries. Do an apples-to-apples comparison.A company may take on debt for various uses. For instance, a business that is growing via acquisitions may need cash to fund those purchases, with the idea that the buys will help it expand going forward. Or a telecom company wants to build more towers to reach its ultimate goal of growing its subscriber base.In a study of the greatest stock market winners, IBD found that many of them didn't have much debt.The accompanying table shows current leaders with outstanding EPS and RS ratings, priced at least $20 a share, and an average daily volume of at least 1 million shares. Facebook (FB), New Oriental Education (EDU), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Ross Stores (ROST), show zero to low single-digit debt ratios.Constellation Brands (STZ), Extra Space Storage (EXR), Hawaiian Holdings (HA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) occupy the higher end. Beer and wine maker Constellation has made a number of acquisitions over the past few years and is planning to expand its Nava brewery in northeast Mexico. Verizon has been spending on wireless spectrum space to build out its wireless network.Companies can finance future investments in new products, services or plants and equipment by issuing new shares as well. This too can dilute shareholder value in the long run.

111,STZ,"Superstitious investors may be aware of the ""Super Bowl indicator,"" which says that if an original NFL team wins, the market will end the year up, but an original AFL win translates to a down year for stocks.Regardless of who triumphs on Sunday, these four names are likely to appear at the big game, whether at the stadium or in living rooms across America:The Swoosh is a recurring member of the IBD 50 and also the NFL's official outfitter, which means that both the Denver Broncos and North Carolina Panthers will be geared up in Nike on the field.Nike (NKE) remains, far and away, the market leader in sportswear, but Under Armour (UA) has been aggressively trying to capture more market share. Panthers quarterback Cam Newton endorses Under Armour.

Nevertheless, the stock sank 6.1%, tumbling below its 50-day moving average and closing below that level for the first time since late September. Constellation hit a record high on Monday but ended the week down 9.5%.Both victory and defeat will surely spill over onto social media after the game, and clips of Budweiser's Clydesdales and wacky Super Bowl ads are bound for Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR).Facebook recently said that it intends to raise 2016 capital spending by about 70% to $4 billion-$4.5 billion.The company has also been working on turning social networking into social commerce as it develops M, a virtual personal assistant that can help make appointments or buy movie tickets.

113,STZ,"Cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA), coffee king Starbucks (SBUX),  “innovative” drug companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and a few biotechs make Morgan Stanley’s list of companies with pricing power.Amid a low-inflation environment and worries over a global recession, stocks with pricing power should get a serious look, says the Morgan Stanley report.Its list also includes American Tower (AMT), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Equinix (EQIX), L Brands (LB), Mindbody (MB), Phillip Morris (PM), Reynolds American (RAI), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take on why some of these companies have pricing power.1) American Tower. “Towers effectively offer local monopolies, and there is little alternative for wireless carriers wishing to add capacity to improve network quality.”2) Amgen. “While drug pricing has been a topic of debate since U.S. presidential candidates raised focus on the topic in the late summer of 2015, we continue to see pricing power among large cap biotech.”3) Biogen. “In 2015, management took around 11% to 12% gross price increases across its portfolio.”4) Celgene. “Management in 2015 took 7-10% gross price increases across its portfolio and we would expect a similar net price trend in 2016.”5) Comcast. “We are positive on CMCSA’s broadband growth story and see improved results in video given X1 (set-top box deployment).”6) Sherwin-Williams. “(Its) pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors.7) Starbucks. “SBUX remains the category leader in the high-margin, premium coffee segment and benefits from selling an often-craved, habitual product.”

114,STZ,"What happens when the market goes down and stays down? Your Weekly Review list gets shorter, and defensive stocks tend to shine. And that's certainly the case right now. This week's list of leading stocks still falls well short of the usual 120-plus that make the cut in a healthy market. Many top growth stocks have dropped off the list, while defensive plays like utilities, real estate investment trusts and food companies raise their profile.Such stocks may not typically be highfliers, but they can offer steady growth and usually pay a dividend. While defensive sectors are viewed as a relative safe haven, keep in mind no stocks are truly safe stocks in a market correction.Atmos Energy (ATO) is finding support at its 10-week moving average as it trades just below a 63.87 flat-base buy point initially cleared Dec. 28 in light trade. The stock's Relative Strength line is near highs, a bullish sign. The Dallas-based natural gas utility serves customers in eight states. Atmos has an annualized dividend yield of 2.7%, above the S&P 500's average 2.3% payout.One Gas (OGS), featured in Thursday's New Highs column, is a natural gas distributor based in Tulsa, Okla. Shares remain in buy range from a 49.97 flat-base entry. All buys, though, are extremely risky with the market in correction. Its annualized yield is also 2.7%.Public Storage (PSA) is an operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S. and Europe. Public Storage shares fell below a 254.05 four-weeks-tight buy point Wednesday, but they found support at the 10-week line Thursday. The REIT's annualized payout is 2.8%. It is featured on today's New America page.Constellation Brands (STZ) continues to trend higher. The stock is well extended from a 122.23 buy point and multiple pullbacks to the 10-week line. The wine, spirits and beer company has a five-year earnings growth rate of 25%. Analysts expect a 21% jump in fiscal 2016 and 13% in 2017.

119,STZ,"A falling stock market has whittled the Weekly Review down to a fraction of its bull-market self. To make the list, a stock needs Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength ratings of at least 85. That's why the list makes up IBD's 85-85 index. In a healthy market, 120 stocks make the cut for publication. But as the market has fallen in recent weeks, not enough stocks are highly enough rated in both categories to fill the list.The list is sorted by industry group, with the highest-ranking groups close to the top. One of the few groups with solid representation is the real estate investment trust group. Six stocks made the cut.Constellation Brands (STZ) makes and distributes beers, such as Corona; wines, such as those made by Robert Mondavi; and spirits, such as those made by Black Velvet.The stock continues to be a winner, trading near all-time highs as it bounces along the north side of its 50-day moving average. It's extended from a base. Remember: Only the first two pullbacks to the 50-day line are safe secondary entries.On Jan. 7, the company reported earnings 15% above those of a year earlier. The stock gapped to a new high that day, but it has since given back that gain.Chuy's Holdings (CHUY) made the cut. It's broken out of a base with a 34.19 buy point but gave back a good part of its gain in recent days. It operates more than 60 Tex-Mex restaurants in 14 states with an ""upbeat, funky, eclectic, somewhat irreverent atmosphere.""The stock has three quarters of good earnings growth, but analysts expect a 7% year-over-year decline in the next report.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is back among the leaders, reporting accelerating earnings and sales over the past several quarters. The company makes the da Vinci robotic surgical system. The stock built a cup-with-handle base and attempted a breakout Wednesday, but it reversed before the day was out and fell below the buy point.

195,STZ,"In the world of beer, the new factor is craft beers. You already knew that if you drink and read the beer labels, but you probably couldn't put a number on it. Statistics from the Brewers Association paint a pretty picture. U.S. barrel-volume growth in 2014 was 17.6% for craft beers but only 0.5% for beer overall. And the barrel-volume growth of export craft beers was 36%, showing that the trend isn't confined to the U.S.Constellation Brands (STZ), a big-cap company, stepped into the craft space Monday when it announced that it would buy San Diego-based Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits, a craft brewery, for $1 billion.Ballast Point says annual revenue is set to double in 2015, from about $50 million in 2014 to an estimated $115 million this year.The craft-beer buy is the second acquisition for Constellation Brands in 2015. In August, the company wrapped up the acquisition of California-based Meiomi, a high-margin, fine-wine brand. Constellation paid $315 million for Meiomi.Constellation Brands is the third largest producer and marketer of beer in the U.S. market and a leading premium wine company. Brands include Corona beer, Paul Masson wine and Wild Irish Rose, a fortified wine.After a 6% decline in earnings in 2013, Constellation grew EPS 48% in 2014 and 37% in fiscal 2015 ended in February. Revenue jumped 74% and 24% in fiscal 2014-15. The 74% revenue gain reflected the acquisition of Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch for $4.75 billion.The Street expects 16% earnings growth in fiscal 2016.Quality funds like this stock, with Fidelity Contrafund , Fidelity Balanced Fund and BNY Mellon Mid Cap Multi-Strategy Fund adding to their positions in Q3.Constellation's chart shows that a flat base has formed. The base is easier to see on the weekly chart than on the daily. The potential buy point is 138.98.

Brown Forman (BFB), maker of Jack Daniels whiskey and other brands, was up less than 1%.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

448,STZ,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance Report
"
449,STZ,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
450,STZ,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
451,STZ,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
452,STZ,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
453,STZ,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
454,STZ,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
455,STZ,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
456,STZ,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
457,STZ,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
458,STZ,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
459,STZ,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
460,STZ,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
461,STZ,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
462,STZ,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
463,STZ,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
464,STZ,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
465,STZ,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
466,STZ,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
467,STZ,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
468,STZ,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
469,STZ,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
470,STZ,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
471,STZ,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
472,STZ,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
473,STZ,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
474,STZ,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
475,STZ,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
476,STZ,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
477,STZ,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
478,STZ,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
479,STZ,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
480,STZ,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
481,STZ,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
482,STZ,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
483,STZ,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
484,STZ,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
485,STZ,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
486,STZ,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
487,STZ,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
488,STZ,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
489,STZ,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
490,STZ,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
491,STZ,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
492,STZ,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
493,STZ,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
494,STZ,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
495,STZ,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
496,STZ,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
497,STZ,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
498,STZ,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
499,STZ,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
500,STZ,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
501,STZ,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
502,STZ,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
503,STZ,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
504,STZ,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
505,STZ,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
506,STZ,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"
507,STZ,"And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets.

"
520,STZ,"Whole Foods is recovering from a disappointing earnings report last May. The company reported EPS that was flat from a year ago. The stock gapped down and closed nearly 19% lower. It traded sideways into November, then starting rising, building the right side of a long, deep base.
"
521,STZ,"It got back on track with an earnings report Nov. 6 when it gapped up 12% on a more favorably received earnings report. It gapped up again on an earnings report Feb. 12, but it needs more work before it's buyable.

"
526,STZ,"Starbucks reported earnings after the close Jan. 22 and gapped out of a flat base the next morning, finishing the day nearly 7% higher. The flat base could also be considered the slightly high handle of a long consolidation going back to November 2013.
"
527,STZ,"It's now well extended from any buy point.

556,STZ,"Low gas prices are among the factors driving consumers to take trips to stores for food and beverages, a trend that could help propel beverage stocks such as high-rated Monster Beverage (MNST), Boston Beer (SAM) and Constellation Brands (STZ) this year.The beverage category is already feeling the impact of lower gas prices. It saw a nice pop in sales for all in-store carbonated soft drink categories and the beer category for the four weeks that ended Dec. 20, according to a report by analyst Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo Securities citing Nielsen data.Herzog credits lower gas prices for the ""strong"" in-store sales at U.S. convenience stores across all categories during the four weeks.Strong average price growth drove total carbonated beverage dollar sales in the U.S. convenience-store channel, excluding the energy drink category, up a solid 3.6% vs. a year earlier for the four weeks ending Dec. 20, Herzog noted.Continued strong growth for Monster and Red Bull fueled the energy drink category to dollar sales growth of 10.9% at convenience stores for the four-week period, Herzog said.IBD 50 stock Monster is in IBD's Beverages-Non-Alcoholic industry group. It has the highest Composite Rating in the group: 95 out of a possible 99.

""We remain encouraged by the KO-MNST partnership as well as positive results from innovation, and we believe growth should continue to accelerate heading into FY2015 and beyond, particularly if retail gas prices continue to support strong in-store sales.""Unit growth of 2% and pricing growth of 2.8% drove beer dollar sales in the U.S. convenience-store channel up a solid 4.8% for the four week period, Herzog wrote.Alcoholic beverage distributor Constellation continued its strong sales growth trends of a 21.9% increase from a year earlier for the four-week period, while Boston Beer saw dollar sales rise 19.8%.Constellation and Boston Beer are a part of IBD's Beverages-Alcoholic industry group.

606,STZ,"Constellation Brands' (STZ) Q2 earnings growth is expected to moderate as the boost from its Grupo Modelo acquisition last year fades.Wall Street forecasts earnings per share of $1.15, up 20% from a year earlier, when the beer and liquor company reports Thursday. The 20% rise would be smaller than the EPS growth of 182%, 72% and 75% in prior three quarters.Revenue is projected to rise 12.5% to $1.64 billion, in large part on strong beer sales.Constellation, which bought Grupo Modelo's U.S. operations from Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) in June 2013, has beaten the analyst consensus on earnings for four quarters in a row and on revenue for three quarters.But Constellation carries a heavy debt load, amounting to $7.2 billion at the end of May, from a series of acquisitions amid a consolidation wave in the beer industry.If Constellation doesn't get its debt under control, the debt could impact the firm's earnings and its ability to continue growing via acquisitions. And the buyout environment is heating up on recent reports that Anheuser-Busch is eyeing SABMiller, whose bid to buy Heineken was rejected.Among Constellation's top brands are Corona and Modelo Especial beers, Robert Mondavi and Clos du Bois wines, Svedka vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whiskey.The company's wine and spirits sales fell 1% last quarter, while beer sales jumped 14%.That jump easily beat the import beer category and overall U.S. beer market. It led Constellation to revise its EPS guidance upward for fiscal 2015, which ends next February. The company sees full-year EPS of $4.10-$4.25 vs. its prior view for $3.95-$4.15.""Our beer business is on fire,"" Constellation CEO Rob Sands said on a July earnings call with analysts.Shares of Constellation, whose stock is on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, rose less than 1% in Tuesday afternoon trading on the stock market today.Anheuser-Busch was up fractionally Tuesday afternoon, as was Molson Coors Brewing (TAP), maker of Coors beer.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

749,STZ,"Roots In Wine Business
"
750,STZ,"Founded in 1945, Constellation began to focus on branded wines in the early 1950s. Sands joined his family's upstate New York wine business in 1979, helping to expand it organically and via acquisitions.
"
751,STZ,"The company shifted its focus to premium wines over the last decade. In 2004, for example, it acquired Robert Mondavi. A few years later, it sold off value brands Almaden and Inglenook.
"
752,STZ,"But some other wine buys weren't as successful as Robert Mondavi. In fiscal 2008, Constellation wrote off $822 million in impaired assets from its Australia and U.K. wine businesses.
"
753,STZ,"""They paid too much for their wine M&A's (mergers and acquisitions),"" Swartzberg said.
"
754,STZ,"Besides Robert Mondavi, Constellation's wine lineup comprises Clos du Bois, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath, Mark West, Franciscan Estate, Ruffino and Jackson-Triggs. Liquor brands include Svedka Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky.Anniversaries are often celebrated with toasts over raised drinks.If any drink were in order when Constellation Brands (STZ) recently marked its anniversary of a game-changing acquisition, it would be beer — and a Mexican brand in particular.A year ago this past weekend, Constellation Brands became full owner of Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business in a $5.3 billion deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD).Victor, N.Y.-based Constellation essentially got the remaining 50% stake in Crown Imports that it didn't already own.The deal included full U.S. rights to import, market and sell Mexican beers under the Modelo umbrella, including Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo and Pacifico.The transaction, which included a brewery, doubled the size of Constellation, which also operates wine and spirits segments.It strengthened Constellation's position as the largest importer of beer in the U.S. and the country's third largest beer brewer and seller after Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, a division of Molson Coors Brewing (TAP).Constellation ""was a wine company before it imported beer, but they didn't own beer,"" said analyst Lauren Torres of HSBC Global Research. It ""now owns a brand (Grupo Modelo) with great equity in beer.""Tops In HopsCheers go especially to Modelo Especial, Constellation's fastest-growing beer. Last year, U.S. shipments jumped 18%, reported Beer Marketer's Insights, making it the fastest-growing of the many beers that the beer-information provider tracks. Crown Imports' overall shipments were up nearly 6%.That growth arrived despite declining sales of many other beers, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Miller High Life and Busch. Overall U.S. beer shipments, excluding exports, slid 1.3% in 2013, said Beer Marketer's Insights, continuing a multiyear trend of declining volumes.The economic downturn ""hit mainstream beer drinkers harder than wine or spirits markets,"" said Eric Shepard, editor of Beer Marketer's Insights' newsletter.But Modelo and Corona aren't expected to slow down anytime soon, Shepard says. Modelo spiked fairly quickly over the last 18 months, he says, largely because it's a hit with Latinos, a large and fast-growing demographic in the U.S.But, he says, Constellation's beer portfolio is reaching plenty of non-Latinos, including Millennials (the generation born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s).This year through April 20, volume sales of Modelo Especial surged 25%, Constellation said, citing data from Information Resources (IRI). Pacifico logged an 11% gain. Corona Extra and Corona Light were up 9% and 5%, respectively, and Negra Modelo 7%.For Pacifico, a new national web and social-media marketing campaign — the largest to date, called ""Yellow Caps,"" a play on the beer's bright yellow bottle caps — will roll out this summer. It will be supplemented by three TV ads on digital video, print ads in Southern California and spot TV ads in San Diego.Corona is one of the biggest imported beers in the U.S. But the mature brand had lost some share to newer, lower-priced imports in the recession, Torres says.But it has ""incredible brand equity"" and is back on the rise ""a bit,"" she said, no doubt due in part to the success of the ""Vacation in a Bottle"" ad campaign.""The Crown (beer) business is growing faster than their wine business,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg. ""We're happy to see (Constellation) becoming less reliant on the wine business.""Beer generates better cash flow and margins than wine, which is ""a more capital-intensive business than beer,"" he said.""Wine is a business that requires a lot more inventory and land than beer,"" Swartzberg said. It's also not as reliant on brand names, he says.Torres says that a good portion of Constellation's wine business is being hurt by ""competitive pricing"" in the industry.For the beer business, the company's outlook for fiscal 2015 calls for mid to high single-digit net sales growth and operating income growth in the low- to mid-20% range.But for wine and spirits, it forecasts low- to mid-single-digit growth for both net sales and operating income.Analysts expect full-year earnings to grow 26% to $4.09 a share.A Year In BeerNet sales in the company's fiscal year ending Feb. 28 jumped 74% to $4.9 billion, driven by $2 billion of incremental net sales related to the Crown beer business. Beer sales for the year rose 10%, while wine and spirits sales grew only 2%.Profit for the year rose 48% to an adjusted $3.25 a share. Fourth-quarter earnings were up 72%, a third straight quarter of double-digit gains.""I'm excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2015,"" said Constellation Brands CEO Robert Sands in the post-earnings conference call on April 9. He said that the firm expects sales and depletion trends to exceed U.S. beer industry and import levels once again.Sands called last year's beer deal ""our most transformational acquisition in the history of our company."" (Management was unavailable to comment for this article, citing the ""quiet period"" ahead of the first-quarter earnings release on July 2.)The acquisition also gave Constellation full ownership of a brewery in Nava, Mexico, which it's doubling in size. But management said in the last earnings report that the work would cost twice the original estimate, $900 million to $1.1 billion vs. $500 million to $600 million previously.

"
780,STZ,"Well-trained, open-water swimmers learn to alter their techniques in order to deal with rough conditions. This means, among other things, sacrificing some symmetry and efficiency in order to flow with and punch through the chop.Stocks attempting to build bases in difficult markets show similar adaptations. One common result: the base-on-base pattern.From an investor's standpoint, a base-on-base can be an exercise in frustration. A stock forms a base, breaks out, then immediately falls back into a second consolidation. An ideal base-on-base sees the low of the second consolidation just touch the high point of the prior base.In reality, the stacked patterns can seem messy and disorderly.  But they generally are an indicator of a strong stock, struggling to advance against a stubborn market. This is one of the reasons why the M in CAN SLIM stands for market conditions. Stocks fighting a weak market are clearly trying to swim upstream.Rather than showing the typical 20%-plus gain that separates distinct bases, leading stocks in choppy markets may rise only a few percentage points before pulling back. Often, they will form a flat base after a breakout from a cup, and use that as a platform from which to advance.When a base dips well into a prior base, this is generally called a base-beside-a-base pattern. It is still a valid structure, but doesn’t normally carry the firepower of a base-on-base. Facebook (FB) has staged an awkward base-beside-a-base pattern since November, yet is still advancing in price. Universal Display (OLED) and Prestige Brands Holdings (PBH) offer somewhat more tidy examples.In some cases, particularly in consolidating markets, a new base will dive back below the low of the prior base. This decline resets the stock’s base count. The new base is considered a first-stage formation, suggesting that the stock may have additional room to advance. Priceline Group (PCLN) and Citrix Systems (CTXS) demonstrate recent base resets.Constellation Brands (STZ) has traded tightly for a fourth straight week, and the recent price movement rests just at the high of its prior base. If it holds for another week, the pattern becomes a flat base-on-base.Maybe the best recent example comes from Edwards Lifesciences (EW). A leading maker of heart valve replacements, Edwards has stacked up a series of base-on-base and base-next-to-a-base patterns beginning early last year. Its first breakout – from a cup-with-handle base in July 2015 – rose for less than two weeks before turning down into another cup-with-handle (1).Investors would not have wanted to hold through this 21% deep consolidation. But the trick is to keep the stock on a watch list. Those who jumped in at this second breakout, in late October, took a little longer ride, rising about 8% in less than six weeks. Then, another consolidation. Shares corrected 13%, cleared an 80.95 handle buy point in heavy trade Feb. 2 (2), then dropped 6.9% below the pivot -- stopping just short of a sell rule (please see a daily chart at Investors.com). Edwards retook the buy point in a three-day run up in mid-February.The stock rose 11% in two weeks before stalling into a flat consolidation. Unlike the prior consolidations, this pattern dipped only 7% and held comfortably above its 10-week moving average. The breakout this time around was a killer: up 17% in powerful trade on April 4 after positive trial results on its Sapien heart valve.True to character, shares rose another 7% over the next three weeks, then pulled back for what may well become another consolidation. But stay tuned....

787,STZ,"Shares of wine and beer giant Constellation Brands (STZ) are popping Thursday on a solid fourth-quarter earnings and sales beat, plus above-consensus guidance for fiscal 2018.The stock heated up and stayed hot throughout Friday's trading session, ending the day up 6.4% at 171.77, well into buy range.

The small-cap Russell 2000 was also flat.

795,STZ,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range. The stock climbed 38% over its IPO price to close at 23.51 on the Nasdaq Friday. That price values the company at over $2 billion. Okta's Identity Cloud platform provides identity management services for businesses. The San Francisco-based company is the fourth new company worth more than $1 billion to come public this year, following the successful IPOs of MuleSoft (MULE) Presidio (PSDO) and Snap (SNAP).RELATED:Tesla stock soared to a record high, following its Sunday report on car deliveries that beat expectations. Tesla now has a higher market valuation than Ford (F), which sold off Monday on weak U.S. auto sales for March. CEO Elon Musk mocked Tesla short sellers in a Monday tweet. Tesla delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, above its target of 23,000-24,500 vehicles and above Wall Street estimates for about 24,200.RELATED:Panera Bread (PNRA) agreed to be bought by Luxembourg's JAB for $7.5 billion including debt, or $315 per share. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea. It's the fourth major restaurant acquisition this year following Restaurant Brands' (QSR) purchase of Popeyes, Golden Gate Capital's buyout of Bob Evans Farms and Darden Restaurants (DRI) buying Cheddars. Other transactions could be on the horizon given analysts' forecasts for restaurant traffic to remain under pressure this year as consumers opt to save money and eat at home.RELATED:Google continued introducing remedies to quash an advertising crisis at YouTube that derailed a rally in parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock in mid-March. Google introduced a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service. The advertising uproar began in Europe when major brands complained about ad placement next to videos that promoted hate, violence and racism. Analysts say some advertisers that have suspended ads on YouTube are seeking concessions from Google, aside from resolving the ad placement issue. YouTube, meanwhile, launched a $35 monthly TV streaming service in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.Meanwhile, Amazon's video business rolled ahead. It won rights to stream 10 National Football League games this fall — taking the ball from Twitter (TWTR), which held the same rights last year. Amazon is paying a big price for the privilege.

It means Merck still has some work to do to get approval for including cardiovascular outcomes data on the labels for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR. Merck said it is exploring its options. The stock lost ground early Friday but recouped most of the losses, closing down 0.2%.U.S. airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks Friday.

797,STZ,"An afternoon rally took the bite out of a decline by some key indexes on Thursday, and the Nasdaq showed enough strength to post a third straight gain Thursday.Apple (AAPL) acted bullishly, rising 0.5% to 116.61 and putting more work into the crafting of a handle on its latest cup-with-handle pattern.While a new base-on-base pattern has produced a 118.79 entry, 10 cents above the new base's left-side high, check out the daily chart and you'll see that the iPhone and iPad giant has now etched a downward-slanting handle over the past week, presenting a slightly lower buy point at 118.12.In September, as noted in an IBD Stock Market Today column, Apple cleared a 110.33 buy point within a cup with handle that was lodged within a long, deep, bottoming base pattern, then rallied 7.5% before pulling back and testing vital support at the long-term 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) continued to show signs that while it's indeed undergoing a price correction, the decline has so far been controlled.The leading graphics processors firm fell 2.5% to 101.74, extending its decline from a 119.93 high to 15%. That's the maximum allowable price decline for a flat base, which must form over a minimum five weeks.That's totally normal for a stock that achieved one of the biggest gains last year, rising 262% past a 33.16 cup-with-handle buy point in mid-March 2016.The Nasdaq composite erased mild morning gains by around 12:45 p.m. ET and finished the day up 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 did even better, gaining more than 0.5%, as Apple and other large-cap techs rallied.Retailers, however, fell hard after poor guidance and plans of massive store closings from big-box retailers Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M). Both stocks got trampled by sellers, falling 19% and 14%, respectively. The S&P 500 closed less than 2 points lower; the Dow Jones industrials fell 0.2%.Volume was slightly lower on both exchanges vs. Wednesday, according to preliminary data.Returning to Apple, the megacap's RS Rating of 56 has been largely unchanged over the past nine weeks, which is unsurprising given the long basing nature of the stock lately.On the other hand, the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is bullish, indicating funds are on net accumulating shares.Wall Street sees Apple's sales rising 2% to $77.4 billion in the December-ended fiscal fourth quarter. That could mark an end to three quarters in a row of falling revenue and signal that Apple is gaining market share in the smartphone industry and succeeding in keeping up fast growth in its services-related businesses.A sharp beat on the top line could also lead to a surprise increase in quarterly profit, which may catalyze the stock to further gains. Right now, the Street sees earnings falling 2% to $3.22 a share, but then rising 12% to $2.13 a share in the current quarter that ends in March.Apple's earnings fell 13%, 15% and 9% in the prior three quarters.Constellation Brands (STZ), one of the largest alcoholic beverage companies in the world, slid 7% to 146.75 and slumped back below its 50-day moving average despite posting a 38% bulge in fiscal third-quarter earnings per share. After-tax margin rose to 22.3%, the highest in at least four years.Sales grew 10% to $1.81 billion, the smallest year-over-year gain in four quarters. In the prior three quarters, Constellation's sales grew 14%, 15% and 17%.Constellation shares have been in correction mode since it failed to make much headway following a breakout past a long flat base-like pattern in the week ended Oct. 7. The RS Rating has slumped to a lowly 28, and the Accumulation/Distribution grade of D+ hints at strong professional net selling.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Can Nvidia's Fundamentals Turn It Into The Next Apple?At The CES 2017 Show: IBD's Alissa Coram Reports On Top Tech CompaniesThe Bottoming Base, Part I: How It Helps Investors Make Money In StocksThe Bottoming Base, Part II: Why Apple Formed One In 2009

798,STZ,"Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) on Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings and raised full-year EPS guidance, but shares fell sharply.Constellation Brands reported third-quarter earnings per share of $1.96, a 38% increase, well above Street forecasts for $1.72. A favorable tax rate played a key role in the EPS beat.Revenue rose 10% to $1.811 billion, roughly in line with estimates.The company expects full fiscal 2017 EPS of $6.55-$6.65, up from its prior range of $6.30-$6.45, with Q3's 24-cent beat largely accounting for that. Analysts had expected $6.46.Still, shares tumbled 7.1% to 146.76 in the stock market today, falling back below their 50-day line a day after retaking that key level on Wednesday. The stock hit 144 intraday, matching its lowest level since last March.Constellation shares sold off following the presidential election, on fears that Donald Trump could set up protectionist barriers that raise the cost of its Mexican beer imports. But the stock had started to recover in recent weeks.IBD'S TAKE: As more states legalize marijuana in some form or another, Constellation could win in some ways and lose in others based on demographic trends, an analyst report said last year.The company has in recent quarters tried to buy its way into the craft beer, Mexican beer and higher-end wine markets. However, investors have been worried about what its reliance on Mexican-made beers might mean under a Trump administration that could put up higher trade barriers.Constellation, whose beer brands include Corona and Modelo, said it expected its beer business to grow sales by 16%-17% for the full fiscal year, helped by last year's acquisition of craft brewer Ballast Point.The company also said it expects full-year wine-and-spirits sales growth in the ""mid single-digit range,"" with the gains boosted by Constellation's acquisitions of the Prisoner, Meiomi and Charles Smith wines, as well as its purchase of High West Distillery, which makes craft whiskey.Brown Forman (BFB), which makes Jack Daniel's, fell 0.75%. Global beer giant AB InBev (BUD) climbed 1.5%, while Molson Coors (TAP) edged up about 0.3%.RELATED:The Brews At Constellation Brands Offer Frothy Growth ProspectsConstellation Brands, Global Payments, Monsanto Up On Earnings; Acuity Sinks

799,STZ,"From the CES electronics show to Detroit to President-elect Trump, autos were front and center during the week. Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and others said holiday sales were terrible. But stocks rose to record highs, with Alphabet (GOOGL) Netflix (NFLX) and Walt Disney (DIS) breaking out and Apple (AAPL) flirted with its own buy point.The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average hit record highs on Friday, with the blue-chip Dow coming within 1 point of 20,000 intraday Friday. The Nasdaq rose 2.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.7% and the Dow 1%. Retailers were hit hard by warnings from Macy's and Kohl's. Netflix and Walt Disney broke out of bases, while Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) retook key support levels. Bank stocks moved sideways as Treasury yields continued a recent pullback.Macy's and Kohl's cut full-year earnings per share estimates after both reported November-December same-store sales fell 2.1% vs. a year earlier, triggering a sharp sell-off in department stores, many other retailers as well as makers of handbags and watches. Macy's outlined plans to close 68 stores, part of 100-store closure effort, cutting 10,000 jobs.

809,STZ,"As more people get high, they might not need to get so drunk, and that's bad news for the beverage industry.Far fewer people today admit to smoking pot than admit to drinking. But as others have noted recently, Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman (BFB) and Samuel Adams brewer Boston Beer Co. (SAM) have warned about the dangers that marijuana legalization poses to their businesses.Brown-Forman, in its past four annual reports, has cited ""the potential legalization of marijuana use on a more widespread basis within the United States"" as a business risk. Boston Beer, in its past two annual reports, has said that states that have relaxed or are considering relaxing laws around pot usage ""could adversely impact the demand for the company's products.""Now, a new report from Cowen & Co. says those two stocks, along with Constellation Brands (STZ) and Molson Coors (TAP), could be among the most vulnerable if more states — or the nation as a whole — legalize the drug.The research comes as traditional beer giants already struggle to retain market share against an array of craft brewers that have broadened drinkers' palates and made things like tulip glasses and beer with hints of coriander more prevalent in places like, say, sports bars.Beer, in general, has also been losing out to the popularity of spirits, Cowen noted. Millennials have been drinking more flavored liquors like cinnamon whiskey.And in this year's election alone, Massachusetts, Nevada, Maine, Arizona and California will vote on whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in some form.""Broadening cannabis use seems to be having an impact on alcoholic beverage incidence,"" according to the Cowen report, released last week.The shift to pot and away from alcohol appeared to be more common among men. The report said that ""male alcohol incidence shifted from modest growth to decline"" over the past five years, while cannabis incidence crept up, posing ""negative implications for beer and spirits, in particular whiskey.""Legalization could also mean less wine consumption, which is more common among wealthier households and could pose a threat to Constellation, Cowen said. Constellation's wines include Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi, Mark West and Toasted Head.""On a total social-lubricant basis (cannabis and alcohol), lower-income consumers are lower-incidence consumers. Interestingly, it would seem that cannabis is in fact having the greatest impact on higher-income alcohol consumption. ... This could have a negative impact on wine consumption, which over-indexes to higher-income consumers,"" the report said.IBD'S TAKE: Anheuser Busch InBev's stock jumped on Thursday, making it one of the few beverage stocks poised for a breakout. Breakouts elsewhere have been fragile. Read this story to see why Apple's breakout is holding up.But Constellation -- which makes Mexican beers Corona, Modelo and Pacifico for the U.S. market -- stands to gain from other demographic trends, Cowen said.""While cannabis use has risen with every major ethnic cohort in the U.S. over both the last 5 and 10 years, Hispanics have been the slowest to adopt cannabis, while their incidence also remains the lowest,"" Cowen's report said.""In contrast, over the last 10 years, Hispanic alcohol incidence has climbed markedly faster than we have seen for other multicultural groups (with the exception of blacks). Notably, despite these strong alcohol gains, there is room to grow, as alcohol incidence remains relatively low.""Shares of Brown-Forman closed up 1.5% in the stock market today but have been below the 50- and 200-day lines since late last month. Boston Beer rose 0.2%, Constellation Brands added 0.1%, Molson Coors gained 1.55%, and Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) climbed 2.2%.The beneficiaries of pot legalization also include tobacco stocks like Reynolds American (RAI), which could draw pot smokers with its vaping devices, Cowen says.Fast-food chain Jack In The Box (JACK), whose past advertising efforts may or may not have appealed to those in the right state of mind, also has a bunch of its restaurants in pot-friendly states, the investment firm notes.RELATED:The Brews At Constellation Brands Offer Frothy Growth ProspectsInsys Stock Jumps As FDA Approves Appetite-Boosting Cannabis DrugGW Pharma Jumps As Cannabis Drug Treats Severe Epilepsy

810,STZ,"U.S. stock indexes on Thursday afternoon reverted to the back-and-forth action they've shown since the Nasdaq's all-time high was posted two weeks ago.The Nasdaq inched down 0.1%, trimming an earlier 0.6% loss. The S&P 500 edged up nearly 0.1%, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running close to Wednesday's levels.In recent weeks, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have been shifting sideways. Weekly closes look tight over the past three weeks, though that could still change this week.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, bulls had to scratch for stocks rising in strong volume. A few stocks rose in brisk turnover, but most were of secondary quality.Home Depot (HD) advanced 1.5% in strong volume, scoring the biggest gain in the blue chip Dow. Home Depot remains under its 200-day and 50-day lines. The company grew earnings 15% in the most recently reported quarter. Home Depot has sketched the left side and at least part of the bottom of a possible base. Work on the right side has not yet begun.Home Depot rival Lowe's (LOW) is in rougher shape, falling fractionally Thursday afternoon. Lowe's is 14% off its high and in an ugly consolidation that will take some time to repair.Wine, beer and spirits provider Constellation Brands (STZ) took a second shot at a breakout. On Wednesday the stock cleared a 168.78 buy point but reversed to close under the buy point. Constellation retook the buy point Thursday in heavy volume.Constellation, Home Depot and Lowe's all have Composite Ratings below the minimum 90 level associated with top stocks. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock is in the top 10 percentile among all the stocks in IBD's database.Twitter (TWTR) has an excellent Composite Rating of 97, but that was no protection Thursday. The stock gapped down 20% on reports that many of the expected bidders to buy Twitter aren't interested. The stock gapped up 21% on Sept. 23 on buyout rumors.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's top gainers included shippers, retailers and building stocks. The chief laggards were gold miners and automakers.RELATED:So, Does Anybody Want Twitter?Economy Is Shrinking When It Comes To Jobs

811,STZ,"Stocks were fighting to get to break-even at midday Thursday, nearly erasing morning losses after investors got rattled by an 18% plunge in Twitter (TWTR) shares on reports that the social media giant is having trouble finding a suitor.Meanwhile, fresh breakouts from the likes of Apple (AAPL) and alcohol giant Constellation Brands (STZ) are holding up.The Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average both slumped more than 0.6% but are now just fractionally lower at lunchtime in New York. A pullback this week would be natural given that the tech-rich Nasdaq began the trading week with three up weeks in a row under its belt.As for the Dow, the blue chip benchmark has been rangebound for weeks, finding buying support near 18,000 and resistance near 18,400 — roughly a trading band of 2.2%.The S&P 500 edged slightly up, aided in part by gains in ship transport, discount retailing, paper, specialty retail and wood products stocks. Volume was mixed in the major exchanges.Apple is bucking Thursday's decline, rising nearly 0.8% to 113.93. It's holding up after a breakout past a 110.33 cup-with-handle base.Go to a daily chart at Investors.com's Research section, and you'll see that the megacap iPhone and iPad maker has pulled back gently for more than two weeks since its Sept. 14 breakout. Given that volume has also eased, one could argue that the recent action has produced another handle within its longer consolidation. Yet for now, the 110.33 buy point remains valid because shares are still within the proper buy range.Earlier this week, Apple unveiled a strategy to become a leader in ""ambient computing"" (computing that is around you and always on), which some Wall Street analysts believe represents a paradigm shift in how people get, use and share information.Among leading stocks, Veeva Systems (VEEV) fell more than 2% to 39.18, slicing through its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out of a long cup with handle at 28.05 in May. Following that breakout, the medical software play had never touched its 50-day line once, even on Aug. 30, when shares slid nearly 3%.A continued drop below the 50-day moving average would mark a sell signal, and shareholders would be wise to lock in at least some gains — especially if volume picks up sharply vs. Veeva's 50-day average turnover of 1.3 million shares.The company handles customer relationship management and other vital business processes for large pharmaceutical companies and went public at 20 a share in October 2013. It had entered IBD's premium Leaderboard product as a potential market leader on June 20 just as the stock was forming a new handle on its long cup pattern. That new handle yielded a new entry point at 35.79, and Veeva went on to break out and sprint to a gain of as much as 19% before cooling off.Constellation Brands (STZ) rose nearly 2% in fast turnover to 171.63, adding to Wednesday's breakout. The stock is up slightly since clearing a tight flat base with a 168.78 buy point. Wall Street sees November-ending fiscal Q3 earnings jumping 20% to $1.70 a share, which would stretch the company's streak of double to triple-digit profit growth to 14 quarters.Also in the stock market today, Tesla Motors (TSLA) failed to reclaim its 200-day moving average near 215 earlier in the week and is now down for a third straight session, falling 3% to 201.30. The action is disappointing to investors rooting for a rebound in the innovative maker of all-electric vehicles. Yet keep in mind that the stock had soared to 291 following a breakout from a base at 40.10 in the spring of 2013.On Thursday, Goldman Sachs issued a gloomy forecast on the U.S. auto sector, forecasting falling earnings in the next two years due to steep price discounts and lower production. It also downgraded Tesla to neutral from buy and shaved its price target to 185 from 240.RELATED:When Did Apple Break Out?Why Is Apple Preparing For The Era Of Ambient Computing?Who Are The New Thoroughbreds In The Stock Market Today?

It's in the early stages of breaking out of a long consolidation that started nearly one year ago when the stock hit an all-time high of 39.11.Raymond James Financial (RJF) picked up 0.92 to 59.48 in light trade. It's just above a 58.60 entry of a big cup-with-handle base.Small-cap FB Financial (FBK) cleared a short IPO base Wednesday, rising 0.91 to 21.85 in good volume. The buy point was 21.37.Several other thinly traded names in the financial sector scored new highs and could be in the early stages of bona fide breakouts. They included Wintrust Financial (WTFC), Stonegate Bank (SGBK), Pacific Continental (PCBK) and Bank of Hawaii (BOH).Constellation Brands (STZ) gapped up out of a flat base with a 168.78 entry on better-than-expected earnings.

Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29.

(SAM) down.The new system, called the Beer Bar, is available in Germany and Switzerland, and is set to hit other markets later this year and next. SodaStream is debuting the system with a light beer, Blondie, which the company said can be made by combining Blondie concentrate with sparkling water.""We are excited to launch a brand dedicated to serving the global growing trend of home-crafted beer,"" CEO Daniel Birnbaum said in a statement.

835,STZ,"Constellation Brands has plenty on tap to quench Wall Street's thirst for growth prospects, including a frothy profit outlook, talk of a possible spin-off that could help make it leaner, and recent purchases that could solidify the alcoholic beverage giant's position in certain markets.But it's Constellation's (STZ) beer business where the stars line up for the company based outside of Rochester, N.Y., with the likes of Mexican imports Corona and Modelo beers vastly outpacing the rest of its lines in sales.""The real economic engine of Constellation Brands continues to be the beer business,"" UBS analyst Stephen Powers told IBD.Organic beer sales rose 18% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to volume growth and favorable pricing. By comparison, wine and spirits sales on an organic constant-currency basis increased 4%, primarily driven by volume growth.""I am excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in (fiscal 2017),"" Chief Executive Rob Sands said on a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. ""We have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio.""Constellation -- through the acquisition of its remaining 50% interest in its Crown Imports joint venture with Grupo Modelo -- bought perpetual U.S. license rights to import, market and sell Mexican beers under the Modelo umbrella. That includes Corona Extra, Corona Light and Modelo Especial, all of which were gained after Anheuser-Busch InBev's (BUD) bought Grupo Modelo in 2013. With those brands, Constellation controls three of the four top spots in imported beer sales, with Corona and Modelo delivering 25% growth last year.But Constellation isn't stopping there. It entered the growing craft beer market with December's $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits of San Diego. Ballast is one of the fastest-growing craft beer companies in the U.S.In 2015, U.S. sales volume for craft beer grew 12.8% from a year earlier, while the overall beer market was nearly flat with 0.2% growth, according to the Brewers Association. As a result, the company is targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for the beer business in fiscal 2017, including benefits from the Ballast Point buy.""The most important and biggest driver of growth -- and the most important variable for the stock -- is to what extent they can drive momentum in the beer business,” said Powers. ""Corona and Modelo Especial are the two brands that have been the drivers of growth and are the two big drivers for future growth.""S&P Global Market Intelligence equity analyst Joseph Agnese agrees.""I expect strong consumer demand for Constellation's beer products, driven by millennials and Hispanic Americans,"" Agnese told IBD. ""It (the growth) is supported by increased marketing spending and the launch of Corona Extra cans.""Agnese says craft beer is the fastest-growing segment of the domestic beer category. The Ballast Point purchase, he adds, goes along with the company's M&A strategy to acquire fast-growing, premium alcoholic beverages in wine, spirits and beer.Constellation also is benefiting from a trade-up to high-end beers and wines.""Constellation has carved out a more attractive niche within (the wine and spirits and beer) industry overall,"" said Powers. ""The U.S. beer market is not growing particularly well. But the Mexican import segment is growing quite well domestically. It's on trend, and there's lots of room for additional distribution.""It's not all just beer, though. Constellation is also the world’s leading premium wine company, with brands such as Robert Mondavi and Clos du Bois. In premium spirits, its brands include Svedka Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky.And all cylinders seem to be firing. Constellation's shares popped 5.9% to a record high on April 6 following its financial report for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 29, its 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth. The stock is up more than 37% from a year earlier. Its shares soared 52% through 2015, during which the company was one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index.""It's about the strength of the quarter and, more importantly, the strength of the company's guidance looking into fiscal 2017,"" Powers said. ""The actual guidance was significantly better than investors expected coming into the quarter. Investors had expectations for the company to guide more conservatively. The guidance was an additional vote of confidence that, not only was the quarter good, but the momentum should carry over into fiscal 2017.""Constellation is targeting fiscal 2017 earnings per share of $6.05-$6.35 on a comparable basis and $6-$6.30 on a reported basis. The midpoints topped estimates at the time for $6.11.One of the company's strategic efforts to create shareholder value and strengthen the ""financial profile"" of its wine and spirits business is the possibility of doing an IPO for a portion of its Canadian wine and spirits business, CEO Sands said in a statement.""In fiscal 2016, our business in Canada delivered excellent overall financial results, outperformed the industry and gained market share, and we believe its full value is not being recognized,"" he said. ""An IPO will create better visibility to this dynamic part of the business.""Constellation will decide on whether it will pursue the IPO later in 2016.Agnese says he views the idea of an IPO for that business as a ""positive.""""It would make the company into a smaller, faster-growing company,"" he said. ""The Canadian wine and spirits business is a slower-growing part of the company vs. the beer business. The IPO would earn Constellation a bigger multiple on the ongoing beer business, and it would help investors isolate and value the Canadian business as a stand-alone company as well.""Constellation's financial picture looks bright. In the fourth quarter, earnings rose 15% to $1.19 a share. Sales jumped 14% to $1.54 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fiscal 2017 earnings to rise 16% to $6.28 a share. They see a 13% gain in 2018 and in 2019.""I forecast Constellation will continue to grow quite well over the next several years and expand margins and profits along the way,"" said Powers. ""The challenge for the stock is that the price of the stock reflects that optimism, and there's a risk if they fall short.""

But that certainly does not entitle the $795 million fund's managers -- Scott Migliori, Karen Hiatt and Raphael Edelman -- to a free pass around the market's challenges.Those include market volatility that the managers expect will continue until there is more clarity about global growth prospects, especially in China and Europe. Other challenges are disappointing U.S. growth, ongoing geopolitical tensions, a recession in Europe and slower-than-expected growth in China.So what are they doing about it? Focused Growth's managers think U.S. large-cap growth stocks are where they'll find most of their opportunities.""They have a long-term track record, visible cash flow and flexibility, consistent payouts and they're multinational in exposure,"" Hiatt said.And we're entering a period where there is much less of a rising tide to lift all boats, so only good stock-pickers should outperform. ""This is a time for active managers to shine vs. what we've seen in recent years,"" Hiatt said.Four of the fund's 10 largest holdings as of March 31 had Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s and 90s. Three of their four top new buys had very strong Comp Ratings of 87, 97 and 99.

On Thursday, shares gapped up over their 117.09 buy point. They briefly dipped below that entry on Friday but held up amid a weak broad market.One negative for the stock: It has a weak Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D.

Sales rose 11% on a constant-currency basis.The firm also bumped its full-year EPS forecast to $2.93-$3.00, up from $2.90-$3.00 and surpassing consensus. The brighter outlook comes despite a tough foreign-exchange environment.The company makes a lot of its money as a card-payments-processing intermediary between businesses and financial institutions. With its acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems (HPY), it hopes to expand its payment-technology offerings for smaller businesses. Global Payments Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sloan said, ""(We) look forward to closing the transaction later this month.”Global Payments gapped up 8.8% to 70.86, getting closer to a 74.74 buy point of a cup base.

But it expects 83-85 cents EPS, vs. views for 76 cents.Ollie's stock rose 5.7% to 24 in after-hours action. Shares closed up 0.9% to 22.70 on the stock market today, retaking a 22.63 buy point. But the late stock action suggests Ollie's may move out of the buy range limit of 23.76.Elaine Low and James DeTar contributed to this articleImage provided by Shutterstock.

The IBD 50 list compiles top-rated growth stocks with top fundamentals that have strong relative price strength in the market.Sportswear retailer Foot Locker (FL), ranked 30th, carries team-branded apparel, including jerseys, caps and scarves. A recent boost in sales of running shoes made by Nike and Under Armour is good news for retailers like Foot Locker, which sells gear for both kids and adults.The New York City-based company says it has a total of 3,546 stores, with retail stores in 23 countries and franchise partners in nine countries.Foot Locker also has been expanding in soccer-crazy Europe, where it has more than 600 stores. Last year, it bought German athletic store chain Runners Point Group, which operates online and through more than 200 stores, for $94 million.Analysts have said Foot Locker is well positioned in Europe and has been taking market share from rivals with help from partners like Nike (NKE).Soccer gear being sold on Foot Locker's website include jerseys for Argentine star Lionel Messi and apparel for World Cup host Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain and the United States.Under Armour (UA), No. 9 on the IBD 50, isn't equipping any of the national teams competing in the World Cup.

The company, based in Victor, N.Y., has more than 100 brands in its portfolio, including Corona, Svedka vodka and more recent acquisitions Grupo Modelo and Crown Imports.Both Modelo and Crown have been paying off handsomely, and ""strengthened Constellation's position as the largest importer of beer in the U.S. and the country's third largest beer brewer and seller after Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors,"" according to a New America profile.The company is expected to report Q1 earnings on July 2 before the open.

927,STZ,"Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) crashed 6% Thursday on news that the U.S. government objects to its acquisition of Grupo Modelo on antitrust grounds.Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch said in June it would pay $20.1 billion for Mexico's Grupo Modelo, whose prize asset is Corona, Mexico's biggest-selling beer (and the biggest beer import in the U.S.). But the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit Thursday to block the deal. Why?""The department is taking this action to stop a merger between major beer brewers because it would result in less competition and higher beer prices for American consumers,"" said Bill Baer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.The DoJ also said that lower-priced Modelo serves to dampen prices in a market where Anheuser-Busch InBev already enjoys too much control.Even before the acquisition, Anheuser-Busch InBev is the biggest beer-seller in the U.S. Grupo Modelo holds the No. 3 slot. Combined, the new entity would control 46% of the U.S. beer market.U.S.-based Constellation Brands (STZ), which would have enjoyed large benefits from a side deal of the acquisition, crashed 17% — roughly the same percentage gain it had won when the acquisition was planned.Anheuser-Busch InBev says the government's lawsuit is ""inconsistent with the law, the facts and the reality of the marketplace."" The deal had been planned to close in the first quarter.Anheuser-Busch InBev is a familiar name to regular readers of this column. The stock broke out from a flat base Jan. 2, then sank 7.1% from its 37.08 buy point, virtually assuring that those who bought the breakout were washed out.But the stock easily could have been bought on a rebound from the 50-day moving average.All was going well until the government's action. Thursday's dive slices below that original buy point, the 50-day line — and all relevant near-term support. The decline was held only by the 200- day line.Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose beer portfolios includes supersellers Budweiser and Artois, has seen its quarterly earnings growth decelerate the past three periods, from 60% (its highest in years) to 44% to 22% to 7%. When the company reports its Q4 March 8, analysts expect to see a 3% decline.Sales growth has been subpar for three years, and is now at about zero.Its bright spot is pretax margins, which have been rising in recent years, from 18% for full-year 2008 to 19% to 24.5% to 27.2% — that last result being from 2011.

Constellation already owns the other half.The Belgium-based AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, formed with the 2008 acquisition of U.S. giant Anheuser-Busch. That brought some of the world's top brands, including Budweiser and Stella Artois, under one roof.The No. 2 beer player in the U.S. is MillerCoors, a joint venture between London-based SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing (TAP).The AB InBev, Grupo Modelo deal revision was one of several pieces of M&A news to come Thursday, including the $28 billion buyout of H.J.

(We had peaked a tad above this range back when hurricane season was ravaging the southern part of the country late last summer.) At 215K, we are nearing all-time lows we haven’t seen since the first few years of jobless claims data was recorded, back in the 1960s. This 215K has a real “White Album” feel to it.Last week’s total in new jobless claims ratcheted down 2,000 in the previous week’s revision to 227K, also historically very low. Continuing claims was up somewhat from the previous week, but at a still very healthy 1.87 million. A week from tomorrow, we will see new non-farm employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which brought in a stellar 313K new jobs in the month of February; for March, analysts expect another 200K or so new jobs.Personal Income & Spending In-LineAlso ahead of today’s market open, new data on Personal Income & Spending is out, reporting +0.4% for income and +0.2% for spending — both in-line with analyst estimates. Wages numbers were also up, +0.5%, a key indicator for inflation asserting itself in today’s economy (or February’s, anyway). The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index for February registered at +1.8%, with core PCE for the month at +0.2%.These figures continue to point in the “right” direction for an increasingly tightening job market, but at rates that are not expected to raise anyone’s hackles regarding spiking inflation causing extra interest rate hikes from the Fed. We continue to exist in a “Goldilocks” economy, even if stock market sentiment isn’t really seeing it like that currently.Constellation, PVH Beat EstimatesOn this last day of calendar Q1, even though the bulk of earnings reports aren’t expected for another couple weeks, two branding-oriented firms did put up their fiscal quarter earnings numbers ahead of today’s opening bell: alcohol distributor Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and apparel company PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Constellation, producers of name brand beverages like Corona and Svedka, posted $1.90 per share versus $1.75 in the Zacks consensus estimate, amounting to 28% growth on the bottom line year over year.

1068,STZ,"Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report), one of the prominent players in the U.S. alcohol industry, seems to be cheering on favorable market trends. Diageo, like most companies in the alcohol space, is benefiting from steadily surging demand, a stable U.S. economy and constant innovations to suit the changing tastes of consumers.Driven by such strong fundamentals, Diageo has emerged into a preferred pick for investors. Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company surged 35.5% in a year, compared with the industry’s rally of 22.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, we expect this alcohol giant to continue on its growth path, backed by strategies to augment offerings and expand business reach.Acquisitions Aid Growth in the Spirits CategoryThe spirits segment, amongst other alcohol categories, is gaining much traction as consumers are inclining toward flavored whisky, premium tequilas and other spirits.Notably, Diageo has also been striving to augment its spirit-based alcohol portfolio through acquisitions. In June 2017, the company announced the acquisition of the fastest-growing premium tequila brand, Casamigos, in a deal worth $1 billion. This buyout is likely to strengthen Diageo's market share in the tequila category along with the existing Don Julio brand. Also, the company will capitalize on its presence in the high-growth international markets. Other noteworthy acquisitions in this segment include United Spirits Limited, De Leon Comb Wine & Spirits, Shui Jing Fang and Halico.The booming spirit segment trend has also been aiding other alcohol manufactures like Brown-Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report). Further, companies like Boston Beer Company (SAM  -  Free Report) have been taking advantage of the growing demand, by adding products to their portfolio.  Focus on Emerging Markets and High-Margin BrandsLike most multinationals, Diageo has been focusing on expanding in the emerging markets. It is the leading international spirits company in markets of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Moreover, the company has been successful in the emerging regions by catering to local tastes. Products like Johnnie Walker and Blue Label have been customized according to the local palate in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Brazil and Mexico.Further, Diageo emphasizes on high-margin products as they have been depicting strong growth globally. During first-half fiscal 2017, the company’s premium brands delivered growth of approximately 6% while the super deluxe brands rose 5%. In accordance with this strategy, management resorted to disposing less productive brands and non-core assets.Bottom LineDiageo has been witnessing unfavorable trends in the beer category. Nevertheless, robust growth in the spirits segment is expected to more than offset dismal beer sales in the forthcoming periods. Also, the company’s consistent efforts to progress in the alcohol industry by adapting with evolving trends look promising.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1070,STZ,"Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) looks promising on the back of its robust strategic initiatives, solid focus on store-expansion endeavors and impressive surprise history. Last year, the company has exhibited a bullish run on the index and has outperformed both the industry and the broader sector.

Additionally, a Growth Score of A with a long-term earnings growth rate of 17.5 % highlight the stock’s growth potential.Let’s Delve DeepGrowth CatalystsIn a competitive retail scenario, Burlington Stores has made multiple changes to business model in order to adapt to the ongoing changes in the industry. In fact, its current open to buy off-price model is helping customers to get nationally branded, fashionable, high quality and fair priced products. Also, over the years, the company has increased vendor counts, made technological advancements, initiated better marketing approach and focused on localized assortments.Additionally, the company has been focusing on store expansion in order to drive top-line growth. Management now intends to focus more on categories such as home, beauty and ladies apparel. It also believes that there is room to increase the store count to 1,000 over the long term.Impressive Performance & Robust Outlook Burlington Stores’ strategic efforts are quite well reflected in the company’s performance. The company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 13 successive quarters now. Also, its top line beat the consensus mark in five of the trailing seven quarters. In the last reported quarter, earnings surged 37% year over year as well. Moreover, the bottom line has shown constant improvement in the past several quarters.In both the second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, earnings have increased 85% year over year following an increase of 20%, 100%, 105% and 39% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively.Management now envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.23-$4.27 per share compared with $3.24 reported in the prior year. For the fourth quarter, earnings are expected to come within the range of $2.02-$2.06 per share compared with $1.78 reported in the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged higher at $4.28 and $2.08 for the fiscal year and the fourth quarter, respectively.Amid a tough retail backdrop, Burlington Stores’ comparable-store sales (comps) have witnessed constant improvement over the past few years. Apparently, comps have increased 4.5%, 2.1%, 4.9%, 4.7% and 1.2% in fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In fact, this momentum continued in fiscal 2017 as well, with first, second and third quarters witnessing a growth of 0.5%, 3.5% and 3.1%, correspondingly. Management now projects comps growth of 2-3% for the final quarter, resulting in comps increase of 2.3-2.6% for fiscal 2017.Where retailers are struggling with dwindling margins owing to high promotional initiatives, Burlington Stores’ gross margin has shown constant improvement in the last few years. Improvement in gross margin can be attributed to its efforts toward managing inventory as well as effective cost management and merchandising margin.

1072,STZ,"Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 5. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.4%.In fact, its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 13.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Constellation Brands will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has declined in the last 30 days. The current estimate of $1.87 per share for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year decline of nearly 4.7%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.86 billion, which is 2.9% higher than the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have surged 14.3%, while the industry grew 3%.Factors at PlayConstellation Brands has been on a roll owing to strong brand portfolio, strategic initiatives and robust quarterly results. The company’s focus on brand building, strength in beer business and efforts to include new products in its wine and spirits portfolio are the key catalysts. Further, it has been gaining from effective integration and growth of recently acquired brands, higher margins, solid overall depletion trends and strong consumer demand.In fact, these factors assisted the company to showcase another sterling performance in first-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its 16th straight quarter of earnings growth year-over-year and 11th straight positive surprise. Moreover, sales advanced while favorable pricing, volumes and lower cost of goods sold provided a boost to margins.Further, the company continues to gain from the recent buyouts and strength in the beer business, which encouraged management to raise fiscal 2018 earnings view. Management also hiked fiscal 2018 operating income targets for the beer segment. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90-$8.10 per share. Operating income is now anticipated to grow 13-15% for the beer segment.The company is also on track with its Nava brewery expansion, while it also enhanced wine portfolio with the buyout of Schrader Cellars. These factors make us optimistic about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Constellation Brands is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Constellation Brands has an Earnings ESP of -0.07%.

The company seems to be on a roll owing to its strategic initiatives, robust brand strength, stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results and an upbeat outlook for the fiscal year. Also, management remains confident of continuing its growth in the second half of fiscal 2018. Earnings per share are now envisioned in the range of $1.90-$1.98 for fiscal 2018 compared with the previous guidance of $1.85-$1.95.Consequently, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 being revised five cents upward at $1.97 and raised 12 cents to $2.17 for fiscal 2019 over the past 30 days.Armed with a sturdy portfolio of globally recognized brands, Brown-Forman is a major producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages in the world.

The company has been putting up a stellar show backed by its solid brand strength, robust growth strategies and an impressive earnings history.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings has moved 14 cents north in the past 30 days. Though the estimate for 2017 has been stable at $6.08, the same has increased by a penny to $6.16 for 2018 over the said time frame.Boston Beer is the largest premium craft brewer in the United States and commands a strong portfolio of globally recognized brands. Also, management remains committed to a three-point growth plan focused on reviving its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives and long-term innovation. Moreover, the company’s brand-building efforts and endeavors to add new products remain key revenue drivers. We expect the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation as well as brand development to boost its operational performance and position in the market.Notably, the company’s third-quarter 2017 results delivered a positive earnings surprise for four straight quarters with a second consecutive sales beat. It has recorded an impressive average earnings outperformance of 63.4% in the trailing four quarters. The stock’s VGM Score of B with a long-term earnings growth rate of 5% further buoys optimism in the stock.Looking For More Stocks Gaining From the Industry TrendsSome other top-ranked alcohol stocks having outpaced the industry with a favorable Zacks Rank are Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) and Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We note that shares of Constellation Brands and Diageo have gained 17.2% and 19.8%, respectively, in the last six months.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

However, the estimate reflects year-over-year growth of 17.6% from $1.48 in the prior-year quarter. Constellation Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Constellation Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteFactors at PlayConstellation Brands has been performing well on the back of its solid brand portfolio, strategic initiatives and robust quarterly results. The company’s focus on brand building and strength in the beer business are the key catalysts. Further, it has been gaining from effective integration and growth of recently acquired brands, higher margins, solid overall depletion trends and strong consumer demand.In fact, third-quarter fiscal 2018 witnessed significant market share gains, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and solid execution. This along with the strength in the beer business led management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in a range of $8.40-$8.50 per share, up from the previous guided range of $8.25-$8.40. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year is pegged at $8.54.For fiscal 2018, management expects net sales for the beer segment to grow 9-11%. Operating income at the segment is envisioned to increase in a band of 18-19%.Consequently, analysts polled by Zacks expect the company's total revenue to be $1.76 billion, which is roughly 8% higher than the year-ago quarter.However, softness in the company’s wine and spirits business continue to impact the overall sales. Apparently, the top line in the previous quarter declined year over year and lagged estimates mainly due to weakness in the wine and spirits business as well as the sale of the Canadian wine business. The segment also witnessed lower operating income due to rise in spending on marketing initiatives and higher cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2018, it expects results at this segment to be at the lower end of the sales and operating income guidance ranges due to slowdown in the industry.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Constellation Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1075,STZ,"Owens-Illinois, Inc.  (OI  -  Free Report) continues to benefit from successful joint venture and acquisitions. Further, positive trends in volumes, efforts to improve productivity across all businesses, functions, processes and geographies will help garner higher profits despite higher expenses. Currently, the manufacturer of glass containers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Here's why investors should hold on to the stock at present. Earnings Estimate Revisions The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 reflects year-over-year growth of 6.0% and 6.6%, respectively. The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.7% holds promise. Price Performance  The company outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past year. The stock has gained 10.8% while the industry dipped 0.2%. Return on Equity (ROE) Owens-Illinois’ trailing 12-month ROE supports its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 53.6% compares favorably with the industry’s average ROE of 50.2%, reflecting that it is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds. Value Growth Momentum (VGM) Score The company currently has a VGM score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A along with some other key metrics makes the company a solid choice for investors. Valuation Looks Rational Owens-Illinois is currently trading at a trailing 12-months P/E multiple of 8.5 while the industry’s average is pegged at 9.7. Consequently, the company is undervalued in comparison with its industry peers. Positive Earnings Surprise History The company has an impressive earnings history having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with an average beat of 7.1%. Upbeat Guidance In 2018, positive trends in volumes and focus on Total Systems Costs (“TSC”) is likely to lead to higher earnings and cash flow. The company is improving productivity across all businesses, functions, processes and geographies. Its focus on TSC contributed approximately $39 million during 2017. The company guides adjusted earnings in the range of $2.75-$2.85 per share for 2018. The mid-point of the range reflects a 6% year-over-year improvement with all regions projected to be more profitable and expand margins. This is projected to generate high-single digit growth in segment operating profit and contribute at least 40 basis points of margin expansion. Growth Drivers in Place Owens-Illinois continues to mitigate the impact of the ongoing decline in mega beer in the United States by positioning itself to benefit from the rapidly growing market of U.S. beer imports.  It intends to achieve this through its joint venture (JV) with Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) and long-term sales contracts in Mexico. The company’s extension of the 50-50 JV with Constellation Brands for an additional ten years (to 2034) and expansion to include an additional furnace will be earnings accretive in the future. Owen-Illinois’ acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business has provided the company a competitive edge in the attractive and growing glass segment of the packaging market in Mexico, further solidifying its position as the world's leading glass container producer. Bottom Line Investors might want to hold on to the stock at present as it has ample positive prospects of outperforming peers in the near future. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include Komatsu Ltd. (KMTUY  -  Free Report) and H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report). While Komatsu sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), H&E Equipment Services carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1077,STZ,"Shares of Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) climbed nearly 1% on Tuesday, just a couple days before the alcoholic beverage giant is set to post its fourth quarter financial results. Investors are often on the hunt for stocks that look poised to top earnings estimates, but after the recent, nearly market-wide downturn, expect Wall Street to really hone in on Constellation when it reports on Thursday.Constellation’s brands include import beer powers Corona and Modelo, Kim Crawford Wines, and Casa Noble Tequila. The New York-based company’s stock has gone on an outstanding run over the last six years, with its stock price skyrocketing from roughly $22 per share in March 2012 all the way up to its current price tag of $222 per share.It seems clear that Constellation has been a growth company for years, and most investors hope that this remains the case for years to come. However, shares of Constellation have sunk by 3.6% over the last 12 weeks.With that said, let’s take a closer look at some of Constellation’s current estimates to understand if investors should consider buying the stock ahead of earnings.Latest Outlook and ValuationBased on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect Constellation to report adjusted earnings of $1.74 per share, which would mark 17.6% growth from the year-ago period. The company is also projected to see its revenues jump by nearly 8% to hit $1.76 billion.Heading into the report, STZ is trading with a Forward P/E of 22.7. This marks a discount compared to the “Beverages – Alcohol” industry’s average P/E of 26.9. Constellation is also currently trading at a lower earnings multiple than its high point of 25.3x forward earnings over the last year and is almost directly in line with its median 52-week P/E of 22.9.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Constellation surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.STZ is rocking a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 1.64%. This is because the company’s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at $1.77 per share, meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus. This improved outlook is a good sign just two days out from Constellation’s earnings report.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of Constellation’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.Constellation Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteWe can see that Constellation boasts a strong earnings surprise history, yet its bottom-line results have not always translated into positive momentum for the stock. Looking at a more consolidated period, the company has posted strong earnings beats in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 11.9%.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Constellation has seen its stock price surge immediately following its earnings release in three out of the last four quarters.  As most investors know, past performance is hardly an indicator of future success, but we can see that investors have tended to reward STZ’s earnings beats recently. On top of that, Constellation looks poised to beat earnings yet again and marks a discount to an industry that is has, for the most part, outperformed.Constellation is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter and full-year financial results before the markets open on Thursday, March 29.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

1078,STZ,"Does morality matter to you? If yes, then you may abhor the idea of putting money into “sin stocks” that are into activities considered unethical. However, products or services in this space are relatively inelastic, and business is recession-proof. The very nature of their business ensures a steady stream of consumers irrespective of market conditions, which eventually lead to higher margins and solid profits.And why not? While legalization of both recreational and medical marijuana will propel the pot industry to new highs, reduction in taxes will help alcohol producers save more. The cigarette industry, meanwhile, continues to make headway despite legal restrictions. As far as the gaming industry is concerned, growth in the Macau market and Japan opening to casinos will surely boost their bottom line heading into the New Year.But before we zero in on stocks from this tempting space, let’s take a look at what’s in store for these companies.Cannabis Sales Up This Year, With More Room to ExpandPer Marijuana Business Daily’s annual report, legal pot sales have skyrocketed 30% so far this year, which is equivalent to $5.1-$6.1 billion in total revenues. In fact, sales are expected to reach $6.7-$8.8 billion in the coming year, which will result in a whopping gain of at least 31%. Further, sales could top $17 billion by 2021.Such a stellar growth is possible, as a number of U.S. states have voted to legalize recreational pot. Legalization of recreational weed in the state of California is helping Cannabis stocks move north. California’s weed market is expected to open in January, with weeds costing around $500 a pound.Lest we forget, as of now, 29 states and the District of Columbia have already legalized the usage of medical marijuana. An increasing number of people are appreciating the medical value of marijuana as they believe it is safer compared to alcohol and a few other legal prescription drugs. Thus, medical marijuana industries in Illinois, Nevada and New York are poised to make the most as the pot market matures.Alcohol Producers See Reduced Taxes, Cigarette Industry Fights Regulations Recently, jubilant Republicans delivered a tax bill to President Donald Trump before Christmas, as promised. The Republican tax plan got the final approval by the House that gave Corporate America a massive permanent tax break. The tax bill also has a provision that will give alcohol producers a two-year reduction in federal excise tax worth $4.2 billion. Reduction in such taxes will encompass brewers, distilleries and wineries.Kevin McElroy, the lead brewer at Random Row Brewing company, said, “I think it's great,” as the company will save $3.50 per barrel of beer from the tax break. He added that the new provision will save them $1,500 to $2,000 next year.However, the same cannot be said of the U.S. tobacco industry. Cigarette sales have fallen considerably in the U.S. as the industry witnessed an increase in federal excise tax. The industry also faces stiff regulations and restrictions. Nevertheless, despite cigarette sales tanking, sales of flavored cigars continue to gain traction. Menthol cigarettes, meanwhile, continue to hold a constant market share. Smart marketing and advertising moves played a major role in helping the cigarette industry stay afloat.Gambling Stocks Make Attractive Buys – Macau is the KeyThe year 2017 has been superb for gaming stocks, with Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Melco Resorts (MLCO  -  Free Report) comfortably outperforming the broader market. The climb in casino stocks was mostly due to the uptick in Macau’s gambling market. In the first 11 months of this year, revenues surged 19.5%. Macau’s momentum has also been hitting highs lately, giving investors enough reason to be bullish going into next year.That said, the big expansion for casino companies in 2018 will be in Japan. The country is expected to approve two more gaming licenses next year, while estimates are that Japan’s market could be worth $40 billion. Major casino players have made Japan their top priority for next year with an outlay of around $10 billion in building a single resort. This property from Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) will eventually become the biggest license opening since Singapore, a key market for owners of integrated resorts.Top 5 Sin Stocks to Buy for 2018As mentioned above, sinful stocks are well poised to gain traction in next year. Such stocks not only celebrate good times but are also useful during recessionary periods. We have selected five solid stocks from the pot, alcohol, tobacco and gaming industries.

1079,STZ,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), commonly known as AB InBev has failed to impress investors lately owing to its dismal performance. The company is battling soft volumes, higher cost of sales, adverse currency impacts and consumers’ changing preferences.A look at AB InBev’s share price reveals that it has lost 6.3% in the past three months, as against the Beverages – Alcoholic industry’s growth of 2.3%. Currently, the industry ranks in the top 46% (118 out of 256) of the Zacks classified industries. The stock has also underperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector’s gain of 3.2%. In fact, a VGM Score of D further raises concerns for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.  What’s Troubling the Stock?AB InBev has been disappointing investors with its dismal earnings surprise history. Apparently, it had delivered seventh consecutive negative earnings surprise in third-quarter 2017. In the trailing four quarters, the company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 28.4%. Moreover, revenues missed estimates for the second consecutive quarter.Results in the quarter were somewhat hurt by volume declines, escalated cost of sales and revenues decline at Budweiser brand. Unfortunately, management believes that cost of sales will continue to rise owing to the lingering currency woes and growth of premium brands. Management also anticipates that some of its core regions will remain volatile. These factors are likely to dent the company’s performance.In fact, analysts are becoming bearish on the stock as evident from the downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The estimates of $4.22 for 2017 and $5.18 for 2018 have moved down by a penny and 4 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days.Further, consumers’ shifting preference toward booming craft spirits in the United States might take a toll on the growth of the company’s Budweiser brand. Apparently, in the last quarter, Budweiser brand’s revenues fell 2.2%.Also, the beer and beverage industry remains susceptible to unfavorable changes in taxes. Thus, any rise in excise taxes or indirect taxes might weigh on AB InBev’s revenues and margins.Can AB InBev Return to Growth Trajectory?Armed with a robust brand portfolio and solid geographic reach, AB InBev keeps introducing near-beer alternatives, along with no- and low-alcohol beers to address the evolving consumers’ preference. Also, the company is poised to gain a dominant share in the global beer market from SABMiller’s buyout.We also expect the company to benefit from its constant efforts of expansion in the craft beer space, given the rising demand for this beer category. Though the expansion might take time, we believe that AB InBev will return to its growth trajectory backed by its strength of Budweiser brand and robust initiatives.Stocks Gaining From Alcohol Industry TrendsThe alcohol market in the United States has been on an expansion spree, owing to strong demand. Also, the alcohol industry is poised to benefit from the holiday season and a buoyant U.S. economy. Markedly, the Alcohol industry recorded 23% growth over a year, ahead of the 19.6% upside of the S&P 500 market.Here are some alcohol stocks that have outperformed the industry and hold a favorable Zacks Rank. These are Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) and The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), each.

1080,STZ,"The European Union (EU) has threatened the United States of a tit-for-tat situation should Trump impose a 25% tax on foreign steel. This is especially true as the EU would propose a retaliatory tariff of 25% on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products imported from the country, valued about 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion).The targeted products include shirts, jeans, cosmetics, other consumer goods, motorbikes and pleasure boats worth around 1 billion euros; orange juice, bourbon whiskey, corn and other agricultural products totaling 951 million euros; and steel and other industrial products valued at 854 million euros.In a counter-attack, Trump warned the EU that he would impose a 25% penalty on European car imports if the bloc carried out punitive measures against the metals tariffs. He reiterated his commitment to levying tariffs on steel and aluminum, saying that the United States has poor trading conditions with other nations, including those in the EU. According to the latest data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), EU and U.S. auto-related trade account for around 10% of total trade between the two regions (read: Trump Tariffs Put These Sector ETFs & Stocks in Focus).Intensifying talks of a trade war between Trump and the EU have been unnerving investors lately, putting many stocks and ETFs in focus. Here, we have discussed some.What’s HotThe penalty on European car imports could spell trouble for popular car manufacturers like Volkswagen and BMW, affecting the German auto industry. These luxury carmakers also manufacture cars in America, shipping billions of dollars abroad. According to Germany's Association of the Automotive Industry, this country produced 854,000 vehicles in the United States in 2016, marking a four-fold increase in about seven years. More than 60% of those were exported.As such, iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG  -  Free Report) targeting the German stock market, will likely feel the pressure. The ETF has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: ETFs to Buy as German Economy Grows).Coming to the EU proposed retaliation against U.S. goods, manufacturer and seller of motorcycles Harley Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) will be hit hard as about 16% of the company’s sales come from Europe. The company cautioned that the tariffs “will drive up costs for all products with these raw materials, regardless of their origin.” It also stated “a punitive, retaliatory tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles in any market would have a significant impact on their sales, their dealers, suppliers and the customers in those markets.” The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of D.Harley Davidson accounts for a minor 1.5% share in the only pure play auto ETF — First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF (CARZ  -  Free Report) (read: Should You Steer Clear of Auto ETFs & Stocks?).Other iconic American brands that will be hurt include Levi Strauss & Co, the corporate parent of global market-share leader Levi's, and bourbon whiskey. Notably, Europe has been a major contributor to Levi’s sales, with 20% increase in jeans sales last year.Meanwhile, the additional tax on bourbon whiskey will make the product more expensive, hurting sales of the likes of Brown Forman Corporation’s  Jack Daniel's family of whiskey, Diageo’s (DEO  -  Free Report) Bulleit Bourbon Whiskey and Constellation Brands’s (STZ  -  Free Report) Black Velvet. The three stocks have a Zacks Rank #3.This would negatively impact the performance of the Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey and Spirits ETF  targeting the fast-growing world of high-end whiskey and spirits. In fact, it has heavy exposure to Diageo, which dominates the fund’s return with 16.6% of total assets.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1081,STZ,"Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) appears promising on the back of its strategic endeavors. Additionally, the company has been gaining from its efforts to drive consumer demand, solid focus on buyouts and continued strength in the beer business. The stock boasts an impressive earnings surprise history as well.Driven by the aforementioned factors, the company returned 48.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 23%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock also exhibits a Growth Score of B with an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 18.4%.Let’s dive deep into the factors that are pushing the stock higher.Robust Surprise History and OutlookConstellation Brands has to its credit a robust surprise history. Apparently, the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings marked 12th straight earnings beat and 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Also, the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the trailing eight quarters.Meanwhile, management remains encouraged with the superb second-quarter results, which was reflected in significant market share gains, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and solid execution. This along with strength in the beer business led management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018, which is envisioned in the range of $8.25-$8.40 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged higher at $8.43.Focus on Business ExpansionConstellation Brands remains focused on expanding operations directed toward achieving business growth. In the beer segment, the company’s expansion plans are anchored by the acquisition of the Funky Buddha Brewery; the introduction of Fathom IPA by Ballast Point Brewery; the Obregon Brewery acquisition, which will bolster its high-end Mexican beer portfolio; the faster-than-expected 25 million hectares expansion of its Nava brewery in Mexico; and the construction of the East Coast brewery in Belleville, VA.Moreover, the company is on track with its glass plant expansion. It also sees immense growth potential for its spirits and wines business, which in turn might prove to be beneficial.Brand StrengthArmed with a formidable portfolio of well-known brands, Constellation Brands is the leading wine company in the world. Moreover, it holds a dominant position in the premium wine and beer segment in the United States. The company is also a leading producer of wine in Canada and New Zealand. This provides it with a competitive edge and also bolsters its well-established position in the market.Other CatalystsConstellation Brands’ consistent focus on brand building and its initiatives to include new products are the key revenue drivers. Owing to its strategic endeavors, the company is witnessing increasing market share, especially in the U.S. beer category.Notably, the company was the highest growth contributor in the U.S. beer category for the fourth straight year, in fiscal 2017. Also, it is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. In this regard, management expects solid results from its Ballast Point craft beer brand, which is currently placed among the top 20 craft brands nationwide.Furthermore, the company is making meaningful leadership changes in an attempt to bring about innovations and improve its operational activities. Also, it is focused on enhancing points of distribution at retail and effectively executing its strategic merchandising initiatives to boost sales. Alongside, Constellation Brands expects to enhance shareholders’ value in the future backed by continued strength in its cash generating ability and sustained growth.Banking on these above factors, Constellation Brands emerged as a lucrative investment opportunity for investors and definitely deserves a place in your portfolio.Do Alcoholic Stocks Appeal You, Check TheseOther favorably-placed Alcoholic stocks are The Boston Beer Company, Inc.

1083,STZ,"Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) delivered robust second-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates. This marked the company’s second straight quarter of earnings beat. Adjusted earnings of 62 cents jumped nearly 23% and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents.Brown Forman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Brown Forman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Brown Forman Corporation QuoteNet sales improved about 10% year over year to $914 million, after deducting excise taxes. However, on an underlying basis (excluding negative currency impact and other adjustments), sales increased 8% that marked the fifth straight quarterly growth. Moreover, the company’s sales, before accounting for excise taxes, came in at $1,166 million, up 11% from the prior-year figure of $1,055 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $867.8 million.The company’s robust underlying sales performance can be attributed to persistent momentum in its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniel’s, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Herradura brand families. Further, net sales gained from improved economies in the emerging markets.Brown-Forman rose nearly 1.6% in the pre-market trading session following the earnings release. However, Brown-Forman shares have gained 14.3% in the last three months, against the industry’s decline of 0.1%.Quarter in DetailBrown-Forman’s gross profit increased nearly 11% to $610 million, while gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 66.7%. However, underlying gross profit improved 8%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses remained flat from the year-ago quarter at $163 million, while on an underlying basis it declined 1%. This was primarily backed by stringent cost controls.However, advertising expenses rose 4% year over year to $111 million, while underlying advertising costs increased 3%. The rise in advertising costs can be attributed to rise in investments for the Jack Daniels family of brands and further growth of the fast growing bourbon and tequila brands.Nevertheless, operating income grew 19% to $346 million, with operating margin expanding 280 bps to 37.9%. On an underlying basis, operating income of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company increased 16%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowBrown-Forman ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $212 million, long-term debt of $1,719 million and total debt of $1,954 million.

Further, the company notes that competition has intensified in the developed economies, which can hinder results.However, the company remains confident of persistent growth in the second half of fiscal 2018 and consequently raised guidance.Management now projects 6-7% growth in underlying sales. Earlier, the company had forecasted underlying sales growth of 4-5%.Nevertheless, the company expects the positive operating leverage experienced in the first-half to reverse in the second half. The reversal will stem from higher cost of sales and increased operating investments in the second half mainly related to the favorable environment for the company’s brands.Consequently, the company expects a moderate increase in SG&A expense on an underlying basis. Further, underlying A&P growth is anticipated to be nearly in line with sales growth.Despite incorporating higher costs, underlying operating income is anticipated to increase 8-9% in fiscal 2018, compared with 6-8% growth expected earlier.

Well, Molson Coors’ shares have plunged 22.5% in a year, as against the industry’s growth of 14%. Molson Coors’ adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share surged 31.9% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. The upside is attributable to favorable global pricing, net pension benefits, MG&A efficiencies and indirect tax provision cycling. However, this was partly countered by reduced volumes, inflation, greater underlying tax rate and investments in global business capacities. Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company Quote Delving DeeperNet sales (excluding excise taxes) advanced 4.5% to $2,579.6 million but was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,597 million. The sales growth was backed by better global pricing, royalty volume, cycling of indirect tax provision and currency translations, somewhat negated by soft financial volumes. On a constant currency basis, net sales climbed 2.4%. While sales declined in the United States, it witnessed improvements in all other regions. Notably net sales per hectoliter improved 5.8% (up 3.7% on a constant-currency basis), on the back of the same factors that drove net sales.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volume inched lower by 1.1% to 22.4 million hectoliters owing to soft U.S. and International volumes, partly compensated by strength in European and Canadian regions. Global priority volumes dipped 1.9%, while financial volumes slipped 1.2% to 23.1 million hectoliters. Financial volumes were hurt by softness in United States.Underlying EBITDA was $480.3 million in the quarter, marking a 17% jump from the year-ago period. Further, underlying EBITDA ascended 14.3% on a constant currency basis.Segment DetailsThe company operates through the following geographical segments.Canada: Molson Coors Canada net sales rose 7.1% to $352.9 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter grew 1% in local currency, driven by better pricing, partly countered by unfavorable sales mix. Further, Canada brand volume climbed 0.8%, thanks to increased sales of craft and import brands. Financial volumes (which includes contract brewing volumes) inched up 1%. Underlying EBITDA fell 4.2% to $79 million due to higher COGS, partly made up by better pricing; favorable currency and reduced MG&A costs.United States (MillerCoors): Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the brands in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. market. Segment net sales (on pro-forma basis) decreased 0.6% to $1,724.7 million. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, improved 1.4%. This stemmed from favorable pricing, partly countered by negative mix. However, U.S. domestic sales-to-retailers volume (STRs) and domestic sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) declined 3% and 1.5%, respectively. The former was accountable to soft Premium Light volumes. The segment’s underlying EBITDA grew 4.9% to $346 million thanks to higher net pricing, lower M&A costs and cost savings. This was partly offset by reduced STW volumes and COGS inflation.Europe: The segment reported net sales growth of 29% to $473.2 million in the quarter. Europe net sales per hectoliter jumped 16.3% in local currency driven by positive mix, inclusion of export brand and royalty revenues and cycling of indirect tax provision. Additionally, Europe brand volume improved 10.4% in the quarter, whereas financial volume (including contract brewing and factored brands, excluding royalty volume) went up by 2.7%. Brand volumes were aided by strength in above-premium brands, transfer of royalty and export brand volumes into this segment from the International segment. Underlying EBITDA surged considerably year over year, from $28.1 million to $102.7 million.International: Segment net sales surged 19% $71.4 million. Net sales per hectoliter grew 6.1%, courtesy of changes in sales mix and better pricing. However, International brand volume plunged 15.1% in the quarter, marred by transfer of export and royalty volumes to European segment and Modelo contract loss in Japan. This was partly cushioned by inclusion of Puerto Rico’s business from MillerCoors and growth in various markets of Latin America. Segment underlying EBITDA came in at $0.4 million in the quarter, much lower than $1.4 million the year-ago period. This was accountable to increased MG&A costs associated with Miller International’s addition, loss of the Modelo deal and transfer of export and royalty volumes to Europe.Other Financial UpdatesThe company’s net cash from operating activities in 2017 came in at $1.866 billion, while underlying free cash flow was $1.449 billion. Underlying free cash flow jumped 67.8% year over year.The company ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $418.6 million and net debt of $10.895 billion. Notably, the company’s net debt declined substantially from the beginning of 2017. The company also made contributions to its defined-benefit pension plans during the year thus moving ahead with its deleveraging targets.Notably, the company generated cost savings of more than $255 million in 2017, that surpassed its target by more than $80 million. Encouraged by this, the company raised its three-year savings goal to $600 million, which is expected to be generated by 2019.OutlookManagement remains impressed with its 2017 results, which was marked by enhanced top line, global brand volume growth and higher net sales per hectoliter, even amid tough market conditions. Notably, the company’s focus on portfolio premiumization and revenue management have been paying off. Also, the company enhanced its financial position by paying down debt and increased market share in Canada and Europe, while it also exceeded its cost-savings and free cash flow target. Moreover, Molson Coors optimized commercial expenditure, which helped it deliver solid net income and underlying EBITDA growth in 2017.Further, the company remains committed toward First Choice, and remains focused on strengthening its brand portfolio. Given these factors, along with focus on achieving cost savings and solidifying balance sheet, we remain optimistic about Molson Coors ongoing prospects.For 2018, Molson Coors anticipates generating cost savings of roughly $210 million. Further, it expects to deliver underlying free cash flow of around $1.5 billion in 2018, (plus or minus 10%). Capital spending is expected to be roughly $670 million (plus or minus 10%). Underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range from 18-22%, thanks to the latest tax reforms.Molson Coors expects 2018 to also be impacted by new revenue recognition standard (which became effective in 2018 beginning) and the updated pension guidance.Don’t Miss These Consumer Staples StocksBoston Beer (SAM  -  Free Report) with a solid earnings surprise history, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1085,STZ,"Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) continues its strides to retain its third position in the high-end U.S. beer market through the latest buyout of Dallas, TX-based Four Corners Brewing LLC for an undisclosed amount. The company’s previous efforts to shine in the beer space are highlighted by the acquisition of Funky Buddha Brewery in 2017, Obregon Brewery in 2016, and Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits in 2015.The latest Four Corners acquisition will be a part of Constellation Brands’ Craft & Specialty Beer group, which includes the iconic Corona, Modelo and Pacifico brands. The addition of flagship brands like Local Buzz Honey-Rye Golden Ale and El Chingón IPA is likely to help the company to diversify its portfolio.Founded in 2012, Four Corners’ beer portfolio aptly reflects the roots and heritage of Texas. The company produces beers that are high-performing and dynamic, with bicultural (Hispanic and American) inspired flavors and branding. The beers are refreshing and big on flavor, and complement Constellation Brands’ existing portfolio. Sales for Four Corners have improved five times since 2014, with the brewery expanding its capacity from 8,000 barrels in 2016 to 25,000 in 2017.Following the acquisition, Constellation Brands and the Four Corners’ team will work together, with brewery owners George, Greg and Steve, carrying out daily operations. Further, Four Corners will retain its standard of brewing and will continue to serve its loyal beer customers with the same innovative and fresh flavors.Notably, Constellation Brands is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue within the beer industry. In this regard, management expects outstanding results from its Ballast Point craft beer brand that is currently placed among the top 20 craft brands nationwide. Evidently, Constellation Brands was the highest growth contributor in the U.S. beer category for the fourth straight year in fiscal 2017.Constellation Brands has been significantly gaining from the strength in beer business over the years. In first-quarter fiscal 2019, sales at the beer business improved 11%, driven by 8.6% rise in shipment volumes and depletions growth of 8.9%. Solid portfolio depletions and market share gains mainly stemmed from the strength in Modelo and Corona brand families. The company’s Corona Premier, Familiar and Modelo Especial brands, were among the top 5 share gainers in the beer market in the fiscal first quarter. Management continues to expect high-single-digit volume growth as well as 9-11% net sales and operating income growth for the beer segment in fiscal 2019.A glance at Constellation Brands’ share price performance shows that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past year, on the back of an excellent surprise history and constant brand-building efforts.

1088,STZ,"Craft beer, which till some time back was a favorite with Americans, seems to be losing its appeal. According to market research firm IRI Worldwide, craft beer growth slowed in the first half of 2018 and the rest of the year doesn’t look good either. Moreover beer shipments from U.S. breweries too are down so far this year. An increasing number of Americans is opting for non-alcoholic beverages that have resulted in demand for energy drinks to shoot over the last few years.Understandably, this has made soft beverage manufacturing companies focus more on healthier drinks, especially non carbonated, low sugary and energy drinks. So much so, that even alcoholic drink manufacturers are focusing on non-alcoholic beverages.Craft Beer Losing AppealTill a few years back, craft beer was a favorite with Americans. However, with changing tastes and preferences of the new generation, the appeal for craft beer is fading. And the change seems to be more evident this year. According to the Beer Institute, beer shipments from U.S. breweries are already down 3.5% this year.Per IRI, worldwide sales of craft beer across large-scale retail stores grew only 1.7% in the first half of 2018. Interestingly, in 2002, beer comprised 54% of overall alcohol sales but in 2017 beer contributed only 46% of total alcohol sales. This is certainly taking a toll on prominent beer manufacturers like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), which are struggling to cope with declining demand for beer.The reason for this sudden beer-apathy is the growing preference for healthier drinks. An increasing number of Americans is becoming health conscious, which has seen a decline in demand for carbonated beverages. The carbonated soft drink market has shrunk for 13 consecutive years now. Carbonated soft drinks volume fell 1.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline between 0.8% and 1.3% this year.Industry Swings Toward Non-Alcoholic and Energy DrinksThe global non-alcoholic beverage market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 5.5% between 2018 and 2023, according to Market Research Future. Analysts believe that growing consumer awareness and increasing interest in a healthier lifestyle is making people shun alcoholic and carbonated drinks.This has resulted in the energy drink market to grow at a rapid pace over the last few years. Energy drinks continue to outperform the overall soft drink market in terms of value. The global value of energy drinks reached more than $51 billion in 2017.Understandably, millennials are opting for healthier and non-alcoholic drinks, which has made not only soft beverages companies shift focus toward healthier drinks, but also beer manufacturers reorient their product line with low-alcohol content.Beer manufacturers like Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) are trying to come up with innovative products and adding new flavors that have less alcohol content. The Boston Beer Company recently launched Fuzzy Traveler Peach Shandy that is low on alcohol content. Craft Brew Alliance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.On the other hand, almost all beverage companies like The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) are redesigning their portfolio along these lines.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Consequently, shares of Boston Beer have rallied 26.7% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.3%. Let’s delve deeper into the factors driving this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Strategic Initiatives: A Key Growth DriverBoston Beer looks well poised with its three-point growth plan, which focuses on revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation.Firstly, this plan prioritizes the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands via packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives.

1095,STZ,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Constellation Brands Inc (STZ  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Constellation Brands Tops Q2 Earnings & Sales EstimatesConstellation Brands’ adjusted earnings for second-quarter fiscal 2018 surged 40% year over year to $2.47 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16. Reported earnings came in at $2.48 per share, up 42% year over year.During the quarter, the company benefited from efforts to drive consumer demand for its robust brand portfolio. Also, results were driven by contributions from acquisitions along with continued strength in its beer business in particular.Net sales advanced 3% to $2,084.5 million, on the back of a rise of 8% in organic sales and gains from recent buyouts. Moreover, the top line was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,058 million, consequently returning to the beat trend after a miss in the prior quarter.Sales at the company’s beer business improved 12.8%, thanks to 11.7% rise in shipment volumes and depletions growth of 8.1%. Further, beer sales benefited from strong portfolio as well as successful key summer selling season driven by its ‘120 Days of Summer’ marketing campaign. This campaign aided the market share gains in the 4th of July holiday and through the rest of the summer season into the Labor Day.Wine and spirits’ sales fell 11.7%, due to lower shipment volumes and 0.9% decline in organic sales partly negated 5% rise in depletions. During the quarter, the U.S. shipment volume lagged depletion volumes, mainly due to the timing. Notably, the company’s recently acquired wine brands — The Prisoner and Charles Smith reported superb depletions growth of 30% and 74%, respectively. Further, the High West Whiskey portfolio delivered depletions growth of 37%.Cost and Margin PerformanceAdjusted gross profit for the quarter improved 9% year over year to $1,061.9 million.

This growth was backed by 26% operating income improvement at the beer segment, offset by operating income decline at the wine and spirits business. The beer segment gained from solid performance during the summer selling season, along with favorable pricing and foreign currency benefits. Meanwhile, operating income at the wine and spirits business was hurt by increased spending on marketing initiatives.Financial PositionConstellation Brands ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $125.6 million. As of Aug 31, 2017, the company had $8,036.9 million in long-term debt (excluding current maturities) and total shareholders’ equity was $7,945.3 million.In first-half fiscal 2018, Constellation Brands generated $1,102.9 million in cash from operations and free cash flow of $597.8 million.The company’s solid cash flows and financials provide it with the flexibility to pay dividends.

The acquired brewery will form part of Constellation Brands’ Craft & Specialty Beer group in the beer division. This fast-growing craft brewery has a cherished portfolio led by Floridian Hefeweizen and Hop Gun IPA.Fiscal 2018 OutlookManagement remains encouraged with superb results, which was marked by significant market share gains, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and solid execution. This along with the strength in the beer business led the company to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Further, management raised fiscal 2018 operating income target for the beer segment, tweaked forecast for the wine and spirits business. However, it retained the sales forecasts for both businesses.The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $8.25-$8.40 per share, compared with previous guidance range of $7.90-$8.10. On a reported basis, EPS for fiscal 2018 is anticipated in the range of $7.90-$8.05, up from $7.55-$7.75 projected earlier.The company expects net sales for the beer segment to grow 9-11%. Operating income at this segment is anticipated to increase in a band of 17-19%, compared with the prior guidance of 13-15%.Sales at the wine and spirits’ segment are still projected to decline 4-6%, while the operating income is now expected to remain flat compared with a rise of 5-7% predicted earlier. Earlier, the company forecasted operating income at this segment to remain flat year over year. These projections include the impact from the sale of its Canadian wine business, and benefits from the High West, Charles Smith and Prisoner buyouts. Excluding the effects of these, operating income for the wine and spirits business is expected to improve 5-7% in fiscal 2018.Certain other factors were taken into consideration in providing the earnings guidance. These include an interest expense expectation of $330-$340 million, an approximate tax rate of 21% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 201 million.The company anticipates capital expenditure for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.175-$1.275 billion with roughly $1.0 billion estimated for expansion of Mexico beer operations.The company’s free cash flow expectation for fiscal 2018 lies in the range of $725-$825 million.

Earnings were also below management’s guidance of 75-83 cents.Net sales of $1,548.8 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,527 million. However, sales declined 2.4% from last year owing to the divestiture of the SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business. The divestiture lowered revenues by approximately 2.9%.

The top line also gained from product recall re-imbursements worth $1.7 million.Gross margin was 16.8% in the third quarter, down 120 basis points (bps) from the year-ago figure primarily due to lower sales. Product recalls, margin improvement initiatives and restructuring activities lowered gross margin by 0.5%. Further, gross margin was impacted by unfavorable volume mix as well as increased operating and commodity costs. These were partially offset by gains from reduced incentive compensation and depreciation.Adjusted EBITDA tumbled 12.7% to $148 million, due to higher commodity and operating costs, and adverse volume/mix. These were partially offset by a reduction in variable incentive compensation.Segment DetailsThe company’s reportable segments are organized by products and are classified into Baked Goods, Beverages, Condiments, Meals, and Snacks.Baked Goods: Sales from the segment increased 6.6% to $351.2 million. The segment gained from favorable volume/mix and foreign currency rates, partially offset by lower pricing.

This was partially offset by unfavorable pricing, resulting from enhanced competition.

These were partially compensated by lower SG&A expenses.Condiments: Sales for the segment increased 3.4% to $333.8 million as a result of favorable volume/mix, pricing and foreign exchange rates. In the third quarter, direct operating income margin declined 150 bps to 10.3%, primarily due to higher commodity and operating costs. These were partially offset by increase in volume and price and lower SG&A expenses.Meals: Net sales declined 18.2% to $284.6 million owing to the divestiture of the SIF business, adverse volume/mix in the ready-to-eat cereal category and unfavorable pricing. Direct operating income margin increased 180 bps to 11.3%. The upside was mainly due to favorable commodity costs and lower depreciation, which were partially offset by increased operating costs. .Snacks: Net sales from the segment declined 5.4% to $332.6 million, owing to adverse volume/mix arising out of weak consumer trends and exit of low margin co-pack business. These were partially offset by favorable pricing. Direct operating income margin fell 480 bps to 0.5% due to unfavorable volume/mix, increased commodity and operating costs. These were partially compensated through lower SG&A expenses.Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Treehouse Foods, Inc.

1098,STZ,"Just recently, Canada became the second nation to legalize the use of recreational marijuana after the Senate passed a bill with a vote of 52-29. Shortly after, Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, tweeted and praised the bill, saying ""It's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana and for criminals to reap the profits, today we change that.""With Canada now on the radar for legal marijuana, companies are looking to expand and use that to their advantage. According to Huffington Post, the brewing company Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) has reportedly been in talks with several cannabis companies in Canada. This is because Molson Coors plans to create marijuana infused beers in order to turn around the company’s declining beer sales.Since the legalization of marijuana use in states, many people have started substituting cannabis for beer. According to Forbes, the beer industry could lose more than $2 billion in retail sales due to legal marijuana. Now that it is legal in Canada, companies are finding ways to prevent marijuana from outshining beer sales and looking to find ways to equal them out.Constellation Brands Inc. v Molson Coors Last year, a similar deal was made between the Corona beer seller, Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), where it took a 9.9% stake in the Canadian medical marijuana company, Canopy Growth (CGC  -  Free Report). The stake was worth $191 million. Rob Sands, the CEO of Constellation Brands, said that their company’s success is the result of identifying early consumer trends. However, according to Fortune, Constellation may plan to sell their drink product in Canada as well. This could mean future competition between the two companies, seeing as they will be releasing similar products in the same market. However, not only does  Molson have the Canadian market under its belt, but it also has the potential to have major exposure in the North American market, seeing as it is the number two beer seller in both Canada and the United States. Although there are risks of combining cannabis and beer industries, Chris Burggraeve, the former chief marketing officer at AB Inbev (BUD  -  Free Report), said that companies who don’t include stoners in their marketing are going to be left in the dust.Looking at the stock movement of Molson Coors and Constellation Brands, it’s clear that STZ has been doing quite better than TAP. Over the past year, shares of STZ have gained around 25% while shares of TAP of have lost over 20% in the same time period. STZ has also performed better than the S&P 500 as well, which has gained about 11.6% in the last year.Currently, Molson Coors is a #5 (Strong Sell) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘D,’ while Constellation Brands is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘B.’What Does this Mean for Molson Coors? Since Molson Coors’ main market is Canada, there could be some competition if Constellation Brands decides to distribute its cannabis infused beer in the same market. Even though a similar product has already been established by another brewing company, if Molson Coors can pull it off right, it will be the first company in Canada to release a cannabis infused beer product.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

In short, while football is over for now, people around the country will still be drinking plenty of booze.But not all beer and liquor companies are well positioned to capitalize in the current U.S. drinking market. Domestic beer sales have slowed, wine and spirits sales are up, and imports from south of the border and craft brews have become more and more prevalent. With that said, let’s take a look at three companies with strong Zacks Ranks that also stand to profit from these new booze trends.1.       Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report)Shares of Diageo plc slipped on Monday as part of a now two-day, market-wide sell-off. But before today’s retreat, shares of this liquor giant had surged more than 27% over the last year. The maker of brands such as Johnnie Walker, J&B, Smirnoff, Cîroc, Ketel One, Don Julio, and Tanqueray has also earned multiple upward earnings estimate revisions for its current fiscal year within the last 30 days.Diageo plc is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The multinational spirits company could be poised to expand even further amid shifting drinking habits. Investors should be happy to note that the company currently sits nearly 8% below its 52-week high, which should give its shares room to rebound without having to jump into a new range.2.       Boston Beer Company (SAM  -  Free Report) Despite Boston Beer Company’s hometown Patriots losing 41-33 in the Super Bowl, the company has a stronghold in the craft beer world. In fact, the maker of Samuel Adams helped kick off the mass appeal of this beer revolution, and it continues to introduce new flavor-forward beers and other alcoholic drinks to this day.Boston Beer also owns two hard cider powers: Twisted Tea Brewing Company and Angry Orchard Cider Company. These two brands should help the company expand its reach as the hard cider drinking trend proliferates. Lastly, Boston Beer quietly entered the even more nascent spiked sparkling water market in 2016 with its Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand. SAM is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)3.       Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report)Constellation boasts beer brands such as Corona and Ballast Point. The company also owns Black Box and Kim Crawford wines as well as Casa Noble Tequila and Svedka vodka. Constellation also owns Mexican beer Modelo Especial, which is one of the fastest growing beer brands in the U.S. These brands have helped shares of this alcohol distribution powerhouse skyrocket over 44.63% in the last 52 weeks.Looking forward, Constellation is expected to see its full-year earnings jump 26.18% year-over-year. Constellation has also experienced a great deal of upward earnings estimate revisions recently. Investors will also be happy to note that the company is expected to see its EPS figure grow at an annualized rate of 19.05% over the next three to five years. What’s more, Constellation is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1100,STZ,"Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) came out with fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein it continued its robust trend of year-over-year bottom-line growth. Further, the company issued a favorable earnings outlook for 2018.If we look into Altria’s stock performance in the past three months, we note that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 11.1%, in comparison with the industry’s growth of 7.8%.Quarter in detailAdjusted earnings of 91 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Also, earnings surged 33.8% year over year, on the back of greater equity earnings from the company’s beer investments related to AB InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), higher adjusted operating companies income (“OCI”) in the smokeable and smokeless segments, lower outstanding shares and reduced adjusted tax rate.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group Quote However, net revenues fell more than 2% to $6,083 million in the quarter, owing to soft net revenues in the smokeable products segments. Revenues net of excise taxes remained almost flat at $4,696 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4,793 million.Management stated that Altria remains focused on enhancing its non-combustible product portfolio for authorization by the FDA.In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume, which expanded 60% in full-year 2017, courtesy of greater distribution and category growth. MarkTen’s full-year 2017 national retail market share was approximately 12.5% in mainstream retail channels. Further, it forms nearly 70% of e-vapor volumes in those channels.The company also made considerable progress in smokeless and other oral nicotine-containing products. Also, in heated tobacco, Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) remains committed toward making plans to commercialize IQOS, which it will exclusively sell in the U.S. upon FDA’s approval.Segment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Revenues net of excise taxes dipped 1% year over year to $3,935 million, due to soft volumes that was somewhat compensated by better pricing and lower promotions. Domestic cigarette shipment volumes fell 8.9% year over year, stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes, unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share. On the other hand, shipment volumes for cigars rose 7.9% in the quarter.Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.8 percentage point slip. This was largely due to a 0.7 share point drop in Marlboro’s retail share stemming from intense competition and increase in cigarette excise tax in California.Adjusted OCI increased 5.7% to $1,964 million, while margins jumped 3.2 percentage points to 49.9%. This could be attributable to lower SG&A, better pricing and reduced promotions.Smokeless Products: Revenues net of excise taxes advanced 11.1% to $542 million in the quarter. This was driven by better pricing and reduced promotions, partly countered by soft volumes. Domestic shipment volumes dipped 0.6% to 211.9 million units, mainly accountable to a decline in Skoal volumes, partly compensated by improved Copenhagen volumes. Total smokeless products retail share contracted 1.1 percentage points to 53.6% in the quarter, due to lower share of Skoal.Adjusted OCI surged 27.2% to $369 million and margins expanded 8.7 percentage points to 68.1%. This was backed by the same factors that drove OCI at the smokeable unit.Wine: The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, tumbled 8.8% year over year at $219 million. Results were impacted by trade inventory reductions, heightened competition and sluggish growth of premium wine. Wine shipment volume also decreased 9.75 to 2.8 million cases.Ste. Michelle’s adjusted OCI improved 1.6% to $65 million, mainly accountable to better pricing, reduced expenses and favorable mix partly countered by lower volumes. Adjusted OCI margin expanded 3 percentage point to 29.7%.A Glimpse of 2017Altria’s adjusted earnings for full-year 2017 came in at $3.39 per share, which advanced 11.9% year over year and also surpassed the consensus mark of $3.28. Notably, Altria’s reported and adjusted tax rate for the full year 2017 was impacted by the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Act).2017 revenues slipped 0.7% to $25.6 billion, while revenues (net of excise taxes) climbed 0.8% to $19.5 billion, almost meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.57 billion.Financial UpdatesIn December 2017, Altria declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66 cents per share. During the fourth quarter and 2017, Altria paid dividends worth $1.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Further, management remains on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line. Further, the company repurchased 8.4 million shares for approximately $558 million during the fourth quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, Altria had approximately $18 million remaining under its share repurchase program of $4 billion, which was, however, concluded in January 2018.Consequently, management announced a new buyback authorization of about $1 billion, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.Consolidation of Manufacturing Facilities & Management ChangeIn October 2016, Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost savings.Concurrently, Altria announced the retirement of Chairman and CEO — Marty Barrington, which is expected to take place later this year. Management also announced Howard Willard as the new Chairman and CEO, who will assume the role on May 17, 2018.OutlookManagement expects adjusted earnings for 2018 in a range of $3.90-$4.03, up 15% to 19% year over year. This excludes an expected charge of about 9 cents related to tax adjustments.Altria expects full-year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to range 23-24%.Further, capital expenditures in 2018 are estimated in a band of $200 million to $250 million, while depreciation and amortization costs are anticipated to be roughly $210 million.Don’t Miss These Consumer Staples StocksBoston Beer Company (SAM) with a splendid earnings surprise history sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1101,STZ,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) took yet another step to expand its portfolio of meat products and address the rising protein demand. The leading chicken, meat and prepared foods producer’s venture capital arm – Tyson Ventures made an investment in Memphis Meats, with the deal terms remaining under covers.Memphis Meats concentrates on developing ways to produce cultural meat directly from animals’ cells without killing them — a method that is not only safer for animals but is also better for the environment and consumers. This food-tech startup intends to use the funds from Tyson Foods to speed up product development. While Tyson Foods now holds a minority stake in Memphis Foods, the latter has attracted many other investors in the past including Cargill, Bill Gates, DFJ, Atomico and Richard Branson.Tyson Foods’ latest move underscores its constant efforts to expand its protein-rich offerings, as the demand for such products has been growing and is expected to rise further in the times ahead. Alongside the widening demography of protein-savvy consumers, traditional meat sales face intense pressure due to increasing environmental concerns about intensive animal farming and animal welfare. Given these factors, we believe that the aforementioned investment deems fit.Focus on Protein-Packed Products: A Major DriverWell, Tyson Foods has long been making efforts to expand protein-packed brands. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To further enrich the Prepared Foods category, the company announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Management continues to expect positive synergies from the acquisitions.Additionally, the company made investments of $84 million (in August 2017) and $300 million (in November 2017) to expand poultry production capacity in Tennessee.  Other than this, the company has also undertaken divesture of non-protein businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) to focus more on the growing protein-packed food arena.All said, Tyson Foods seems to be well equipped with the categories that are currently in high demand at the national foodservice chains. Further, the company is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food-service channel.Notably, Tyson Foods’ top- and bottom-line results have been gaining from such efforts, which have also boosted investors’ confidence in the stock. Markedly, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 28% in a year, surpassing the industry’s upside of 20.5%. We believe that efforts like the aforementioned investment in Memphis Meats, is likely to spur further growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.  Looking for More Promising Stocks?

1102,STZ,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

1103,STZ,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company’s top line declined year over year. Consequently, management lowered its outlook for 2017.Consequently, Newell’s shares declined 10.5% in the pre-market trading session. The stock was down 39.1% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 9%.Results were below the company’s expectations and were hurt by soft late-quarter sales with respect to retailer inventory rebalancing, mainly related to the decelerated market growth, in the United States through the Back-to-School period. As a result, markets were weaker across various categories.Q3 HighlightsNewell’s normalized earnings of 86 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents in the third quarter but improved 10.3% year over year from 78 cents in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by modest core sales improvement, the ongoing cost savings and related synergies, Project Renewal, acquisitions along with a more favorable tax rate. However, these were somewhat mitigated by the lost earnings from divested businesses, adverse product mix, commodity cost inflation, higher advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment coupled with a greater share count.On a reported basis, including one-time items, the company recorded earnings of 48 cents per share compared with 38 cents a year ago.Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteNet sales dropped 7% to $3,678.2 million in the quarter, also missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,702 million. This represents a net adverse impact of 770 basis points (bps) from acquisitions and divestitures.Core sales increased 0.4%, driven by solid performance by Baby and Food businesses within the Live segment, Waddington as well as Consumer and Commercial business within the Work segment, Team Sports and Fishing in the Play segment.Segmental Performance Live net sales increased 2.3% year over year to $1483.3 million while core sales improved 0.6%. The uptick was backed by solid results in the Baby and Food businesses, substantially offset by soft results from Appliances and Cookware.Net sales in the Learn segment edged up 0.7% to $642 million while core sales were up 0.5%, on the back of modest improvement in all its divisions.Work net sales rose 1.6% to $738 million while core sales improved 1.9%, owing to persistent growth on Waddington as well as robust results from the Consumer and Commercial business.Sales at the Play segment increased 2.4% to $611 million while core sales advanced 2.3%, driven by growth across all the divisions along with solid growth in Team Sports and Fishing.Net sales at the Other segment plunged 62.4% to $204 million, primarily due to the divestitures of the Tools, Winter Sports, Fire Starter as well as Fire Log and Cordage businesses. Further, core sales decreased 10.6% owing to soft Process Solutions business.MarginsNewell’s normalized gross margin contracted 100 bps to 35% as cost synergies and savings gains were more than negated by adverse mix as well as higher commodity cost inflation.Normalized operating income fell roughly 9.5% to $551 million. Normalized operating income margin also declined 40 bps to 15%. Gains from synergies and Project Renewal savings were higher than compensated with the absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix and increased advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment.Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $792.3, long-term debt of $10,184.4 million and total shareholders’ equity of $12,770 million. In the nine months of 2017, the company used $58 million cash in operating activities.Further, operating cash flow was $183 million in the quarter versus $513 million in the last year.Additionally, the company’s board of directors has approved a share buyback plan in addition to the existing share repurchase program. Under the revised plan, Newell is authorized to buyback up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares through 2020-end. Still the company had $256 million left under its current $500 million share buyback plan. Earlier, the existing plan was expected to expire at the end of 2017 but now it is extended through the end of 2020.OutlookNewell is on track to attain its transformation initiatives. In fact, market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement, along with cost-savings plans are expected to drive growth. Further, it continued to obtain cost synergies as anticipated, with an additional $86 million in the quarter.However, management trimmed its guidance for 2017. Newell now expects normalized earnings per share in the range of $2.80-$2.85, down from $2.95-$3.05, projected earlier. In September, the company had trimmed its earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressure due to low resins’ supply owing to impacts from the Hurricane Harvey.Further, the company expects net sales for 2017 in the band of $14.7-$14.8 billion, reflecting 11.3-11.8% improvement from prior-year quarter. Moreover, core sales growth is anticipated in a range of 1.5-2%. However, the company had earlier maintained its net sales and core sales guidance. Newell Brands anticipated net sales for 2017 in the range of $14.8-$15 billion, reflecting 11.5-13% growth.

Though rising material costs, sluggish sales in the U.K. and higher brand marketing expenses have raised concerns for sustaining the company’s performance, its acquisitions and innovation initiatives bode well for the company.

1105,STZ,"The consumer staples sector has been on a growth trajectory since the beginning of the year, on the back of improved economic scenario buoyed by rising consumer confidence, which is a key determinant of the economy’s health. Although consumer confidence declined marginally in September due to hurricane Harvey and Irma’s impact in Texas and Florida, we believe the economic conditions are quite favorable and indicate that the economy will continue to grow in the near term.The improving economy was also supported by labor market optimism and the recent gross domestic product (GDP) rate provided by the Commerce Department in consumer spending for the second quarter 2017. The commerce department stated that GDP rose 3.1% in the second quarter of 2017, the highest in two years. The recent tax cut proposal proposed by President Trump further instills confidence.However, we understand that the U.S. economy is not fully immune to global uncertainties, which could limit growth potential. But the encouraging data as well as the new tax reforms reflects that the economy is in good shape and the spending power is likely to increase going forward. This is also well reflected in the three key U.S. indexes, which have closed in positive territory so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 13.0%.

1109,STZ,"Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended April 2018) results on May 24, before the market opens.The company recorded a negative average earnings surprise of 2.03%, over the past four quarters. However, in first-quarter fiscal 2018, its adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHormel anticipates that elevated demand for its finest brands, such as Spam, Dinty Moore, Skippy, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, Natural Choice, black label bacon, Hormel Pepperoni and Justin's, will have bolstered revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company’s focus on making diligent marketing and advertising moves from the beginning of this calendar year is expected to have helped improve top-line results in the fiscal second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fiscal second-quarter net sales of the company’s Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods segments are currently pegged at $646 million and $1,189 million, higher than the respective tallies of $432 million and $1,027 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fiscal second-quarter operating profit of the company’s Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods segments are currently pegged at $108 million and $139 million, higher than the respective tallies of $77 million and $130 million reported in the yea-ago  quarter.Hormel Foods also believes reduced corporate tax rates will have aided in boosting free cash flow in the quarter under review.However, prevalent turkey market challenges are feared to have affected Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store segment’s revenues and profitability in the quarter to be reported. The turkey market has been facing an oversupply situation and is unlikely to witness price hike in the near term.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fiscal second-quarter net sales and operating profit of the company’s Jennie-O Turkey Store segment are currently pegged at $380 million and $52 million, lower than the respective tallies of $388 million and $64 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Moreover, high volatility in prices of major inputs like pork bellies and beef trim might have depressed Hormel Foods’ profitability in the fiscal second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hormel Foods will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Hormel Foods currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate are pegged at 45 cents per share.Zacks Rank: Hormel Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +7.14%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.United Natural Foods, Inc.

"
1111,STZ,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1112,STZ,"Boston Beer Co. Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) reported robust second-quarter 2017 earnings, wherein both top line and bottom line topped estimates. Moreover, both earnings and sales improved year over year. While this marked the company’s third straight earnings beat, sales returned to growth after three consecutive misses.Results benefited from top-line gains accompanied by gross margin improvement and lower operating costs owing to the company’s cost saving initiatives.Following the solid results, the stock jumped nearly 14.6% in the after-hours trading session on Jul 27. However, the shares of Boston Beer have declined 5.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 4.5%.Q2 HighlightsBoston Beer’s second-quarter earnings per share of $2.35 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 and improved 14.1% year over year. The outperformance stemmed from solid top-line growth and gross margin expansion partly offset by rise in advertising, promotional and selling expenses. Moreover, the company’s earnings included a tax benefit of 2 cents owing to the adoption of the new Accounting Standard ""Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting"" (""ASU 2016-09"") effective Jan 1, 2017.Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) QuoteNet revenue rose 1.3% year over year to $247.9 million. Excluding excise taxes, revenue increased 1.3% year over year to $264.7 million. Revenues, both including and excluding excise taxes, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $228.9 million. Core shipments remained flat at 1.1 million barrels, while depletions were down 3%.In the second quarter, depletion volumes were primarily impacted by persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, as well as fall in Coney Island. This was partly mitigated by growth in Twisted Tea, and Truly Spiked & Sparkling brands, alongside slight gains from the shift in its second- quarter end timing, particularly related to the fourth of July holiday.Though the company pointed to some improvement in the depletion trends from the beginning of the year, it stated that trends in the craft beer and cider categories continue to remain soft. Further, challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop persist, providing lot of drinking options.Further, the company continues to project soft depletion trends for 2017. Evidently, depletions for the year-to-date period through the 29 weeks ended Jul 22, 2017 are estimated to have declined nearly 7% from the comparable year-ago period in 2016.Costs & MarginsGross profit increased 5.6% year over year to $134 million, while gross margin expanded 230 basis points to 54.1% in the quarter. The improvement in gross margin can be attributed to higher revenue per barrel that resulted from better pricing and package mix, along with lower brewery processing cost per barrel due to its cost saving initiatives.Advertising, promotional and selling expenses rose 7.1% to $67.8 million due to higher salaries and benefits costs along with media spending, offset by fall in point-of-sale costs and lower freight to distributors. General and administrative expenses slumped 11% to $19.4 million due to a favorable stock-based compensation, consulting and legal costs.FinancialsAs of Jul 1, 2017, Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of $71.7 million and stockholders’ equity of $421.7 million.In first-half 2017, the company generated approximately $61 million of cash from operating activities, while it deployed nearly $16.7 million toward capital expenditure, primarily to be invested in breweries.Growth PlanManagement remains committed to a three-point growth plan. One, revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Further, it targets maintaining momentum for the Twisted Tea brand.Two, accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects, with savings directed for further brand development. In this regard, the company has adjusted the organization to the new volume environment, while at the same time retained its capability to innovate and return to growth. Evidently, the results of these initiatives reflected in gross margin improvements and lower operating expenses in the second quarter. Further, this has led the company to increase spending on brands during the quarter. On the back of this early success, the company reiterated the previously revealed target of improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019.Third, long-term innovation, with current focus maintaining the leadership of Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential.Moreover, Boston Beer remains focused on making investments to revive hard cider category and Angry Orchard brand, while maintaining category leadership. Though management is prepared for not so impressive bottom-line results in the short term, it remains on track to boost long-term profitability. Going forward, the company remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider category growth.GuidanceFor 2017, the company narrowed its previously stated earnings per share guidance range based on an uncertain volume outlook. The company now estimates adjusted earnings per share, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09, in the range of $5.00–$6.20 compared with the prior guidance of $4.20–$6.20. However, the company stated that the actual results may deviate significantly from current projections. Moreover, the company affirmed that 2017 will include 52 weeks as against 53 weeks in 2016.Other assumptions for earnings include depletions and shipments changes of -7% to +1%. The company anticipates revenues per barrel to increase 1–2%. Gross margin is anticipated to range from 51–52% due to increased cost savings. Investment in advertising, promotional and selling expenses are envisioned to increase in the range of $20–$30 million.Effective tax rate for 2017 is anticipated to nearly 37%, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09. However, the company revised capital expenditure guidance for the year to $35–$45 million, which will be directed toward investment in breweries. Earlier, the company had forecasted capital spending of $30–$50 million.Zacks RankBoston Beer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1113,STZ,"World’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), also known as AB InBev, missed the earnings estimate of analysts polled by Zacks for the sixth straight quarter, when it posted second-quarter 2017 results. The company’s bottom-line also declined year over year. Moreover, revenues also missed the estimate after beating the same in the trailing two quarters. Lower-than-expected earnings performance in the past few quarters has hurt the stock in the past one year. AB InBev’s stock has declined 8.2%, wider than the industry's marginal decline of 0.4%.The lower-than-expected bottom-line result can largely be attributed to persistent weakness in Brazil and negative impact of mark-to-market adjustment. In fact, the company stated that Brazilian economy is recuperating at a slow rate. Nonetheless, management remains positive about Brazil’s performance in the long run, as it anticipates recovering revenues in the country, this year itself.Q2 HighlightsNormalized earnings per share of 95 cents decreased 10.4% from $1.06 earned in the year-ago quarter and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14.Revenues for the quarter advanced 31.2% to $14,182 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,434 million. Further, the company registered organic revenue growth of 5.4% on the back of a 4.1% rise in revenues per hectoliter (hl) on a constant geographic basis. This improvement resulted from ongoing revenue management and premiumization in markets like Western Europe and China, along with robust performance by superior brands. Further, revenues per hl advanced 3.6% on a reported basis.Moreover, consolidated revenues for the company’s three global brands, namely Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, increased 8.9% in the reported quarter. Global brands revenues for the quarter comprised 16.6% growth at Corona, a 6.6% rise in Stella Artois and a 5.7% upside at Budweiser.Total volumes inched up 1%, including a 2.1% increase in the beer volumes. Gains from volume growth in South Africa, Mexico and Australia were offset by volume declines witnessed in Columbia, Brazil and the U.S.Cost of sales escalated 28.9% year over year to $5,444 million, while organically the same increased 3.2%. Organic cost of sales per hl rose 1.3% due to negative foreign currency translations, partly compensated by synergies, efficiencies and procurement savings. On a constant geographic basis, cost of sales per hl increased 2.2%.The company’s normalized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) surged 33.5% year over year to $5,354 million, while growing 11.8% on an organic basis – on the back of cost synergies and robust top-line growth. This was partially curbed by the increased cost of sales. EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) to 37.8%, while organically, the same increased 238 bps.Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA QuoteOther DevelopmentsManagement stated that it is well on track with SABMiller’s integration, and realized synergies worth $335 million in this regard, during the second quarter.Also on Apr 12, the company announced that it has concluded the sale of its indirect stake in Distell Group Limited to Public Investment Corporation (SOC) Limited in order to win the South African Competition Tribunal’s sanction for its deal with SABMiller.OutlookFollowing the quarter, management reiterated previously issued outlook for 2017. Owing to greater volatility in some of its core regions, AB InBev still projects revenues growth in 2017 to be backed by robust growth of global brands and its commercial plans, including revenues management initiatives.For 2017, AB InBev continues to expect cost of goods sold per hl, on a constant geographic basis, to increase in the low-single digits range, in spite of adverse currency movements and premium brand growth. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are estimated to remain flat, driven by savings in overhead costs that will be reinvested to boost strength of its brands. Management now expects normalized effective tax rate for 2017 in the range of 22–24%, compared with previous expectation of 24–26%.Additionally, AB InBev anticipates incurring nearly $3.7 billion as net capital expenditure for 2017.

1114,STZ,"The Boston Beer Co. Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) looks like a strong contender in the Alcohol Beverage space as its sturdy portfolio, robust surprise trend, strategic initiatives, and growth through acquisition hold promise. Further, the recent evolution in drinking trends makes this Boston, MA-based company’s shares a must buy.This largest craft brewer of the United States has seen its shares surge 16.6% quarter to date, outpacing the industry’s 12.1% upside. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 5% of the Zacks classified industries (14 out of 256). In fact, the company’s shares have substantially outperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector’s gain of 2.1%, which is placed at the top 38% of the Zacks classified sectors (10 out of 16). That said, let’s find out more about the factors aiding Boston Beer’s performance.Solid PortfolioBoston Beer commands a robust portfolio of globally recognized brands and is amongst the largest U.S. premium craft brewers producing beer, malt beverages, and cider products. In addition to selling alcoholic beverages in the United States, it distributes beverages in Canada, Europe, Israel, Caribbean, Pacific Rim, Mexico, and Central and South America, through a strong network of wholesale distributors. We expect the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation and brand development to boost operational performance and position in the market.Robust Surprise Trend & Outlook Boost EstimatesThe company reported solid second-quarter 2017, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates and improved year over year. While this marked third straight earnings beat, sales returned to growth after three consecutive misses. Results benefited from top-line gains accompanied by gross margin improvement and lower operating costs owing to the company’s cost saving initiatives.

One, the company is keen on the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Further, it targets maintaining momentum for the Twisted Tea brand.Two, the company has accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects, while ensuring that these savings are directed for further brand development. In this regard, the company has adjusted the organization to the new volume environment, while at the same time retained capability to innovate and return to growth.

Based on this early success, the company continues to anticipate improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019.The company’s third priority is long-term innovation, wherein its focus currently hovers around maintaining the leadership of its Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential.Gaining From Industry TrendsAlbeit the prohibitions on drinking, recent observations unveil that alcohol sales trends have been witnessing a change with a higher demand for flavored products and tequilas. In fact, the industry has recently seen the spirits segment gaining traction, accounting for nearly 36% of the total alcohol market.Consequently, the Alcoholic Beverages industry has gained 22.8% year to date, compared with the S&P 500 market’s growth of 11.5%.Bottom LineThough the company continues to face hurdles due to soft depletion trends stemming from weakness in Samuel Adams, soft craft beer and cider categories, its revival efforts and robust drinking trends position it for solid long-term profitability.

1115,STZ,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) recently launched Kleenex Reveal Countertop System under the Kimberly-Clark Professional (KCP) segment that partners with businesses to offer improved and exceptional hygiene products. The new countertop system provides superior quality hand towels and requires fewer refills owing to its greater inbuilt capacity. The system aids maintaining a clean restroom area by providing hand towels at the sink itself, thereby reducing water spillage on the countertop and the floor.In addition to Kleenex, other brands in this category include Scott, Kimtech, WypAll and Jackson Safety. The company’s products are one of the most preferred amongst its peers in the United States, when it comes to restroom cleanliness and consumer health.Product Innovation to Boost SalesThe company has been involved in regular innovations and product launches to improve its market share. Of late, the company has been focusing on upgrading personal care portfolio, especially feminine hygiene and diaper products. Innovations related to the Huggies brand has been initiated in several regions such as in Russia and China.Unfavorable Industry Conditions Weigh on Performance  Despite efforts to improve market share, Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing decelerated organic sales growth from the developing markets for a while now. The sluggish growth can be attributed to unfavorable economic environment laden with increased competition and promotional activities. Sales in Latin America, especially in Brazil and Argentina have been displaying such a trend. Though the company has strong long-term growth prospects in these markets, it expects only modest improvement in the second half of 2017. Further, the company’s organic sales in the North American region have been soft due to the effects of competition and less promotional shipments.Competition has particularly hurt the company’s diaper segment volumes. It is observed that more parent shoppers are shifting away from Huggies and buying either less expensive or premium diaper offerings. Additionally, Kimberly-Clark’s performance is also plagued with higher input cost owing to the ongoing inflationary trend.Amid such headwinds lurking in the industry, it would be quite a challenging task for Kimberly-Clark to pull off positive yields from its ongoing innovation and product launch efforts. Moreover, shares of the company have also been losing investor confidence and have decreased 9.7% over the past six months, almost in line with the industry’s decline of 9.3%. The Consumer Staples sector, to which it belongs, increased 5% in the same time frame. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Done With Kimberly-Clark?

1117,STZ,"Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report) recently announced interim results for the half yearly period ended Jul 31, 2017. Pre-exceptional earnings per share for the first half of fiscal 2018 grew 9.4% (in local currency) year over year. The upside was backed by increased organic operating profit and reduced finance costs.  While Diageo’s stock didn’t react much to the announcement, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 33.2% in a year, faring even better than the industry’s 26.1% surge. Clearly, this alcohol behemoth is riding on its focus on innovations, achieving growth through buyouts and penetration in emerging markets.1H18 HighlightsOn a reported basis, net sales as well as operating profits moved up 1.7% and 6.1%, respectively, courtesy of organic growth. However, this was somewhat countered by unfavorable currency fluctuations.Diageo PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Diageo PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Diageo PLC Quote Broad-based organic sales increased 4.2%, backed by improved volumes and favorable price/mis. Also, all regions witnessed organic sales growth, driven by Diageo’s strong brand portfolio and solid reach. Further, organic volumes went up 1.8%.Gross margin expanded nearly 200 basis points during the first half, as impacts from GST and inflation were more than offset by favorable mix, greater productivity and efforts like better pricing and lowering input costs to reduce the adverse impact of GST.Additionally, organic operating profit advanced 6.7%, thanks to benefits from the company’s productivity program, partly negated by greater marketing investments. Organic margins rose 81 basis points.Segment DetailsOrganic sales grew 2% in North America due to higher sales at U.S. Spirits which in turn was fueled by strength across all categories other than Vodka.  Categorically, results were led by Don Julio in the Tequila category; North American whiskey; Captain Morgan in the Rum category and Baileys. Operating profit (organic) rose 3%.In Europe, Russia and Turkey, organic sales increased 4% on greater volumes. Also, improved pricing in Turkey aided price mix, while it was partly offset by unfavorable mix from Gordon’s and Baileys in Europe. Organic operating profit in the region improved 12%.Organic sales in Africa climbed 2%, driven by strong performance in Nigeria, which was partly hampered by softness in Africa Regional Markets and South Africa.     Also, price/mix remained negative due to heightened competition in South Africa, accelerated growth in Mainstream Spirits across East Africa and Nigeria. This was somewhat compensated by favorable pricing in Nigeria. In Africa, operating profit (organic) fell 3%Organic sales in the Latin America and Caribbean region ascended 7% backed by strong growth in Mexico and PUB. Results gained from strength across primary scotch brands, which delivered higher sales in Mexico, PUB and Colombia. However, price mix remained negative.

1122,STZ,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire Chesapeake Bay Candle in a $75-million deal. Subject to working capital adjustments and certain closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company plans to fund the acquisition mainly using its cash in hand.Chesapeake Bay Candle, being one of the market leaders in manufacturing and marketing of premium candles, will be a valuable addition to Newell’s portfolio. In order to strengthen candle business, Newell had also acquired WoodWick fragranced candles business during the first quarter of 2017. Contributions from the WoodWick acquisition had favorably impacted sales during the second quarter.These acquisitions are in line with the company’s Growth Game Plan, whereby it makes prudent investments in areas with high growth potential. On similar grounds, the company also acquired the Sistema food storage business during the first quarter, which resulted in top-line expansion.On Track with Growth Efforts In addition to strategic acquisitions, Newell is also devoted toward simplifying its operating structure. Accordingly, during the first quarter it undertook the divestiture of four of its businesses namely — tools, consumer storage totes, fire building and fire starting, and the rope and chain business.Further, the company has an agreement in place to divest Teutonia, its central European baby gear business. It is on track with its plan of exiting product lines with annual sales of $200-$300 million across its combined business with Jarden, over the next two to three years. Newell’s Project Renewal Program is also on schedule, and the company expects annual cost savings from this program to approach $700 million by 2017 end or 2018 beginning.Guidance Tweaked on Impacts of Hurricane Harvey Newell recently trimmed earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressures due to lower resins supply. The decline in supply was caused by the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Normalized earnings are now envisioned in the band of $2.95 to $3.05 per share versus the previous expectation of $3.00 to $3.20. However, net sales and core sales guidance remain intact.The effects of Harvey have significantly disrupted huge parts of the United States’ resin manufacturing supply chain, significantly raising operating costs. Further, these resin supply issues and increased inflation is likely to persist through the rest of 2017 and in 2018. The impact of such challenges is visible on the company’s share price performance. Newell’s shares have gone down 11.8% in the past one month, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.1%Despite the headwinds concerning resin supply, Newell is expected to continue delivering growth on the back of savings and acquisition related initiatives. Management also expects to boost performance in the second half backed by new distribution gains, a strong pipeline of innovations and e-Commerce strength.Currently, Newell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).                               Looking for More?

Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) recently projected that the total U.S. beer market will decline by 0.7% in 2017, and the firm downgraded Boston Beer Company (SAM  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) stock accordingly.However, alcohol sales aren’t stopping outright, they are shifting, and the companies we will look at today are ready to gain based on more niche drinking trends.Overall, beer lost 10% of its market share to wine and spirits between 2006 and 2016. Spirits made up 35.9% of the industry in 2016, while wine grabbed 17.1%, according to Fortune. Tequila consumption jumped by 7.4%, while bourbon climbed 6.4% last year. Vodka, gin, scotch, and wine also all grew.And beer still accounts for 47% of the market, with the craft beer and Mexican imports segments experiencing growth in 2016.So now let’s take a look at a few companies with strong Zacks Ranks and the ability to profit from these new trends.Heineken N.V. (HEINY  -  Free Report) Heineken N.V. is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Netherlands-based brewing giant has a market cap of $59 billion and has already experienced a strong first half of the year.Heineken’s organic revenues grew by 5.7% in the first half of 2017. The company’s operating profit jumped 11.8% to $2.12 billion, which beat Wall Street expectations. Heineken’s consolidated beer volume rose 2.6%, while the Heineken brand itself saw a 3.9% increase in volume.The Dutch power brews Europe's top-selling lager, as well as others, including Amstel, Sol, Tecate, and Red Stripe. Heineken sold over 8.5 million barrels in the U.S., which is more than double what Boston Beer sold.Heineken also recently made a major investment in up and coming California-based Lagunitas Brewing Co., as well as other craft beer makers. The company’s stock price currently sits less than a dollar bellow its all-time high of $52.44 a share, and with a better-than-industry average forward PE of 22.36, Heineken may still be undervalued among its beer-making peers.Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report)Diageo plc is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a massive $83 billion market cap. The multinational spirits company has experienced a strong 2017.The company, which owns Johnnie Walker, J&B, Gordon's, Baileys, Guinness and more, has seen its stock price soar from $109.61 a share at the end of last August to rest just below its all-time high of $134.49 a share today. Over the last month, shares have hit multiple new 52-week highs.Over the last thirty days, we’ve seen one analyst increase their earnings estimate for this year and next year. The 2017 figure was revised from $5.95 a share to $6.14 a share, while full-year 2018 estimates jumped to $6.71 per share from $6.41 per share.The company also owns Smirnoff, Cîroc, Ketel One, Don Julio, and Tanqueray, which are all brands that could be poised to grow further as the spirit explosion continues in the U.S.Pernod Ricard SA (PDRDY  -  Free Report)Pernod Ricard SA is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and the French-based liquor and spirits power is coming off a solid first half of the year.The company has a forward PE ratio of 20.26, which is better than the industry average. Also, the company’s share price has increased by more than 19% over the past year, making it one of the hotter stocks in this space. Pernod Ricard also pays its shareholders a respectable 1.06% dividend, and company holds a price to cash flow ratio of 20.75.Pernod Ricard owns Havana Club, Ballantine's, Malibu, The Glenlivet, Chivas Regal, Jameson and Absolut Vodka, as well as multiple wine brands, which means it is also positioned to cash in on America’s cocktail boom.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1124,STZ,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term.

1125,STZ,"Alcohol is hardly ever in bad taste, especially American whiskey’s popularity among the spirit enthusiasts continues unabated. This is evident from the U.S. Alcohol market’s expansion spree owing to rising demand and improving consumer spending. Among the host of diverse spirts, craft beer seems to be hogging the limelight at the moment, courtesy of its popular fan base and convenient size production. Per BMI Research, global spirits sales are expected to increase by 4.3% in 2018.In view of these above-mentioned tailwinds, the Beverages-Alcohol industry ranks among the top 45% (116 of 256) of all Zacks industries.The first-quarter 2018 earnings season has seen releases from nearly 87 S&P 500 members as of Apr 20. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the scenario looks quite compelling, with 82.8% of the members delivering positive earnings surprises and 67.8% trumping top-line expectations. In fact, the proportion of companies pulling off earnings and revenue beats is a stellar 62.1%.The momentum is likely to continue as total earnings for the S&P 500 index are still anticipated to increase 18.3% from the year-ago period on 7.7% growth in revenues. As the earnings season gets into groove, we expect the scenario to become much more transparent.Why the Consumer Staples Sector?Alcohol stocks form part of Consumer Staples sector. We believe the sector is well poised to grow on a buoyant U.S. economy driven by rising consumer confidence, improving consumer spending and an accelerating labor market. In fact, Consumer Staples sector carries a Zacks Rank #8, placing it at the top 50% among 16 Zacks sectors.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total first-quarter earnings for the sector are likely to grow 6.2% year over year with revenues expected to increase 2.8%. In fact, margins are also estimated to edge up 0.4% year over year.Notably, Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), the world’s leading wine company has already released its earnings numbers on Mar 29. The company delivered better-than-expected quarterly results, witnessing margin expansions, significant market share gains, strong free cash flow and solid execution. As a result, it issued an upbeat outlook for fiscal 2019.Furthermore, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.All said, let’s take a look at the performance of a few alcohol stocks ahead of their earnings releases.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) is slated to report its first-quarter 2018 results tomorrow. Although the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 10.6% last quarter, it pulled off a positive surprise in each of the trailing three quarters. Per the Zacks model, Boston Beer is unlikely to deliver earnings beat this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of +35.65 and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which makes our surprise prediction difficult.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Though the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for the quarter remained stable in the last 30 days, it portrays a decline of more than 15% year over year. Also, it has been witnessing lower shipment volumes and depletions due to challenges in Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands along with soft hard cider category. However, management remains confident about its growth plan focused on cost-saving initiatives, long-term innovation and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands. Moreover, Boston Beer’s brand-building efforts and initiatives to add new products bode well for the company’s top-line growth.Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. Though the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.7% last quarter, it recorded an average miss of 13.2% in the trailing four quarters. Per the Zacks model, the trend is likely to continue as Molson Coors’ Earnings ESP of -0.21% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate that it is unlikely to beat earnings. Also, the consensus estimate of 80 cents moved south by a penny in the last seven days but depicts year-over-year growth of 5.3%. Notably, the company has been gaining from its focus on above-premium brands, which form nearly 20% of its total annual brand volumes. Also, management is making efforts to gain share in the U.S. premium light segment through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands.Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. The company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history with a beat in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average of 275.9%. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of earnings beat, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents for the quarter remained stable in the last 30 days and reflects a substantial improvement from a loss of 9 cents incurred in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, management remains optimistic on continuing growth momentum, strategic local brands and partnerships as well as bolstering revenue management and operational improvements. In fact, Kona’s potential of delivering robust growth in 2017 is also impressive.Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), alias AB InBev, is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 9. Although the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 6.1% last quarter, it lagged earnings estimates in the preceding seven quarters. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of EPS. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Also, the consensus mark shows an improvement of 6.8% from the year-ago quarter despite the downtrend in the estimate in the last seven days. While AB InBev's fourth-quarter 2017 results marked a return to the positive earnings trajectory, it envisions a soft first quarter due to difficult comparisons, and phasing of marketing and sales initiatives. Nevertheless, robust brand portfolio and solid geographical reach remain major strengths. It also anticipates delivering strong top-line growth in 2018 backed by impressive brands performance and robust commercial plans.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

However, some investors choose such stocks for their attractive return potential.How to Add Sin Stocks to Your Portfolio?Investors have multiple ways to gain exposure to the space. Depending on their preference, investors can choose pure play alcohol stocks, tobacco, marijuana stocks or form a diversified portfolio of the entire space. However, owing to high volatility in this space and stringent regulations, it is advisable to go the ETF way to gain exposure to the sector.With experienced managers handling money, investors will be in a good spot when the sector performs well. When AdvisorShares Vice ETF was launched last September, the fund’s portfolio manager Dan Ahrens said, “We’re not making any kind of moral judgment or statement about what people want to consume with this focus; there’s a strong economic argument for looking at these sectors.""Another positive for this segment’s investors is that these products are somewhat staples. Even when the economy is not performing well, people drink and smoke. As a result, even if the sector takes a beating at the time of a recession, it will outperform other segments of the markets, owing to its demand interdependency.The alcohol industry has been looking up, with growth surpassing expectations.

1127,STZ,"Whiskey has always held a special place in the American culture and history. Barring a few hiccups, it has always been in vogue with spirit enthusiasts and casual drinkers all over the world. Cheerfully the tradition continues, as evidenced from the strength in the U.S. Alcohol market that has been on an expansion spree due to the rising demand and improving consumer spending. In fact, Americans are availing jobs in the craft-booze industry, consequently aiding stability in the labor market. Among the host of American spirts, craft beer seems to be the cynosure of all eyes at the moment with its fervent fan base and convenient size production. Per BMI Research, global spirits sales are expected to increase by 4.3% in 2018.Notably, the Beverages-Alcohol industry lies at the top 38% (96 of 256) of all Zacks industries.With that said, here are two alcohol stocks that are scoring high on the growing spirits and industry trends. The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) hit 52-week high on Apr 17 driven by their robust strategies and stellar past performance.Let’s explore the stocks individually.Three-Point Growth Plan Aiding SAMShares of Boston Beer scaled a 52-week high of $223.50 yesterday, closing the session lower at $222.05. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surged a whopping 57.4% in a year, cruising well ahead of its industry’s 12% upside. Management remains committed to the three-point growth plan focused on the revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives and long-term innovation. Additionally, the leading craft brewer in the United States is making strides to address challenges through improved cost structure and re-investing these savings for brand development.Though depletions continued to be soft in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company’s quarterly depletion trends have been improving since the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, we are encouraged by a strong start in 2018. Notably, depletions for the year-to-date period through the six-week period ended Feb 10, 2018, are estimated to have grown nearly 6% from the comparable year-ago period. For 2018, depletions and shipments are likely to range from flat to up 6%. Also, Boston Beer remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider categories.A look upon the company’s earnings surprise history shows that it has outpaced estimates in four of the trailing five quarters. It delivered an impressive average earnings beat of 48.9% in the last four quarters.Strength in Beer Business Driving STZShares of Constellation Brands also touched a 52-week high of $233.19 yesterday, though it closed a tad lower at $231.40. In a year’s time, the Zacks Rank #3 stock advanced 34.6% outperforming its industry’s growth of 12%. Constant brand-building efforts, acquisitions and strength in its beer business have been the key growth drivers for the world’s leading wine company. Armed with a robust brand portfolio, Constellation Brands has a record of 18 straight quarters of year-over-year earnings growth with 13 consecutive positive surprises.While softness in wine & spirits business linger, the company remains focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. In the beer segment, the company’s expansion plans are anchored by the acquisition of the Funky Buddha Brewery, a leading craft brewery in Florida; the introduction of Fathom IPA by Ballast Point Brewery; the Obregon Brewery acquisition, which will bolster its high-end Mexican beer portfolio and more.Wrapping UpWe expect these stocks to continue soaring high, creating new records given their solid strategic actions, expansion in the craft beer space and impressive long-term earnings growth rates. Boston Beer boasts an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 9.5%, while that of Constellation Brands is 18.4%.Other stocks that hit a 52-week high on Apr 17 are Burlington Stores, Inc.

1128,STZ,"Fears of an imminent U.S.-China trade war have shaken up a number of sectors. The beer industry too hasn’t been spared. President Donald Trump’s imposition of a 10% tariff on imported aluminum from China is likely to have a devastating effect on the U.S. beer industry. Given that most of the beer produced in the United States today is packaged in cans, aluminum tariffs will only make things difficult for the country’s beer industry.The tariffs certainly aren’t a good sign at a time when the U.S. beer industry is already witnessing a decline in domestic beer sales due to the changing preferences of consumers. Amid all these developments, the only good news is that U.S. craft beer exports rose in 2017.And, yes, most of the exports were to Canada, the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), the U.K. and Western Europe. That said, the beer industry stands a critical juncture, where higher exports are being cheered but lower domestic sales and aluminum tariffs are denting the confidence of brewers. Let’s look at each of the good, the bad and the ugly sides of the U.S. beer industry in this tumultuous time.The Good: Craft Beer Export Rise  International distribution of craft beer continued to increase in 2017, with U.S. export volumes rising 3.6% to $125.4 million, according to The Brewers Association (BA). Canada remains the biggest market for craft beer export, accounting for 51.3% of total exports. The Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) also witnessed robust growth of 7.4%.The U.K., Sweden, Korea, Australia are the second, third, fourth and fifth biggest markets, accounting for 10.5%, 6.7%, 4.6% and 3.8% exports, respectively. The U.K. market grew 7.1%, accounting for 10.5% of beer exports compared with 10.1% in 2016. The Western Europe market grew 1.3%. However, despite 2017 setting a record, export growth slowed for the third consecutive year. U.S. craft beer exports increased 37%, 16% and 4.4% in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.Now, coming to the country that is breathing fire, China accounts for a meager 2.5% of U.S. craft beer export. Given this scenario, U.S. craft beer exporters might not really worry if China concocts any tariff on beer. Canada, U.K. Sweden, France and Australia are still the biggest consumers of  Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report), Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands Inc (STZ  -  Free Report) and Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report), who export their beer in bulk.Moreover, the Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) is being seen as lucrative market with its taste for craft beer developing over the last few years. Naturally, beer exporters will be looking to capture this market. Shares of Craft Brew Alliance, Constellation Brands, Diageo and Anheuser-Busch have increased 52.7%, 33.9%, 22.5% and 1%, respectively, in the last year.The Bad: Domestic Beer Sales DeclineWhile craft beer export is soaring, beer sales are struggling at home. Per Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau statistics published in a report by the Beer Institute (BI), the U.S. beer industry shipped 3.8 million fewer barrels in 2017 than 2016, reflecting a decline of 2.2%. According to Michael Uhrich, BI chief economist, this is “the largest percentage decrease in annual domestic beer shipment volume since 1954.” The question is, are Americans consuming less beer? Well, beer sales volume fell 1% in the United States in 2017.One of the primary reasons cited by analysts for this is that there is an increasing shift toward distilled spirits and wines, a category headwind. According to Vivien Azer, managing director and senior research analyst, Cowen and Co., consumers aged 21-34 were eight percentage points less likely to prefer beer than their 35-to-44-year-old counterparts. However, amid this decline in domestic sales, preference for craft beer to draught beer has increased. This is perhaps because consumers are going for authenticity with a good brand story and increased flavor selection. The only good sign is that 2018 started on a good note for the beer industry, with a 3% sales increase through the first four weeks, according to retail data provider IRI Worldwide. The Ugly: Aluminum Tariffs to Hurt Beer IndustryAmericans prefer their beer in cans. More than 50% of the beer produced in the United States is packaged in cans. And with Trump imposing 10% tariff on imported aluminum from China, the situation certainly looks grim. According to the BI, 10% aluminum tariff would amount to $347,700,000 on beverages sold in cans. Additionally, this might also result in a loss of 20,000 jobs.At the end of 2016, there were more than 53,000 breweries across the United States selling around 190 million barrels of beer. Of these, almost 60% of the beer is sold in aluminum packaging. United States currently imports around 52% of the aluminum used for manufacturing.Given this scenario, large breweries like Molson Coors, Anheuser-Busch, Craft Brew Alliance, Constellation Brands will have to spend more on producing aluminum beer cans. Moreover, foreign brands like Heineken NV (HEINY  -  Free Report) and Carlsberg AS (CABGY  -  Free Report) that have manufacturing units in the United States will have to bear the brunt of the 10% aluminum tariff. Heineken has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In ConclusionUndoubtedly, the U.S. beer industry is walking on a tight rope. Declining domestic beer sales coupled with the imposition of a 10% duty on imported aluminum has heightened their worries. High production cost of beer will result in either the companies losing revenues or the price burden being passed on to consumers. The second certainly doesn’t look a wise option given the dwindling domestic beer sales figure.The only bright spot is that Americans are very good at recycling and beer cans produced in the country today contain approximately 70% recycled aluminum. Moreover, a rise in craft beer exports certainly will give a boost to the confidence of brewers, which will try to focus on more lucrative markets. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1129,STZ,"The re-emergence of trade war fears has sent tremors across the Wall Street. This is because China has targeted about $3 billion in American exports in retaliation against Donald Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminum import (read: Trump Tariffs Put These Sector ETFs & Stocks in Focus).The second-largest country has slapped a duty on 128 American food products effective Apr 2. Of these, 120 products, including dried fruits, sparkling wine and stainless steel pipes, saw a new tariff of 15% while eight commodities, including pork products and aluminum scrap, saw a 25% tax hike. The new tariffs went into effect on Apr 2.The move would hurt several American food producers and exporters. In particular, farmers and the pork industry have been on the forefront of damage, as American farmers shipped nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. China is the third-largest consumer of U.S. pork and bought about $1.1 billion worth of pork products from the United States last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.The tariff would also severely impact the apple and wine industry. Washington growers exported nearly 1.8 million 40-pound boxes of apples to mainland China last year and another million to Hong Kong, according to data from the Washington State Tree Fruit Association. Meanwhile, China is one of the fastest growing wine markets in the world and is the sixth-biggest wine importer following France, Australia, Chile, Spain and Italy. U.S. wine exports to greater China (including the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong) were up 10% last year to $197 million. Notably, the value of U.S. wine exports (97% from California) to China has increased 450% in the past decade (read: China Had a Strong Start in 2018: ETFs to Buy).Per money.cnn.com, China makes up for 6% of American fruit exports, 5% of wine exports, 3% of nuts exports and 40% of all ginseng exports.Given this, we have highlighted several ETFs and stocks that are likely to be hit hard and are in focus in the weeks ahead:Tyson Foods Inc.

1130,STZ,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has approved an increase of 8.2% in its quarterly dividend, amounting 66 cents per share as compared with the previous rate of 61 cents. The newly hiked dividend is payable on Oct 10, 2017, to shareholders of record  on Sep 15.The company’s current annualized rate of dividend is $2.64 per common share, compared with $2.44 previously. Since Philip Morris International's (PM  -  Free Report) spin off in 2009, Altria has increased its dividend every year by 8% in 2016 and 8.7% in 2015. Notably, the company has raised its dividend 51 times in the last 48 years. It maintains a dividend payout ratio target of around 80% of its adjusted earnings per share, which is among the highest in its peer group.Altria has been consistently returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In the second quarter of 2017, the company paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends and nearly $2.4 billion in the first half of 2017. During the second quarter, Altria also repurchased 14.4 million shares under its existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.05 billion. As of Jun 30, Altria had approximately $335 million remaining in the share repurchase program. In July, Altria’s board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the program. Altria expects to complete the expanded $4-billion share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.Further, the takeover of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report) in October 2016 helped Altria, SABMiller’s biggest investor. Altria received a 9.6% ownership of AB InBev, and approximately $5.3 billion in pre-tax cash per the terms of the acquisition, which the company used to reinvest in its core businesses or/and return value to shareholders.Industry Headwinds Effecting Stock Price Performance Notably, the tobacco maker has been returning value to its shareholders despite industry-wide headwinds. The tobacco stocks have been primarily hurt by the declining use of tobacco since past many quarters. Strict anti-smoking regulations by governments, globally, in the form of restrictions on packaging and high excise duties are also affecting the stock. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume. The recent FDA proposal to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels has also added to the company’s woes.Most recently on Jul 28, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels.A look into Altria’s price performance over the past six months, projects that the company’s shares have decreased 14.7%, wider than the industry’s decline of 5.2%. The broader Consumer Staples sector depicted a growth of 3.6% in the said time frame.Proactive Measures to Remain Afloat Despite unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes, Altria has been able to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes.Additionally, Altria has promptly responded to the general shift among consumers toward low-risk, smokeless tobacco products due to serious health hazards of smoking cigarettes. Altria offers several reduced risk tobacco products that helped it to maintain its market share. Altria collaborated with Okono A/S and developed innovative, non-combustible nicotine-containing products for adult smokers. Further, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris, under which the latter markets its MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally, is boosting the company’s business prospects. Altria also distributes two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States, which is also positive factor in terms of business growth.Such dedicated efforts are expected to improve the company’s stock performance, going ahead. Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a long-term growth rate of 7.1%.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

1131,STZ,"After posting back-to-back misses in the last two quarters, Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise in third-quarter 2017, which also marked its third straight quarter of year-over-year bottom-line growth. However, top line fell year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Nonetheless, the company kept its 2017 earnings guidance intact.Quarter in detailAdjusted earnings of 90 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. Also, earnings increased 9.8% year over year, on the back of higher operating income in the smokeable and smokeless segments and lower outstanding shares. This was somewhat offset by reduced equity earnings from the company’s investment in beer.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteHowever, net revenues fell 2.5% to $6,729 million in the quarter, owing to soft net revenues in the smokeable products segments. Revenues net of excise taxes slipped 1.3% year over year to $5,123 million. This also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,196 million.In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume and retail share. MarkTen’s third-quarter national retail market share was approximately 13.5% in mainstream retail channels. Further, it forms nearly 65% of e-vapor volumes in those channels.However, if we look into Altria’s stock performance over a year, we note that the stock has moved up just 3.9%, in comparison to the industry’s growth of 11.4%.We believe declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes have been weighing on the stock. Strict Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on cigarette packaging dissuade customers from smoking. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume. Evidently, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the last nine quarters, including this quarter.Segment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Revenues net of excise taxes dipped 1.5% year over year to $4,410 million, due to soft volumes that was somewhat compensated by better pricing. Cigarette shipment volumes fell 6.2% year over year, stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes, unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share. On the other hand, shipment volumes for cigars rose 6.6% in the quarter. Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.5%, representing a 0.6 percentage point slip.Adjusted operating companies income (OCI) increased 7.7% to $2,300 million, while adjusted OCI margins jumped 4.5 percentage points to 52.2%.Smokeless Products: Revenues net of excise taxes advanced 4.5% to $515 million in the quarter. This was driven by better pricing and reduced promotions, partly countered by unfavorable mix and soft volumes. Shipment volumes fell 1.8% to 212.6 million units, where Copenhagen and Skoal shipment volumes dropped 2% and others increased 1.2% in the quarter. Total smokeless products retail share grew 1.1 percentage points to 53.8% in the quarter.Adjusted OCI surged 15.7% to $362 million and margins expanded 6.8 percentage points to 70.3%.Wine: The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, remained nearly flat year over year at $175 million. Results here were impacted by trade inventory reductions, heightened competition and sluggish growth of premium wine. Wine shipment volume was also almost flat at 2.2 million units.Adjusted OCI declined 5.3% to $36 million, mainly accountable to soft volumes and escalated expenses. OCI margin decreased 1 percentage point to 20.6%.Financial UpdatesIn August 2017, Altria announced an 8.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 66 cents per share. During the third quarter, Altria paid dividends worth $1.2 billion and intends to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line. Further, the company repurchased 11.1 million shares under its existing share repurchase program for approximately $759 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Altria had approximately $576 million remaining under its share repurchase program of $4 billion. Altria expects to complete the program by the end of second-quarter 2018.Consolidation of Manufacturing FacilitiesIn October 2016, Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost.OutlookThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reaffirmed earnings guidance for full-year 2017 and expects adjusted earnings in a range of $3.26-$3.32, up 7.5% to 9.5% compared with adjusted earnings of $3.03 in 2016. Altria expects 2017 full-year effective tax rate on operations to be roughly 35.5%.Don’t Miss These Consumer Staples StocksOllie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.

1132,STZ,"World’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV’s (BUD  -  Free Report), alias AB InBev, dismal earnings trend persisted in third-quarter 2017 as the bottom line lagged estimates for the seventh straight quarter.  Moreover, revenues missed estimate for the second consecutive quarter.Despite the dismal surprise history, AB InBev’s stock has improved 15.3% year to date. However, it has lagged the industry's growth of 23.6%.Q3 HighlightsNormalized earnings per share of $1.31 rose 57.8% from 83 cents earned in the year-ago quarter on the back of higher profits. However, earnings fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50.Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA QuoteRevenues advanced 32.7% to $14,740 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,398 million. Further, the company registered organic revenue growth of 3.6% on the back of a 5.4% rise in revenues per hectoliter (hl) on a constant geographic basis. This improvement resulted from ongoing revenue management and premiumization initiatives that bolstered the performance of its global brands, particularly outside their home markets. Further, revenues per hl advanced 5% on a reported basis.Consolidated revenues for the company’s three global brands, namely Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, increased 1.6% in the reported quarter. Global brands revenues for the quarter comprised 9.6% growth at Corona and 0.9% rise in Stella Artois, partially offset by 2.2% decline at Budweiser. Growth at Corona can be attributed to 11.2% revenue growth outside Mexico, including strength in China, Colombia and Ecuador. Meanwhile, revenue growth at Stella Artois was driven by persistent strength in Argentina and Brazil. While Budweiser revenues declined year over year, it included a 4.4% growth outside the United States, led by Brazil, South Korea and Chile.Total volumes dipped 1.2%, including a 1.5% fall in the beer volumes. Gains from volume growth in Mexico, Argentina, and Africa were more than offset by lower shipment volumes in the United States due to unfavorable weather conditions, alongside a decline in Brazil.Cost of sales escalated 26.2% year over year to $5,546 million, while organically the same declined 1.9%. Organic cost of sales per hl fell 0.5% due to better synergies and favorable emerging market exchange rates. On a constant geographic basis, cost of sales per hl remained flat.The company’s normalized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) surged 42.2% year over year to $5,733 million, while growing 13.8% on an organic basis. This was driven by persistent synergy capture and robust top-line growth. EBITDA margin expanded 290 basis points (bps) to 31.8%, while organically, the same increased 382 bps.Other DevelopmentsOn Oct 4, the company successfully concluded the transaction to sell its 54.5% equity stake  Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (Pty) Ltd (“CCBA”) to the soft-drinks giant The Coca-Cola Company (KO) for $3.15 billion. This transaction forms a part of the asset sale agreements signed for fulfilling the antitrust commitments under the SABMiller acquisition.Agreed upon in December 2016, the deal includes the sale of CCBA’s operations in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Ghana, Mayotte and Comoros. Formed in 2016, CCBA is the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Africa. It was founded by combining the African non-alcohol ready-to-drink bottling interests of SABMiller plc, The Coca-Cola Company and Gutsche Family Investments.Additionally, AB InBev and Coca-Cola are in the process of finalizing a deal for to sell AB InBev’s interest in bottling businesses in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras, to the latter. These transactions are dependent upon the receiving necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals.OutlookFollowing the quarter, management reiterated previously issued outlook for 2017. As the company remains well on track with the SABMiller integration, it raised the synergy and cost savings guidance by $400 million to $3.2 billion. These synergies are expected to be realized in four years from the close of the acquisition (or by October 2020).Owing to greater volatility in some of its core regions, AB InBev still projects revenue growth in 2017 to be backed by robust growth of global brands and strong commercial plans, including revenues management initiatives.For 2017, AB InBev continues to anticipate cost of goods sold per hl, on a constant geographic basis, to increase in the low-single digits range, in spite of adverse currency movements and premium brands growth. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are estimated to remain flat, driven by savings in overhead costs that will be reinvested to boost strength of its brands. Management expects normalized effective tax rate for 2017 in the range of 22-24%.Additionally, AB InBev anticipates incurring nearly $3.7 billion as net capital expenditure for 2017. Also, the company expects dividend growth to be modest in future.AB InBev currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3 Hot Picks in the Beverage – Alcohol SpaceSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Constellation Brands Inc.

1133,STZ,"Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings, up 13% year over year to 77 cents per share.

Shipments in Mexico increased in mid-single digit, while shipments in Brazil are up significantly. Sales volume in the Asia-Pacific region rose 5% primarily due to elevated beer shipments in Australia. In Europe, sales volumes inched up 1% chiefly due to favorable product mix as shipments were flat.

The initial expansion plans have been progressing as scheduled, with three furnaces currently in operation. The fourth furnace is expected to be operational in the first half of 2018.To meet the rising demand from Constellation Brands’ adjacent brewery, the newly-expanded relationship provides for the addition of a fifth furnace, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2019. This capacity expansion, which is estimated to cost approximately $140 million, will be financed by equal contributions from both partners. Furthermore, the term of the JV agreement was extended for 10 additional years to 2034.GuidanceThe company trimmed its earnings per share guidance for 2017 to the range of $2.60-$2.65, from the prior band of $2.55-$2.65.

1134,STZ,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) made a comeback in the third quarter of 2017, outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6%. On the contrary, net sales marginally fell short of the consensus mark but grew year over year in the quarter under review.Nevertheless, management reiterated its full-year view. As a result, not much movement was noticed in the stock during pre-market trading hours, in spite of an earnings beat. However, we note that the stock has declined 0.6% on a year-to-date basis, marginally better than the industry’s decline of 1.7%.The quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 and increased 5% year over year. The quarterly results benefited from improved volumes, cost savings and reduced marketing, research and general spending. However, lower net selling prices and input cost inflation had negatively impacted earnings during the quarter.Quarter in DetailKimberly-Clark reported sales of $4.64 billion in the third quarter. Sales marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.67 billion but depicted a growth of 1% from the prior-year quarter. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by currency rates changes of 1% and marginal growth in organic sales.Organic sales grew marginally, as volumes inched up more than 1%, whereas net selling prices declined 1%. While organic sales remained even in North American consumer products, the same increased 3% in the emerging market regions. Organic sales declined 3% in the developed markets.Operating profit in the quarter increased 2.2% to $854 million. It was favorably impacted by volume growth, reduced marketing, research and general spending and cost savings of $125 million from the FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere) program. These were partially offset by higher input costs of approximately $115 million, arising out of higher costs of pulp and other raw materials as well as lower net selling prices.Segment DetailsPersonal Care Products: The segment includes products like disposable diapers, training/ youth/swim pants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products.Segment sales of $2.3 billion went down 1% during the quarter, owing to a 1% decline in both net selling prices and volumes.

1136,STZ,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), commonly known as AB InBev has been doing well, backed by its impressive brand portfolio, solid geographical reach and focus on business expansion. Though the company is battling hurdles related to stiff competition, consumers’ changing preferences and slow North American growth, the aforementioned initiatives remain this AB InBev’s growth drivers.So, let’s take a closer look into the world largest brewer’s growth story and see if it can be sustained amid the industry hurdles.What’s Driving AB InBev?AB InBev remains focused on portfolio diversification to resonate with consumers’ evolving drinking patterns. Given the accelerated shift toward low-and no-alcohol products, AB InBev keeps introducing near beer alternatives, along with no- and low-alcohol beers to provide greater choices to consumers. This is evident from the company’s plans to acquire Hiball — manufacturer of healthy, clean and premium energy drinks as well as a provider of organic sparkling water and juices under its Alta Palla brand. Another evidence of AB InBev’s commitment toward portfolio diversification is its contract with Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) to provide Teavana, a ready-to-drink tea. Notably, management expects the low and no-alcohol beer category to account for about 20% of global beer volumes by 2025.AB InBev’s expansion in the craft beer space further highlights its practice of exploiting all possible growth avenues. To make the most of this lucrative market, this Belgium-based brewer made numerous acquisitions to strengthen its position in the competitive craft beer space. The company’s strong craft beer portfolio includes well-known names like Karbach, Devils Backbone, Four Peaks, Goose Island and Golden Road among others.Apart from AB InBev, other alcohol players like The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) are also expanding in the craft beer category. Thus, expansion in this space is likely to help AB InBev combat competition and cater to the rising demand.Well, AB InBev is also gaining from its buyout of SABMiller, which augmented its presence in the brewing space. Notably, the combined entity has a dominant share in the global beer market. Incidentally, AB InBev has operations spread across North America, Latin America (North, South & West), Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific. Moreover, SABMiller’s buyout seems to have lowered AB InBev’s exposure to the troubles looming over North America. The company is also likely to gain from solid sales in the emerging market, expected in fiscal 2017.What’s Troubling AB InBev?While all is well with AB InBev, the company delivered its sixth consecutive negative earnings surprise in second-quarter 2017, wherein the bottom line fell year over year. This resulted from persistent weakness in Brazil, negative impact of mark-to-market adjustment and increased finance costs. In fact, the company stated that Brazilian economy is recuperating at a slow rate. Further, going forward, the company continues to expect witnessing increased cost of sales due to the lingering currency woes and growth of premium brands. Management also expects a more volatile scenario in some of its core regions.Nonetheless, the company remains optimistic about Brazil’s long-run outcome. It also projects 2017 sales to be backed by growth of global brands and its commercial plans, including revenue-management initiatives. All said, we believe that AB InBev’s strategic initiatives are likely to keep it going despite the hurdles.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Robust earnings were driven by higher sales in the Wholesale business and the benefits from the completed acquisition of Unified Grocers in June.Though the company reported a strong second quarter, its share performance has been unimpressive due to negative surprises reported in two of the past four quarters. In fact, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have underperformed the industry over the last three months.

However, margin contracted 280 basis points to 11.3%, owing to store closing costs and changes in business segment mix. Wholesale segment accounted for a large portion of the total sales and gross profit during the quarter.During the quarter, SUPERVALU’s operating loss was of $7 million, as compared with the operating earnings of $58 million in the prior-year period. This was caused by higher selling and administrative expenses.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsWholesale: Net sales at Wholesale business grew 58% year over year to $2.74 billion, mainly driven by the revenues from Unified Grocers business. Additionally, the segment also gained from sales to new customers and stores. These were partially offset by reduced military sales and stores that no longer receive supplies from SUPERVALU. Also, the segment’s operating income totaled $61 million, up from $58 million in the year-ago quarter.Retail: Net sales at Retail slipped 1.1% to $1.02 billion. This decrease represents store closures and unfavorable identical store sales of 3.5%, partly mitigated by sales from acquired and new outlets.In fact, we note that this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to competitive pressures. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of sales decline of the retail segment.Further, the segment reported operating loss of $58 million, wider than the operating loss of $12 million in the year-ago quarter. The downside was driven by lower sales and reduced gross margin owing to enhanced promotional activities.Corporate: During the second quarter, fees earned under services agreements were down 2.4% to $40 million. Further, the segment delivered operating loss of $10 million, as against operating income of $12 million delivered in the year-ago quarter.Financial Update The company’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $209 million as of Sep 9 compared to $252 million as of Jun 17.Long-term debt was $1,601 million and total stockholders’ equity totaled $373 million as of Sep 9, compared with long-term debt of $1,282 billion and stockholders’ equity of $397 million as of Jun 17.Further, the company’s year-to-date net cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations amounted $116 million, as compared with $208 million in the previous year.Outlook For fiscal 2018, management continues to expect adjusted EBITDA, including Unified Grocers of $475-$495 million.We commend SUPERVALU’s efforts to develop the wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. In fact, the acquisition of Unified Grocers has yielded positive results and is expected to radically boost the company’s wholesale segment, alongside offering new growth opportunities across multiple geographies. It also recently announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Associated Grocers for approximately $180 million. The company has also been working hard toward achieving a turnaround in its retail segment, reduce costs and increase operating efficiency. Looking for More?

1145,STZ,"Traditionally, October is the most volatile month for the broader market. The daily percentage change in the month is 1.44% compared with 1.08% for the other months. Historically, the period between the end of April and the end of October, had been the worst “six months” for the Dow and the S&P 500, while the period between June-end and October-end is considered the worst for the Nasdaq.This bearish trend, however, hasn’t played out so far this year. All the major indices continued to scale record highs on improved corporate earnings, the chugging along of the U.S. economy and the rise in oil prices after the decline in the first half of the year. Oil prices moved north after major producers said that the global market was on its way toward tallying international demand-and-supply levels.Hopes that President Trump is making strides with his new tax plans also overshadowed a slew of negative developments including catastrophic hurricanes, threats of war from North Korea and cyber breach at credit bureau Equifax.Given such positives, the month of October is not likely to put an end to the bull market. Equities, moreover, have a reputation of maintaining gains as the fourth quarter is usually the strongest. This calls for investing in some rock-solid stocks this month for better gains.Corporate Earnings EncourageTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are up 11.1% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues. This marked the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Earnings growth is also expected to turn positive in Q3. Total Q3 earnings are poised to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues.For the full year, total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up 7.4% on 4.6% higher revenues, which would follow 0.7% earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in 2016 (read more: Start of the Q3 Earnings Season).Economic Recovery SolidMeanwhile, the U.S. GDP expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside.Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.Trump’s Tax Policy ProposalsTrump has urged Congress to move fast with the lowering of corporate taxes and had recently held a bipartisan group of House members at the White House to discuss a tax deal. He has been working on a major tax overhaul in more than three decades. Ever since 1986, the tax code hasn’t been restructured, when President Ronald Reagan along with a divided Congress broadened the tax base and slashed marginal tax rates.Trump proposed a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that would boost the U.S. economy and drive corporate profits. Such a tax cut included trimming of the business tax rate to 20% from 35%. Low corporate tax will benefit businesses of all sizes, as most of them will see the improvement in their bottom lines.5 Top-Performing Stocks for OctoberOctober may be a rocky month for the stock market. But, as mentioned above, there are positives that may propel the broader markets. We have, thus, selected five stocks that have not only gained, traditionally during the rough trading month of October but also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1146,STZ,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $14.80 on Jul 14, closing at $15.03. Despite the company’s efforts to diversify the brand and its sustained focus on improving operations, performance remains challenged by rising competition and escalated raw milk costs. The impact is well reflected in Dean Foods’ share price which has been underperforming the broader Zacks categorized Consumer Staples sector for the last six months. In the said time frame, share price of the company has declined 28.2% against the sector’s growth of 9%. Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been pulling down Dean Foods and the strategic measures put in place to revive its performance.Milk Cost & Volumes Posing Concerns Dean Foods’ business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel and others. The prices of these commodities are continuously fluctuating. A price hike in such items will hurt the company’s margins. The company witnessed escalated raw milk costs in the first quarter of 2017, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. During the quarter, raw milk costs rose about 6% from fourth-quarter 2016 and jumped 18% from first-quarter 2016.The USDA data through Feb 2017 revealed that fluid milk volumes dipped 1.8% year over year on an adjusted basis. Also, total volume of 633 million gallons dipped 1.3% from 641 million gallons in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the Class I Mover, a measure of raw milk expenses, increased year over year in the second quarter. This raises concerns over the company’s near-term performance.The impact of decreased volumes and increased raw milk costs led Dean Foods to post dismal first-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings marked its second consecutive miss and plunged year over year.. The company’s earnings underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.4% in the trailing four quarters. Consolidation Intensifies Competition In recent years, the retail grocery industry experienced significant consolidation, resulting in intense competition among dairy product suppliers. Dean Foods experiences stiff competition, both geographically and at the processor level, in all major product lines. The company could suffer significantly from the loss of any large regional grocery chain. It not only competes with various dairy processors for shelf space but also with various beverages and nutritional products.Strategic Initiatives Lift Hopes of Improvement Contributions from Friendly’s acquisition have been boosting ice cream sales volumes. This is aiding top-line growth. We also applaud the company’s efforts to grow in the organic space, which is evident from its recent deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley as well as the acquisition of Uncle Matt's juices. Further, the company's focus on cost productivity and growth plans bode well. With such strategic initiatives in place, we can hope that Dean Foods would be able to uplift its performance. Moreover, the company carries a VGM Score of “A”, which points at its inherent strength.While estimates for the second quarter have been stable, fiscal year estimates have witnessed a downtrend. Dean Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Still Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks? Check theseSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Energizer Holdings, Inc.

1147,STZ,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has been delivering better-than-expected earnings over the past several quarters backed by acquisitions, online business growth, and cost savings measures. In fact, strong yields from acquisitions drove its recently announced fourth-quarter 2017 results.Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been impacting the performance of this company.Strong Fourth Quarter Results Both earnings and sales surged during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which was released on Aug 18. The company posted adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Adjusted earnings also surged 21.4% year over year.Estée Lauder’s net sales of $2.89 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.85 million by 1.5%. Moreover, sales grew 9% from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by acquisitions. Almost all the brands, geographic regions and product categories, except hair care reported sales growth in the quarter.Immediately after posting an upbeat fourth-quarter result, the company hit a 52-week high of $106.45, eventually closing at $105.92. We also note that shares of this cosmetic giant surged 7.7% since its fourth-quarter earnings release. Shares of this cosmetic giant have been rising primarily on the back of growth initiatives. We observe that shares of Estée Lauder went up 15.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 13.9% over the past year.Strategic Acquisitions Supports Growth The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter of 2017) has strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed approximately 3.5 percentage points of the reported sales growth during the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2017, these acquisitions contributed about 2 percentage points of the reported sales growth.The recent investment made in DECIEM – a fast-growing multi-brand company – is expected to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming quarters. Earlier acquisitions including By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso and GLAMGLOW have also boosted Estée Lauder’s skin care portfolio apart from aiding it to bolster its international presence.Online Business Acceleration & Other FactorsEstée Lauder has a strong e-Commerce business and the company expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years as well. During fiscal 2017, global online sales of the company depicted a 33% growth to reach $1.3 billion. A number of brands of the company such as MAC, Tom Ford and La Mer witnessed strong online sales growth during the year. Additionally, under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, the company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs in order to drive beauty business. Estée Lauder also has a strong presence in emerging markets which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. The company also gains from the rising demand for beauty products, particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup.Bottom Line Estée Lauder has remained cautious regarding slower retail growth in Hong Kong and unfavorable currency. It has also been witnessing a decline in retail traffic in U.S. brick-and-mortar stores, principally for MAC, Estée Lauder and Clinique.Nevertheless, with a strong portfolio of brands, lucrative acquisitions and well-planned cost and resource allocation strategies, Estée Lauder is well placed in the beauty arena and is expected to easily overcome current challenges.Estée Lauder currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

1148,STZ,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will invest $84 million in its poultry plant located at Union City, TN. The investment will expand the plant’s capacity and is anticipated to create more than 300 jobs. The expansion of the facility is expected to begin in the fall and be completed by mid-2019.The investment is anticipated to increase the facility’s capacity and expand the existing processing lines and harvest area.

Tyson Foods expects that the expansion plan would require building 200 additional broiler chicken houses within the forthcoming two years. The company also intends to collaborate with independent farmers in the northwestern Tennessee region.The expansion of the Union City plant in Tennessee is well in line with the company’s growth initiatives to expand its protein segments, especially chicken. Consumer demand for protein enriched food has been rising, which is well reflected in the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, where Tyson Foods witnessed strong volumes and solid performance of its chicken, beef and pork segments.Further, the company’s acquisition of AdvancePierre in the third quarter is also expected to drive growth of its protein packed brands. The acquisition is projected to generate cost synergies of $200 million within three years and also to be accretive to earnings. Similarly the acquisition of Hillshire in fiscal 2014 aided Tyson Foods to sell its pork products in higher-margin end markets, gain synergies of $580 million in fiscal 2016 and anticipate gains of $675 million for fiscal 2017.Apart from robust domestic demand, Tyson Foods also has a strong presence in the markets of Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Middle East, South Korea and Taiwan.

1149,STZ,"Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) has acquired Funky Buddha Brewery, a leading craft brewery in Florida, in order to strengthen its position in the high-end beer segment in the U.S. The acquired brewery will form part of Constellation Brands’ Craft & Specialty Beer group in the beer division. However, the terms of the deal remained under covers.Founded in 2010 in Boca Raton, this fastest-growing craft brewery in Florida makes exclusive craft beer with high quality ingredients. Further, it has some of the most popular brands in its portfolio including Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen. Located in the heart of Oakland Park’s burgeoning Culinary Arts District, this 54,000 square feet brewery with a capacity of 45,000 BBLs is South Florida’s largest craft microbrewery in terms of size and volume. Moreover, it is Florida’s busiest tap room with regard to beer sales.Following the acquisition, Constellation Brands and the Funky Buddha’s team will work together, with brewery owners Ryan and KC Sentz carrying out daily operations. Further, Funky Buddha will retain its standard of brewing, continue to serve its loyal beer customers in the same culinary-style.As for Constellation Brands, the addition of a local brand like Funky Buddha to its existing portfolio, which includes the Ballast Point, is likely to aid in executing the strategy to preserve its leadership in the high-end craft beer segment. The company believes that the combination of its market reach in the beer industry, distribution partnerships, consumer insights and craft expertise from the Ballast Point, with the bold culture created by the Sentz family, will help nurture and develop Funky Buddha’s unique brand.As one of the world’s largest wine companies, Constellation Brands holds a dominant position in the premium wine and beer segment in the U.S. and is also a leading producer of wine in Canada and New Zealand. Besides, its focus on expanding operations to achieve business growth is evidently noteworthy from the recent buyouts. Additionally, the acquisition of Obregon Brewery is likely to bolster its high-end Mexican beer portfolio, going forward.Constellation Brands, which shares space with Ambev S.A. (ABEV  -  Free Report) and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), remains on track to expand in the craft beer space. Notably, its first quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings marked the 11th consecutive beat and 16th straight quarter of year-over-year improvement. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 25.2% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.4%.

1150,STZ,"Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) is one of those stocks that never lets investors down. Backed by its strategic growth initiatives, this alcohol behemoth has put up a spectacular show in the past. The company’s superb earnings record and ongoing prospects are also visible from its stock price performance.Evidently, the company has surged a whopping 40.5% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s 26.8% growth. So let’s take a detailed look at the factors that are most likely to keep driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s momentum.Focus on Enhancing Brand Portfolio Leads to Solid Market PositionConstellation Brands has a formidable portfolio of well-known brands and is the largest wine company in the world. The company holds a dominant position in the premium wine and beer segment in the United States, alongside being a leading producer of wine in Canada and New Zealand. This provides it with a competitive edge and also bolsters its well-established position in the market. Further, the company’s consistent focus on brand building and initiatives to include new products remain key revenue drivers for the stock.Beer Business Strength Fuels GrowthThanks to its strategic endeavors, the company is witnessing increasing market share, especially in the U.S. beer category. Notably, the company was the highest growth contributor in the United States’ beer category for the fourth straight year, in fiscal 2017. Also, Constellation Brands is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. In this regard, management expects solid results from its Ballast Point craft beer brand, which is currently placed among the top 20 craft brands nationwide. Also, confidence in the beer business was one of the major drivers of the company’s recently raised outlook, as discussed below.Expansion Initiatives Bode WellConstellation Brands focuses on expanding operations directed toward achieving business growth. In the beer segment, the company’s expansion plans are anchored by the recent acquisition of the Funky Buddha Brewery, a leading craft brewery in Florida; the introduction of Fathom IPA by Ballast Point Brewery and the Obregon Brewery buyout among others. The company also sees immense growth potential for its spirits and wines business. Evidently, Constellation Brands acquired America’s highest rated Schrader Cellars in June  to enhance its fine wines kitty. Also, in fiscal 2017, the company purchased and integrated High West Distillery, Charles Smith Wines and The Prisoner Wine Company brands.Q2 Retains Stellar Surprise History, Outlook Boosts EstimatesThe aforementioned factors are enough to decipher Constellation Brands’ past record.  Notably, the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings marked its 12th straight earnings beat and 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the top line improved year over year and returned to a beat trend. Management remained encouraged by the outstanding results, which was marked by significant market share gains, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and solid execution.

1151,STZ,"With rising consumer confidence, spending on beauty and personal care products in addition to apparel and footwear has increased. Moreover, the rise of e-commerce has driven growth of the beauty segment.The Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report), one of the leading manufacturer and marketer of beauty products, has been a favorite pick for investors. Shares of the company have surged 29% in the past six months compared with the industry’s gain of 13.2%. Recently, its shares have hit a new 52-week high of $111.79 during the trading session on Oct 16, eventually closing at $111.28.Let’s delve into the aspects which have been aiding the company’s impressive performanceE-commerce on the Rise Estée Lauder has been continuously opening sites across different regions and targeting sustained growth in its e-commerce platform. During the fiscal year 2017, global online sales of the company depicted a 33% growth to reach $1.3 billion. Further, Estée Lauder is implementing new technology and digital experiences including online booking for each store appointment and omni-channel loyalty programs. These initiatives are expected to boost the company’s top line.Well Planned AcquisitionsEstée Lauder has been widening its portfolio through acquisitions. The buyout of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter of fiscal 2017) have strengthened its fastest-growing prestige portfolio. This, in turn, have contributed about 3.5 percentage points of the reported sales growth during the fiscal fourth quarter and approximately half the reported sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The recent investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is also expected to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods.Other notable acquisitions of Estée Lauder include By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso, GLAMGLOW and Le Labo. Such acquisitions aid the company to expand its portfolio and maintain the respective loyal customer base.Strategic Allocation of Resources & Marketing Fuels Sales Effective promotions help cosmetic and beauty companies to influence consumer sentiments and thereby enhance sales. Estée Lauder emphasizes heavily on marketing, especially through digital media and social networking.The company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, in order to boost its beauty business. After its full implementation, Estée Lauder expects the initiative to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses of $200-$300 million, before taxes.Favorable EstimatesAhead of its first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate inched up by a penny to reach 97 cents in the past 30 days. Estimated earnings for the forthcoming quarter lie in the upper end of the management’s guidance of 94-97 cents. This marks an increase of 12% to 15% over the prior-year earnings of 84 cents. However, estimated earnings of $3.97 per share for the fiscal year 2018 surpass management’s anticipated range of $3.87-$3.94.Final Thoughts                                                                                Estée Lauder has been struggling with social and political issues in Hong Kong. Though the company is attempting to strengthen its business with local consumers in Hong Kong, we do not anticipate a significant increase in consumption from the region in the near term.Nevertheless, the company expects to easily offset such challenges based on its strong growth in other emerging regions. The Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets offer extensive untapped potential for the company. Estée Lauder also expects strong growth of its brands in China, and has therefore been expanding steadily in the region.Moreover, Estée Lauder is strongly positioned in the beauty arena, with its robust brand portfolio and productive growth strategies. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B, indicating its inherent growth potential.Looking for More?

1153,STZ,"Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the top and the bottom line declined year over year due to lower sales leaders and weak performance in the regions of South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong/Taiwan. As a result, management trimmed guidance for 2017.This led to negative sentiment among investors, as Nu Skin’s shares dipped 1.4% during after-market trading hours on Nov 1. However, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry in the past three months owing to its consistent efforts to improve performance through product launches. Nu Skin’s shares have returned 4.1% as against the industry’s 2.6% decline.Q3 Highlights The company posted earnings of 76 cents per share which met the higher end of management’s previous outlook of 74-76 cents. However, earnings slumped 22.4% from the prior-year period, due to lower revenues and margins.

On a constant-currency basis, revenues dropped 5.8%.

1154,STZ,"Tyson Foods, Inc (TSN  -  Free Report) has been struggling with higher operating expenses owing to enhanced investments and restructuring initiatives, of late.  Evidently, shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past six months. In the said time frame, the company’s shares have increased 5.6% compared with the industry’s rise of 10.2%.However, Tyson Foods’ shares have depicted a turnaround recently and increased more than 7% since Sep 28, when it raised fiscal 2017 earnings guidance along with other restructuring initiatives.The company now expects adjusted earnings in the range of $5.20-5.30 per share, significantly higher than the previously anticipated range of $4.95-5.05.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are currently pegged lower at $5.09 and $5.35, respectively.The higher earnings expectation for fiscal 2017 is backed by improved performance of the company’s Beef segment. This segment performed strongly during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, backed by enhanced domestic demand, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports.  Financial Fitness, Job Cuts & Other InitiativesIn addition to improved earnings, Tyson Foods also stated that it would proceed with the implementation of its previously announced Financial Fitness plans, in an effort to induce greater operational efficiencies and create more value for its stakeholders.Management also stated that the company would be adhering to job cuts for about 450 positions, to make the organization more agile and achieve greater financial efficiency. The headcount reductions would mainly be carried out in Chicago, Cincinnati and Springdale. We note that the company has been struggling with higher wage-related costs, owing to hikes to attract and retain efficient workers. Hence, the current job cuts are expected to offer the company considerable reduction in expense burden.The management also expects net synergies of $200 million, $400 million and $600 million from the AdvancePierre acquisition for fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The acquisition, which was carried out in June, is mainly expected to improve the performance of Tyson Foods’ Chicken and Prepared Foods segments.In relation with its ongoing restructuring and improvement initiatives, Tyson Foods expects charges in the range of $140-$150 million to be reported in its fourth-quarter results. The charges mainly include in-process software implementations of approximately $70 million, employee termination costs of $45-$50 million and contract termination costs of $25-$30 million.We expect that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s dedicated efforts toward inducing operational efficiency and reducing costs to improve margins and boost the stock performance in the forthcoming months.Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

Further, it has been gaining from effective integration and growth of recently acquired brands, higher margins, solid overall depletion trends and strong consumer demand.In fact, these factors assisted the company to showcase another sterling performance in first-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its 16th straight quarter of earnings growth year-over-year and 11th straight positive surprise. Moreover, sales advanced while favorable pricing, volumes and lower cost of goods sold provided a boost to margins.Further, the company continues to gain from the recent buyouts and strength in the beer business, which encouraged management to raise fiscal 2018 earnings view. Management also hiked fiscal 2018 operating income targets for the beer segment. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90-$8.10 per share. Operating income is now expected to grow 13-15% for the beer segment.The company is also on track with its Nava brewery expansion, while it also enhanced its wine portfolio with the buyout of Schrader Cellars.

(The) QuoteProduct Based Segment ResultsOn the basis of product category, Skin Care reported sales growth of 16% year over year (up 15% on a constant currency basis) to $1,275 million, owing to strong performance of brands like GLAMGLOW, La Mer, Origins and Estée Lauder. These were partially offset by lower sales of Aveda and Clinique brands.Makeup revenues were up 18% (up 17% on a constant currency basis) to $1,372 million on the back of incremental sales stemming from the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced. Tom Ford and MAC brands also generated solid sales. These were partially offset by sluggish retail environment in the United States and weak performance of the company’s Bobbi and Clinique brands.Fragrance category reported revenue growth of 8% (up 7% on a constant currency basis) to reach $476 million driven by increased sales of luxury brands such as Le Labo, Tom Ford and Jo Malone London, partially offset by declines in certain Estée Lauder and designer fragrances.Hair Care sales amounted $136 million and remained flat compared with the prior year, owing to moderate growth of Bumble and bumble as Aveda brands. These were countered by lower sales of Origins hair care products.Regional Results Sales in the Americas increased 8% (up 7% on a constant currency basis) to $1,329 million, benefiting from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. The company’s online and specialty-multi channels registered strong growth in the region, including increased sales across a number of brands. These upsides were partially offset by soft retail traffic in few domestic stores as well as adverse weather conditions in the region. Weak sales in Latin America also impacted sales negatively.Sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa region improved 20% (up 18% on a constant currency basis) to $1,258 million owing to enhanced retail travel sales and growth across most of the key markets.

Nevertheless, the Middle East region registered lower sales in the quarter owing to macro-economic challenges.In the Asia/Pacific region sales improved 16% (up 17% on a constant currency basis) to $687 million.

1159,STZ,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Aug 31, 2017) results on Sep 28, before the market opens.Over the last month, Conagra’s shares yielded a return of 2.9%, as against 2.3% loss incurred by the industry.In fact, the company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 10.66% over the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayConagra believes its ongoing restructuring moves will likely boost its top-line performance in the quarters ahead. Moreover, launch of innovative products such as Power Bowls and new category of Alexia branded will likely help bolster sales going forward. The company anticipates to widen near-term margins on the back of ongoing volume strategy, improved pricing conditions, supply-chain productivity and divestiture of low revenues-generating businesses. Further, increased share repurchases, margin expansion and lower interest expense are likely to boost the company’s near-term earnings.However, lower volumes, unfavorable price/mix or adverse foreign currency translation impact might continue to weigh over the company’s Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, and Foodservice, and International segments’ sales in the quarters ahead. Also, we believe price inflation of major raw inputs such as as soybeans, pork, oats, beef, poultry, wheat and corn might hurt near-term margins of Conagra. In addition, intense rivalry in the industry might mar near-term top- and bottom-line performance as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Conagra will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1160,STZ,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.33%. Notably, over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe are positive about Accenture’s latest product additions in the analytics application space, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, the company’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging. These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe these will have a positive influence on the company’s upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the recent forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner gave some optimism about Accenture’s near-term performance. The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to grow 2.4% to $3.48 trillion, marking a solid recovery after two consecutive years of decline.The research firm noted two major catalysts which, it believes, will drive IT spending this year. The first catalyst highlighted by Gartner is decline in the U.S. dollar against several foreign currencies. Secondly, the firm foresees an uptick in digital transformation projects in the near term, which will enable organizations to spend more on IT related infrastructure, products, and services. All these encourage us about the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter overall performance.Nonetheless, Accenture’s February 2017 announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. The company has already started to work on this space, by opening two innovation centers and hiring people over there.The company is believed to be preparing itself for a more protectionist U.S. technology-visa program under President Trump. It should be noted that out of more than 394,000 of its total workforce, 140,000 are in India, which provides it a cost advantage. With the addition of 15,000 new jobs, Accenture’s total employee count in the United States will increase by 30% to 65,000, thereby increasing its salary expenses significantly.Additionally, heightening competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and International Business Machines Corporation, as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.46 on $9-billion revenue projection.Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Accenture PLC QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will likely beat on earnings this quarter.

1163,STZ,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Constellation Brands Inc (STZ  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 10% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Constellation Brands Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, View RaisedConstellation Brands posted robust first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. During the quarter, Constellation Brands benefited from its efforts to drive consumer demand for its robust brand portfolio. Also, results were backed by contributions from acquisitions along with continued strength in the company’s beer business in particular.Q1 HighlightsThe company’s adjusted earnings for first-quarter fiscal 2018 surged 52% year over year to $2.34 per share, outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98. Reported earnings came in at $2.00 per share, up 29% year over year.Net sales advanced 3% to $1,936.0 million, on the back of a 7% rise in organic sales and gains from buyouts, partly countered by sales loss from the divestiture of its Canadian wine business. However, the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,949 million thus breaking its solid trend.Sales at the company’s beer business improved 8%, thanks to higher volumes and favorable pricing. Further, beer sales were backed by the company’s solid brands which witnessed depletions of nearly 12% in the quarter.Wine and spirits’ sales fell 4%, as organic sales growth of 6% was negated by the impact of the Canadian wine business revenues. The organic sales growth was fueled by enhanced mix, volumes and pricing. During the quarter, the U.S. shipment volume outdid depletion volumes, mainly due to the timing of promotional activities. However, this segment witnessed considerable margin improvement. Also, spirit sales rose in double-digits mainly backed by its High West Whiskey portfolio.Cost and Margin PerformanceAdjusted gross profit for the quarter improved 15% year over year to $1,003.0 million. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 530 basis points (bps) to 51.8%.Constellation Brands' comparable operating income grew nearly 22% to $668.8 million with the comparable operating margin expanding 530 bps to 34.6%. This growth was backed by a 22% operating income improvement at both the beer and wine and spirits businesses. The beer segment gained from higher volume, effective pricing and lower product costs, while improvement at the wine and spirits segment was attributed to volume growth, contributions from acquisitions and favorable pricing and mix. This was partly offset by the sale of Canadian wine business.Financial PositionConstellation Brands ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $199.1 million. As of May 31, 2017, the company had $8,077.2 million in long-term debt (excluding current maturities) and its total shareholders’ equity was $7,397.8 million.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Constellation Brands generated $381.6 million in cash from operations and free cash flow of $165 million.  The company’s solid cash flows and financials provide it with the flexibility to pay dividends.

1164,STZ,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both top and bottom lines fell year over year and the former also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings came in line with the consensus mark, faring better than its three-quarter long trend of posting negative surprise.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteWhile the stock hasn’t moved much in the pre-market trading hours, Molson Coors’ shares have plunged 15.9% so far this year, as against the industry’s growth of 25.1%.Molson Coors’ adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though it dropped 3.6% from the prior-year figure of $1.39. The decline stemmed from lower financial volumes, increased amortization costs, elevated general and administrative and greater tax rate. This was partly compensated by improved net pricing and mix, reduced interest expense and cost savings.Delving DeeperNet sales (on pro-forma basis) dipped 2.1% to $2,883.2 million, which came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,000 million. The sales decline was accountable to lower financial volumes, partly offset by better global pricing; favorable mix; royalty volume and currency translations. On a constant currency basis, sales dropped 3%. While sales declined in United States, it witnessed improvements in all other regions. Notably net sales per hectoliter improved 2.9%, backed by better pricing and mix.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volume inched up 0.6% to 25.5 million hectoliters in the quarter driven by robust growth in European and International regions. This in turn was backed by the addition of Miller global brands business as well as improvements in some of the company’s key brands. Financial volumes dipped 4.8% to 26.3 million hectoliters, whereas global priority brand volumes jumped 2.4%. Financial volumes were impacted by curtailments in wholesale inventories, brand volumes and contract brewing — which largely weighed upon U.S. and Canadian volumes.Underlying EBITDA was $679.7 million in the quarter, a slip of 0.4% from the year-ago period. Further, underlying EBITDA on a constant-currency basis went down by 1.2.Segment DetailsThe company operates through the following geographical segments.Canada: Molson Coors Canada net sales climbed 1% to $406.4 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter grew 2% in local currency, driven by better pricing and brand mix. However, Canada brand volume declined 1.7% owing to soft domestic volumes, partly compensated by impacts of Miller brands. Financial volumes (which includes contract brewing volumes) fell 4.7% on account of lower wholesale inventories and soft contract brewing volume. The segment’s underlying EBITDA dipped 0.5% to $112.1 million.United States (MillerCoors): Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the brands in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. market. Segment net sales (on pro-forma basis) decreased 5.5% to $1,892 million in the quarter. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, improved 1.2%. This stemmed from favorable pricing, partly countered by negative mix. However, both U.S. domestic sales-to-retailers volume (STRs) and domestic sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) declined 2.9% and 7.2%, respectively. The former was accountable to soft volumes in Premium Light and Below Premium units. The segment’s underlying EBITDA grew 0.8% to $475.6 million thanks to higher net pricing, lower M&A costs and cost savings. This was partly offset by lower shipment volumes.Europe: The segment reported net sales growth of 9.5% to $561.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. Europe net sales per hectoliter grew 4.1% in local currency driven by positive mix and net pricing. While Europe brand volume increased 9.6% in the quarter, financial volume (including contract brewing and factored brands, excluding royalty volume) went up by 2.7%. Volumes were aided by contributions from Miller brands and strength in the company’s main and above-premium brands. Europe underlying EBITDA surged 13.6% to $140.3 million, backed by greater volume, favorable pricing and mix, higher net pension benefit and positive impacts from currency translations.International: Segment net sales almost doubled to $65.7 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter fell 11.6%, owing to unfavorable sales mix, somewhat cushioned by improved pricing. Total International brand volume soared 64.7% in the quarter, on the back of Puerto Rico’s business transfer from MillerCoors, the inclusion of the Miller global brands, and growth of Coors Light, mainly in Latin America. International underlying EBITDA suffered a loss of $1 million in the quarter, narrower than the loss of $1.8 million a year ago. The improvement came on the back of higher volume and better pricing, though it was partly countered by increased M&A costs along with loss of the Japanese Modelo deal.Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $971.3 million and total debt of $12,319 million.Net cash from operating activities in the first three quarters of 2017 was $1,145.4 million, while underlying free cash flow was $836.4 million.OutlookManagement remains impressed with its year-to-date results, which is marked by global brand volume growth and higher net sales per hectoliter. Notably, the company’s focus on portfolio premiumization has helped it achieve better pricing and mix. Also, in the year so far, Molson Coors’ above-premium brands have jumped more than 20%, thus representing about 20% of the company’s global volume. Moreover, the company is witnessing enhanced EBITDA margins, thanks to its cost-saving efforts.Even amid tough North American conditions, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains on track to achieve its financial goals for 2017, alongside exceeding its cost savings and cash flow targets for the year. The company still envisions underlying EBITDA margin to rise by 30-60 bps (on an average annual basis) in the next 3 to 4 years. In fact, management expects EBITDA margin to grow in this range this year too.Further, Molson Coors anticipates generating cost savings of more than $175 million in 2017. Further, it expects to deliver underlying free cash flow of around $1.2 billion in 2017, (plus or minus 10%). Capital spending is now expected to be roughly $650 million, compared with the prior projection of $750 million. Effective tax rate for the year is likely to range from 26-28%, as compared with 24-28% guided earlier.Don’t Miss These Alcohol StocksThe Boston Beer Company, Inc.

1165,STZ,"The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the bottom line improved year over year.Notably, the quarter marked the company’s fourth consecutive positive earnings surprise and second straight sales beat.Q3 HighlightsBoston Beer’s third-quarter earnings per share of $2.78 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 and improved 12.1% year over year. This outperformance stemmed from higher gross margin coupled with lower general and administrative costs and tax rate, somewhat compensated with decline in revenues due to lower volumes.During the quarter, the company recorded a tax benefit of 4 cents owing to the adoption of the new Accounting Standard – Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), effective Jan 1, 2017.Net revenue dropped nearly 3% year over year to $247 million. Excluding excise taxes, top line dipped 2.6% year over year to $264.1 million but outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $259 million. Further, shipment volume declined 4% to 1.1 million barrels and depletions were down 3.5%.In the reported quarter, depletion volumes were mainly hurt by persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, as well as marginal adversity from the timing of the quarter, particularly related to the fourth of July holiday. This was partly mitigated by growth in Twisted Tea, and Truly Spiked & Sparkling brands.Though management pointed to some improvement in the overall depletion trends from the beginning of the year, it stated that the on-premise channel remains tough. Further, trends in the craft beer and cider categories continued to remain soft. Also, challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop persist, providing lot of drinking options.Meanwhile, Boston Beer continues to project soft depletion trends for 2017. Evidently, depletions for the year-to-date period through the 42 weeks ended Oct 21, 2017 are estimated to have declined nearly 6% from the comparable year-ago period.Costs & MarginsGross profit slipped 1.6% year over year to $131.5 million, while gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 53.2% in the quarter. The improvement in gross margin can be attributed to higher revenue per barrel that resulted from better pricing and package mix, along with lower brewery processing costs due to waste reductions and efficiency gains. These were partly mitigated by adverse fixed cost absorption owing to lower volumes.Nevertheless, advertising, promotional and selling expenses remained flat at $63.6 million, owing to marginally greater media spending, which was offset by lower freight to distributors. This, in turn, resulted in lower volume and rates.General and administrative expenses slumped 15.9% to $16.4 million, mainly due to declines in stock compensation associated with it’s retirement of its chief executive officer in 2018, along with salary and benefit costs, consulting and legal expenses.FinancialsAs of Sep 30, 2017, Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of $70 million and total stockholders’ equity of $414.3 million.During the nine months of 2017, the company generated approximately $108.2 million of cash from operating activities.As of Oct 20, 2017, Boston Beer bought back about 884,000 shares worth roughly $130.5 million. With this, it had nearly $192.8 million remaining on the $931.0 million share buyback authorization.Growth PlanManagement remains committed to a three-point growth plan. Firstly, revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Moving forward, the company plans to launch new media campaigns for these brands. These innovations include Samuel Adams Sam '76, Samuel Adams New England IPA and Angry Orchard Rose, which are likely to be launched nationally in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, it targets maintaining momentum for the Twisted Tea brand.Secondly, accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects with savings directed for further brand development. In this regard, the company has adjusted the organization to the new volume environment while at the same time retained its capability to innovate and return to growth. Evidently, the results of these initiatives reflected in gross margin improvements and lower operating expenses in the third quarter. On the back of this early success, Boston Beer reiterated the previously revealed target of improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019.Lastly, long-term innovation coupled with current focus in maintaining the leadership of Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential.Furthermore, Boston Beer remains focused on making investments to revive hard cider category and Angry Orchard brand. Going forward, the company remains optimistic on the future of craft beer and cider category growth.Markedly, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 22% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 10.9%. We believe these initiatives to drive growth and retain the stock momentum, going forward.GuidanceManagement updated its outlook for 2017. Depending upon the current spending and investment plans, adjusted earnings per share, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09, are now estimated in the range of $5.60-$6.20 compared with the prior guidance of $5.00–$6.20. However, the company stated that the actual results may deviate significantly from current projections. Moreover, the company affirmed that 2017 will include 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in 2016.Other assumptions for earnings include depletions and shipments changes of -7% to -4% compared with the previous forecast of -7% to 1%. In the meantime, Boston Beer continues to anticipate revenues per barrel to increase 1-2%. Gross margin is continued to be anticipated to range from 51-52%. Investment in advertising, promotional and selling expenses are envisioned to increase in the band of $10-$20 million compared with $20-$30 million, projected earlier.Adjusted effective tax rate guidance for 2017 is maintained to be nearly 37%, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09. Further, capital expenditures for the year are still guided in the band of $35-$45 million, which will be directed toward investment in breweries.Also, management issued guidance for 2018. Depletions and shipments are likely to rise in low-single digits. Prices are expected to grow in 1-2% range. Gross margin expansion is guided from 52-53%, owing to the progress on the cost initiatives as well. Investment in advertising, promotional and selling expenses are envisioned to increase in the range of $15-$25 million.Further, adjusted effective tax rate guidance for 2018 is anticipated to be roughly 37%, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09. Capital spending is expected in the band of $55-$65 million in 2018, which can move higher per the requirements.Looking for Solid Stocks, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Staples sector include Constellation Brands, Inc.

1166,STZ,"Ballast Point Brewing Company, a unit of Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) has recently announced the introduction of Fathom IPA, thus adding a new twist to the brewery’s signature West Coast-style IPAs. The Fathom IPA signifies a crisp-and-clean brew with a slight taste of malt on the surface along with zesty orange and piney hops flavors to follow.This new Fathom IPA also caters to the needs of the beer enthusiasts looking for low alcohol levels in the craft beer category with 6% Alcohol by Volume (ABV). In addition, the brewery has come up with innovations related to packaging and graphics in order to differentiate this IPA from other Ballast Point beers. Therefore, this new packaging is expected to aid customers to easily find it on store shelves.Markedly, the latest packaging of Fathom IPA will have a bold blue background and will feature a deep-sea diver submerged in water. Further, the company stated that other Ballast Point brands with more of sessionable ABVs and flavors, comprising Bonito Blonde and Mango Even Keel, are likely to adopt this new packaging as well.In fact, Fathom IPA will be available in the stores from Oct 9 in six and 12 pack cans throughout the country.

Interestingly, in order to celebrate the launch of the new Fathom IPA, Ballast Point invites its beer enthusiasts to have the tastings of the new IPA at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, from Oct 5 to Oct 7.

Ballast Point’s well-known brands include Sculpin - the brewery’s flagship beer brand, Bonito Blonde, Mango Even Keel Session IPA, Longfin Lager, among others.We believe the acquisition of Ballast Point has provided a high-growth premium platform to Constellation Brands, one of the largest wine companies in the world with a strong portfolio of premium wine brands. Also, the Ballast Point aids the company to compete in the fast-growing, craft beer category, alongside strengthening its position in the U.S. beer market.Moreover, the company is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. In this regard, management expects outstanding results from its Ballast Point craft beer brand that is currently placed among the top 20 craft brands nationwide.

1167,STZ,"Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 5, after the closing bell.Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for eight consecutive quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 18%. Let’s dive deeper to know what’s in store for this earnings season.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Helen of Troy is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Helen of Troy Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Helen of Troy Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Helen of Troy Limited QuoteHelen of Troy has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.37. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Earnings Estimate RevisionsLet’s look at the company’s earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about Helen of Troy, right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 has been stable in the last 30 days. The company reported earnings of $1.31 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $381.0 million for the to-be-reported quarter, representing growth of 3.5% year over year.Factors at PlayHelen of Troy’s shares have rallied 8.4% in the past month, substantially outperforming the Zacks Cosmetics industry’s gain of 1.2%. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 42% (107 out of 256) of the Zacks Classified industries.Additionally, we remain encouraged by the company’s solid brand portfolio and its transformation strategy that remains on track. In fact, its leadership brands like Braun, PUR, Honeywell, OXO, Vicks, Hydro Flask and Hot Tools are gaining traction in various markets.Also, Helen of Troy is exploring new opportunities for additional investments in product enhancement, expanding its footprint, digital marketing as well as e-commerce growth.However, the company is facing a tough retail landscape including sluggish brick-and-mortar business. Furthermore, it is facing intense competition in the personal care category, and is also being impacted by changing consumer preferences. In addition, Helen of Troy is witnessing sluggishness in its Nutritional Supplements and Beauty segments.Evidently, these factors hurt the company’s top line that has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last five quarters.Nevertheless, it is to be seen whether Helen of Troy is able to keep its positive earnings streak alive in the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1168,STZ,"The Boston Beer Co. Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) has been exhibiting consistent growth as evident from its stock movement, which has hardly witnessed a dip in quite some time. The company’s strong performance can be attributed to its three point growth plan focused on revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation. Additionally, the company is poised to gain from industry growth trends.Recent observations reveal that alcohol sales trends have been witnessing a change, with a rise in demand for more flavored products like the honey and cinnamon flavored whiskeys and higher-priced tequilas. The industry has recently witnessed the spirits segment gathering momentum, accounting for about 36% of the total alcohol market, seizing share from beer and wine sales.However, beer still accounts for 47% of the market share as craft beer and Mexican imports remained popular throughout 2016 and into 2017. We believe Boston Beer is well-positioned to gain from these ongoing industry trends.This largest craft brewer in the United States has seen its shares advance 30.9% in the last three months, outpacing the industry’s upside of 11%. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 39% of the Zacks classified industries (103 out of 265). In fact, the company’s shares have substantially outperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector’s gain of 1.4%, which is placed at the top 38% (6 out of 16) of the Zacks classified sectors.These factors have aided the company to retain the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while carrying a VGM Score of A. That said, let’s find out more about the factors aiding this Boston, MA-based company’s performance.Strong Brands Portfolio Provides an EdgeBoston Beer is the largest premium craft brewer in the United States, and commands a strong portfolio of globally recognized brands. Apart from selling alcoholic beverages in the United States, the company distributes beverages in Canada, Europe, Israel, Caribbean, Pacific Rim, Mexico, as well as Central and South America through a strong network of wholesale distributors. We expect the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation and brand development to boost operational performance and position in the market.Robust Earnings Trend and Outlook Stirs OptimismBoston Beer reported third straight earnings beat in second-quarter 2017, while sales returned to growth after three consecutive misses. Results benefited from top-line gains accompanied by gross margin improvement and lower operating costs owing to the company’s cost saving initiatives. Further, gross margins expanded in the quarter attributable to higher revenues per barrel that resulted from better pricing and package mix, along with lower brewery processing cost per barrel due to cost saving initiatives.Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) QuoteMoreover, the company raised the lower-end of its previously stated guidance range. The company now estimates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.00-$6.20 compared with the prior guidance of $4.20-$6.20.Strategic Actions Keep it GoingManagement remains committed to a three point growth plan focused on revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation. One, the company is keen on the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands via its packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Further, it targets maintaining momentum for the Twisted Tea brand.Two, the company has accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects, while ensuring that these savings are directed for further brand development. In this regard, the company has adjusted the organization to the new volume environment, while at the same time retained its capability to innovate and return to growth. This is reflected in the improved gross margin and increased spending on brands in second-quarter 2017. Based on this early success, the company continues to anticipate improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019.The company’s third priority is long-term innovation, wherein its focus currently revolves around maintaining the leadership of its Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential.Additionally, Boston Beer always seeks strategic opportunities to expand business through inorganic means. The company’s past record reveals that it believes in reinvesting its profits toward capital expenditures rather than distributing the same to shareholders. Since its inception, the company has made significant investments toward acquiring brewing assets, enhancing research & development (R&D) as well as packaging and marketing of products. The company mainly focuses on acquiring assets which can fulfill its goal of enhancing brewing capacity as well as expanding into new geographic regions.Possible DeterrentsWhile all is well with this renowned beer company, its depletion trends continued to be soft due to persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, as well as fall in Coney Island. Further, challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop persist. The company continues to project soft depletion trends for 2017.Nevertheless, we suggest holding on to the stock at this time as the aforementioned concerns are mostly addressed by its strategic actions, which focuses on reviving the distressed brands.Want More of Beverage Stocks?

Additionally, the company is poised to gain from industry growth trends.Recent observations reveal that alcohol sales trends have been witnessing a change with higher demand for flavored products as well as tequilas. In fact, the industry has recently observed the spirits segment gathering momentum, accounting for about 36% of the total alcohol market. We believe Brown-Forman is well-positioned to gain from these ongoing industry trends driven by strength in its premium American whiskey and tequila brands along with its Jack Daniel’s trademark.This alcoholic beverage company has seen its shares advance 14.6% in the last three months, outpacing the industry’s upside of 11.1%. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 17% of the Zacks classified industries (45 out of 256). In fact, the company’s shares have substantially outperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector’s gain of 1.4%, which is placed at the top 31% (5 out of 16) of the Zacks classified sectors.These factors have aided the company to retain the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while carrying a Growth Score of B. That said, let’s find out more about the factors aiding this Louisville, KY-based company’s performance.Robust OutlookMost of the growth witnessed in recent months can be attributed to the company’s robust outlook for fiscal 2018. The company remains confident of persistent growth in underlying net sales and operating income in fiscal 2018. Hence, it reiterated underlying net sales and operating income guidance for the fiscal. Moreover, the company raised earnings per share view for the fiscal.Management continues to project 4-5% growth in underlying sales mainly backed by growth of its premium American whiskey and tequila brands, comprising innovation for Jack Daniel’s RTDs. Further, growth is likely to come from new product launches including the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye and Slane Irish Whiskey. Underlying operating income is expected to increase in range of 6-8%. Further, the company estimates earnings per share in the range of $1.85-$1.95, compared with the previous guidance of $1.80-$1.90. The company’s revised earnings forecast assumes tax rate of nearly 28% and gains from foreign currency tailwinds due to reduced dollar. For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates slight foreign currency tailwinds to benefit results.A Strong Portfolio of Brands Gives an EdgeBrown-Forman is armed with a sturdy portfolio of globally recognized brands, which makes it the major producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages in the world. It currently owns and produces a multitude of popular spirit brands, with Jack Daniels, Southern Comfort, and Finlandia Vodka being a few of their most popular. Moreover, we anticipate the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation and expanding operations in emerging markets to boost operational performance, and further strengthen its market position.Expansion – A Key Growth StrategyGoing forward, Brown-Forman plans to expand Jack Daniel's market share in the developed markets as well as emerging markets, where the whiskey category is in the early stages of development. Additionally, it is on track to expand the sphere of other brands, alongside entering the fastest-growing spirit category — the Irish Whiskey — with the purchase of all shares of Slane Castle Irish Whiskey Limited in Ireland. Meanwhile, the company concluded the sale of its Southern Comfort and Tuaca trademarks to Sazerac as part of its portfolio management and prioritization of strategic brands.Want More of Beverage Stocks?

1171,STZ,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in 13 out of the last 15 quarters, with an average beat of 4.4% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact the third-quarter results.                     Estimate Revisions The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained unchanged over the last 30 days at $1.05, reflecting a year-on-year increase of 1.7%. However, estimates for fiscal 2017 have increased by a cent to reach $4.09, reflecting growth of 8.3% from the prior-year period.Further, analyst polled by Zacks expects revenues of $1.15 billion for the third quarter, up 5% from the prior-year period. Revenues for fiscal 2017 are expected to be $4.8 billion, displaying an increase rise of 7.9% from the previous year.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.McCormick has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.05. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteFactors at Play McCormick’s strategic focus on acquisitions has been aiding the company to boost top line for quite a while now. It recently completed the acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The acquisition is anticipated to generate cost synergies of approximately $50 million, expected to be achieved by 2020, with significant margin and earnings accretion in 2017. Moreover, the buyout is expected to position McCormick as one of the leading companies in the U.S. condiments category. In the past, the company has made several acquisitions including Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (both carried out in 2016).Additionally, the company has been focusing on innovation and brand marketing to enhance portfolio and revenue opportunities. McCormick has also remained dedicated toward its Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program, which aids cost reduction. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $109 million in 2016, up from $98 million in 2015. Further, it expects to deliver cost savings of at least $100 million in fiscal 2017 and savings of around $400 million by Nov 30, 2019.Nevertheless, McCormick has been battling with increased input costs since the past many quarters. Prices of raw materials such as vanilla, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and rice, as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing, thereby affecting margins. For fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. Further, the company’s sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) have remained sluggish of late due to difficult economic, political and competitive factors. Moreover, its business in the U.K. has been sluggish as large retailers reduce shelf space for food products to gain space for general merchandise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.99% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.                                   Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.45 and carries a Zacks Rank #3Church & Dwight Company Inc (CHD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.26% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

1172,STZ,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 28. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company reported a negative surprise as a loss per share of 2 cents was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. Further, the company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 20.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 2 cents per share, compared with earnings of 3 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release.Factors at PlayThe company’s negative surprise trend in recent quarters and the termination of the merger deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) has led the stock to underperform the industry in the last three months. Shares of Rite Aid have declined 22.2%, against the industry’s growth of 2.6%.The company suffered a loss in first-quarter 2018 driven by soft sales due to negative comparable store sales (comps) that stemmed from lower pharmacy and front-end sales. Further, Rite Aid continues to battle lower pharmacy reimbursement rates that hurt margins in first-quarter fiscal 2018.However, the recent Federal Trade Commission’s (""FTC"") approval for the sale of 1,932 Rite Aid stores to Walgreens for $4.375 billion bodes well. This will help in lowering Rite Aid’s debt and improving financial flexibility, making it a smaller, yet stronger independent firm with solid control in key markets. Further, the company's stringent focus on cost management and strengthening its portfolio of health and wellness services also remain impressive. Nonetheless, let’s see if Rite Aid’s growth drivers can help counter the challenges this time around.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Rite Aid has an Earnings ESP of -33.33%, with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share.

1173,STZ,"NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 26. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this athletic goods behemoth will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Notably, NIKE has delivered positive earnings surprises for 20 straight quarters.  In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 25%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 48 cents, which is way below the year-ago period figure of 73 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained nearly stable over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $9.1 billion, up slightly by 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayNIKE’s progress on its strategic initiatives has been reflected in every quarter’s results for over three fiscal years now. The company has been gaining from its robust growth and innovation efforts, which along with reduced expenses fueled the bottom line in the last quarter. The company is also benefiting from strong e-commerce initiatives. Notably, the enhancement of digital platform has led NIKE to nearly double its revenue contributions from NIKE.com and its apps in just two years, going over the $2 billion contribution mark in fiscal 2017. Incidentally, global Direct-to-Consumer businesses and growth at international locations largely augmented NIKE’s top line in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Nike, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nike, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nike, Inc. QuoteApart from this, management remains confident of growth drivers like efficient supply chain and enhanced sync between the digital and physical experiences. Moreover, the company is focused on Consumer Direct Offense (“CDO”) plan, which focuses on using digital methods for rapid innovation and product development, along with strengthening consumer relations by operating through core regions. This, in turn is backed by its “triple-double” strategy which is aimed at doubling innovation, speed and direct connection with customers. All these factors reflect Nike’s growth prospects.However, NIKE has been battling soft sales in North America owing to lackluster product assortments and intensified competition. The company’s wholesale business in the region has also been impacted due to increased focus on online sales. Moreover, the overall environment is expected to remain promotional in North America, which is likely to hurt results in this segment. Furthermore, adverse currency movements are expected to continue weighing upon NIKE’s performance, as evident from its outlook. Evidently, the company anticipates reported revenues to be flat in first-quarter fiscal 2018, with gross margin forecasted to contract 150-180 bps due to currency headwinds.Together, currency woes and difficult trends in North America make us cautious about the company’s overall performance. So, let’s see if NIKE’s robust strategies and e-commerce strength can manage to offset the hurdles and keep its splendid surprise streak alive. While the company’s shares have jumped 5.7% year to date, it has lagged the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector’s 13.8% growth.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that NIKE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Oh, and one big earnings beat, which came out ahead of today’s opening bell.Constellation Brands Blasts OffGlobal adult beverage distributor Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) posted a big beat in today’s pre-market, putting up earnings of $2.47 per share that easily topped the$2.16 in the Zacks consensus. This also represents EPS up 40% from this quarter — fiscal Q2 2018, BTW — on $2.08 billion in revenues, which beat consensus and are up 3.1% year over year. Solid growth in its beer business was cited in the earnings report.Constellation Brands has also raised guidance for fiscal 2018 quite notably: the new EPS range of $8.25-8.40 is a big boost from the previous estimate of $7.90-8.10. The company expects beer sales to continue to grow 9-11% through the remainder of fiscal 2018.

This result remains hotter than the 4-week, 12-week and 12-month ranges, but there is a clear hurricane effect within these numbers. That today’s total gets closer to the long-term range of 225-250K points to quality restoration efforts in Texas and Florida following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma last month, as well as impressive resilience in the U.S. labor market overall. Continuing claims stayed pretty flat week-over-week, at 1.938 million.Tomorrow’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report will bring us up to date on the unemployment rate and the breakdown of the labor market for the month of September.

Currently, Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank is looking for a headline BLS number of 156K, with 4.4% unemployment.August Trade BalanceWe see a downwardly revised figure this morning for the U.S. August Trade Balance (deficit), from -$43.6 billion last week to -$42.4 billion today. This 2.7% drop follows a further dwindling trade deficit from the previous week — another positive sign for the U.S. economy overall.Fed Officials SpeakThe market indexes continue to climb to higher all-time highs, with pre-market reads on the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all marginally higher this morning. In short, there appear to be no dampeners to this ongoing good fortune.And even as we hear from monetary authorities today, such as Fed Governor Jerome Powell, San Francisco Fed President John Williams, Philadelphia President Patrick Harker and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, as we do not see inflation metrics encroaching in any consistently meaningful ways, at this point we don’t expect much verbal bomb-throwing from the officials. Harker, just this morning, was quoted on CNBC as saying he is “still penciling in December” for the next Federal Reserve rate hike, but this statement was again qualified by what effect inflation wil have been having on the U.S. economy.

1176,STZ,"Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) posted robust second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top and bottom line topped estimates and improved year over year. Notably, this marked the 12th consecutive quarter of earnings beat for the company. Further, to perk up investors’ confidence management raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.Consequently, shares of Constellation Brands rallied nearly 6% in the pre-market trading session following the sturdy results. Further, driven by splendid past performance, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock jumped 31.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 20.7% growth.During the quarter, Constellation Brands benefited from efforts to drive consumer demand for its robust brand portfolio. Also, results were driven by contributions from acquisitions along with continued strength in the company’s beer business in particular.Q2 HighlightsThe company’s adjusted earnings for second-quarter fiscal 2018 surged 40% year over year to $2.47 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16. Reported earnings came in at $2.48 per share, up 42% year over year.Constellation Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteNet sales advanced 3% to $2,084.5 million, on the back of a rise of 8% in organic sales and gains from recent buyouts. Moreover, the top line was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,058 million, consequently returning to the beat trend after a miss in the prior quarter.Sales at the company’s beer business improved 12.8%, thanks to 11.7% rise in shipment volumes and depletions growth of 8.1%. Further, beer sales benefited from strong portfolio as well as successful key summer selling season driven by its ‘120 Days of Summer’ marketing campaign. This campaign aided the market share gains in the 4th of July holiday and through the rest of the summer season into the Labor Day.Wine and spirits’ sales fell 11.7%, due to lower shipment volumes and 0.9% decline in organic sales partly negated 5% rise in depletions. During the quarter, the U.S. shipment volume lagged depletion volumes, mainly due to the timing. Notably, the company’s recently acquired wine brands — The Prisoner and Charles Smith reported superb depletions growth of 30% and 74%, respectively. Also, the High West Whiskey portfolio delivered depletions growth of 37%.Cost and Margin PerformanceAdjusted gross profit for the quarter improved 9% year over year to $1,061.9 million. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 290 basis points (bps) to 50.9%.Constellation Brands' comparable operating income grew nearly 14% to $709.8 million with the comparable operating margin expanding 340 bps to 34.1%. This growth was backed by 26% operating income improvement at the beer segment, offset by operating income decline at the wine and spirits business. The beer segment gained from solid performance during the summer selling season, along with favorable pricing and foreign currency benefits. Meanwhile, operating income at the wine and spirits business was hurt by increased spending on marketing initiatives.Financial PositionConstellation Brands ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $125.6 million.

1177,STZ,"Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report) or FEMSA divested 5.24% of its total stake in the Heineken Group for roughly 2.5 billion euros. The equity offering, which is likely to be concluded on Sep 21, includes shares of Heineken N.V. (HEINY  -  Free Report) and its holding company, Heineken Holding N.V.Incidentally, in January 2010, FEMSA had exchanged its FEMSA Cerveza beer business for about 20% interest in the Heineken Group. Since then, the company has been gaining from its exposure in the beer space through its stake in the second largest brewer.That said, let’s delve deeper into yesterday’s announcement and see where FEMSA is headed.Transaction in DetailManagement at FEMSA stated that the equity sale will reduce its interest in Heineken N.V. from 12.53% to 8.63%. In Heineken Holding N.V., the company’s stake will go down to 12.26% from 14.94%. Consequently, FEMSA’s combined economic interest in the Heineken Group will be reduced to 14.76%.Notably, the equity offering include 22,485,000 and 7,700,000 shares of Heineken N.V. and Heineken Holding N.V., respectively, representing a 3.9% and 2.7% of the issued share capital. Further, the respective gross proceeds from these businesses amounted to 1.9 billion euros and 600 million euros.Meanwhile, L'Arche Green N.V. will buy back 2,564,102 shares of Heineken Holding N.V. in the offering, with the price of each share being decided by FEMSA. In fact, L'Arche Green is a firm through which the Heineken Family controls over Heineken Holding N.V. Therefore, this buyback highlights Heineken family’s commitment toward the company.Where’s FEMSA Headed?FEMSA has been optimistic about its prospects from investment in Heineken for a long time. Though this Mexico based company is lowering its stake in the world’s second largest brewer, it still remains a considerable stakeholder in Heineken. Additionally, FEMSA will continue being entitled to its current governance rights, which include a seat in the Heineken Holding N.V.’s board of directors and two seats in its supervisory board. Thus, this transaction will enhance FEMSA’s monetary position while retaining its governance rights in Heineken. Also, it will help the company to continue leveraging the favorable taxation issued by Mexico’s government, which can be afforded by the Repatriation Decree.Going forward, FEMSA intends to utilize the proceeds from this offering to fund its growth endeavors in Mexico. To this end, the company has been undertaking several strategic endeavors to fuel long-term growth.While stake in Heineken exposes FEMSA to the beer industry, the company gets its exposure to the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA. Notably, Coca-Cola FEMSA operates as the world’s largest franchise bottler for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) products.Moreover, the company’s share in the retail space relates to the operation of various small-format store chains including OXXO, through its FEMSA Comercio subsidiary. Apart from these, FEMSA provides logistics, point-of-sale refrigeration solutions and plastics solutions to its business units and third-party clients through its FEMSA Strategic Businesses subsidiary. These growth drivers, in turn, have helped the company’s shares surge 30.6% so far this year, surpassing the industry’s 16.2% growth.Hence, it seems that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is most likely to carry this momentum forward, even after reducing its second largest stake in Heineken Group.Meanwhile, investors can count on alcohol-beverage big-wig, Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report). The company with a robust earnings surprise history, holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1178,STZ,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) shares have been dismal for a while. The company’s shares have plunged 12.5% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 9.1%. Its performance has primarily been affected by weak organic sales trend in the North American region. During the first and second quarters of 2017, organic sales from the region declined owing to high competition, reduced promotional shipments and lower net pricing.Although organic sales have been positive in the developing and emerging markets, its growth rate has decelerated in the past few quarters. Further, consumer dynamics have also shifted negatively toward Kimberly-Clark’s diaper offerings. Rising input costs are also hurting the company’s margins. Owing to such challenges, Kimberly-Clark issued soft earnings guidance for the full year, when it reported second-quarter 2017 results. The company now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of $6.20-$6.35. Following the company’s discouraging performance and dull outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate also witnessed a downtrend in the past 60 days. In the said period, estimates for 2017 have gone down nine cents to reach $6.22. Also estimated earnings of $1.55 for the third quarter depict a decline of five cents.  Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been striving hard to spark a turnaround. Let’s look into some of the initiatives undertaken by the company to improve performance.Product Innovations Kimberly-Clark dedicatedly focuses on innovations and product launches to improve market share. Recently, the company launched its new Kleenex Reveal Countertop System under the Kimberly-Clark Professional segment, to offer improved and exceptional hygiene products. The company has been providing greater importance toward the improvement of its personal care products portfolio, especially feminine hygiene and diaper products. Innovations related to the Huggies brand has been initiated in several regions such as in Russia and China. In the near term, the company has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America, including upgrades on Huggies Snug and Dry diapers, Good Nights youth pants and Depend underwear. Savings Enhancing Initiatives Kimberly-Clark is also aggressively cutting costs through a program called Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE. The FORCE program has generated higher cost savings each year with $435 million in 2016, $365 million in 2015, $320 million in 2014, $310 million in 2013, $295 million in 2012 and $265 million in 2011. In fact, cost savings in 2016 exceeded the initial target of at least $350 million. For 2017, the company now expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425 to $450 million from the FORCE program, up from the prior estimate of $400 million.Restructuring efforts, which involve divestiture of lower-margin businesses and streamlining of manufacturing activities, have also resulted in significant savings for the company. Such efforts generated savings of $70 million in 2016, bringing the cumulative benefit to $140 million annually, compared with the original estimate for savings of $120-$140 million by the end of 2017.           Final Verdict We expect that the company’s innovation and restructuring efforts will aid toward driving its performance in the periods ahead. Moreover, the company currently carries a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 6.7%.Considering the pros and cons, Kimberly-Clark currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

1179,STZ,"Shares of Pinnacle Foods, Inc (PF  -  Free Report) have been underperforming of late, owing to underlying weaknesses in its Specialty segment and pickle business. The company’s share performance has remained dismal since it released second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, wherein sales were negatively impacted by the divestitures of its low-margin businesses.Further, shares of the company have also declined 3.5% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s fall of 1.5%.Investors seem to be disappointed with the company’s murky sales surprise history, whereby it missed estimates in 10 out of the past 14 quarters. Being a leading marketer and distributor of canned meat, shelf-stable pickles and frozen seafood, Pinnacle Foods has been struggling with consumers shift toward healthy and natural food products. Stiff competition, aggressive promotional spending and tight margins have also been bothering firms in the food industry.Considering its ongoing challenges, Pinnacle Foods now expects earnings for 2017 to be at the lower end of its expected range of $2.55-$2.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the forthcoming third-quarter 2017 results as well as for 2017 has also declined by a penny to reach 58 cents and $2.55 respectively, in the past 60 days. Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains hopeful on improving its performance backed by dedicated expansion initiatives. Let’s now delve into some of the efforts undertaken by the company to improve performance and the factors from which it has been gaining.Acquisitions Aiding Portfolio Expansion The acquisition of Boulder Brands, completed in January 2016, gave Pinnacle Foods a new growth platform for refrigerated foods and also added brands such as Udi's, Glutino, Smart Balance, Earth Balance and EVOL to the company’s portfolio. The benefits from the acquisition are expected to be spread over 2017, in areas such as procurement, manufacturing and logistics. The company received synergies of $15 million from the acquisition of Boulder Brand in 2016. It expects to achieve the same worth $15 million in 2017.The company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to expand its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. Few noteworthy acquisitions of the company in the past include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone salad dressings.Initiatives to Enhance Savings & Margins The company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. In fiscal 2016, the company’s operational excellence initiative drove productivity savings of 4%, as compared with 4.4% in fiscal 2015 and 3.7% in fiscal 2014.These productivity savings, along with higher pricing, have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins. The company continues to expect gross margin to improve 300 to 400 basis points by 2019.In order to enhance gross margin, Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives, including the improvement of its product mix through innovation. The company has also been exiting from low-margin businesses in order to utilize resources more efficiently.In this respect, the company had undertaken divestiture of Aunt Jemima frozen breakfast products in May 2017, and also closed down its Boulder UK operations in November 2016. Such rationalizing efforts have negatively impacted the company’s top line of late, in the long run. These initiatives are expected to aid Pinnacle Foods to focus specifically on growth oriented businesses.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

1181,STZ,"The Finish Line, Inc.  is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 22. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this specialty retailer of athletic footwear, activewear and accessories will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Well, Finish Line's bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, by an average of 14.5%. This seems to be the reason as why the company has slumped 42.8% so far this year, wider than the industry’s 22.8% decline.  So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 11 cents, which is way below the year-ago period figure of 55 cents. Moreover, we note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined sharply over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $470.5 million, down 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayFinish Line recently posted disappointing preliminary numbers for the second quarter, which compelled management to lower its guidance for fiscal 2018. Management stated that the athletic space witnessed intense promotional activities in the quarter, which weighed upon sales and gross margin. Sales in the quarter dropped 3.3% to $469.4 million owing to a 4.6% fall in comparable store sales (comps). Further the gross margin remained pressurized on account of soft sales and greater markdowns. Consequently, the company envisions the second-quarter earnings to lie in a band of 8-12 cents per share. The company expects the retail space to remain extremely competitive and promotional in the remainder of fiscal 2018. The Finish Line, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  The Finish Line, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | The Finish Line, Inc. QuoteWhile Finish Line remains committed toward effective inventory and expense management, and developing omni-channel capacities, the aforementioned hurdles make us apprehensive about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Finish Line is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Finish Line currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 11 cents.  Further, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. The combination of Finish Line’s unfavorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Constellation Brands, Inc.

1182,STZ,"Despite of the harmful effects, alcohol stocks have been performing quite well of late. The rise in demand for flavored whisky, premium tequilas and spirits seems to be doing the trick for the industry. In fact, in the alcohol market, the spirits segment has been gaining momentum, accounting for about 36% of the total alcohol market.However, Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is one stock in the industry that has been in the red zone for quite some time now as can be seen from its dismal earnings and sales surprise history. Disappointing volumes, weak margins and significant currency headwinds amid difficult economy and competitive pressure have been the major deterrents.Notably, Molson Coors is making efforts to bring the stock back on growth trajectory. The company is focusing on increasing its marketing for beers and targeting above-premium brands to help grow its market share. Further, the company’s recent agreements with Heineken and Hornell Brewing are in line with Molson Coors’ current business expansion initiatives and are expected to enhance its portfolio. However, looking at the headwinds and the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), it seems that these initiatives are yet to bear fruits.If we analyze the share price performance of the company on a year-to-date basis, we note that the stock hasunderperformed both the industry and the broader Consumer Staples sector in the said time frame. The stock has declined nearly 10% against the industry’s gain of 22.3%. Meanwhile, the sector, of which they are part of, has improved 7.3%.Let’s now take a closer look at the challenges that the company is grappling with, which makes it a no-no for investors.Weak Earnings and Sales HistoryMolson Coors has a dismal track record of earnings. The company has reported negative earnings surprises in five of the trailing seven quarters. Sales have also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 out the last 14 quarters.Molson Coors posted weaker-than-expected earnings in second-quarter 2017, while revenues marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While earnings increased 3.1% from the prior-year figure driven by increased brand volume, higher net pricing, positive sales mix, cost savings and lower marketing spending, sales dipped 0.6% year over year due to a 0.2% fall in net sales per hectoliter. Currency also had a negative impact of $57.3 million on overall sales.The company has also seen significant downward estimate revision following the lower-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone down 33.5% to $4.34 in 2017 and down 29.8% to $4.78 in 2018 in the past 60 days.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteContinued Decline in VolumesMolson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trends in the United States, Canada and Europe for the last few years. Though the acquisition of the Miller global brands (in October 2016) has boosted sales in Europe and international regions, volume continued to decline in Canada.Among the core brands, while Miller Lite and Staropramen brands witnessed volume growth, Carling volume in Europe decreased by 2.6% during second-quarter 2017 and Coors Light global brand volume decreased 2.2% due to lower brand volume in the United States and Canada, slightly offset by strong growth in Europe and International.The volume declines in Canada are attributed to the overall weak industry performance along with the ongoing competitive pressure in Quebec and Ontario and a continued shift in consumer preference to value brands in the West. Molson Canadian volume in Canada also decreased 5.5% in the quarter due to overall weak industry conditions and competitive pressures in the West and Ontario.Since 2001, the premium beer segment in Canada has been gradually losing volume to the above premium and value segments. Aging population, a stalled economy and strong competition from other alcohol beverages led to the decline. The termination of the Modelo brands agreement in Canada in February 2014 also resulted in volume decline. In the United States, the company suffered declines due to reduced labor participation rates and lower consumer confidence.Though economic conditions improved slightly, competition from outside the beer category persisted. In Europe too, the company has been witnessing volume declines since 2013 due to a shift from the higher margin on-premise channel to the lower margin off-premise channel. The loss of the Modelo brands in the U.K. in 2015 is also contributing to lower volumes.Foreign Currency HeadwindsThe company is also plagued by currency headwinds due to the recent weakening of many foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable foreign currency translations impacted sales by more than $180 million in 2016 and will continue to deter the company’s profits in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the same space may consider some better-ranked stocks like Boston Beer Company Inc.

1183,STZ,"United Natural Foods, Inc’s (UNFI  -  Free Report) shares have returned 8.8% since the company reported upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 13. United Natural has been benefiting from increased consumer preference for natural and organic brands, despite industry concerns such as stiff competition, aggressive promotional spending and tight margins that are bothering most of the grocery firms. The company’s top line has also been gaining from strategic acquisitions.Altogether, such factors have also been aiding the company’s price performance over the past three months. United Natural’s shares have surged 14.1% in the said time frame, compared with the industry’s decline of 1.9%.Let’s now delve into some of the factors that have been impacting United Natural’s performance of late.Acquisitions - A Major Growth DriverAcquisitions have been one of the primary growth drivers for United Natural over the past few years. The acquisition of Haddon House (May 2016) and Gourmet Guru (August 2016) have helped the company boost sales by 5.7% during the fourth quarter of 2017. Such acquisitions have aided United Natural to expand distribution network, customer base, launch new brands as well as expand its footprint in key markets.Few other major acquisitions of the company in the past include Nor-Cal Produce, Inc, Tony’s Fine Foods (in July 2014), Trudeau Foods (in September 2013) and SunOpta Inc (in June 2010).Consumer Shift Toward Organic & Natural FoodThe growth rate of the natural products industry has outpaced the same for the overall food-at-home industry in recent times, as a result of increasing demand for healthy lifestyle, food safety and environmental sustainability. The company’s e-commerce channel is also witnessing growth in natural and organic food products. This rapid adoption rate of organic products has led to new opportunities for United Natural and has resulted in increased shelf space across a growing number of retailers.Efficiency Enhancing Efforts The company has also been on track with reducing its operating expenses and enhancing operating efficiency including initiatives to exit from less-profitable businesses. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, United Natural sold off its stake in Kicking Horse Coffee business. The sale generated profits of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and contributed toward improving the company’s bottom line. Bottom LineNotably, the food industry is undergoing dramatic changes after the acquisition of Whole Foods Market by online biggie Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). It has also resulted in uncertainty over United Natural’s partnership agreement with Whole Foods for the distribution of the latter’s products.Nevertheless, we expect that United Natural’s consistent efforts to drive its organic and natural food products sales through acquisitions and restructuring will aid the company toward overcoming such challenges and thereby sustain growth momentum.Considering the pros and cons, United Natural currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

1185,STZ,"Of late, the Consumer Staples sector has been witnessing rising consumer confidence, backed by improving economic and labor market conditions as well rising GDP numbers.  This has further triggered an increase in consumers spending power. Apart from purchasing essential items such as grocery, food and beverage products, consumers are also seen to spend heavily on apparel items, personal care and beauty products.  Moreover, luxury spending is also aided by the increasing preference for e-commerce.While such trends have been benefiting cosmetics companies like The Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report) and Nu Skin Enterprises Inc (NUS  -  Free Report), other companies in the industry are still struggling with competitive pressures. One such company is Coty Inc (COTY  -  Free Report). We observed that Coty’s shares have declined close to 14% since it announced its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 22. Moreover, the company’s shares have declined more than 9% in the past six months against the industry’s gain of 11.3%.Headwinds Impacting the Company                                   Although the company’s strategic acquisitions, including ghd and Younique, have aided its top-line expansion, such measures have also increased the company’s marketing spending and have led to an increase in its fixed cost structure.In addition to increased operational expenditures, Coty’s segments have not depicted growth during fiscal 2017. In fact, its Consumer Beauty segment has remained sluggish since the past few quarters. The segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges, especially in North America, driven by a combination of weak market trends across several of its categories and some reduction of shelf space for few brands like Astor.Additionally, increasing competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences have been hurting the company’s performance. In particular, declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the United States and mass fragrance in Western Europe and in the domestic market are expected to impact business. Dismal Earnings Trend & Estimate Revisions We note that Coty has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 27.7%. Sales have also lagged estimates in two out of the past four quarters.Estimate revisions have also been down trending owing to ongoing challenges. Estimate for the forthcoming first-quarter fiscal 2018 has declined 18 cents to reach 7 cents, in the past thirty days, while the same for fiscal 2018 has also gone down 22 cents to reach 69 cents.  Coty’s ScorecardSome of the key financial ratios of Coty are also observed to be weaker than the industry, as depicted in the scorecard below.Final ThoughtsAlthough Coty has been working towards improving its segments and achieving a turnaround from its sluggish performance, the transition is expected to take time. Further, Coty carries a VGM Score of D and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating that the stock is currently not a safe pick for investors.Looking For Consumer Staples Stock?

1187,STZ,"Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) has decided to invest $45 million in its cooperage located at MacLean Avenue in Louisville, KY, in order to manufacture high-quality barrels. In addition to giving the cooperage a facelift, the investment will help in lowering operating costs and enhancing efficiency.As part of the modernization, the company plans to install new equipment that will ease the work of the Heading and Staving departments. This will attract elimination of 70 jobs after complete implementation in early 2019. Following the revamp, the facility will still hold 205 employees. The company plans to offer the affected employees transitional support.Through this investment, the company will not only retain the competitive advantage producing its own barrels but also improve the long-term viability of the Louisville plant and minimize accidents.Established in 1945, Brown-Forman’s cooperage crafts more than 2,500 barrels per day. In fact, the cooperage has been lending unique flavors to the company’s bourbon for more than 70 years now. It is used to age spirits like Jack Daniel’s, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Early Times, Canadian Mist, el Jimador and Herradura.Apart from having a cooperage in Louisville, Brown-Forman also has a cooperage in Decatur, AL. Here, the company crafts barrels for its premium brand, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey.Brown-Forman’s PerformanceBrown-Forman looks appeasing backed by its sturdy portfolio, solid strategies and robust outlook for the year. This spirits maker is poised to gain from its industry growth trends as well.Going forward, the company plans to expand Jack Daniel's market share in the developed markets as well as emerging markets, where the whiskey category is in the early stages of development. Additionally, it is on track to expand the sphere of other brands, alongside entering the fastest-growing spirit category, the Irish Whiskey.Therefore, we believe Brown-Forman is well-positioned to gain from the ongoing industry trends driven by strength in its premium American whiskey and tequila brands, along with its Jack Daniel’s trademark.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have rallied 8.1% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.8%.

The industry has recently witnessed the spirits segment gathering momentum, accounting for about 36% of the total alcohol market, grabbing share from beer and wine sales. (Read More: Cheers to These 5 Alcohol Stocks Gaining on Industry Boom)One such stock is Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report), which has been witnessing strong growth driven by rising demand for beverages. In fact, this leading global manufacturer and seller of alcohol beverages recently hit a 52-week high of $137.59 on Sep 12, eventually closing at $137.35. We believe that the company’s dedicated efforts to expand business through acquisitions and focus on high margin brands has aided it to reach a new high.

In June 2017, the company announced the acquisition of Casamigos, one of the fastest-growing premium tequila brands in the United States. This buyout is likely to strengthen Diageo's market share in the tequila category along with the existing Don Julio brand, acquired in February 2015. Notable acquisitions in the past includes; De Leon Comb Wine & Spirits, United Spirits Limited, Mey Içki, Shui Jing Fang and Halico.Gains from Emerging Markets Diageo, like most other multinationals, is turning attention to the emerging markets. It is the leading international spirits company in markets of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Moreover, the company has been successful in the emerging regions by catering to local tastes. Its products like Johnnie Walker and Blue Label, have been customized according to the local palate in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Brazil and Mexico.Focus on High-Margin Brands Diageo puts greater emphasis on high-margin products as they have been depicting strong growth globally. During first-half fiscal 2017, the company’s premium brands delivered growth of approximately 6% while the super deluxe brands went up 5%. Also in accordance with this strategy, management has resorted to disposing less productive brands and non-core assets.Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

1192,STZ,"Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) has emerged as a strong contender in the beverages – alcohol space, thanks to its spectacular earnings history, sound fundamentals and long-term EPS growth rate of 18.2%. So, let’s take a closer look at the factors that have been driving this New York-based company.  Superb Earnings History & Outlook Indicate Solid ProspectsConstellation Brands’ bottom line has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.7% in the trailing four quarters. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company marked its 11th consecutive positive earnings surprise and 16th straight quarter of year-over-year improvement. Results benefited from Constellation Brands’ efforts to drive demand for its impressive brands. Also, results were backed by contributions from acquisitions along with continued strength in the company’s beer business in particular. Moreover, lower cost of goods sold, improved pricing and volumes boosted margins in the quarter. Notably, the company has delivered gross and operating margin growth in the trailing four quarters.These factors, along with confidence in its beer business encouraged management to raise its earnings view for fiscal 2018, clearly underscoring its solid prospects. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90–$8.10 per share, compared with its previous guidance range of $7.70–$8.00.Strong Beer Business Remains a Growth DriverAs mentioned above, Constellation Brands has been gaining immensely from its beer business. Notably, the company was the highest growth contributor in the U.S. beer category for the fourth straight year, in fiscal 2017. In the last reported quarter, sales at this segment improved 8%, thanks to higher volumes and favorable pricing. Further, beer sales were backed by the company’s solid brands which witnessed depletions of nearly 12%.  Apart from this, Constellation Brands is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. In this regard, management expects solid results from its Ballast Point craft beer brand, which is currently placed among the top 20 craft brands nationwide. Apart from Constellation Brands, other industry players like Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), The Boston Beer Company Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) have also made attempts to grow in the craft beer space.Coming back to Constellation Brands, the company raised its fiscal 2018 operating income target for its beer segment, now anticipating it to grow 13–15%, compared with the prior guidance of 11–13%.Robust Brands & Focus on Buyouts Bodes WellConstellation Brands has a formidable portfolio of well-known brands and is the largest wine company in the world. The company remains focused on expanding operations directed toward achieving business growth. Incidentally, last week, the company announced the acquisition of Funky Buddha Brewery, a leading craft brewery in Florida. This move is aimed at strengthening its position in the high-end beer segment in the U.S. The company’s buyout of Obregon Brewery to bolster its high-end Mexican beer portfolio, is another evidence of its focus on achieving growth via acquisitions. Moving to its spirits and wines business, Constellation Brands acquired America’s highest rated Schrader Cellars in June 2017 to enhance this portfolio. Moreover, in fiscal 2017, the company acquired and integrated High West Distillery, Charles Smith Wines and The Prisoner Wine Company brands, which marked its entry in the premium craft whiskey space.Well, we believe that these factors, along with healthy cash flows and shareholder-friendly moves are likely to help Constellation Brands maintain its spot in investors’ portfolio.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1193,STZ,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) has been in troubled waters for quite some time now as evident from its dismal earnings and sales surprise history. Lower volumes and significant currency headwinds amid difficult economy and competitive pressure have been the other major dampeners.If we analyze the share price performance of the company over the last six months, we note that the stock has underperformed both the industry and the broader Consumer Staples sector in the said time frame. The stock has declined 6.3% against the industry’s gain of 10.4%. Meanwhile, the sector, of which they are part of, has improved 7.3%. Let’s now take a closer look at the challenges that the company is grappling with rendering it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Weak Earnings and Sales TrendMolson Coors does not have a good track record of earnings. The company has reported negative earnings surprises in five of the trailing seven quarters. Sales have also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 out the last 14 quarters.Downward Estimate RevisionThe company has also seen significant downward estimate revision following the lower-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is going down 21.8% to $4.35 in 2017 and down 20.2% to $4.77 in 2018 in the past seven days.Continued Decline in VolumesMolson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trends in U.S., Canada and Europe for the last few years. Though the acquisition of the Miller global brands has boosted sales in Europe and international regions, volume continued to decline in Canada.Among the core brands, while Miller Lite and Staropramen brands witnessed volume growth, Carling volume in Europe decreased by 2.6% during second-quarter 2017 and Coors Light global brand volume decreased 2.2% due to lower brand volume in the U.S. and Canada, slightly offset by strong growth in Europe and International. The declines in Canada are attributed to the overall weak industry performance along with the ongoing competitive pressure in Quebec and Ontario and a continued shift in consumer preference to value brands in the West. Molson Canadian volume in Canada also decreased 5.5% in the quarter due to overall weak industry conditions and competitive pressures in the West and Ontario.Since 2001, the premium beer segment in Canada has been gradually losing volume to the above premium and value segments. Aging population, a stalled economy and strong competition from other alcohol beverages led to the decline. The termination of the Modelo brands agreement in Canada in Feb 2014 also resulted in volume decline. In the U.S., the company suffered declines due to reduced labor participation rates and lower consumer confidence.Though economic conditions improved slightly, competition from outside the beer category persisted. In Europe, the company witnessed volume declines since 2013, as volumes continued to shift from the higher margin on-premise channel to the lower margin off-premise channel. The loss of the Modelo brands in the U.K. in 2015 is also contributing to lower volume.Weak EBITDA MarginsCNBC had pointed weak EBITDA guidance during investors meeting in June. Per reports, the company now expects underlying EBITDA margins to grow 30–60 bps per year for the next three to four years. This is weaker than the company’s previous expectation of 50–60 bps per year for the next three years, as announced during earnings conference.Foreign Currency HeadwindsWith a major portion of its revenues coming from outside the U.S., the company’s profits are being affected by currency headwinds due to the recent weakening of many foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable foreign currency translations impacted sales by more than $180 million in 2016 and will continue to negatively impact the company’s profits in the near term.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteBottom LineMolson Coors’ management is leaving no stone unturned to bring the stock back on growth trajectory. The company is focusing on increasing its marketing for beers and targeting above-premium brands to help grow its market share.Further, the company’s recent agreements with Heineken and Hornell Brewing are in line with Molson Coors’ current business expansion initiatives and are expected to enhance its portfolio. However, whether these ongoing initiatives will be able to spark a turnaround in the company’s performance is a wait-and-watch story.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the same space may consider some better-ranked stocks like Inter Parfums, Inc.

1194,STZ,"Benchmarks suffered their worst one-day percentage drop since the middle of May. The Dow not only lost grip of the psychological 22,000 level but also finished near session lows. Losses in shares of Apple and Goldman Sachs weighed on the blue-chip index. The S&P 500 also ended in the red after a broad based sell off ensued due to rising tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. Decline in shares of technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq and dragged it lower as well.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,844.01, declining by 0.9% or 204.69 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.5%, decreasing 35.81 points to close at 2,438.21. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,216.87, slipping 135.46 points or 2.1%. A total of around 6.48 billion shares were traded on Thursday, above the last 20-session average of 7.5 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 6-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 3.60-to-1 ratio.Benchmarks Slip to Worst Levels since mid-MayDow lost grip of the psychological 22,000 milestone on Thursday to finish near the session lows. This was triggered by plunging shares of tech behemoth Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), which lost 3.2% and 2.4% respectively. Only three of the 30 components which make up the blue-chip index finished in the positive territory. Losses were primarily attributable to a broad-based sell-off as tension between Washington and Pyongyang escalated. Investors are now looking to take profits off the table after what has been a good earnings season. This decline comes a week after the Dow crossed the 22,000 landmark for the first time.The S&P 500 exhibited a steep decline after ten of its eleven primary sectors finished in the red on Thursday. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) nosedived about 2.0% followed by Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) which declined 1.8%. The index has also fallen below its 50-day moving average for the first time in a month. This is also the S&P 500’s worst performance after it fell 1.8% in the middle of May. This dip came as a shock given the fact that the index was down just 0.1% for the entire week entering into the session.The Nasdaq finished in negative territory due to falling tech shares. Shares of Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) all declined due during the selloff which ensued because of the ongoing geopolitical tussle.North Korea Dismisses Trump’s WarningsEarlier in the week President Trump commented that North Korea would face “fire and fury” if the renegade country continues threatening the US. On Thursday, North Korea dismissed these claims as “load of nonsense” and continued threatening the U.S. by laying out plans to attack the Guam Naval base and announcing it to the media.Investors were worried by such developments and all three benchmarks closed lower for the third day in a row. The Dow is trading 1.2% off its closing record, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are 1.7% and 3.2% respectively off their all-time highs. Thursday also marked the worst one-day percentage drop of the benchmarks.Stocks That Made HeadlinesNordstrom Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, Stock Jumps 2.8%Nordstrom Inc.

1195,STZ,"Pinnacle Foods, Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its acquisitions and productivity enhancing initiatives to drive margins. However, the company’s growth remains challenged due to sluggish Specialty Segment and Pickle business.Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been impacting the company’s performance.Acquisitions & Innovation Aiding PerformanceAcquisitions have been a prime growth driver for Pinnacle Foods in the past few years. Through the acquisition of Boulder Brand (completed in 2016), the company achieved synergies of $15 million in 2016 and is expected to achieve synergies of $15 million in 2017. This will benefit both gross margin and SG&A overhead. Also, some of the earlier notable acquisitions of Pinnacle Foods include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone salad dressings business.Pinnacle Foods has also been innovating products to offer variety and maintain market share. Some popular innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits and Birds Eye product lines. In fact, during the second quarter, the company launched Perfect Size for One, a unique baking solution kit and Vlasic purely pickles. It also launched five new platforms in the second quarter of 2017 to ensure continued momentum of the Birds Eye franchise.Initiatives Inducing Productivity & Savings The company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. In fiscal 2016, the company’s operational excellence initiative drove productivity savings of 4.0%, as compared with 4.4% in fiscal 2015. Such savings related initiatives have also been aiding the company to offset input cost inflation, thereby improving gross margin. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives such as expanding its product mix through innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization.The company’s growth initiatives have positively impacted its share price performance. Shares of Pinnacle Foods have increased 16.1% in the last 12 months against the industry’s decline of 13.8%.Sluggish Segment & Other Headwinds Impacting Performance Pinnacle Foods’ Specialty segment has been witnessing weakness since four consecutive quarters now. In the second quarter of 2017, sales in the segment declined 15.1% due to reduced volume/mix and the exit of low-margin businesses such as Aunt Jemima. Further, management expects the Specialty segment to remain challenged in the upcoming quarters due to sales loss from divestitures. The company has witnessed sluggishness in Pickle business due to continued competitive environment in the form of pricing and innovation. Although the company has been undertaking innovations to improve the performance of the Pickles business, the turnaround is expected to take some time.Additionally, regular innovations have led to increased product introductory costs. Enhanced investment in consumer marketing and input cost inflation also adds to expenses. Moreover, Pinnacle Foods has been dealing with macroeconomic headwinds including stiff competition and a general shift in consumer preferences toward healthier food items.Bottom LineDespite such headwinds impacting the company’s performance, we remain hopeful that its consistent productivity initiatives and business expansion strategies through innovation and acquisitions will yield significant results and continue aiding growth.Pinnacle Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More?

1196,STZ,"Celebrations of any kind call for a toast. Rightly, the Alcohol industry seems to be raising a toast to booming trends, albeit the negative promotions on the evils of drinking.Recent observations reveal that alcohol sales trends have been witnessing a change, with a rise in demand for more flavored products like the honey and cinnamon flavored whiskeys and higher-priced tequilas. The industry has recently witnessed the spirits segment gathering momentum, accounting for about 36% of the total alcohol market, grabbing some share from beer and wine sales.However, beer still accounts for 47% of the market share as craft beer and Mexican imports remained popular throughout 2016 and into 2017. In the 1990s, beer commanded about 60% of the total alcohol industry’s share. Moreover, wine currently holds nearly 17% market share.Per the Distilled Spirits Council, the distilled spirits business witnessed 2.4% volumes growth to 220 cases in 2016. Supplier spirits sales were up 4.5% to $25.2 billion for the year.American Whiskey Gets PopularAmerican whiskey, which includes Bourbon, Tennessee and Rye, has been getting popular among the U.S. consumers. The reason for this rise in popularity was change in customers’ preference toward new flavors. Volumes for American whiskey grew 9.8% in 2016, with sales improving 7.7% to $3.1 billion. This has been working well for spirit makers like Brown-Forman backing the Jack Daniels and Woodford Reserve brands.In fact, Brown-Forman’s sales beat in the recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 was driven by strength in its premium American whiskey and tequila brands, along with its Jack Daniel’s trademark. Further, growth is likely to come from new product launches including the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye and Slane Irish Whiskey.Craft Spirits Era is HereFurther, a recent trend analysis reveals that the craft beer segment has almost matured and spirits lovers are now looking for the craft essence in spirits. Evidently, the craft experiment of producers with the spirits is working and customers like it. Consequently, there has been a rise of craft distilleries in the industry. Further, big names like Constellation Brands are looking to explore the craft spirits segment.Evidently, the company recently acquired and integrated High West Distillery, Charles Smith Wines and The Prisoner Wine Company brands, which marked its entry in the premium craft whiskey space. It also made small investments in Catoctin Creek Distilling Company and Bardstown Bourbon Company.How Well is the Alcohol Industry Positioned?The industry growth trends since the start of 2017 have been very appeasing. Markedly, the Alcohol industry recorded 18.9% growth year to date, comfortably outpacing the 10.5% upside of the S&P 500 market.Further, the Zacks Industry Rank is 17 (out of 256) places it at the top 7% of the Zacks Classified industries.Alcohol Stocks Worth Buying NowAll said, we hand-picked five Alcohol stocks that are positioned to benefit from the ongoing industry trends.

1197,STZ,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) has been struggling with a tough retail environment, laden with stiff competition and an aggressive promotional environment. Such factors have been denting the company’s top line. We note that sales have been lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 10 straight quarters now. With these aspects in mind, let’s now have a look into factors which have been impacting the company’s performance.Grocery Market Headwinds Impacting Performance The grocery industry is currently facing a tough time. The industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition, tight margins and aggressive promotional environment. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rival companies, which are strengthening their franchises and are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Customers are also becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low-cost alternatives to national brands, which are hurting the food companies.Such industry-wide headwinds are also expected to dent the company’s top line and margins, going ahead. The company’s gross margins have also remained challenged owing to stiff competition both in retail and wholesale.The ongoing industry challenges have also taken a toll upon the company’s share price performance. Over the past six months, shares of the company have plunged 23.7%, wider than the industry’s decline of 8.5%.Will Initiatives Spark a Turnaround? United Natural is focusing on acquisitions in order to expand presence in key urban markets as well as develop new organic brands, backed by increased resource strength and operating scale. The recent acquisitions of Haddon House and Gourmet Guru have aided the company to improve sales. Further, the company has also been working toward improving its operational efficiencies through its restructuring plan that was announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.While United Natural is benefiting from its acquisitions and restructuring initiatives, the same have not been able to completely offset the disadvantages arising out of the difficult grocery environment, leading to a soft sales trend.  Owing to such headwinds, management lowered its sales guidance and expects the same in the range of $9.29-$9.34 billion for fiscal 2017, which is lower than the earlier projection of $9.38-$9.46 billion.Given the greater disadvantages associated with the company, it currently carries a Zacks Rank # 4 (Sell) and is therefore not a favorable pick for investors.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

1198,STZ,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 14, before the opening bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this global food products maker and distributor will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. We note that the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 6.9%.Let’s delve deeper on how things are shaping up for this announcement. Which Way are Estimates Treading? A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days at 71 cents and $2.47, respectively.Estimated earnings for the fourth quarter depict a year-on-year growth of 11.2%, while the same for fiscal 2017 is estimated to grow 17.8%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of 14.23 billion for the fourth quarter, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Sysco is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Sysco has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 71 cents.

However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteFactors Influencing the Quarter Sysco’s strategic acquisitions, especially London-based Brakes acquisition in Jul 2016 have aided the growth of its distribution network, customer base and drive long-term growth. In fact, this acquisition is likely to be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by low to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. Such acquisitions have significantly improved the company’s top-line.Sysco has also been managing its expenses quite efficiently since the past few years. We are impressed with the fact that Sysco has delivered higher gross margins for eight consecutive quarters now, on the back of SG&A and supply chain process improvements.  Further, the company remains on track to achieve the recently raised three-year adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of FY18.However, Sysco has been facing deflationary pressure for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters. The trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation from third-quarter fiscal 2017. Though the company is anticipating overall modest inflation in the fourth quarter, the impact on the company might take little more time. The grocery/supermarket business is also grappling with stiff competition, aggressive promotional environment and reduced store traffic.Such industry wide headwinds have hurt the company’s share prices. Nevertheless, the decline was narrower than the industry owing to its strong fundamentals. We note that Sysco’s shares have declined 1% over the last one year, narrower than the industry that fell 10.2%. This makes it quite evident that the company’s growth strategy is paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are bearing fruit.Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

The Reckitt’s food division is also expected to result in combined pro forma 2017 annual net sales of approximately $5 billion.The acquisition of Reckitt’s food division, if it materializes, will significantly boost the company’s robust spices portfolio with iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce, French's Mustard, French's Crispy Vegetables and Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce.

1201,STZ,"McCormick & Company, Inc.’s (MKC  -  Free Report) strategic growth efforts which include acquisitions and innovation have been boosting its portfolio. Moreover, its cost saving initiatives has significantly aided improving profitability. Nevertheless, raw material cost inflation and weak sales in the U.K region have raised concerns for sustaining the company’s performance.Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been aiding the company’s performance and hindering its growth.    Acquisitions & Innovations Aiding Growth McCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio. It recently completed the acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a British consumer products company. The acquisition is expected to significantly boost the company’s robust spices portfolio with iconic brands like Frank's RedHot and French's Mustard that hold top positions in their respective categories in the United States and Canada. The buyout will position McCormick as one of the leading companies in the U.S. condiments category. In the past, the company has made several acquisitions including Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (both carried out in 2016). The buyouts have aided the company to expand its distribution network and increase brand investment.McCormick has also been investing in innovation in order to develop healthy food products as consumers turn toward fresh food items. In this respect, the company has been partnering with government and trade agencies. It is also shaping up its portfolio with gluten free, non-GMO and organic products to satisfy the evolving needs of consumers.Cost Saving Initiatives The company’s dedicated focus toward cost savings is quite evident from the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $109 million in 2016, up from $98 million in 2015. Further, it expects to deliver cost savings of at least $100 million in fiscal 2017 and savings of around $400 million by Nov 30, 2019. McCormick uses its CCI savings to increase investments and productivity, thereby leading to higher sales and profits.Headwinds Posing concerns McCormick has been suffering from higher input costs since past many quarters. Prices of raw materials such as vanilla, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and rice, as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing, and thereby affecting McCormick’s margins. For fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. Further, the company’s sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) have remained sluggish of late due to difficult economic, political and competitive factors. Moreover, its business in the U.K has been sluggish as large retailers reduce shelf space for food products to gain space for general merchandise.Owing to such headwinds, the company’s shares have underperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector in the past six months. Shares of the company have declined 3.8% in comparison to the sectors gain of 2.4%. Bottom-Line                                                                                                                          We believe that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential to offset these headwinds. The company’s higher brand marketing, increased pricing, new products, expanded distribution and acquisitions are expected to contribute to the growth, in the forth coming periods. Further, the company anticipates pricing actions to offset an anticipated mid-single digit increase in material costs. The company also expects lower currency impact on fiscal 2017 sales. Moreover in an effort to improve EMEA regions dismal performance, the company had resorted to undertaking streamlining actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

1202,STZ,"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) has been displaying disappointing performance lately, owing to unfavorable market conditions, evolving consumer buying pattern and operating inefficiencies. These factors had a negative impact upon the company’s recently reported second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, post which share price have declined 21.2%. Moreover, shares of the company have plunged 22.8% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 8.5%.Let’s now take a deeper look into the factors that have been hindering TreeHouse Foods’ performance for a while now.Dismal Second-Quarter Results, Slashed GuidanceAlthough TreeHouse Foods’ second-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the same declined year-over-year owing to unfavorable market conditions and pricing lag from commodity cost increases. Operating inefficiencies related to lower-than-anticipated volumes had also affected the company’s performance during the second quarter.Sales were hurt due to the divestiture of the SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business and currency headwinds. Despite the overall improvement in the U.S. economy, consumer spending continues to remain challenged. Specifically, retail food volumes continue to be weak compared with overall consumer spending. Including the divestiture impact and considering a difficult retail landscape, the company lowered its full-year guidance.Industry Wide Headwinds Impacting Performance Of late, the grocery industry has been challenged with stiff competition and an aggressive promotional environment. Moreover, the recent approval of Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout of Whole Foods Market has shaken the industry, as it is expected to change the retail landscape. Additionally, Amazon’s move to lower grocery prices is also expected to aggravate pricing pressure and would further squeeze profit margins of smaller industry players like TreeHouse Foods.TreeHouse Foods has also been incurring higher operating costs due to increased commodity prices of products like oils, nuts and coffee. Acquisitions and additional investments have also raised the company’s expense structure.Bottom LineAlthough the company has been undertaking cost saving and restructuring efforts as part of its ‘TreeHouse 2020 Initiative’, the same includes offloading low-margin businesses that reduces the company’s sales and productivity volumes. Also these initiatives are yet to bear a significant impact upon its performance. Moreover, unfavorable industry conditions, combined with pricing and volume pressures make us less hopeful regarding TreeHouse Foods’ recovery.Owing to such factors, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is therefore not a safe bet for investors.Done With TreeHouse Foods?

In fact, the bottom-line results reflected a turnaround from the dismal earnings reported in the prior quarter.Adjusted earnings of 46 cents jumped nearly 27% and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents.Net sales improved about 9% year over year to $723 million, after deducting excise taxes. However, on an underlying basis (excluding negative currency impact and other adjustments), sales increased 6% that marked the fourth straight quarterly growth. Moreover, the company’s sales, before accounting for excise taxes, came in at $929 million, up 8% from the prior-year figure of $856 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $685.3 million.Brown Forman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Brown Forman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Brown Forman Corporation QuoteThe company’s robust underlying sales performance came on the back of strong portfolio of premium American whiskey brands, along with its Jack Daniel’s trademark. Further, net sales gained from solid growth rates in both developed and emerging markets. During the quarter, the impact of foreign currency on net sales growth was relatively lower.Brown-Forman rose nearly 2.5% in the pre-market trading session following the earnings release. However, Brown-Forman shares have declined 1.4% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s increase of 3.4%.Quarter in DetailBrown-Forman’s gross profit increased nearly 9% to $493 million, while gross margin contracted 30 basis points (bps) to 68.2%. However, underlying gross profit improved 6%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses dipped 1% from the year-ago quarter figure to $161 million, both on a reported and underlying basis. This was mainly driven by stringent cost controls.However, advertising expenses rose 9% year over year to $89 million, while underlying advertising costs increased 6%. The rise in advertising costs is attributed to rise in investments for the Jack Daniels family of brands and further growth of the fast growing bourbon and tequila brands.Nevertheless, operating income grew 14% to $244 million, with operating margin expanding 150 bps to 33.7%. On an underlying basis too, operating income of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased 12%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowBrown-Forman ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $238 million, long-term debt of $1,720 million and total debt of $1,978 million.

The dividend is payable on Oct 2, 2017, to shareholders on record as of Sep 7.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceGoing forward, the company expects the volatile global economic and geopolitical environment, particularly in the emerging markets as well as intensified competition in the developed economies to hinder results. However, the company remains confident of persistent growth in underlying net sales and operating income in fiscal 2018 and consequently reiterated guidance. Moreover, the company raised earnings per share projections for the fiscal.Management continues to project 4-5% growth in underlying sales mainly backed by growth of its premium American whiskey and tequila brands, comprising innovation for Jack Daniel’s RTDs. Further, growth is likely to come from new product launches including the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye and Slane Irish Whiskey.The company expects SG&A expense on an underlying basis to remain flat, driven by smooth execution of cost-control initiatives.Underlying operating income is anticipated to increase in range of 6-8%. Further, the company now estimates earnings per share in the range of $1.85-$1.95, compared with the previous guidance of $1.80-$1.90.

1204,STZ,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) has not been able to gain investor confidence this earnings season. Although the recent acquisitions make them hopeful, higher marketing spend and fixed costs weigh on its earnings. Shares of the company have declined approximately 17.7% since its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results announced on Aug 22.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has underperformed the industry over the past six months. Its shares plunged 16.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 8%. So what are the factors that derailed Coty? Let’s delve deeper.Increasing Costs Weighs on EarningsDuring the fourth quarter, Coty witnessed higher marketing investment to support acquisition-related momentum in the business as well as increased fixed costs. Consequently, adjusted operating margin contracted 480 basis points to 4.0% in the quarter. Management, however, claims that rise in marketing expenditures will aid revenue momentum in the forthcoming period.Dismal Consumer Beauty Segment The company’s Consumer Beauty segment has been sluggish for the last few quarters. Organic net revenue from the segment declined 10% for both the fourth quarter as well as for fiscal 2017. Also, the segment’s organic sales declined 6% in the third quarter due to negative price and mix impact.We note that the segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges, especially in North America, driven by a combination of weak market trends across several of its categories and some reduction in shelf space for a few brands like Astor. Though the company is working on improving the segment, the transition may take time.Other Headwinds To add to the company’s worries, the beauty segment is witnessing increasing competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences. In particular, declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the domestic market and mass fragrance in Western Europe and the United States are expected to impact business.Bottom-Line Although Coty has been gaining from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique, synergies from the same have not been sufficient enough to offset the increase in operating expenses. Moreover, the company’s organic revenues have remained under pressure owing to less significant segmental growth. As a result of the greater negativities impacting the stock, Coty is currently not a favorable pick for investors.Still Interested in the Consumer Staples Space?

1205,STZ,"Shares of The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) have rallied 11.1% after it posted solid second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Also, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock was up 13.7% in the last month compared with its industry’s gain of 7%.Currently, the industry is placed at the top 7% of the Zacks classified industries (18 out of 256). Also, its shares have outpaced the broader Consumer Staples sector’s gain of 3.9%, which is placed at the top 13% of the Zacks classified sectors (2 out of 16).Let’s delve deep to explore more about the stock, which boasts a VGM Score of “A.”Sturdy Q2 ResultsBoston Beer posted solid second-quarter 2017 with both earnings and sales surpassing estimates and increasing year over year. This marked its third straight earnings beat, while sales returned to growth after three consecutive misses. In fact, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with average earnings beat of 50%.Results benefited from top-line gains accompanied by gross margin improvement and lower operating costs owing to the company’s cost saving initiatives. Further, gross margins expanded in the quarter attributable to higher revenue per barrel that resulted from better pricing and package mix, along with lower brewery processing cost per barrel.Consequently, management raised the lower-end of its previously stated guidance range and expects its adjusted earnings in the range of $5.00–$6.20 per share compared with the prior guidance of $4.20–$6.20. This, in turn, has led to an uptrend in estimates in the last 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 and $5.74 for 2017 and 2018, respectively, has increased 87 cents and 38 cents. Moreover, the estimates for the third quarter have increased from $2.09 to $2.13 over the same time period.Other StrengthsBeing one of the largest premium craft brewer in the U.S., Boston Beer, commands a robust portfolio of globally recognized brands. Also, the company distributes its beverages in Canada, Europe, Israel, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and Central and South America through a strong network of wholesale distributors.Going forward, we expect its continued focus on pricing, product innovation and brand development to boost its operational performance and position in the market.Further, we remain encouraged by Boston Beer’s three point growth plan focused on revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation. In addition, management seeks strategic opportunities to expand business through inorganic means, which help it in capturing considerable market share.Boston Beer vs. IndustryConcernsThough Boston Beer’s second-quarter 2017 earnings and sales topped estimates, depletion trends continued to be soft. Depletion volumes in the quarter were primarily impacted by persistent declines in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands as well as a fall in Coney Island brand.However, the company pointed to some improvement in the depletion trends from the beginning of the year while it stated that trends in the craft beer and cider categories continue to remain soft. Further, challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop persist, thereby providing lot of drinking options. In the mean time Boston Beer continues to project soft depletion trends for 2017.Bottom LineWe expect the company’s strategies to likely overcome the soft depletion trends, but this might take some time.Meanwhile, you may also count upon some other top-ranked stocks such as Constellation Brands, Inc.

Although earnings were within management’s guided range of 45–55 cents, the same had declined 15% from the prior-year earnings.Results for the quarter were hurt by unfavorable market conditions, pricing lag from commodity cost increases and operating inefficiencies related to lower than anticipated volumes.

Sales during the quarter were mainly affected by the divestiture of the SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business, resulting in 1.1% of the overall decline.

We note that sales came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters.Gross margin was 18.2% in the second quarter, up 100 basis points (bps) from year-ago figure of 17.2%, primarily due to lower cost of sales. Product recalls contributed 1% towards reducing cost of sales.Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.1% to $148.5 million, mainly due to unfavorable pricing resulting from competitive pressures, higher commodity and operating costs as well as adverse volume/mix. These were partially offset by cost savings and reduction in variable incentive compensation.Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Treehouse Foods, Inc.

The decrease was partially offset by lower commodity costs, freight and commission rate and cost savings.Beverages: Sales increased 15.6% to $246.2 million as a result of favorable volume/mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable pricing and sale of a part of Tetra re-cart broth business, in relation to the divestiture of the SIF business.

These were offset by gains from cost savings and favorable volume/mix.Condiments: Sales for the segment increased 1.3% to $344.9 million as a result of favorable volume/mix, pricing and lower trade spent.

Direct operating income margin had increased 240 bps to 11.7%. The surge was mainly due to favorable commodity costs, lower depreciation and SG&A cost savings.Snacks: Net sales from the segment had declined 11.5% to $317 million, owing to adverse volume/mix, exit of low margin co-pack business and low merchandising support from customers. These were partially offset by favorable pricing. Direct operating income margin went down 210 bps to 3.2% due to unfavorable volume/mix, increased commodity costs and slightly unfavorable freight and commission rates.TreeHouse 2020 Initiative Along with the second quarter 2017 results, the company announced that it would launch the first phase of the comprehensive strategic multiyear plan, TreeHouse 2020. The plan has been designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole. Alongside of cost savings, the initiative is expected to improve management of the company’s category and customer portfolio along with optimizing supply chain.  The initiative is believed to improve the company’s operating margin by 300 bps by the end of 2020.The initiative would be carried out through a series of phases in the next several years. The recently announced Phase 1 action would include closure of two manufacturing facilities and downsizing another. Restructuring charges associated with these actions would amount to $44.5 million, of which $29.7 million will be cash and $14.8 million will be non-cash.2017 Outlook TreeHouse continues to work diligently in order to improve their operational effectiveness and reduce cost structure.

1208,STZ,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been depicting strong growth backed by higher demand for chicken, beef and pork as well as acquisition related synergies. The company recently reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein it witnessed strong volume growth in most of its segments. The growth came on the back of increased demand for protein rich food products.We observe that Tyson Foods’ shares have outpaced the broader Consumer Staples sector in the past three months. Shares of the company increased 11.1% compared with the sector’s decline of 0.8%.Let’s now delve deeper into the aspects that have been aiding the company’s performance of late.Increased Demand Aids Growth Both earnings and revenues increased year over year during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was driven by the solid performance of its segments, primarily Beef, Pork and Chicken, owing to rising demand of these products. Notably, the Beef segment was seen to be sluggish in the past. Nevertheless, robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports aided the segment’s growth during the third quarter. Increased level of exports also benefited Beef and Pork segments during the quarter. For fiscal 2018, the USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase. Acquisitions & Expansion Yields Positive Results   Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to expand its portfolio. During the third quarter of 2017, it completed the acquisition of AdvancePierre for approximately $4.2 billion. Integration of this newly acquired business is on track. Tyson Foods expects the transaction to generate net synergies of approximately $200 million within the next three years. The acquisition also indicates the company’s focus on expanding its protein-packed brands and its fresh prepared foods offering. Tyson Foods’ Hillshire acquisition (completed in fiscal 2014) resulted in synergies of $580 million in fiscal 2016 and anticipates synergies of $675 million for fiscal 2017. This acquisition has boosted the company’s consumer products portfolio with the addition of strong brand names and provided an avenue for it to sell pork products in higher-margin end markets. Further, the company’s acquisition of Mexican food restaurant chains, Circle Foods and Don Julio Foods, in fiscal 2013 shows its commitment to diversify its product line up.Recently, Tyson Foods had announced that it will invest $84 million in its poultry plant located at Union City, TN. The investment will expand the plant’s capacity and is anticipated to create more than 300 jobs. The expansion of the facility is expected to begin in the fall and be completed by mid-2019.Continued Innovation Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up. As an increasing number of health-conscious U.S. consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts, the company considers it a high-potential category. Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas and Stuffed Hash Browns, Tyson Food Service Fully Cooked Drumsticks and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers.Bottom Line Efforts taken by Tyson Foods to expand its network and capacity have increased the company’s cost structure, thereby creating pressure upon margins. The company has also been incurring higher wages, further raising its expense burden. Nevertheless, its acquisitions and innovation efforts have been yielding positive results, and are expected to aid the company to further raise its sales volumes and thereby overcome its current challenges.Moreover, Tyson Foods currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A, indicating its inherent strength. Such factors make the stock highly favorable amongst investors.Looking For More Consumer Staples Stocks? Check TheseInvestors may also consider stocks such as Constellation Brands, Inc.

1211,STZ,"Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) has been witnessing a rough phase, primarily due to its dismal earnings trend, weak fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results along with other major concerns like currency headwinds. However, management is trying hard to revive and remains encouraged by its Jack Daniel's family of brands, premium bourbon and tequila brands.Let’s explore the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Dismal PerformanceBrown-Forman’s fiscal fourth quarter marked its second straight earnings miss, and third in the trailing four quarters. In fact, it recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 2.5% in the last four quarters, which also includes a quarter where earnings met the estimates. In addition, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 13 of the last 16 quarters, including the recently reported quarter.In the fiscal fourth quarter, results were hurt by the acquisition and divestiture activity, alongside currency headwinds and lower distributor inventory levels. Also, sales were marred by the divestiture of Southern Comfort and Tuaca in fiscal 2016. Moreover, operating income plummeted 71% to $212 million, with operating margin contracting substantially to 30.5% from 99.5% in the year-ago quarter. However, operating margin rose 13% on an underlying basis.Further, earnings for fiscal 2018 are anticipated in the range of $1.80–$1.90 per share, including a modest negative influence from foreign currency headwinds, higher tax rate and the establishment of owned distribution center in Spain. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged higher at $1.85 for the fiscal year.Consequently, Brown-Forman’s shares declined 8.3% since it reported earnings results on Jun 7. In fact, the stock dipped 1.8% in the last month against its industry’s rally of 2.3%. Currently, the industry is placed at top 9% of the Zacks Classified industries (23 out of 256).Other HeadwindsThe company remains prone to adverse currency translations, which hurt its top-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter by 3% and fiscal 2017 by 2%. Going forward, management continues to feel the pinch of currency headwinds and forecasts the same to dent its fiscal 2018 earnings.Brown-Forman’s performance is also challenged by the excise tax levied on distilled spirits by governments of respective countries. Volatile global economic and geopolitical environment, coupled with competitive pressures further add to the woes.Growth AvenuesArmed with a strong portfolio of globally recognized brands, Brown-Forman gains strength from its premium American whiskey brands, along with its Jack Daniel's trademark. The company expects to grow on the back of strong demand for its authentic American whiskey brands worldwide, consumer interest in flavored whiskey and a growing trend in premium spirits. Further, its consistent focus on pricing, product innovation and expansion strengthen its market position.Brown-Forman vs. IndustryBottom LineSo let’s wait and see if Brown-Forman can counter the hurdles and able to spark a turnaround. Meanwhile, investors might focus on some better-ranked stocks in the same industry, including Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), Ambev S.A. (ABEV  -  Free Report) and The Boston Beer Company, Inc.

Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), has managed to keep its shareholders happy through regular dividend payments.The board of directors recently approved an increase of 4% in its quarterly dividend, from $0.75 to $0.78 per common share. The dividend will be paid on Sep 1 to shareholders held in record at the close of business on Aug 11. This represents the company’s 16th consecutive year of dividend growth.However, the dividend growth rate was lower when compared with year-ago numbers. Smucker increased its quarterly dividend by 12% in 2016, by 5% in 2015, by 10% in 2014 and by 11.5% in 2013.In addition to dividend payment, the company actively repurchases shares. During the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company completed the 3 million share repurchase program that was announced in February.In fiscal 2017, the company returned over $775 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends, up from $750 million of cash returned to shareholders last year, reflecting strong cash flow. In fact, in the last five fiscal years, the company has returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Stock Price Performance and Estimates RevisionIf we look into the company’s share price performance over the past six months, we will notice that shares of Smucker underperformed the Zacks categorized Food–Miscellaneous/Diversified industry. In the said time frame, shares of the company have declined 12.5%, compared with the industry’s fall of 5.3%. Challenging coffee and pet foods segments seems to have pressurized the stock.Moreover, the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results of Smucker were not quite impressive. While earnings during the quarter fell 19% year over year due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits, sales edged down 1% due to lower net price realization. The fall was witnessed in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment and an unfavorable mix in the U.S. Retail Coffee segment.The dismal quarterly performance has also lowered analysts’ expectations. Estimates for the first quarter and for fiscal 2018 have gone down by a penny to reach $1.67 and $7.97 respectively, over the last 30 days.Bottom LineDespite such unfavorable trends, we are encouraged with Smucker’s acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand, the launch of Dunkin Donuts K-cup pods and expanded distribution for the Natural Balance pet brand which are fueling sales. The company remains focused on expanding its business though sustained innovation, cost-cutting initiatives and efforts to expand e-commerce sales. Smucker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and carries a long term growth rate of 7.3%.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Still Interest You?
