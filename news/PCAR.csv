0,PCAR,"Dow futures rose ahead of Tuesday's open, but lagged behind the Nasdaq and S&P 500 as the market gathered up to face a double dose of resistance. Caterpillar (CAT), Verizon (VZ) and United Technologies (UTX) stirred Dow futures early, as crude oil prices gained and investors dug into the session's long list of earnings results.Dow futures rose 0.6%, as Caterpillar forged a strong early lead, but premarket losses from Travelers (TRV) and 3M (MMM) limited gains. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.7%.

But heavy losses from Incyte (INCY) and Biogen (BIIB) tempered the advance.The Dow has logged four straight declines. The Nasdaq has slipped in the past three sessions and the S&P 500 in two of the past three. The results left all three indexes back below resistance at their 50-day moving averages. The declines also pushed the Dow and S&P into negative territory for the year. The Dow industrials ended Monday down 1% for the year. The S&P 500 carried a 0.1% decline.The Nasdaq holds a 3.3% gain. But both the Dow and the S&P 500 must push past their 50-day lines, as well as into positive territory for the year, in order to put the market's struggling uptrend back on track.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

13,PCAR,"Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) will buy a stake in Navistar International Corp. (NAV) to gain a foothold in the U.S. heavy-truck market, taking a gamble on a struggling U.S. manufacturer as the German automaker still grapples with the fallout from the emissions-cheating scandal.VW will pay $256 million for a 16.6% holding and assume two board seats as part of a deal that includes technology sharing and joint purchasing, the two companies said Tuesday. The Wolfsburg-based automaker will pay $15.76 per share, 12% more than Navistar's closing price on Friday, the most recent trading day in the U.S. The holding puts Volkswagen on par with the largest shareholders, activist investors Carl Icahn and Mark Rachesky.""Closer collaboration among our existing brands was a top priority for our commercial vehicles business and we are well on track in this context,"" Andreas Renschler, head of the German carmaker's Volkswagen Truck & Bus division, said in the statement. ""We are now taking the next step on our way to becoming a global champion in the commercial-vehicles industry.""Gaining traction in the U.S. heavy-truck market, dominated by Daimler AG (DDAIF), Volvo AB and Paccar Inc. (PCAR), is key to VW's plan to forge a global commercial-vehicle operation with higher profit margins than rivals.The marriage isn't without risk given Navistar's shrinking market share in the U.S., a country that also has confounded VW. Even before the diesel-cheating scandal, Volkswagen's car sales were slipping behind competitors in the region.""Navistar has a volatile history and struggles with eroding market share,"" said Roman Mathyssek, a consultant with Arthur D. Little in Munich. ""Via know-how from their truck brands Scania and Man, VW could unlock value at Navistar.""Working with Navistar will provide access to technology and designs targeting customers in the U.S., where model lines are wholly different from offerings in the rest of the world. Many U.S. truck drivers prefer vehicles with an elongated nose, while European operators buy trucks with a flat face due to length restrictions. Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, hired Renschler away from Daimler's truck unit to push a stalled plan to deepen cooperation between its Man and Scania brands.Munich-based Man and Swedish counterpart Scania don't sell vehicles in the U.S., and the group's only other large truck-making operation is a VW-brand division in Brazil focused on Latin America. Man has a Chinese joint venture with local affiliate Sinotruk Hong Kong Ltd. that sells models in Asia. Entering the U.S. will give VW access to a market a bit smaller than its current home region. Around 240,000 trucks will be sold this year in the U.S., while 290,000 will be bought in Europe, according to estimates from Volvo.Volkswagen Truck & Bus was created in 2015 after the carmaker accumulated majority control of Man and Scania over the previous decade. The unit has been largely unaffected by the diesel-emissions scandal that erupted at the group's car operations a year ago. It's targeting 1 billion euros, or $1.12 billion, in long-term cost savings through closer collaboration among its brands. Renschler has said VW is keeping all options open as part of his expansion strategy, including acquisitions and a possible share sale.VW and Navistar expect to reap combined synergies of $500 million over the next five years, they said Tuesday. Navistar posted its first profit in 14 quarters in the three months through April, helped by spending cuts.Lisle, Ill.-based Navistar is no stranger to dramatic consequences from emissions-related troubles. The truck maker had to kill most versions of its so-called premium vocational models in 2010 because they lacked diesel engines that complied with U.S. federal air-pollution rules. Navistar's market share has tanked since its pollution-control technology failed to meet industry standards and brought the company to the brink of collapse.RELATED:EOG Expands Permian Holdings With Yates Deal$28 Billion Enbridge-Spectra Deal Creates Huge Energy Storage FirmGE Buys European 3D Printing Firms, Lifting 3D Systems, Stratasys

58,PCAR,"How do you follow a legend?
"
59,PCAR,"That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.
"
60,PCAR,"Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.
"
61,PCAR,"Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.
"
62,PCAR,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
63,PCAR,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
64,PCAR,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
65,PCAR,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
66,PCAR,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
67,PCAR,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
68,PCAR,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
69,PCAR,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
70,PCAR,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
71,PCAR,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
72,PCAR,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
73,PCAR,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
74,PCAR,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
75,PCAR,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
76,PCAR,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
77,PCAR,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
78,PCAR,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
79,PCAR,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
80,PCAR,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
81,PCAR,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
82,PCAR,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
83,PCAR,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
84,PCAR,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
85,PCAR,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
86,PCAR,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
87,PCAR,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
88,PCAR,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
89,PCAR,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
90,PCAR,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
91,PCAR,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
92,PCAR,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.
"
93,PCAR,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
94,PCAR,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
95,PCAR,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
96,PCAR,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
97,PCAR,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
98,PCAR,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
99,PCAR,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
100,PCAR,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
101,PCAR,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
102,PCAR,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
103,PCAR,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
104,PCAR,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
105,PCAR,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
106,PCAR,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
107,PCAR,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
108,PCAR,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
109,PCAR,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
110,PCAR,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
111,PCAR,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
112,PCAR,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.
"
113,PCAR,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
114,PCAR,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
115,PCAR,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
116,PCAR,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
117,PCAR,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
118,PCAR,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
119,PCAR,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
120,PCAR,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
121,PCAR,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
122,PCAR,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside.

123,PCAR,"Navistar (NAV) stock gapped up Monday amid reports that Volkswagen (VLKAY) may buy the portion of the heavy-duty-truck company it doesn't already own.XThe German automotive giant's trucking division is eyeing Navistar as it seeks scale to compete with global leaders Daimler (DDAIF) and Volvo.Volkswagen Truck & Bus CFO Matthias Gruendler said at a press conference in Munich Monday that a takeover would ""make sense at some point.""The executive also cited a potential price point of between ""3 to 4 billion,"" but did not specify if he was talking about dollars or euros. In addition, he did not give a time scale as to when his company would look to increase their stake.Shares in Navistar, a laggard in the Trucks And Parts-Heavy Duty industry group with an IBD Composite Rating of 40, shot up 9.85% to close at 40.71 on the stock market today. Among other stocks in the group, Cummins (CMI) climbed 2.6%, Paccar (PCAR) rose 2.4%, Oshkosh (OSK) gained 1.3%, and Spartan Motors (SPAR) added 2.6%. Tesla (TSLA), which is building an electric big-rig truck, fell 3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseVolkswagen has spent $256 million for a 16.6% stake in Navistar after they agreed in 2016 to pursue a strategic technology collaboration and to establish a procurement joint venture.Gruendler said the cooperation between the two companies has been developing ""very well."" He also said VW would have to make a formal takeover offer under U.S. law if it raises its stake in Navistar above 17%.The German company is looking to dramatically grow its truck business, and is considering a stock market listing to raise expansion funds.Navistar crushed earnings estimates back in December, and in a prophetic turn CEO Troy Clarke said the company wanted to strengthen its relationship with VW.""We will build on our alliance with Volkswagen Truck & Bus by investing in and collaborating on the major technologies that are reshaping our industry, including electric, connectivity and autonomous,"" he said in a statement.

125,PCAR,"Another Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) Autopilot executive has left the company for rival Waymo. According to media reports, Matthew Schwall is now a part of Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) company Waymo's safety team led by former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Deputy Administrator Ron Medford.Tesla should feel the pinch here as Schwall was its director of field-performance engineering and the main technical contact on safety matters, dealing with regulatory bodies like the NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).The departure follows that of Jim Kellar, Tesla’s Autopilot head in charge of building an AI chip, who moved to Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) in April. Its corporate treasurer and chief accounting officer also jumped ship recently.It’s almost as if leading executives at the company are losing confidence in its ability to deliver self-driving technology, especially as the number of accidents involving Teslas continues to increase.To be fair, Tesla has the maximum number of vehicles with some form of self-driving technology out there, so it makes sense that Teslas would also meet with the maximum number of accidents. Also, not every accident can be attributed to the self-driving tech because Autopilot may not have been in operation in all cases, or may have alerted the driver who didn’t for some reason take back control. So it would have been fooled only in some of the cases.But each time there’s an accident, we go back to arguing about whether semi-autonomous is more dangerous than fully autonomous and essentially, whether AI can really ever be as good as a human being.This WSJ article by Christopher Mims hits the nail on the head: “Deep learning — the “intelligent” component of these systems — is “brittle, opaque and shallow,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and the former head of Uber’s AI lab.AI is brittle because it can’t carry over insights from one context to another, opaque because humans can’t evaluate its neuron-like tangle of connections, and shallow because it’s easy to fool. You can’t just throw more deep learning at a problem and expect it to be as good as a human, says Dr. Marcus.”In short, the technology just isn’t there yet. Doesn’t mean it never will be. But it does mean that it will take time, and we don’t yet know how much more time. Waymo’s fully autonomous taxi service is already operational on a tiny scale, so maybe we’ll know soon.Meanwhile, Musk has other things on his mind, such as Model 3 production volumes. Aside from the negative press and slumping share prices that’s doing the company no good reputation-wise and also in terms of its capital raising prospects, the company really does need to do more volumes if it wants to be profitable this year.That’s probably why SVP of engineering, Doug Field is taking a sabbatical while Musk has a go at production responsibilities himself. Field has been overseeing both engineering and production over the past year to better align the two departments (another Musk experiment). A Tesla spokesperson told CNBC: ""Doug is just taking some time off to recharge and spend time with his family. He has not left Tesla.""What Do The Numbers Say?Analysts still expect Tesla to generate a 61% revenue increase this year as well as a 75 cent reduction in the loss per share. In 2019, revenue growth is expected to slow down to about 38% with the company finally generating a $2.46 per share profit.Tesla’s revenue topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last-reported quarter by 7.5% although the loss per share was just a couple of cents lower than expected.What’s more, the primary driver of auto revenue growth of 19% from the year-ago quarter was the jump in Model 3 deliveries. Management said that first quarter 2018 orders were even higher than the strong orders in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, so buyer interest in the cars continues to increase.The company delivered a total of 29,997 cars, of which 9,766 were Model 3s.While gross margin improvements continue, there will be further improvements once the new automated production line in Germany is operational. So figuring out the battery module line and getting Germany online will help Tesla get to the magic 5,000 number and also help it generate stronger gross margins.RecommendationTesla is currently the most-shorted stock, so there are a lot of bears out there. But for those willing to take a look at the numbers and consider that the shares are down 2.7% year to date, this may be just the time to accumulate the shares. Tesla currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other stocks in the sector with the same rank are General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), Fox Factory Holding Corp. (FOXF  -  Free Report) and PACCAR (PCAR  -  Free Report).

126,PCAR,"Auto companies’ increasing preference for sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks are reshaping the industry. Even concerns over high interest rates and growing oil prices could not stop Americans from splurging on SUVs and pickup trucks. This has led to strong unit sales of SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks.In the past week, a news regarding Ford Motor Company’s (F  -  Free Report) declining vehicle production in Mexico surfaced as the company planned to exit the sedan market of the United States. The rise in demand for trucks and SUVs among the customers forced Ford to take this decision.The week also saw the Japanese auto giant Toyota Motor Corp. (TM  -  Free Report) reporting an earnings beat. In fact, the company recorded earnings of $3 per ADR in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018), surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61. Cost-reduction initiatives and currency fluctuations aided the company during the reported quarter.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for May 3, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) announced that its board has approved a 12% increase in the company's quarterly dividend on common stock to 28 cents per share from the earlier payout of 25 cents per share. The revised dividend will be paid on Jun 5 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2018.Per management, increase in dividend showcases its continuing exceptional business performance. Further, the company has been paying regular dividends since 1941 and increased the payout by 40% in past five years.In first-quarter 2018, the company’s net income was $512 million due to increased truck deliveries in Europe and North America along with a strong performance by the aftermarket parts segment across the globe.An excellent balance sheet and strong operating cash flow enabled PACCAR to pay regular dividends while boosting shareholder value. Earlier in December 2017, it paid an extra cash dividend of $1.2 per share to shareholders. In addition to this, the company paid its usual quarterly dividend of 25 cents on Mar 6, 2018.

The recent demand for trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) among the customers forced Ford to take this decision.Per data, compiled by a trade group of automakers, the company’s production at its Mexican facilities declined 31% in April, marking the lowest April production since 2009. Further, exports from Mexico witnessed a decrease, including a slump of 36% in units exported to the United States.The slump in output from Mexican facilities is due to Ford’s strategic shift in its U.S. market. The company has been focusing more on SUVs and trucks, and is disposing of its less-selling sedan models. Out of the sedans manufactured in Mexico, Fiesta subcompact, Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ are already losing popularity in the United States.Ford is frequently adjusting its production, depending on demands in the North American market, in sync with its goal to reduce inventory. Auto manufacturers consider 60 days’ supply to be an ideal-inventory level. At the beginning of May, the U.S. inventory of Ford’s Lincoln MKZ, Fiesta and Fusion were 104 days, 85 days and 74 days, respectively.

127,PCAR,"The auto industry saw a lackluster start to the spring season as car sales dropped to an annualized 17.15 million units in April compared with 17.04 million units a year ago, according to Autodata.Of the six major American and Japanese automakers, Nissan Motor (NSANY  -  Free Report) led the slump, plunging 28%. Honda (HMC  -  Free Report), Ford Motors (F  -  Free Report) and Toyota (TM  -  Free Report) saw declines of 9%, 4.7% and 4.7%, respectively, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report) auto sales rose 5%. Notably, General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) will no longer provide monthly sales data (read: US Retail Rise: ETFs in Focus).The dismal performance came on the heels of waning consumer demand after a long boom and intensified competition, which has led to more car production, resulting in increased inventory.Challenges AheadConsumers have long been shifting from traditional passenger cars in favor of larger and more comfortable pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. But the number of new models is now growing faster than demand, threatening the fat profits that automakers have enjoyed over the past several years. Additionally, higher rates have made financing of new vehicles expensive.Further, Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs may deal a big blow to the industry as these would increase the cost of auto production. Notably, the auto sector accounted for 26% of demand for steel in the United States in 2017, lagging the construction industry, which accounted for 40%, according to data provider Statista (read: China's $50B Tariff Backlash Puts These ETF Areas in Focus).Weak earnings expectation is an added challenge as the sector is expected to post earnings decline of 2.5% for this year, following earnings growth of 2.9% last year.Any Bright Spot?A strong economy, low unemployment, increasing consumer confidence, higher spending, fuel-efficient and technologically enriched vehicles, and still-low financing rates and gasoline prices will fuel the industry. Though the tax reform will encourage rate hikes, it will provide a lift to U.S. car sales.Further, the auto sector has a compelling valuation with a P/E ratio of 10.96, the lowest of all the 16 Zacks sectors. This could provide an upside to the stocks this year. That said, we have highlighted a few ETFs & stocks that could be attractive picks.First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF (CARZ  -  Free Report)This fund offers pure play global exposure to 34 auto stocks by tracking the NASDAQ OMX Global Auto Index.

131,PCAR,"The first-quarter reporting cycle for the auto sector is now in full swing. Some important companies such as Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report), PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) reported their quarterly numbers. While Ford, Harley-Davidson and PACCAR delivered an earnings beat, Genuine Parts Company missed on earnings.Auto companies scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on Apr 27 are Tenneco Inc. (TEN  -  Free Report), Autoliv, Inc. (ALV  -  Free Report) and CNH Industrial N.V. (CNHI  -  Free Report).Per the latest Earnings Trends, as of Apr 25, 154 companies from the S&P 500 category already announced results. The earnings and revenue beat ratio for these companies is 80.5% and 72.1%, respectively.First-quarter 2018 earnings and revenue growth for auto companies are expected to be in the negative territory. Auto stocks are expected to register a 7.9% and 3.2% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, during the first quarter, the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to record 20% and 8% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively.In fact, the auto sector, which grappled with several problems, reported good sales in March 2018. After a slow start in 2018, major automakers reported robust sales in March. A strong job market and tax reforms drove consumer demand, which in turn aided sales.In Europe, automakers are witnessing a decline in vehicle sales. Per European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, vehicle registrations edged down 0.6% in first-quarter 2018. This decline is majorly due to slowing economic growth and uncertain trading regulations.That said, let’s take a look at the three auto companies, which are scheduled to announce their results tomorrow.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank — #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP to predict chances of a beat this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that with an ideal combination of the two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks, which are lined up for an earnings release.Lake Forest, IL-based Tenneco IL is a leading designer, manufacturer and supplier of emission control and ride control systems. Currently, it has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #3. It is likely to report a positive earnings surprise in tomorrow’s results.Tenneco Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tenneco Inc.

132,PCAR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PACCAR Inc (PCAR  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.6. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, PACCAR’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.However, the stock’s PE compares slightly unfavorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 11.6. This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.Nonetheless, we should point out that PACCAR has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.0, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PACCAR stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PACCAR has a P/S ratio of about 1.0. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, PCAR is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PACCAR currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PACCAR a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D. This gives PCAR a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen three upward and one downward revision in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PACCAR Inc. Price and Consensus  PACCAR Inc. Price and Consensus | PACCAR Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 42% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

In fact, Tesla is the first automaker to increase prices in the world’s largest automotive market. Moreover, the company inked a deal to build its first factory outside the United States. With this factory in Shanghai, Tesla will be the first wholly-owned foreign automaker in China. The automaker resorted to this move as the U.S.-China trade war started affecting auto companies.

The new shared-mobility facility will be added to the company’s existing division, MOIA. Founded in 2016, the division aims at developing and offering an extensive portfolio of on-demand mobility services.In Germany, Volkswagen’s car-sharing service is going to face strong competition from DriveNow and Car2Go, launched by two major German automakers, which are set to merge soon to beat counterparts like Uber Technologies.Volkswagen might witness rise in demand for its lineup of EVs, owing to the unveiling of the mobility service.

But Tesla and many other automakers were unwilling to shift their manufacturing facilities to this country because of the restriction to share technology with local partners. For Tesla, China is the second largest market after the United States.Tesla stated that the construction for the new factory would start only after the necessary official permits are obtained.

135,PCAR,"The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing. A few automakers have already released their earnings while a majority of them will release theirs in the next few days. On Apr 24, PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) and Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings. Both the companies reported earnings beat for the quarter.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 companies from the S&P 500 category have already announced first-quarter results as of Apr 20, registering earnings and revenue beat ratios of 82.8% and 67.8%, respectively.However, on a year-over-year basis, the auto sector’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to record a decline of 9.6% while the top line is likely to fall 3.4%. However, the S&P 500 companies are estimated to record respective 18.3% and 7.7% year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues during the quarter.An improved economy and shift in consumer preferences toward trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUV) encouraged automakers to launch new models in the U.S. market with an aim to earn their share of profit. In Europe, automakers are witnessing a decline in vehicle sales. Per European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, vehicle registrations edged down 0.6% in first-quarter 2018. This decline is majorly due to slowing economic growth and uncertain trading regulations, once U.K. pulls itself out of European Union.Now, let’s evaluate how the four auto companies namely General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report), LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) and Lear Corporation (LEA  -  Free Report) are placed ahead of reporting quarterly figures on Apr 26.We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that with an ideal combination of the two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks, which are lined up for an earnings release.Detroit, MI-based General Motors offers a complete range of vehicles to cater to the needs of customers. Its products range from electric cars to heavy-duty full-size trucks. The company offers products under eight distinctive automotive brands namely, Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Holden, Baojun, Wuling, and Jiefang. Our model does not predict that the company, with an Earnings ESP of -2.21% and a Zacks Rank #3, is likely to beat on earnings as the combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It also beat estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 18.4%. General Motors has long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%.

Further, in the last four reported quarters, it exceeded estimates, leading to an average beat of 7.6%.The company has long-term growth rate of 8.6%.

136,PCAR,"Albeit the recent rise in sales, the auto industry is grappling with a myriad challenges. Trade tensions between China and the United States, shifting preference pattern of the consumers, the compulsion to embrace various changes, and safety recall issues are some of the challenges faced by automakers.In fact, the industry is going through a transition. The necessity of manufacturing electric vehicles in a profitable way is fast becoming a big challenge for automakers.In fact, there are a number of factors that raise concerns for the auto sector in both the short and the long run. Below we discuss a few key challenges that the auto sector might face in the coming months.Safety Recall ExpensesOne serious problem automakers across the globe are facing is huge expenses pertaining to safety recalls. According to the data provided by the U.S. Transportation Department, automakers recalled 53.2 million vehicles in the United States in 2016, setting a new record. According to a report by Center for Auto Safety, there about 60 million vehicles on the road that are open to recalls and in need of repairs.Many auto giants such as Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) and Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) have been facing recall issues in recent times and incurring huge expenses in this regard.EV Race, the New CompulsionIn an effort to respond tostrict emission standards and the proposals made by some Asian and European countries to restrict internal combustion engines driven by fossil fuels, many traditional automakers across the globe have geared up for electric vehicles. However, the new technology has yet to yield profits, which holds the key to the survival of any business entity.Presently, EVs account for less than 1% of U.S. vehicles sales and a small part of total vehicles sold across the globe. EV pioneer Tesla is losing money persistently.Despite these odds, conventional automakers are pouring in a huge amount of money to brace for an all-electric future. These companies are diverting profits generated from the sale of gasoline-fueled trucks and SUVs to invest in the expensive EV technology.Price Stability & High Demand for Used CarsA lucratively priced, high-quality used vehicles inventory has prompted consumers to think over the alternatives to buying new cars. This resulted in higher demand for used vehicles. In fact, a leading rating agency Moody’s has projected that the used car and truck Consumer Price Index will suffer a year-over-year decline of 1.07% in 2019, whereas the decline was 3.63% in 2017. The rating agency further anticipates prices to stabilize in 2020.The price stability of used cars is not bad news for customers but definitely not good news for automakers and dealers. In fact, low prices of used vehicles compel automakers to offer higher discounts to customers on new vehicles, which in turn strain their margins.Moreover, per a research report by Technavio, the increased use of dedicated online sites to sell used cars is having a positive impact on the used-car market. The presence of several online car sales sites has enabled buyers to pick a used car through online sites.Commodity WoesPresident Trump has imposed tariffs on two key commodities: steel and aluminum. However, any increase — tariff induced or otherwise — in the prices of these two important metals that the automobile space is crucially dependent on, will leave an adverse impact. In other words, U.S. automotive companies would lose their competitive capabilities to global rivals if tariffs are imposed on steel and aluminum.Rising Delinquency RatesAccording to Moody’s, huge competition in banks, finance companies and credit unions have resulted in loosening of the underwriting conditions. Presently, loan terms in the United States are longer than they were in 2010. Also, lenders are being allowed the facility to roll a significant part of the unpaid balance into new loans. This is leading to rising delinquency and its long-term effect can be serious.Market Share ConcentrationThe majority share of the automobile market is held only by a few leading automakers. Moreover, high dependence on these automakers makes auto parts’ suppliers vulnerable to pricing pressure and production cut. Pricing pressure from automakers constricts margins of parts suppliers. Simultaneously, frequent production cuts by automakers in order to cope with market adjustments affect suppliers’ operations.Some auto industry suppliers that are dependent on a few major automakers are Meritor Inc. (MTOR  -  Free Report), Tenneco Inc. (TEN  -  Free Report) and Magna International Inc. (MGA  -  Free Report).Lack of Demand for Greener VehiclesOne distinctive feature of vehicles sales is that the sales of vehicles with lower efficiency have been strong in recent times. This indicates lack of demand for greener cars which is actually favored by policymakers across the globe. In fact, in recent times, sales of trucks and SUV, which are usually less fuel-efficient than passenger cars, have been on the rise.Bottom LineThe auto industry continues to face a number of challenges. As a result, we would advise investors to dump stocks with a Zacks Rank # 4 or 5 such as Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) and Autobytel Inc. (AUTO  -  Free Report). Meanwhile, investors who continue to be optimistic about the sector can check out companies such as PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report), Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.PACCAR has an expected long-term growth rate of 9.8%.

139,PCAR,"After a tepid start to 2018, major automakers reported robust sales in March. A strong jobs market and favorable tax measures spurred consumer demand, which in turn pushed up sales. The March sales upsurge is in contrast to what the auto industry witnessed in the past year.In fact, in 2017, U.S. vehicle sales declined for the first time since the financial crisis. It slipped to 17.2 million from 17.55 million in 2016. Last year’s decline notwithstanding, the overall level of sales aren’t that far from all-time record levels.Elevated consumer confidence, a strong job market, big discount and a growing U.S. economy have aided this rise. Even concerns over high interest rates and growing oil prices could not stop Americans from splurging on sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks. This has led to strong unit sales of SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks.Per Autodata, auto industry sales rose 2.5% to 1,653,529 while new vehicle sales gained 6% in March. Moreover, seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) was 17.5 million in comparison to 16.8 million, a year ago. General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) posted a sales increase of 15.7% year over year to 296,341 vehicles.This upside was attributable to the Chevrolet, GMC, Buick and Cadillac brands. Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) announced a 3.5% rise in year-over-year sales to 244,306 vehicles, boosted by crossover and truck sales. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) reported 13.6% growth in year-over-year sales to 216,063 vehicles in the United States.There are also other reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry for both the short and the long run. Below, we highlight those that should drive the sector’s performance in the near to medium term.OpportunitiesStrong Economy & Elevated Consumer ConfidenceAccording to a recent report by the Federal Reserve, unemployment has dropped from 10% in October 2009 to 4.1%. This is the lowest level in about 20 years. About 17 million jobs have been added through this expansion. The labor market has remained robust and is likely to also remain strong in the future.Additionally, growing household wealth, stable income gains and elevated consumer confidence continue to support consumer spending. Also, fiscal sops and accommodative financial measures are aiding both household spending and business environments. These positive macroeconomic factors are likely to aid the U.S. auto sector at least in the near term.Improved Global Auto Industry OutlookLeading rating agency Moody’s has upgraded its outlook for the global auto industry from negative to stable. Improving business conditions have partly led to this rating upgrade. The rating agency has further added that it anticipates sales of cars, SUVs and light trucks to be higher this year than the previous projection.In fact, prospects for growth are improving for the majority of the auto markets in the world. Moody’s anticipates 1.5% rise in sales for 2018, unchanged from its previous projection. In addition, the rating agency expects U.S. auto sales to shrink less in 2018 than its previous forecast.Rising Vehicles Age in the United StatesThe increasing average age of vehicles on U.S. roads is adding to the replacement demand for cars as well as car parts. The steadily improving quality of vehicles is mainly behind this rise in average age of vehicles over time. According to IHS Automotive, as of 2016, the average age of light vehicles was 11.6 years, whereas it was 9.9 years a decade ago. Moreover, by 2021, around 81 million vehicles are expected to be over 16 years old compared with 62 million vehicles today. This will benefit replacement part manufacturers and retailers, apart from new vehicle manufacturers.Huge Opportunities in Self-Driving IndustryOf late, the self-driving industry has been growing by leaps and bounds. In fact, a few cases of accidents have not deterred the confidence of the auto giants to enter into this field in a big way. Several leading automobile and technology companies have been pouring in a huge amount of money to develop the niche technology and raise their market share. Huge prospects of self-deriving vehicles to transform the auto industry and the transportation landscape have mainly resulted in this lofty investment.Attractive, Tech-Savvy Vehicle LaunchesIn order to stay in competition, automakers have to constantly strive toward introducing new and attractive, technologically advanced vehicles. A majority of automakers are revamping their popular vehicles with new technologies and visual appeal. Features such as backup cameras, automatic emergency braking and in-car connectivity are common in most vehicle segments.Bottom LineThe solid outlook for the economy is certainly a blessing for the auto sector, which is facing a myriad challenges. Moreover, given the rising thrust on the self-driving industry, the auto space is gradually moving toward a seismic shift.At this juncture, we recommend stocks such as PACCAR Inc.

141,PCAR,"The Auto sector has been seeing a slew of first-quarter 2018 earnings releases of late. Many of the bigwigs are slated to release results for the quarter ending Mar 31, 2018, by the end of this week. On Apr 19, Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) and WABCO Holdings Inc. (WBC  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings. WABCO reported earnings beat for the quarter, while Genuine Parts missed the estimate.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 companies under the S&P 500 category have reported results. These companies’ beat ratios were 82.8% and 67.8% for earnings and revenues, respectively.For first-quarter 2018, earnings for auto companies are expected to decline 9.6% on a year-over-year basis and revenues are likely to fall 3.4%. However, the S&P 500 companies are likely to see 18.3% and 7.7% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively, in the quarter.In March, the automakers made a comeback after seeing declining U.S. sales in February 2018. An improved economy, product launches and customer discounts have helped auto companies witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. This uptick has encouraged automakers to introduce improved SUV and pick-up truck models under various brands, each catering to specific customer requirements. Further, a number of major auto companies have announced newer models which are expected to hit the showrooms in 2019.Meanwhile, in the world’s largest automotive market China, auto sales rose 4.7% year over year to 2.66 million units in March after an 11% drop in February 2018. Per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, first-quarter vehicles sales rose 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to around 7.2 million units.Now, let’s take a closer look at two big names in the auto industry — Harley-Davidson, Inc.

At present, the company is making investments to develop and launch electric motorcycles by 2019. Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Harley-Davidson.

Additionally, in the last four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in three while meeting in one. Further, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8%.

144,PCAR,"U.S. vehicle sales declined in 2017 for the first time since the financial crisis. The first two months of 2018 were also unimpressive for the auto sector, but the growth trend came back in March, with the major automakers registering strong sales. A robust job market and favorable tax laws have worked in favor of sales. Moreover, rising demand for profitable crossovers, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickups are also aiding the auto industry.However, the auto space has also grappled with several challenges. Trade tensions between China and the United States, the compulsion to embrace various changes, and safety recall issues are some of the challenges faced by the automakers.Also, the industry is going through a transition. The necessity of manufacturing electric vehicles in a profitable way is fast becoming a big challenge for automakers. In recent times, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) have added some new EVs to their individual lineup. German auto major, Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) is also committed to introduce new energy vehicles. Other automakers are also following suit.These challenges are showing up in the sector’s stock market performance. Stocks in the Zacks Auto sector are down -2.6% in the year-to-date period, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +0.4% gain. On a trailing 12-month basis, the sector’s performance is roughly in-line with the S&P 500 index.Zacks Industry Rank – Positive OutlookThe typical characteristics of the auto industry prompted us to have a dedicated sector for the industry in our database. The automobile sector is one of the 16 Zacks sectors, unlike the S&P classification, wherein autos is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. The S&P has 10 sectors compared with the 16 sectors for Zacks.At the expanded classification level, the Zacks Auto sector is divided into six industries: Auto-Domestic, Auto-Foreign, Auto-Original Equipment, Auto-Replacement Parts, Auto-Internal Combustion Engines and Rubber-Tires. The level of sensitivity and exposure to the different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.We rank over 250 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors, based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries into two groups — the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)The current Zacks Industry Rank is 116 for Automotive-Domestic (placing it at the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 83 for Automotive-Foreign (placing it at the top 32% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 88 for Automotive-Original Equipment (placing it at the top 34% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 63 for Automotive-Replacement Parts (placing it at the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 4 for Automotive-Internal Combustion Engines (placing it at the top 2% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 116 for Rubber-Tires (placing it at the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries).Looking at the exact location of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the auto industry is Positive.Sector-Level Earnings TrendThe auto sector contributed 1.6% to the total S&P 500 earnings in 2017. This is nearly double its 0.8% market-cap weight in the index.Looking at the fourth-quarter 2017 results of the auto sector, earnings advanced 20.3%. Auto sector earnings are expected to rise 4.3% in the first quarter of 2018 and 19.4% in second-quarter 2018.Total revenues rose 30.2% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017. Revenues are expected to rise 24.3% in the first quarter of 2018 and 7% in second-quarter 2018. Earnings for 2018 are expected to decline 3.7% from 2017. Also, revenues for the year are expected to decrease 0.9%. Again, earnings for 2019 are expected to rise 0.2%, and revenues are projected to rise 0.5%.For more information on earnings for this sector and others, please read our latest Earnings Trends report.Bottom LineThe auto sector currently has ample opportunities amid serious challenges. While a strong economy, robust demand for SUVs, attractive financing options and impressive vehicle launches are driving sales, rising auto loan defaults and high levels of safety recalls are acting as dampeners.At this juncture, we recommend stocks such as PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report), Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.PACCAR has an expected long-term growth rate of 9.8%.

145,PCAR,"Investors looking for stocks in the Automotive - Domestic sector might want to consider either Paccar (PCAR  -  Free Report) or Fox Factory Holding (FOXF  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, both Paccar and Fox Factory Holding are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 25.08. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 2.17.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.55. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 6.76.These metrics, and several others, help PCAR earn a Value grade of A, while FOXF has been given a Value grade of D.Both PCAR and FOXF are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.

146,PCAR,"After the European Union (EU) announced that from Jun 22 import tariffs of more than $3.2 billion will be levied on a variety of American products, Trump retaliated with auto tariffs. On Jun 22, the American President threatened to levy a tariff of 20% on cars and other automobiles imported from EU countries.With the President giving warnings of raising import tariffs on foreign-made cars, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group of mostly U.S. automobile manufacturers, shared its concerns. Auto Alliance warned that such high auto tariffs may eventually raise production costs, reduce car demand and result in high job loss.Auto Alliance Expects $45 Billion Auto Tariffs In a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, also known as Auto Alliance said that a tariff of 20% will lead to “increased producer costs,” which in turn will raise overall car costs. Additionally, the trade group estimated that after new tariffs are placed, the average price of a car will increase to $5,800. It also anticipated that the auto industry may have to bear a total tax of $45 billion after tariff raise, following this development.In fact, the trade group in its letter cautioned that higher auto tariffs will be a drag for car sales and lead to “less tax receipts.” Auto Alliance added that a low level of car sales “will lead to fewer jobs,” which will affect numerous families and ultimately the entire economy.Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department is investigating whether auto-imports are actually a big threat to the country’s security. If Commerce Department’s probe findings reveal that they are a national threat, Trump’s auto-tariff initiative will gain ground and will create tension for the U.S. automakers.Automakers Anticipate a Booming Auto-Related Trade WarIt has been months now that auto manufacturers have begun discussions with the Trump administration in an attempt to prevent a full-on trade war. Several major automakers of the U.S., in their letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce, showed their concerns of a possible decline in car sales and job losses following high tariffs. Further, they have used a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics to highlight their worries.As per the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a private, non-profit research institution devoted to international economics, a 25% auto tariff will lead to “a 1.5 percent decline in production.” Additionally, the institution expects that around 195,000 domestic workers may lose their job for a period of one to three years or even higher. They added that in case other such countries retaliate with similar tariffs, about 624,000 U.S. workers will be rendered jobless.Given this scenario, companies related to the domestic auto industry will definitely suffer. Market leaders of the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) are visibly at the receiving end. While General Motors holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Ford Motor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Other companies that could be affected by the new auto tariffs are PACCAR Inc (PCAR  -  Free Report), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) and Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report).Summing UpUndoubtedly, the auto industry is going through a bad phase, following President Trump’s decision to impose a tariff of 20% on cars and other automobiles imported from other countries. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers clearly showed its concern over higher auto tariffs and expects a dip in auto sales and witness steep job loss. So, it can be concluded that Trump-imposed new auto tariffs are expected to dampen investor sentiment for auto stocks in the days to come.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

That’s the stock that is stuck in no man’s land.What does that mean?It’s the stock that is neither a value stock nor is it a growth stock. Something is missing from the equation. It has no identity.As a result, these stocks tend to underperform as both value and growth investors shun them.What do these stocks look like?Examples of Stocks in No Man’s Land1.      Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), despite the shares tumbling from their post-IPO highs, still has a forward P/E of 69. It’s clearly not a value stock. But is there growth? Sure, it’s planning on opening another 35 domestic stores in 2018. But same-store-sales fell 1.2% in 2017 even as it raised menu prices. Additionally, it expects same-store-sales to be flat in 2018.  Verdict: It’s an expensive stock that doesn’t have a strong enough growth story.2.     Potbelly (PBPB  -  Free Report), is a stock that has gone nowhere for several years. Over the last 2 years, shares of this sandwich chain have fallen 3.2% while the S&P 500 was up about 40%. Earnings are expected to fall 33% in 2017. But is it cheap? Not even close. It has a forward P/E of 34. Verdict: Growth is lethargic, at best, and it’s not a value stock.It’s easy for value investors to get stuck in these stocks because they appear to have value characteristics, as often the shares have sold off big.But a stock plunge doesn’t necessarily equal value.Buying a Real Value and Growth Stock InsteadTracey ran a screen looking for companies that had both value fundamentals AND double-digit earnings growth.In addition, she added the extra firepower of the Zacks Rank, screening only for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, which hopefully means rising earnings estimates.The screen gave her a list of 56 companies.Not too shabby.3 Stocks with the Rare Combination of Growth and Value1.      Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report), the property insurance giant, has a forward P/E of just 11.4 as the shares have fallen about 7% year-to-date. Earnings are expected to rise 25.2% in 2018.2.     PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report), the commercial truck manufacturer, saw record annual revenue in 2017 thanks to a strong European truck market. It’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 13.1, and earnings are expected to rise 23% this year. As an added bonus, it has paid a dividend every year since 1941.3.     Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH  -  Free Report), operates beauty stores worldwide. It’s known for hair color. The company has been in a transition period as it expands its online capabilities. Same-store-sales are expected to be flat in fiscal 2018 while earnings are expected to rise 32%. It’s dirt cheap as well, with a forward P/E of just 7.3.What else should you know about stocks in the No Man’s Land and how to avoid them?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

149,PCAR,"Per Reuters, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) has presented a plan to invest $2.8 billion over a period of 10 years to restructure its stressed South Korean operations. Additionally, the company has requested the South Korean government to inject funds for the investment through its state-run Korea Development Bank (""KDB""), which already holds a 17% stake in GM Korea.The proposal is in addition to the company’s offer to convert around $2.2 billion of debt into equity, owed by its Korean operations, in exchange for financial support and tax benefits from the government.These initiatives, to revive GM Korea, started after the Detroit-based automaker announced last week that it will shut down one of its four plants in South Korea as part of the restructuring of its business in Asia. (Read more: General Motors to Trim South Korea Business, Focus on Profit) General Motors Company Price and Consensus  General Motors Company Price and Consensus | General Motors Company Quote In a period of two years ending in 2016, the company’s Korea operations suffered a loss of approximately 1.9 trillion won. Further, in sync with General Motor’s recent decision to exit from unprofitable markets like Europe and emphasizing more on profitability and innovation than on revenues and volume have intensified problems for GM Korea.Being a low-cost export hub, the company’s South Korean operations manufactured nearly a fifth of General Motor’s global output during its peak time. GM Korea was once a major manufacturer of the company’s Chevrolet models which were offered to the European market. Price PerformanceIn the last six months, shares of General Motors’s stock have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

150,PCAR," (0:25) - Is It Time To Buy Large Cap Stocks?(2:15) - Stock Screener Criteria (4:45) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks(15:00) - Takeaways On Large Cap Stocks: AMGN, CMA, CVX, HPQ, PCARPodcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #98 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.For the last couple of years, the large cap stocks dominated the headlines. The S&P 500, the Dow and the NASDAQ out performed the small cap indexes.But in 2018, the tide has recently turned.The small cap index, the Russell 2000, is easily out performing the large caps which have weakened on trade and tariff worries.But you know what that means. There’s value in some of those large caps now.Where are the buying opportunities?Screening for Large Cap Value StocksTracey did a basic screen to find cheap large cap stocks.She screened for stocks with a market cap above $10 billion and a forward P/E below 15. P/E is not always the best metric for finding value, but in this screen, it will be a good enough basic indicator to get the cheap stocks.She then added on the Zacks Rank, screening only for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) stocks. By having those Ranks, it should mean that earnings estimates are on the rise.It’s one thing to buy a cheap stock, but it’s a whole new ballgame to get a cheap stock that is also growing its earnings.The screen returned 62 stocks, which isn’t too shabby.Tracey narrowed it down to her 5 favorite names.5 Cheap Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now 1.       Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) is one of the mega-cap biotechnology companies. These have been out of favor for a while now. It has a forward P/E of 13.6 and rewards investors’ patience with a 2.9% dividend yield. Analysts are bullish with earnings on the rise for both 2018 and 2019.2.       Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is a Texas-based regional bank with a market cap of $16 billion. In April, it raised its dividend 13%. It now yields 1.5%. Earnings are expected to pop 42% in 2018 and with a low P/E, it has a PEG ratio of 0.7. That means it is both a value and growth stock. That’s a rare combination.3.       Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) is one of the largest oil companies in the United States with a market cap of $234 billion. Earnings are expected to jump 130% thanks to the increase in the price of oil yet the shares trade with a forward P/E of just 14.4. You also get a juicy dividend, which was not cut during the oil price plunge years.4.       HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is one of the “boring” technology companies as it makes notebooks, desktops and printers. But one look at its fundamentals and you can see why its attractive. Earnings are expected to rise 21% in fiscal 2018 and analyst estimates are on the rise for both F2018 and F2019. It’s also really cheap, with a forward P/E of just 11.5.5.       PACCAR (PCAR  -  Free Report) is a global manufacturer of light, medium and heavy-duty trucks under the brands of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. It has a market cap of $21.9 billion and reported a record quarter in the first quarter. Orders for US & Canada Class 8 trucks were more than double a year ago, prompting PACCAR to raise its full year industry sales range. It’s trading at just 11x and earnings are expected to jump 32% in 2018.Wall Street has been ignoring value stocks for a couple of years.But the tide might be turning in 2018.Suddenly, the cheap large cap stocks are holding their own and, in some cases, even beating the returns of the major indexes.Should you be buying the big caps on this weakness?Find out the answer to this, and more, in this week’s podcast.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

151,PCAR,"The strong sales momentum witnessed by the U.S. auto industry in 2015 and 2016 did not continue in 2017. However, in 2018, industry sales have been trending higher, helped in no small measure by a positive economic backdrop and dealer discounts. The strong job market and favorable tax measures have boosted consumer demand, which in turn is driving sales.In the year so far, concerns about high interest rates and growing oil prices have not stopped Americans from splurging on sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks. This has led to strong unit sales of SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks. In fact, this changing preference, from conventional passenger cars towards spacious vehicles, has prompted automakers to reorient their business strategies. In the changing situation, big discounts are playing a huge role in helping automakers grab a higher share of the market or at least retain their share. However, these discounts are putting pressure on their margins.Industry players also have to contend with the need to invest in all-electric vehicle (EVs) and autonomous driving technology. In between all these developments, recalls remain an overhang.Industry Returns on a Bumpy TrackBroader economic growth has not been enough to give market participants confidence in the industry's outlook. With sales already at or near record levels, many in the market suspect that the direction of change in sales will be to the downside going forward. Importantly, the need to maintain sales levels is forcing industry players to offer incentives that eat into margins. The rising interest rate environment is an issue as well. The Zacks Domestic Auto Industry, which is an eight-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto, Tires And Trucks Sector that includes companies like Ford and GM, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 2%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Auto, Tires And Trucks Sector have rallied 13.5% and 9.2%, respectively (the blue line in the chart below represents the industry). One-Year Price Performance A Good Value or a Value Trap?We can look at a variety of valuation metrics to evaluate the industry's valuation picture and all of those will likely help us reach the same conclusion. But given the high capital intensity of the space, the appropriate metric is the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio or multiple. This metric takes into consideration equity as well as the level of debt. Also, this metric is not impacted by differing capital structures and does not take into account the effect of non-cash expenses.Owing to the industry underperformance over the past year, the valuation picture appears attractive, in comparison to the S&P 500. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.6X, at a discount to the S&P 500’s EV/EBITDA ratio 11.5X. As the chart below shows, the industry has traded as high as 12.7X and as low as 10.7X, with a 12-month median of 11.4X. Looking at industry's valuation history relative to the broader market, we find out that the industry traded at a premium to the S&P 500 index from January 2012 through January 2015 and has been trading at a discount since mid-2015. Enterprise Value/EBITDA TTMThe chart below compares the industry's valuation picture with its sector. As would be expected, the two track each other fairly closely, though the industry is currently trading at a modest premium to the sector. As the chart shows, the industry traded at a premium to the sector through year-end 2017 and has been trading at a discount this year. Enterprise Value/EBITDA TTMThis valuation discussion shows that the group's valuation is attractive. But offsetting this seemingly favorable valuation picture is the long list of issues plaguing the space, ranging from trade issues (the future of Nafta) to the negative earnings impact of discounts.  Underperformance May Continue Due to Bleak Earnings OutlookThe positive macroeconomic drivers are likely to be offset by operating challenges encountered by the industry, keeping a lid on shareholders’ returns.The industry's recent stock market underperformance notwithstanding, the more relevant question for investors pertains to handicapping how the industry will perform over the coming weeks and months. A good handle on the industry's, and companies', evolving earnings outlook can help answer that question for us.  Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry below shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Zacks Domestic Auto Industry This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the -$2.61 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Domestic Auto industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the loss of -$2.61 per share of the industry for 2018, but how this estimate has evolved recently. While the consensus loss estimate for the Zacks Domestic Auto industry of $2.61 per share implies mostly a decent year-over-year improvement, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable lately.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 8.8% downward since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate RevisionsZacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsHowever, the group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates the possibility of outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #101, which places it at the top 39% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks.Domestic Auto Industry’s Long-Term GrowthSince the past month, the group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has been decreasing to reach the current level of 8.5%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite. However, before that, the long-term EPS growth prospects for the industry were better than the Zacks S&P 500 composite index.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth RateRevenue growth figure for the industry shows that since the end of 2015, revenues for the group have been increasing. However, gross profit has witnessed a declining trend since the end of 2016.Revenues – Autos Mfrs-Domestic MarketGross Profit – Autos Mfrs-Domestic MarketBottom LineA closer look at the domestic auto industry brings some interesting facts. Cheap valuation and improving industry rank are some bright spots. Moreover, these two fundamental factors are further bolstered by solid macro economy.However, several changes and challenges put a huge strain on the profitability of the industry as a whole. The fat discount to sell vehicles corroborates the phenomenon of a recent rise in revenues with strained profits. Added to this, the bleak earnings outlook does not brighten the prospects for shareholders’ returns. Trade uncertainty, particularly the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) also has a direct bearing on the industry's fture. While none of the stocks in our domestic auto universe currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), below are three stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)Fox Factory Holding Corp.

152,PCAR,"On Jun 15, we issued an updated research report on PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report).Driven by a robust economy and strong freight demand, the company witnessed the doubling of Class 8 truck orders in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the prior-year quarter. This has encouraged PACCAR to raise its 2018 Class 8 truck industry retail sales estimates for the United States and Canada to 265,000-285,000 vehicles compared with its prior anticipation of 235,000-265,000 units. Moreover, the newly estimated range is much higher than 218,000 units of retail sales generated in 2017.In first-quarter 2018, this leading truck manufacturer saw a year-over-year increase in revenues and adjusted earnings. Moreover, both earnings and sales surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Furthermore, a strong balance sheet and outstanding long-term earnings are enabling PACCAR to invest in innovative products and new technologies. In 2018, the company aims to invest $300-$320 million under research and development expenses, to develop new truck models and powertrains, enabled with electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell technologies.PACCAR Inc. Price and Consensus PACCAR Inc. Price and Consensus | PACCAR Inc. QuoteFurther, PACCAR has been paying regular dividends to its shareholders since 1941. Recently, in May, PACCAR’s board approved 12% increase in the quarterly dividend on common stock to 27 cents. The revised dividend was paid on Jun 5 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2018. Earlier, in March, the company paid a quarterly dividend of 25 cents.However, PACCAR faces fierce competition from its peers at the commercial truck market in the United States and Canada. This might hamper the company’s sales and pricing. Also, an increase in the supply of used trucks has led to declining prices, which might be a headwind for PACCAR.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, PACCAR’s stock has moved down 3.3%, underperforming 11.2% increase of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, PACCAR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Magna International Inc. (MGA  -  Free Report), Douglas Dynamics, Inc.

157,PCAR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, PACCAR’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.However, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 10.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that PACCAR has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PACCAR stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PACCAR has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PACCAR currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PACCAR a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives PCAR a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower, while the full year estimate has seen nine up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 11.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 10.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PACCAR Inc. Price and Consensus  PACCAR Inc. Price and Consensus | PACCAR Inc. QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LinePACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Bottom Top 37% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence.However, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:We believe, despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance, a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in PACCAR.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

158,PCAR,"A good way to look for Value stock investment ideas is to find an industry that has been sold off by the market because of negative news or unfavorable economic conditions, then find the companies who are least subject to the negative conditions but were dragged down by their peers.Automakers Take a Beating on Rates and TariffsThe automotive industry has been hurting of late, hit by the 1-2 punch of rising interest rates and the imposition of U.S. tariffs on imported Steel and Aluminum.  Rising interest rates increase the cost to the consumer of financing an automobile.  Rising commodity prices increase the cost of producing automobiles which can either be borne by the automaker as an expense, or passed along to the consumer, making cars more expensive to buy.  How Much Do Rates Really Matter?The interest rate component is likely overblown.  Rates are still historically low, especially for automobile loans, which are still around 4%.  Every 25 basis point increase in that rate adds about $8 - $20 to the payment on a new car.  That’s hardly significant enough to deter almost anyone from purchasing a new car.  The strength of the economy as a whole and record low levels of unemployment will have a much bigger impact.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) has been undeservedly battered in the recent selloff of auto stocks.  Its price is off 15% YTD even as its Zack’s Consensus Earnings Estimate has been revised upward.  It currently trades at a Forward P/E of 5.6X, versus the 7X of closest competitor Ford Motors (F  -  Free Report) and an industry average of 9.9X.  It earns a Zack’s Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and a Zack’s Value Score of A.  It also pays a 4.4% dividend, so a savvy investor is rewarded for waiting for the market to recognize the value in the stock.Toyota Likely Unaffected by Metals TariffsToyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) also has a Zack’s Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  At a forward P/E of 8.4X, it’s currently trading closer to the industry average than General Motors, but the Zack’s Consensus Earning’s Estimate for 2018 has been revised upward several times already this year from $11.97/share to $15.16 – an increase of 26%.  Additionally, though it manufactures automobiles globally, Toyota buys the vast majority of the steel and aluminum for the cars it produces in the U.S. from domestic suppliers, so it is not likely to suffer from the tariffs.Big Truck Company Outpaces its Industry Paccar (PCAR  -  Free Report), maker of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF medium and heavy duty trucks has had 2018 earning estimates revised upward by 9 of the 11 analysts included in the Zack’s Consensus in the past 60 days.    A year ago, Paccar was expected to earn $4.26/share, but that has been revised all the way up to $5.33. Paccar is a Zack’s Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  The strong economy should keep demand firm for heavy equipment (regardless of the rise in interest rates), and the tariffs shouldn’t affect this U.S. manufacturer.

163,PCAR,"Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report) has rung the warning bell that its shifting focus to electric vehicles (EVs) could compel it to support its supply chain, per a Reuters report. In fact, many automakers, including Daimler, have scaled up production of EVs and are also updating the engine management software to keep a lid on pollution level.In fact, due to a shift in customer demand, from diesel to gasoline engines and planned electrification of new model series, there will be a huge change in the supply components, particularly for the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment.The new demand pattern may lead to underutilization of production capacities for some supplies, whereas overutilization of production capacities for some other. In the changed scenario, some suppliers may have to opt for expansion of production capacities at its plants. If the supplier is not able to cover fixed-costs, there is a high chance that the suppliers could ask for a compensation payment.Daimler projects that its profit in 2018 would be affected as the company is investing a lot in electric and autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the political doldrums could result in supply bottlenecks for some raw materials. However, due to the intense competition, the ability of the company to pass on the higher expenses of commodities and other materials to the price of end vehicle is limited.Over the past year, shares of this company have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

The automaker has further added that it would take a decision on the future of the remaining operations in South Korea within weeks.The restructuring move is in sync with the automaker’s recent strategy of giving more emphasis on profitability and innovation than on sales and volume.

Two auto giants, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU  -  Free Report), have already announced quarterly performance on Jan 25. While Ford’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Fiat Chrysler beat the same.Now, let’s evaluate how the four auto companies namely PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report), CNH Industrial N.V. (CNHI  -  Free Report) and Autoliv, Inc.

However, the S&P 500 companies are estimated to log a respective 10.8% and 7.3% year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues during the quarter.Automakers are closely observing a shift in their customer preferences. A change in the buying pattern of consumers has compelled automakers to reassess their strategies. Nowadays, the auto sector is focusing more on developing its line-up of pick-up trucks and crossovers.Now, let’s take a look at the four auto companies scheduled to announce results on Jan 30.We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Additionally, it develops and manufactures advanced diesel engines and distributes truck parts related to its primary business. Our model does not predict that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around with an Earnings ESP of -1.34% and a Zacks Rank #3 as the combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Besides, the company will be paying regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents on Mar 6, 2018.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that PACCAR is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of -2.97% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.09 and $1.12, respectively.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PACCAR carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering from the same space as these have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:BorgWarner, Inc.

190,PCAR,"With several companies releasing their quarterly results in a row, a few automakers, namely Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and PACCAR, Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) also recently reported third-quarter figures. While Harley-Davidson’s earnings per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, both General Motors’ and PACCAR’s bottom lines beat the estimates.Three important auto and parts manufacturers, expected to come up with their earnings numbers on Oct 26 are, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) and BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report).As of Oct 18, per the latest Earnings Outlook, 52 S&P 500 members have already revealed their quarterly earnings results. Of these companies, the beat ratios of earnings and revenues are 76.9% and 73.1%, respectively. From the Auto sector, 10% has reported quarterly earnings figures.For third-quarter 2017, earnings and revenue growth for the auto companies is expected to be more on the negative side. The sector is expected to record 17.4% and 5.6% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, companies under the S&P 500 category will come up with 3% and 4.9% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively.In order to tackle air pollution problems, many countries are focusing on use of electric cars. This new paradigm shift has prompted many automakers to transfer their attention from gasoline and diesel-automobiles to electric cars. With this move, the companies have to balance current strategies as well as invest in future industrial trends and changes.Let’s take a look at the three auto companies, scheduled to announce results on Oct 26.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of an earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this ideal combination of two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks lined up for an earnings announcement.A multinational automaker, headquartered in Dearborn, MI, Ford manufactures and distributes automobiles in 200 markets across six continents. Our model predicts that the company is not likely to deliver an earnings beat as it currently has an Earnings ESP of -9.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Therefore, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In 2017, the company expects the adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.65-$1.85. Also, the company’s frequent vehicle recalls to fix safety issues is increasing the capital expenditure. (Read more: Ford Motor Set to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?)Ford Motor Company Price and EPS Surprise Ford Motor Company Price and EPS Surprise | Ford Motor Company QuoteChicago, IL-based LKQ Corporation is a leading provider of alternative and specialty parts to repair and accessorize automobiles and other vehicles. Our model does not conclusively predict that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Although the bullish rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESP however, makes surprise prediction difficult.The company expects organic sales growth in the 4-5.25% range compared with the earlier guided range of 4-6%, in 2017.

(FCAU  -  Free Report) — are expected to come up with their results on Oct 24.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, as of Oct 18, 52 companies from the S&P 500 category have already announced their results. These companies registered earnings and revenues beat ratios of 76.9% and 73.1%, respectively. As of that date, 10% companies from the Auto sector have reported earnings for the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017.However, third-quarter 2017 earnings and revenue growth for auto companies are expected to be in the negative territory. Auto stocks are expected to register 17.4% and 5.6% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, the S&P 500 companies are expected to register 3% and 4.9% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively, during the quarter.Automakers are witnessing a radical shift in their operations. The speed at which consumers’ preference pattern is changing, has prodded a number of automakers to reassess their strategies. Added to this is the compulsion of manufacturing electric and green cars, which are likely to bring in numerous changes in the industry.Let’s take a look at the three auto companies scheduled to announce their results tomorrow.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of a beat this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of Zacks Rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive company. Our model predicts that the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise as it currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.14% and a Zacks Rank #3.General Motors has a positive outlook for 2017, mainly driven by robust retail crossover sales. In September 2017, the company’s total U.S. vehicles sales increased 11.9% year over year. In August, too, the auto giant’s total U.S. sales rose 7.5%.

202,PCAR,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and PACCAR Inc (PCAR  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PACCAR is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PCAR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.09 per share for PCAR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PCAR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.82% heading into earnings season.PACCAR Inc.

206,PCAR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PACCAR Inc (PCAR  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.7. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, PACCAR’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 16.8 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.However, the stock’s PE is pegged higher than the Zacks Auto sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.6. This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers. We should point out that PACCAR has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 18.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PACCAR stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PACCAR has a P/S ratio of about 1.5. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. This makes the stock undervalued from the P/S aspect as well.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PACCAR currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PACCAR a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A. This gives PCAR a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter and full year have seen eight and nine estimates go higher respectively in the past sixty days compared to no downward revisions.This has had a small positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the full year consensus estimate has risen by 0.5% in the past two months, while the current quarter estimate has remained unchanged. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PACCAR Inc. Price and Consensus  PACCAR Inc. Price and Consensus | PACCAR Inc. QuoteThis somewhat bullish trend is why the stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, this Zacks Rank #2 company has a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among Top 14% of more than 250 industries), which hints at favorable broader factors. In fact, over the past year, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

210,PCAR,"U.S. auto sales rebounded in September following a prolonged period of year-over-year declines. General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company’s (F  -  Free Report) pickups and popular crossovers along with Toyota Motor Corp’s (TM  -  Free Report) SUVs primarily boosted the sales figures.Americans bought cars and light trucks at the fastest rate in a dozen years in September as consumers in hurricane-hit areas of the country replaced flood-damaged cars. The momentum is expected to continue as many are still on the lookout for better bargains. Given the positive trends, investing in stocks related to the auto industry seems sensible.Harvey & Irma Drive Automakers’ September SalesThe auto industry reversed a year-long downward trend and posted solid uptick in car sales in September. According to Autodata Corp, the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for all U.S. light vehicles touched 18.57 million units last month, up from 16.14 million in the prior month. It also marked the highest sales rate since July 2005.Auto sales increased as many drivers in hurricane-affected locations, in particular Texas, replaced damaged cars. Almost 500,000 cars were destroyed after hurricane Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, had put vast areas under water. As per industry estimates, around 200,000 cars were damaged during hurricane Irma that had hit the Sun Shine state of Florida.Several analysts predicted that such hurricanes would help automakers register their first monthly gain this year. Chief investment strategist at Cascend Securities, Eric Ross added that car sales may increase in the later part of 2017 and beginning of 2018. This is because many have been mulling over the purchase of new automobiles since May. Such online activities are primarily done three to four months before the real purchase takes place.GM, Ford, Toyota Lead Rebound in Car SalesThe three largest sellers in the United States – General Motors, Ford Motor and Toyota – posted strong sales numbers in September following months of declines. Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (NSANY  -  Free Report) also posted higher-than-expected sales.General Motors – The No. 1 U.S. automaker led the pack with 279,176 cars and trucks sold in the United States in September, up 11.9% on a year-over-year basis. This represented a nearly 12% jump in sales compared to the same period last year. Such a feat was possible owing to a 43% increase in sales of crossovers and 10% uptick in pickup trucks, which overshadowed an 11% decline in passenger cars. Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of GM’s sales operations said that “our new crossovers from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac have been very well-received, and Chevrolet had an outstanding month with the Silverado and Colorado.”General Motor’s inventory level dropped to 76 days supply in September from 88 days in August. This is a positive, especially, when analysts criticized the automaker for having oversupply of new vehicles. In fact, General Motors claimed that it will reduce its inventory level further to 70 days by the end of the year.Ford – The automaker sold 221,643 vehicles in total, gaining 8.9% on a year-over-year basis.  Its F-Series pickup sales surged 21.4%, with 82,302 trucks sold. Demand for its Super Duty, with the premium Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum trim levels, remained strong.Ford added that sales of its Explorer, Sport and SportTrac SUVs totaled 21,207. Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president, U.S. marketing, sales and service added that their “business was strong nationwide, with retail increases in 12 of our 21 sales regions, with particular strength in Houston.”Toyota – The automaker sold 226,632 cars in total, up 14.9% on a year-over-year basis. The automaker’s gains were broad based, with its RAV4 compact SUV climbing 44% after a new Canadian assembly plant gained momentum. Sales of its flagship product Camry also jumped after the Georgetown, KY, assembly plant switched to a new generation of vehicle manufacturing methods.Toyota’s light trucks, including Tundra, Tacoma, Highlander and 4Runner, gained as well. Overall, the segment rose nearly 29%. David Christ, vice president of U.S. sales for the Toyota brand, said that last month sales had got a “significant boost right away” from post-hurricane recovery efforts, especially, in Texas.Here’s a look at how other two major players performed in September:Car ManufacturerVehicles SoldYear-over-Year ChangeHonda142,7226.8%Nissan139,9329.5%(Source: Bloomberg)5 Solid ChoicesWith U.S. car sales gaining momentum on post-hurricane vehicle demand, it would be prudent to invest in certain stocks related to the auto industry.

212,PCAR,"In just the last decade, the automotive industry has drastically changed, in ways that we likely haven’t really noticed. Companies like Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) are redefining what it means to own a luxury vehicle, while Silicon Valley tech giants like Uber have not only helped create a new industry—ride-hailing—but it is also (controversially) working to further the development of self-driving vehicles.And Uber isn’t just the only one.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PACCAR is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PCAR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.05 per share for PCAR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PCAR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +6.06% heading into earnings season.PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PACCAR Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

224,PCAR,"Genuine Parts (GPC  -  Free Report) will release its second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 20, before the market opens.Genuine Parts reported adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share in first-quarter fiscal 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.86%. Revenues in the reported quarter increased 5% year over year to $3.91 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.87 billion.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise | Genuine Parts Company QuoteFactors to ConsiderGenuine Parts has undertaken various initiatives to boost sales and earnings, such as product-line expansion, penetration into new markets and cost-saving activities. The company relies on a diverse product portfolio for top- and bottom-line growth.Earnings per share in 2017 are expected in the band of $4.70–$4.80, up from the $4.59 recorded in 2016. Annual revenues of Genuine Parts are expected to increase in the range of 3–4%, while comparable sales growth is projected to increase 2% to 3%. Revenues from Automotive and Industrial are estimated to increase in the range of 3–4%, Office segment is expected to witness 2–3% improvement, and the Electrical segment is likely to grow 1% to 2%.However, high level of inventory is a challenge for the company. The high proportion of inventory in current assets can affect short-term liquidity of the company in periods of low sales. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Genuine Parts is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, this is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Genuine Parts is currently 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.31. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Genuine Parts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Concurrently, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks in the Auto industry you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. PACCAR Inc.
