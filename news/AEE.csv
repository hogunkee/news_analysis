11,AEE,"Amid a somewhat turbulent session for the major indexes Tuesday, many of the stocks making IBD's Utility Leaders screen showed stability.That's not all. At least four names have built sound-looking bases. Here is a brief review of their chart work.Utilities may continue to offer stable cash payouts and the prospects of capital gains so long as the Federal Reserve does not quickly raise interest rates and the prices of natural gas do not spike. The strong jobs market also benefits utilities in terms of attracting new customers and keeping current ones.Eversource Energy (ES), last covered in this column March 22, has arguably built a pair of handles on its nine-month saucer base. The first handle shows a 59.21 buy point, 10 cents above the Feb. 24 intraday high. The second handle shows an intraday peak of 60.36 and began with the reversal March 29. Add a dime to that price and you get an alternative buy point of 60.46.Notice how in both cases, Eversource did not rebound all the way back to the saucer's left-side high of 60.44.Handles that form within 5% to 15% below the left-side peak of a cup or double bottom tend to lead to successful breakouts. Remember, not all breakouts work. When the electric power utility, serving New England, cleared a 59.19 entry in an unusual-looking saucer base June 30, 2016, Eversource rallied for just two weeks, then dropped more than 16% over the next five months. Fortunately, shares did not venture far below the 10-week moving average, and a new saucer base was born.Eversource has a 3.2% annual dividend yield. It paid 47.5 cents a share March 31.Ameren (AEE) (3.2% yield) rallied past a 53.49 entry in a nearly eight month, cup-with-handle base on Feb. 21 this year. Now, shares are testing support at the rising 50-day moving average.Xcel Energy (XEL) (3.2% yield) has formed a nearly nine month, cup-with-handle base. The Minneapolis-based diversified utility has moved steadily after rising past a 44.19 entry on March 15. CMS Energy (CMS) (2.9%) has built a nine-month cup with handle, and a three-week handle offers a 45.65 entry. Again, like in Eversource and Xcel, one can see mildly lower handles within the base that are not too far off the left-side high in the cup itself.The S&P 500's annualized yield is around 1.93%.RELATED:The Income Investor: 4 Reasons Why This Dividend Play Might Soar In 2017The Income Investor: Should You Invest In These 3 Financial Plays?

12,AEE,"The 10-year Treasury yield has shed close to 30 basis points over the past month to around 2.35%, so it's not surprising to see some utilities holding their own. Utilities are interest-rate sensitive. Since they tend to carry a fair amount of debt, a rising interest-rate environment makes debt more expensive to service. More importantly, utilities act as an alternative…

60,AEE,"After re-emerging from bankruptcy in October 2012 as a smaller and leaner company, Dynegy is powering up again.The Houston-based independent power producer increased its capacity by around 50% in early December. That's when it acquired 4,000 additional megawatts of power through five coal-fired power plants in Illinois, bringing its total to more than 13,000 megawatts of power in six states.And it's looking to buy more. Still, what it owns today is a fraction of what it owned in its heyday, before Enron imploded in 2001 and caused credit to dry up and the industry to spiral downwards.Dynegy (DYN) logged nearly $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013, down from $42 billion in 2001.The company had previously owned power plants in about a dozen states and several foreign countries. It also ran gas-processing plants, pipelines, a utility and an energy-trading business.Dynegy stumbled from ""ill-timed strategic decisions and cratering power prices,"" Morningstar analyst Andrew Bischof said in a note.A Power ShiftIn 2011, the board hired Robert Flexon to lead restructuring efforts and then named him CEO. He previously worked as chief finance officer at utility operator UGI and NRG Energy (NRG), a much larger rival.Dynegy now provides wholesale power and capacity to utilities, cooperatives, municipalities and large industrial customers.The company owns nine coal plants in Illinois, including the five acquired in December from power company Ameren Corp. (AEE), which wanted out of the deregulated state of Illinois to focus more on its regulated businesses. But it was the kind of business Dynegy liked.""We felt we were in a position to operate them more effectively and efficiently since we have similar facilities also located in Illinois,"" said Katy Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Dynegy.Those acquired coal plants are broken out in financial reports as Illinois Power Holdings, or IPH.In California, Dynegy still has a natural-gas fired plant in Monterey County, Calif., and a small fuel-oil plant in Oakland. It recently retired an older natural gas-fired plant in Morro Bay, but is exploring renewable energy opportunities at the site. In the Northeast, it has three small natural gas fired plants — in upstate New York, Bangor, Me., and Reading, Pa.""Management has done a great job in fleet (plant) performance,"" Bischof said in a phone interview.In the first quarter, a key financial metric in Dynegy's industry, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) jumped to $152 million from $43 million a year earlier. The gain was driven by improved spark spreads (a metric for estimating profitability) in the natural gas segment, higher energy prices for coal and the new IPH segment, with its five coal plants.Management kept adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2014 at $300-$350 million, even though executives have said they expect to exceed that forecast.Resources For RevenueThe company is currently in a ""sweet spot,"" Bischof said. Natural gas prices have risen to around $4, making cheaper coal ""more competitive."" Meanwhile, tougher environmental regulations have caused coal-plant closures. As coal capacity tightens, power prices rise.Dynegy gets paid for the electricity its plants generate and also for their capacity, or their ability to produce power when needed.Power companies are paid via regional transmission organizations that manage supply and demand. In Illinois, the company's dominant market, Dynegy is mostly paid by a system operator known as MISO.A year ago, the auction clearing price for capacity in the 2013-14 planning year was 3 cents per kilowatt per month, but this year in the annual MISO auction in mid-April the price spiked to 50 cents for the 2014-15 planning year. Planning years for MISO run June to May.The price jump ""serves as a signal that markets are tightening,"" Sullivan said. ""So we can enter into agreements with utilities or large industrial customers for higher prices.""Readying For Price HikesEven before the recent auction, in anticipation of higher prices, Dynegy had been entering into bilateral transactions as high as $2 to $2.50 per kilowatt per month for planning years from 2015 to 2019, she says.The transmission organization PJM Interconnection completed an auction last week that also resulted in sharply higher prices, increasing revenue potential for power companies in its covered region. Dynegy has a small portion of its assets under PJM's domain (one plant in northern Illinois and one near Reading, Pa.) but is interested in exporting some energy and capacity from MISO to PJM.Its IPH segment recently secured 240 megawatts of transmission into PJM, effective for the 2017/2018 planning year.Meanwhile, Dynegy is actively looking to gain more power via additional acquisitions. Since its hands are full managing plants in Illinois, they'll likely be in or near other areas where Dynegy operates.""There is a handful available or expected to be available over the next several months and we will evaluate those opportunities as they come to market,"" Sullivan said.In a note on May 8, UBS analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith said there's a ""50% deal probability"" with Duke Energy (DUK) and various co-owned Duke assets.Deal With Duke?Duke, the largest electric power holding company in the U.S., said in mid-February that it intended to exit its volatile Midwest commercial generation business, which includes ownership interest in 13 power plants. Eleven are in Ohio, one is in Illinois and one is in Pennsylvania.Dumoulin-Smith also sees potential candidates among many diversified utilities as they seek to reduce their exposure to commodity swings, as Ameren did with its Illinois coal plants.The five coal plants now in Dynegy's hands have necessary environmental controls, Sullivan says. But Dynegy is spending $250 million to finish a scrubber project at one to curb release of the pollutant sulfur dioxide, a regulated emission.The prior owner had already spent $250 million on the project, which is expected to be completed in 2019.""Regulations change and become stricter. To meet future compliance we have to make that investment,"" Sullivan said.Top executives were unavailable for comment. CEO Flexon said in a May 8 conference call that Dynegy is actively looking to make more acquisitions, but said he didn't expect a deal to close this year. The UBS analyst expects a deal to close in the first quarter of 2015, whether with Duke or another party.

63,AEE,"Great Plains Energy (GXP) agreed to buy Westar Energy (WR), the biggest utility in Kansas, for $8.6 billion as power companies across the U.S., facing weak demand and rising operational costs, look to consolidate.Missouri-based Great Plains will pay $51 per share in cash and $9 per share in stock, Westar said Tuesday in a statement. The company will also assume $3.6 billion in debt, according to the statement. Great Plains Chief Executive Officer Terry Bassham will become chairman and CEO of the combined company, while Mark Ruelle will remain at the company until the deal closes.Westart Energy rose 9% to 57.64 in early pre-market trading on the stock market today.The transaction comes amid a boom in utility mergers and acquisitions as customers using more energy-efficient appliances and resources such as rooftop solar flatten electricity demand. There were more than $52 billion worth of utility deals pending or completed across the U.S. last year, the most since 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.“The combination of our two companies is the best fit for meeting our region’s energy needs,” said Bassham. “By combining our two companies, we are keeping ownership local and management responsive to regulators, customers and regional needs.”Westar delivers power to about 700,000 customers in Kansas and owns power plants capable of producing about 7,000 megawatts, according to the company’s website. It operates in a single state so regulatory approvals may not be as complicated to obtain as they have been for utility deals involving several jurisdictions.Goldman Sachs (GS) will provide about $8 billion of debt financing for the deal, according to the statement.Great Plains expects the accord to be neutral to earnings-per-share in the first full calendar year of operations and “significantly accretive” after that, according to the statement.Westar had also drawn interest from Ameren (AEE) and an investor group that includes Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, people familiar with the matter said last month, asking not to be identified because the information wasn’t public. Westar was working with Guggenheim Partners LLC on a possible sale, they said at the time.Westar Chief Executive Officer Mark Ruelle fanned speculation about a takeover in November when he indicated the company would be open to a sale. Ruelle declined to comment on “rumors” surrounding the company during a first-quarter earnings conference call with investors on May 4.

66,AEE,"Edison International’s (EIX  -  Free Report) unit, Southern California Edison (“SCE”), appealed to the California Public Utilities Commission (""CPUC"") for the expansion of Charge Ready 2. It is a program that will expand the installation of electric vehicle (“EV”) charging infrastructure in California. This $760-million, four-year program will allow the company to install 48,000 charging ports.Recently, SCE installed the 1000th EV charging point to increase the availability of in transportation. The Transportation sector is one of the largest source of air pollution in California, contributing nearly 45% of the greenhouse gas emission. Higher usage of EVs will lower carbon emission and for that reason deployment of electric refueling ports has become a necessity.More Electric Charging PortsThe success of the pilot program has prompted Edison to further expand its Charge Ready program through introduction of new charging ports across California. Post the approval of the program’s second phase, SCE will launch a marketing and customer education campaign to increase EV awareness.Per an estimate, nearly 7 million electric cars are required to be introduced in California by 2030 to put a check on emission levels. The new electric ports will be an integral part of the entire EV system.Apart from Charge Ready, SCE is also launching a number of other approved programs that support charging for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, transit buses, port equipment, other industrial vehicles as well as public and home-based cars.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Edison’s shares have lost 19.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.3%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEdison International currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), Avangrid, Inc (AGR  -  Free Report) and Otter Tail Corporation (OTTR  -  Free Report).

67,AEE,"U.S. stocks suffered losses on Jun 15 after trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated. President Trump announced tariffs on $50 billion worth of China’s goods. Beijing promised to evaluate the tariff and hit back in equal measure. On Jun 16, China announced that it is levying tariffs on an equal scale on U.S. goods.With bitterness increasing between the United States and its trading partners, defensive stocks have grabbed investors’ attention. These stocks offer slower but stable growth during periods of uncertainty. Since they also hold out the promise of higher-than-average yields, investing in defensive stocks looks like a prudent option at this point.   Trump Slaps Tariffs, China Strikes BackOn Jun 15, President Trump announced that the United States was imposing tariffs on $50 billion of China’s imports. Additionally, he said that the United States “will pursue additional tariffs” in case China pursues retaliatory measures. Trump added that 25% tariffs will be imposed on Chinese products that utilize ""industrially significant technologies.""China’s commerce ministry retorted that would respond by imposing tariffs on U.S. goods in “equal scale and equal strength.” On Jun 16, China’s finance ministry stated that it will launch tariffs of 25% on $50 billion of U.S. imports. Tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. imports, primarily on agricultural goods, will commence from Jul 6.  India Retaliates, Defensive Stocks Gain CurrencyMeanwhile, India is moving ahead with plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on 30 U.S. products. Per a revised WTO filing, the move is aimed at recouping tariffs worth $241 million imposed by the United States on India’s steel and aluminum in March. These fresh tariffs have been levied on almonds, apples, walnuts as well as metal and chemical products.Fittingly, defensive sectors, such as real-estate, consumer staples and utilities were the major gainers of Friday’s trading session. These stocks grow at a slower pace than the rest of the economy. However, they are more stable in nature and safer during periods of economic uncertainty.These also offer dividend yields which are higher than the overall market. Such a characteristic had actually decreased their attractiveness during a year when treasury yields have peaked. But with trade tensions cropping up, they may prove to be popular, especially among risk-averse investors.Our ChoicesTrump’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese products seems to have sparked off a full-fledged trade war. China has responded in equal measure and no resolution seems to be in sight in the near term. In fact, the trade war could actually expand in scope with countries like India choosing to impose retaliatory tariffs.Investing in defensive stocks, which offer a safe and stable choice during periods of uncertainty looks like a good option at this point.

68,AEE,"PG&E Corporation’s (PCG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) recently announced its five-year sustainability plan that aims at reduction of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from the company’s operations by 1 million tons, through 2022. This newly set goal promotes the company’s progress toward creating a sustainable energy future.A Brief Note on the Five-Year GoalIn particular, the five-year plan, known as the Million Ton Challenge, aims at reducing methane emissions from natural gas operations, increasing clean vehicles and fuels, adopting environmentally responsible products with focus on electric substation equipment, and making the existing facilities more energy efficient and sustainable.By a reduction of 10% in the greenhouse-gas emissions, the company successfully extends its ongoing sustainability efforts and continues to provide safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy options to its customers.Initiatives Undertaken Toward Goal AchievementCalifornia has mandated the state-based energy companies to reach 33% of retail electric deliveries from eligible renewable sources by the end of 2017 to 2020. PG&E Corporation already achieved the mandated target in 2017 when 33.1% of its electricity came from renewable resources. Furthermore, in the same year, nearly 80% of total electricity provided by the company came from carbon-free sources.Such achievements, along with the latest planned initiatives, should definitely pave the way for PG&E Corporation in reducing a million ton of greenhouse-gas emission by 2022.To further promote clean energy adoption, the company has increased its focus toward the adoption of electric vehicle (EV) to support clean transportation in California, via its targeted EV programs. In this context, PG&E Corporation plans on installing 7,500 EV chargers at various locations across Northern and Central California, through its EV Charge Network program.Looking ahead, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act has mandated electric utilities to deliver 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of 2028 to 2030, increasing the 33% mandate. Considering the new policy, we may expect to witness similar initiatives from PG&E Corporation, in terms of further reduction of its GHG emissions, over the long run.Price MovementPG&E Corporation’s shares have lost 34% in the last 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksPG&E Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

69,AEE,"The trade war between the United States and China just got worse, with President Trump unveiling a fresh round of tariffs on imports from China. While China has responded that it would impose retaliatory tariffs, it did not divulge details about its plan of action.Renewed fears of a trade war may result in a scurry toward safe-haven sectors as preferred investments. One of the most-popular, safe-haven sectors is utilities. This sector comprises companies that provide telephone, gas, water and electricity services.The Utilities Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund has gained over 8% in the past month against the S&P 500’s decline of 0.3%. Under such circumstances, investing in companies from the utility sector seems prudent.U.S. Blasts China With Additional Import TariffsOn Jul 10, the Trump administration unveiled a spate of fresh tariffs on imports from China. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer stated that Chinese commodities worth $200 billion such as fruits and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, rain jackets and baseball gloves among others could be charged with 10% tariffs.The newly proposed tariffs would undergo a two-month review post which a decision on its future would be taken. Trump reasoned that he is wary of China’s unfair trade practice and the country’s tendency to steal intellectual property from the United States.China Promises to Hit Back at Trump’s TariffsOn Jul 11, Beijing announced that it planned to retaliate against Trump’s most recent tariffs. However, the country did not reveal any details about how it would hit back at White House’s fresh round of duties. This has resulted in approximately $250 billion worth of Chinese goods being subject to import tariffs from the United States.The country’s commerce ministry termed such an act by the United States as ""totally unacceptable"" heightening of the already existing trade dispute between the two countries. Further, the ministry pledged to safeguard the country’s ""core interests."" Finally, the Chinese ministry also vowed to impose “necessary countermeasures” on the United States if the need be.4 Best ChoicesThe trade-war between the United States and China shows no signs of ebbing any sooner. This has got more to do with Trump’s new tariffs on additional goods worth $200 billion from China. Although China has not retaliated with a tit-for-tat tariff, it is not expected to back off.Under circumstances where geopolitical conditions remain unfavorable, investing in safe-haven stocks such as utilities would be advisable.

71,AEE,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary — Duke Energy Renewables — has finalized the acquisition of the Shoreham Solar Commons project from Invenergy. Located in Brookhaven, NY, the facility is one of the largest solar projects in New York and has a capacity to generate 24.9 megawatts (MW) of solar power.With this buyout, Duke Energy’s renewables business has set foot in New York, thereby expanding its footprint across 14 states of America. The facility came online on Jul 1, in sync with the company’s expectation to commence the project by second-quarter 2018. Duke Energy is selling the power generated from this facility to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) under a 20-year purchase power agreement (PPA).Benefits of the Project The Shoreham Solar Commons project is anticipated to generate annual tax revenues in the $0.7-$0.9 million range. Annually, the energy produced by this facility is expected to displace 29,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions and create nearly 1 million MW-hours (MWh) of clean energy over its lifetime.Moreover, the fact that this solar facility has been constructed on the grounds of a former golf course will eliminate the use of pesticides and fertilizers on the property. This, in turn, will protect Long Island's fresh water aquifer.Increasing Demand for Solar EnergyScientists are increasingly growing conscious about fossil fuel-fired energy generation and its consequences. According to them, greenhouse gases are causing global climate change and subsequent environmental hazards. As a result, renewable energies are increasingly gaining traction across the globe. A key area in the renewable space is solar energy.Now coming to the U.S. renewables industry, per the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report electricity generation from solar resources in the United States reached 77 million MWh in 2017. With this, solar energy surpassed annual generation from biomass resources for the first time, making it the third-most prevalent renewable electricity source in the nation, after hydro and wind. Going ahead, solar power generation is anticipated to increase 19.9% to 0.928 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 18% to 1.095 quadrillion Btu in 2019. Such developments and projections surely reflect growth prospects for solar energy generation in the United States. This, in turn, should prompt companies like Duke Energy that are expanding their solar assets.What’s Ahead for Duke Energy?Realizing the expanding market for green energy, the company has invested more than $5 billion since 2007. Duke Energy intends to invest $11 billion to generate energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low-carbon future. By retiring coal plants and adopting more natural gas and renewables, the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30 % since 2005. In fact, the company has set a new goal to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% from the 2005 level by 2030. On completion of the Shoreham Solar Commons project’s acquisition, we believe that the company will move a step forward toward achieving this goal.As far as the solar market’s expansion in New York is concerned, one can conclude that the city is making a rapid progress in adopting solar energy as a desired option for its citizens’ electricity generation. In February 2018, New York’s governor announced that solar power therein increased more than 1,000% from December 2011 to December 2017, leveraging more than $2.8 billion in private investment into New York's growing clean energy economy. Notably, such huge investment came as part of the Governor's mandate that half of all electricity consumed by New Yorkers should come from renewable energy sources by 2030.Considering the fact, that the Governor is aiming to make New York as one of the national leaders in clean energy growth, there is an immense opportunity of solar power installation in New York. In this line, we expect Duke Energy to make more investments in the city’s solar facilities, in days ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Duke Energy has lost 4.4% compared with the industry’s 0.9% decline. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that the company is facing.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are NRG Energy, Inc.

73,AEE,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) recently announced that the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 93 cents per share on its common stock. This would mark a quarterly increase of 3.75 cents or 4.2%.Per the company, the dividend will be payable on Sep 17, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Aug 17. The estimated annual yield on the dividend is 4.3%.Regular Distribution HikesDuke Energy has been raising its cash dividend per share every year and this is the 92nd consecutive year, in which the company has continued with the same trend.

77,AEE,"Avista Corporation (AVA  -  Free Report) has made a filing to Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) for approving its annual fixed cost adjustment (FCA) in Idaho. If lent a nod, the overall annual electric and natural gas revenues in the region will decrease by $7.2 million (2.9%) and $2.7 million (4.5%), respectively. The nod is expected to be implemented with effect from Oct 1, 2018, for electricity and Nov 1, 2018, for natural gas.The last filing by the company for annual rate adjustment with IPUC was made on Aug 1, 2017. It was done in order to increase overall electric revenues by $2.8 million (1.1%), which was effectively enforced on Oct 1, 2017. These annual filings for fixed cost adjustments are separate from those general rate case petitions, which have no material impact on the company’s earnings as well as are unrelated to the company’s proposed acquisition by Hydro One.Customer-Centric BenefitsIf the proposed filing is approved by the IPUC — the company’s residential electric customers — whose usage is on an average of 910 kilowatt hours (KWh) per month, the monthly bill will accordingly be reduced from $88.49 to $84.33, a decrease of $4.16 per month (4.7%).Also, the residential natural gas customers of the company, whose usage is on an average of 63 therms per month, will witness lower expenses on their monthly bill from $48.31 to $46.28, an improvement of $2.03 per month (4.2%).Rationale Behind the Rate DeclineRate reduction is nothing new in the Utility space. In the United States, government regulations dominate this sector. Therefore, utility providers frequently file for rate changes with the state utility commission to keep their revenue requirement competitive in tandem with the changing market conditions.The average monthly residential electricity bill in Idaho is $88 KWh per month, lower than the average monthly bill in the United States, which is approximately $107 KWh. Also, the average monthly consumption in the region is 1,010 KWh per month, greater than the average national monthly consumption of 903 KWh. So, the higher electricity consumption pattern in Idaho with modest monthly cost supports the company’s filing for rate reduction from $88.49 to $84.33 in the region with a view to strengthen the customer base as well as better serve the increased demand for electricity.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Avista have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

79,AEE,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the sale of its 17% equity stake in Eletropaulo, the company’s utility unit in Brazil. The transaction came in at a total consideration of BRL 1.27 billion ($310 million approximately) and the proceeds are expected to be used for lower outstanding debts of the parent company within next 60 days.Reason for Sell-OffDuring the first half of 2016, the company had decided to undertake a strategic move to decrease its exposure to Brazilian utility distribution market. Last November, the company converted its preferred stock stake in Eletropaulo to equity share with 17% holding interest.The Brazilian distribution business has been persistently suffering loss for the past three years. As of 31 Dec, 2017, the company reported an after-tax loss of $611 million on deconsolidation. Of the total loss, $455 million was on account of cumulative translation loss and $243 million related to pension loss.AES’ Focus on RenewableWith the strategic move of selling its interest in Eletropaulo, the company exited the electric distribution business in Brazil. It is now poised to focus on the growing need for renewables and looking forward to bring in new technologies such as, energy storage, digitalization and drone applications to the Brazilian electric sector.As of May 8, 2018, the company had a generation mix consisting of 37% gas, 32% coal, 27% renewable and 4% oil, diesel & pet coke. In addition, the company had a gross megawatt (MW) in operation of 33,965 MW.The company is rapidly expanding its renewable footprint in overseas. In this context, the company’s subsidiary, AES Gener, entered into a new contract during the first quarter of 2018 with Strabag for its Chile-based Alto Maipo hydroelectric project.Also, due to increased electricity tariff by the Argentinian government, the company evaluates this transaction as an opportunity and is looking forward to take advantage of the same by expanding renewable energy in the country. Moreover, AES Argentina agreed to acquire a 100 MW wind development project with 20 years of U.S. dollar-denominated Power Purchase Agreement. The company expects to see more such contracts in days ahead.Importance of RenewableRenewable Energy source has been gaining momentum globally. Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation on the international front over the past decade. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, thus bringing the global total to 540 GW. Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate that renewable energy will continue to grow at a faster rate than fossil fuels over the next two decades.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration report, during the 2014-2017 time period, renewable sources accounted for more than 50% of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States. In 2018, 9 GW of new solar and wind assets will be installed, reflecting the rising popularity and importance of renewable resources in the United States.Price PerformanceShares of AES Corporation have outperformed its industry over the past year.

82,AEE,"York Water Company  filed an application with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) to increase base water rates in its services areas. Through this rate increase filing, the company intends to recoup the capital investment made since the rate filing in 2013 as well as for the planned investment till Feb 2020.The rate approved in 2014 raised the company’s annual revenues by $5 million. Since the last rate filing, the company has invested nearly $77 million to upgrade and strengthen drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in its service territories.Rate Hike to Fund Capex PlansThe rate hikes no doubt increase the monthly budgets for the customers. However, water utility companies need funds to support capital investment to reinforce and replace its existing infrastructure or to replace the aging one with new set-ups. The capital investments are necessary to keep the essential supplies like water and wastewater services running 24x7 and to improve water quality as well as operational efficiency through upgrades of facilities and equipment.The company filed for a general rate hike of $6.4 million in base water and $ 288,623 in base wastewater. If granted immediately, the rate increase would be effective August 1, 2018.Aging Water Infrastructure Needs ReplacementSome of the water infrastructure in the United States are a century old, requiring immediate replacement or restructuring. The U.S. water system is wearing away and regular investments determine the need of the hour to restore it. Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced to pump in significant funds to mend the water infrastructure projects.Per the program initiated by the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA), a $5.5 billion will be provided as low-cost loan to renovate water infrastructure in the country. This funding proposal could leverage more than $11 billion in water infrastructure projects.So, if the commission continues to support regulated water utilities with justifiable rate hikes, it will assist the utilities to carry on with their infrastructure strengthening work.  Price MovementIn the past 30 days, York Water Company's stock has inched up 1.7%, outperforming its industry’s decline of 6.1%.  Stocks to ConsiderYork Water Company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

86,AEE,"Following months of negotiations, the United States and China are again on the brink of an all-out trade war. The United States has targeted a flurry of Chinese goods, while China has vowed to respond with tariffs of its own, which could hurt U.S. businesses.Trade wars are never good for the economy and squeeze corporate profit margins. Thus, this escalating trade tension is weighing on investors’ risk appetite. This, in turn, calls for investing in low beta defensive companies. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns and steady earnings regardless of the state of the equity market.Trump Announces Tariffs on Chinese GoodsThe White House will impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion Chinese imports, which has increased the chances of a confrontation with China over trade.. The United States has decided to penalize China for stealing American technology and of course trade secrets. Chinese aerospace, robotics, manufacturing and auto makers will mostly be targeted.The tariffs will be passed in two phases. More than 800 Chinese exports, worth $34 billion, will be subject to tariffs beginning in July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later.Trump gave the green light after meeting top economic officials last week, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.Trump said that trade between two of the world’s largest economies “has been very unfair, for a very long time” and that the “situation is no longer sustainable.”U.S.-China Trade Trump has, in fact, kept the doors open for further escalation if China imposes retaliatory tariffs. He had earlier suggested that tariffs could apply to as much as $100 billion worth of Chinese goods.China Vows to Retaliate, Blames U.S. of Firing the First ShotChina has accused the United States for ratcheting a trade war. The Chinese government said that it will respond accordingly to U.S. tariffs. China has vowed to impose tariffs on 545 U.S. goods worth $34 billion. These include agricultural products, automobiles and seafood. The tariffs are expected to get implemented from Jul 6. Beijing will impose tariffs on another 114 U.S. goods like chemicals, medical equipment and energy products later.Beijing confirmed that it “will immediately launch tariff measures that will match the scale and intensity of those launched by the United States.” Beijing added that “all economic and trade agreements reached by previous negotiations will be nullified at the same time.” That includes a deal to increase purchases of American energy and agricultural products.China’s Commerce Ministry, by the way, urged all the countries to act together to stop such a trade war for the benefit of business houses and “safeguard the common interest of all mankind.”American Businesses Brace for More PainAmerican companies are poised to bear the brunt of a trade war. They say that the cost of critical supplies needed to make products could jump in the near term. Multinationals, in particular, remain worried about their future ability to do trade in China. Needless to say that China is a massive market for them.Semiconductor companies including QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) were taken aback after the U.S. government decided to impose tariffs on computer chips imported from China. The Semiconductor Industry Association raised concerns by saying “while the U.S. semiconductor industry shares the Trump administration's concerns about China's forced technology transfer and intellectual property practices, the proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive.”Other multinationals like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) are caught in the crosshairs of the trade war. For Boeing, China is a big market. After all, the airline manufacturer previously said that it expects China to spend almost $1.1 trillion in the next 20 years by acquiring more than 7,200 new airplanes. Lest we forget that China had threatened to buy Airbus instead of Boeing if the United States gets involved in a trade fight.Wall Street Takes a Beating on Trade WorriesGeopolitical tensions are, thus, headwinds for companies as they erode profit margins and affect the overall economy. U.S. bourses did close lower after Washington-Beijing exchanged blows due to the ongoing trade dispute.5 Ultra-Safe Stocks to Buy NowAs the markets are plagued with trade related uncertainty, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option.

87,AEE,"On a definitive agreement with SunPower Corporation (SPWR  -  Free Report), Enphase Energy (ENPH  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire the former’s microinverter business segment for a total purchase consideration of $25 million in cash along with 7.5 million shares of the company.The acquisition is expected to be closed by the end of third-quarter 2018, subject to fulfillment of product qualification and other various conditions, mentioned in definitive asset purchase agreement.Acquisition SynergyWith the buyout of SunPower’s microinverter business, Enphase Energy would be able to integrate its seventh generation IQ microinverter technology with the acquired company’s AC modules used in home solar system. This integration of technology would create high performance, efficient solar cells and an easy to use home solar system. The company would be able to add value to its revenue component and expand its customer base. The consolidation would aid the combined entity to avail of the benefits of experience and expertise of the acquirer in the area of microinverters used for home solar system.Also, the company estimates this acquisition to add nearly $60-$70 million annualized revenues by the second half of 2019 with approximately 33-35% gross margin. The company would add nearly 140 new patent rights to its existing portfolio via this acquisition.Solar Industry OutlookPer U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the source of energy from renewables has increased over the years. Around 55% of the total energy, nearly 21 gigawatt (GW) added in the United States last year, was from a renewable source. Also, as of February 2018, 22% of the country’s total electricity generation comes from a renewable source.By 2018 end, EIA expects an additional 5,067 MW of solar power to come online. According to the forecast, solar capacity is anticipated to grow by 127 gigawatt (GW) from 2020 to 2050. Also, electricity generation through solar will likely account for nearly 14% of the total energy output to be generated during the same period.Per Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), some renewable energy sources have grown over the years owing to federal policies in the United States. Electricity generation via wind and solar enjoys a special federal tax credit. This tax credit is one of the key growth-drivers for solar power generation companies as the credit allowed to power generator is transferred to end users through lower solar prices.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Enphase Energy have gained significantly by 465% compared with its industry’s surge of 36%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEnphase Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Given its operational efficiency, the company can carry out debt servicing uninterruptedly.Long-Term Plans of Alliant EnergyAlliant Energy has plans to invest nearly $5.4 billion during the 2018-2021 time frame. Post 2021, within the 2022-2026 time frame, the company plans to invest nearly $5 billion to strengthen its electric and natural gas distribution, and generation portfolio, along with their operations. The investments will primary focus on generating more production from the renewable assets.To complete these capital projects on time and within budget, the company will have to issue new debts to fund these capital projects. Meanwhile, the rising interest rates are a concern. However, the strong state economies in its service areas, constructive regulatory environment and nearly 99% of the earnings generated from the regulated operations provide ample visibility and stability to the company, thereby ensuring its financial flexibility.Price MovementAlliant Energy has gained 1.2% in the past three months against its industry’s decline of 2.7%.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksAlliant Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

89,AEE,"Avista Corporation (AVA  -  Free Report) announced that it is seeking proposals or tender offer from the developers of the renewable energy projects, who owns or operates or can build up to an average of 50 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy via single or multiple proposal with a minimum net annual output of average 5 MW of electricity. Avista will consider proposals that include storage associated with the generation assets.To avoid complexities of building the facility, the company has come up with a Request for Proposal (RFP). The parties eligible for a tender offer to the company via RFP should own an existing facility, propose to develop or should possess rights to construct facilities for generation of renewable energy.Avista’s Take on Renewables & Capex PlanThe company is intending to increase the energy output more from the renewable source. It is looking forward to opportunities for acquisition or addition of more renewable energy resources to its existing capacity in order to offset market purchases and fossil fuel energy generation. The company is planning to generate electricity at lower cost in the long term, thereby reducing the heavy dependence on fossil fuel to some extent.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total capacity of 1,875 MW with an electricity generation mix of 55.5% from renewable (Hydro-49%, Wind-4.5% and Biomass-2%).The company is expected to incur a capital expenditure of around $1,237 million over the 2018-2020 period on generation, transmission and distribution system to preserve and enhance the reliability of the services provided to its customers and to replace the aging infrastructure.Importance of RenewableRenewable Energy source has been gaining momentum globally. Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation on the international front over the past decade. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, thus bringing the global total to 540 GW. Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate that renewable energy will continue to grow more rapidly than fossil fuels over the next two decades.In 2018, per U.S. Energy Information Administration report, 9 GW of new solar and wind assets will be added, thus underscoring the rising significance of renewable sources in the United States.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Avista have outperformed the Zacks Utility industry. The stock has rallied 21.2% versus the industry’s decline of 9.6%.  Stocks to ConsiderAvista currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

90,AEE,"Ameren Corporation’s (AEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Ameren Missouri, recently announced that it has signed an agreement for acquiring a 400-megawatt (MW) wind farm in northeast Missouri. Notably, Ameren Missouri will purchase the farm following its construction.The transaction seems to be in line with the company’s goal to reduce carbon emissions up to 80% by 2050.Details of the AgreementThe wind farm will consist of 175 technologically-advanced wind turbines and electricity generated from these turbines will be sufficient enough to power an estimated 120,000 homes by 2020. Post construction, the wind farm will become the largest wind energy provider in Missouri.The transaction still remains subjected to a number of regulatory conditions, while the financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Benefits of the BuyoutAmeren Missouri’s 20-year outlook plan pledges to expand clean energy in Missouri and possibly neighboring states with an investment of $1 billion in new wind generation projects. This venture is expected to produce at least 700 MW of new wind-generated energy by 2020. Impressively, Ameren’s latest buyout of the wind farm will enable the company to meet 50% of this planned capacity.Moreover, the company’s Mark Twain Transmission Project, which got the regulatory go-ahead this January, will aid the wind farm to distribute energy more seamlessly in Missouri with the former’s expanded transmission capacity. Indeed, energy from the new wind farm, together with the new transmission lines of the Mark Twain project, will enable Ameren to deliver greater energy reliability, economic growth and better access to clean energy sources to the residents of Missouri.Our ViewWind energy is one of the fastest growing forms of electricity generation from clean energy in the United States and thereby, plays a pivotal role in the country’s rapid expansion of low-carbon electricity generation. The U.S. wind power industry had a strong finish to 2017, with 7,017 MW of new wind capacity installed in the country, representing $11 billion in new private investment, as per a report published by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA).Moreover, the pipeline of wind farms under construction or in advanced development totals 28,668 MW as of 2017 end, reflecting a 34% increase compared to 2016 end. Going forward the wind industry’s powerful growth is poised to continue in 2018 as well, delivering jobs and private investment to rural areas and factory towns and resulting in an overall economic growth.Such valued growth prospects of the wind industry must have encouraged Ameren Corp. to invest in the latest wind farm.  Missouri, being the national transportation hub for rail, river, road, and air shipments in the United States, has energy consumption per capita at the national median. Naturally, energy demand is high in the state that offers solid opportunities to electricity providers, like Ameren, to expand its footprint in there.Coming to its operational performance, the company witnessed a solid 48% year-over-year increase, driven by higher Ameren Missouri electric service rates and retail sales. Considering its latest expansion plans for wind energy in the state of Missouri, we may expect the company to deliver similar bottom-line growth in the coming days.Price MovementAmeren’s stocks gained 1.0% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s decline of 6.3%. The company’s modernized approach and focus on increasing customer reliability might have led to the outperformance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmeren carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few top-ranked stocks from the same space are NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), TerraForm Power, Inc. (TERP  -  Free Report) and Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report).

We expect the effect of this debt reduction to get reflected in the company’s first-quarter results, in the form of lower interest expenses, which in turn, is likely to boost its bottom line.The acquisition of sPower was a key growth driver for the company in 2017. In fact, AES Corp. gained higher equity earnings last year on account of new solar projects at sPower.

QuoteFactors at PlayCenterPoint Energy witnessed increased customer count during fourth-quarter 2017, which in turn, bolstered its quarterly growth. We expect the company’s first-quarter results to reflect a similar trend. Further, rate relief, energy services and midstream segments are likely to drive CenterPoint Energy’s performance in the to-be reported quarter.The reduction in tax rates, primarily associated with the unregulated businesses, is expected to positively drive the bottom line of the company. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings of 44 cents, marks a 18.9% increase year over year.Major regions of CenterPoint Energy’s service territory witnessed colder-than-normal winter during the first quarter.

(ED  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 3.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 2.56%. However, Consolidated Edison lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average miss of 0.05%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Consolidated Edison Inc Price and EPS Surprise Consolidated Edison Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Consolidated Edison Inc QuoteFactors at PlayOf late, Consolidated Edison has been incorporating renewable energy in its grid at an increasing rate. As a result, its fourth-quarter 2017 results reflected higher revenues from renewable electric production projects. We expect the company’s first-quarter results to reflect the same.Weather pattern tends to influence quarterly results of utility providers. During the first quarter, Consolidated Edison’s service territories witnessed fluctuating weather, which might impact its revenues.The company’s regulated based utilities offer it with a stable earnings base. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings of $1.33 reflects an improvement of 4.7% year over year.In January 2018, the company announced a dividend hike of 10%, reflecting the 44th consecutive annual dividend rise. Such dividend hikes hint at a solid cash flow reserve for the company, which we expect to get reflected in the to-be-reported results.Earnings WhisperOur proven model shows that Consolidated Edison is unlikely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

In Pennsylvania, the company completed significant transmission projects, including the first phase of the $160 million Greater Scranton Transmission Reliability Project, which is going to a have positive impact on earnings. However, higher financing costs are expected to offset the gains.The company’s higher cash repatriation from its U.K. segment is going to have a positive impact on its overall performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues has increased 1.64% to $1,983 million from same period last year.

97,AEE,"Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on May 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.28%. Moreover, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 12.35%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn December 2017, South California Edison (SCE), a subsidiary of Edison International, secured wildfire insurance worth $300 million for 2018 and requested the California Public Utility Commission (“CPUC”) to approve recovery of the associated premium worth approximately $121 million. Per the company, this insurance cost might drag its 2018 earnings per share by 29 cents, until the CPUC addresses this request. Moreover, Edison International expects to incur additional insurance costs during the current year, in excess of what the company had requested in its general rate case (GRC).Consequently, these additional costs are expected to partially weigh on Edison International’s earnings in the quarter to be reported. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings reflects an 18.2% decline year over year.On the flip side, moderate or worse drought conditions extended across southern California at the onset of the first quarter while the state as a whole witnessed a dry winter with temperatures dropping below normal levels. This, in turn, is anticipated to increase household consumption of electricity and thereby boost Edison International’s first-quarter revenues.However, considering the impact of the latest tax reform, which reduced the corporate tax rate substantially, the company has lately updated its GRC that requested a 2018 revenue requirement of $5.5 billion. This reflects a $106 million decrease from the 2017 revenue requirement.Therefore, the positive impact of high electricity demand on the company’s top line might get neutralized by the aforementioned revenue requirement reductions. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edison International’s first-quarter revenues of $2.46 billion represents a drop of 0.2%.Edison International Price and EPS Surprise Edison International Price and EPS Surprise | Edison International QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Edison International is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

100,AEE,"Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the market opens.Last quarter, the utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 5.34%. Moreover, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 1.05%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPer Ameren’s third-quarter earnings call, fourth-quarter 2017 earnings are expected to be impacted by expenses associated with the fourth quarter Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage.However, the company’s earnings are likely to increase on the back of strong rate-based growth and disciplined financial management. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s fourth-quarter earnings of 33 cents per share reflects an annual growth of 153.9%.Moreover, we expect the company’s yet-to-be reported quarter’s result to duly reflect the increase in revenue recognition, resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act.  Also the company expects to incur low interest expenses driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017, which is likely to get reflected in the upcoming results, partially.Further, the company’s service territories witnessed almost normal temperatures during the fourth quarter.

102,AEE,"Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois (“ATXI”) — recently received approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) to proceed with the construction of the Mark Twain Transmission Project. The approval followed ATXI’s receipt of the certificate of convenience and necessity (CCN) from the MoPSC.Details of the ProjectThe transmission project is a 100-mile, 345,000-volt transmission line and substation, which will run from Palmyra to Kirksville in Missouri and north to the Iowa border. Per Ameren management, once completed, this project will accomplish a critical link in the region's energy infrastructure. The project is also expected to deliver greater energy reliability, economic growth and better access to clean energy sources to the residents of Missouri.The route will run through the Adair, Knox, Lewis, Marion and Schuyler counties of Missouri and will include the construction of the Zachary Substation adjacent to the Adair Substation in Adair. The route will co-locate on Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative’s 161,000-volt line between Palmyra and Kirksville and Ameren Missouri's 161,000-volt line from Kirksville to the Iowa border.Construction of the project, worth $250 million, is expected to begin in April 2018 with a targeted in-service date of December 2019. The company plans to work with Northeast Power, landowners, county commissioners and various local and state agencies on the project.About the Mark Twain ProjectThe Mark Twain project is a MISO-approved transmission line to be built in Northeast Missouri. In the third quarter of 2017, ATXI finalized an alternative project route and reached agreements with a cooperative electric company in Northeast Missouri and Ameren Missouri to locate nearly the entire Mark Twain project on existing transmission line corridors. It also received consent for road crossings from five affected counties in Northeast Missouri. In September 2017, ATXI filed for the certificate of CCN with the MoPSC and anticipated a decision from the MoPSC in the first half of 2018. The recent approval was in line with the company’s expectation.Our ViewAmeren follows a systematic investment strategy, primarily for growth projects and infrastructure upgrades. This strategy has helped the company provide reliable services and maintain a dependable and safe transmission system which will help meet rising demand.The company’s current long-term capital-expenditure plan worth $11.2 billion comprises up to $0.6 billion of investment in ATXI. These investments will support its overall system reliability, environmental compliance and electric and natural gas utility infrastructure improvements.Missouri, being the national transportation hub for rail, river, road, and air shipments in the United States, has energy consumption per capita at the national median. Naturally, energy demand is high in the state that offers solid opportunities to companies like Ameren.Toward this end, the Mark Twain project approval will help the company deliver more reliable electricity in various regions of the state as well as cost-effective energy savings beyond new efficiency standards. This in turn will attract more customers, subsequently allowing Ameren to expand its revenue margin.Price MovementAmeren’s stock has moved up about 8.1% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 2.6%. The modernized approach and focus on increasing customer reliability might have led to the outperformance. Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmeren carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Pampa Energia S.A.

104,AEE,"Federal Reserve officials supported a June rate hike but weren’t in a rush to tighten rates aggressively this year. They were not certain that inflation will stay around 2% for long and suggested that even higher inflation might not result in faster rate hikes.A slower rise in interest rates boosted rate-sensitive sectors. Thus, investing in home builders and utility players from the Fed’s latest decision seems judicious.June Rate Hike in the CardsMinutes from the Fed’s May 2 meeting showed that most of the policymakers have agreed that a strong economic outlook warranted a rate hike “soon.” Traders in the federal funds futures market are pricing in a 90% chance of a June rate hike. Fed officials kept the target range for the benchmark overnight lending rate unchanged at 1.5% to 1.75% in early May after raising rates in March.The Fed said in the minutes that “most participants judged that if incoming information broadly confirmed their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate for the committee to take another step in removing policy accommodation.”Fed to Go Easy With Rate Hikes This YearBut, the policymaking arm of the Fed seems to remain flexible on its inflation targets, indicating that it is not in a hurry to bump up rates faster than planned. The officials also mentioned that it won’t be a problem if prices of essential commodities went past the Fed’s target range of 2% and concluded that rate hikes will be gradual this year.The odds of three more rate hikes this year instead of two declined after the minutes. The CME’s FedWatch tool showed that the Fed funds futures market sees less than a 40% chance of a fourth rate hike this year.Fed’s Calm About InflationThe minutes, in fact, said that “it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2%, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the Fed’s 2% objective.”This showed that most of the Fed officials were not convinced that inflation will remain at elevated levels for long even though the Fed’s preferred indicator reached 2% in March. After all, it has taken such a long time for inflation to get there, with so many fits and starts. It was only a “few” officials who thought that inflation may go past the 2% mark.Rate-Sensitive Sectors GainWith the Fed minutes reassuring investors that the central bank won’t be too aggressive in hiking rates, shares of rate-sensitive utilities and real estate scaled north. Both the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) were top-performing sectors on May 23, raking in 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively.Utilities are capital-intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements. Hence, these companies have high levels of debt. Low interest rates will help them pay off debts and book profits.But, higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level, for that matter a steep debt/equity ratio, impact the credit ratings of these utility operators. If the credit ratings go down, a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates, leading to a rise in cost of operations.Rate hikes are also a dampener to real estate activities. After all, the average American will bear the brunt of higher borrowing costs. James Cassel, chairman and co-founder of the investment banking firm Cassel Salpeter in Miami had said that if aggressive rate hike happens, losers might include “construction-related businesses, like homebuilders.”5 WinnersWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid sectors that are poised to gain from decelerated hikes in the near term.

105,AEE,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) — recently announced that the last project of Solar 4 All program has commenced operations. It will be used as backup during extended power outage in Department of Public Works (DPW) building located in Pennington Borough, NJ.Other three solar storage projects of Solar 4 All have already commenced services at Hopewell Valley Central High School, Cooper University Hospital and Caldwell Wastewater Treatment Facility in New Jersey. The Solar 4 All is a 158 megawatt-dc solar program, which is used to develop solar integrated projects to increase reliability of grid resiliency for unplanned prolonged outage.How This Storage System Works?The Pennington DPW solar storage system consists of 1,188-panels, 404-kilowatt-dc solar system with 200 megawatt-hour Tesla Energy lithium-ion batteries for storage. The project can provide power to 65 homes annually directly though grid. During day times, it recharges the batteries along with providing electricity to the building. At night, those batteries are used for supplying power. This way the system ensures emergency power service when required.Prospects in Solar IndustryPer a report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), solar electricity generation in the nation was 211 gigawatt-hour/day (GWh/d), which is likely to increase to 246 GWh/d in 2018. In spite of the rapid uptake, solar contributed just 1.3% of the total U.S. utility-scale generation in 2017, indicating immense scope for growth in the solar market.Realizing the fact that alternative energy will gain traction in the future, many utility providers have recently shifted their focus toward renewables as their preferred source of energy. Being no exception, Public Service Enterprise is also expanding its renewable assets apart from focusing on transmission and distribution infrastructure.   With solar energy being a key area in the renewables space, the company is rapidly expanding its base in solar. As of Dec 31, 2017, PSEG Power owned and operated 414 MW dc of photovoltaic solar generation facilities across various states. To further expand its solar operations and support New Jersey Senate’s bill that requires utilities in the state to source 80% of their electricity from renewable energy by 2050, Solar 4 All seems to be an apt strategic decision by the company.Price MovementPublic Service Enterprise’s shares have returned 16.8% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s gain of 0.8%. Consistent investments in infrastructure projects and focus on expanding renewable assets have boosted Public Service Enterprise’s performance.Zacks Rank & Key Picks Public Service Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Toward this, it aims to invest approximately $866 million toward TNPM and nearly $856 million for PNM transmission and distribution.Fresh Investment & Customer Growth HelpsThe company witnessed year-to-date customer growth of 0.7%. At the TNMP division, performance in the third quarter of 2017 can be attributed to better revenues driven by customer additions that grew by almost 1.3% for the quarter compared with the prior quarter. We expect the increased demand driven by higher customers to be reflected going forward as well.Overall, we believe that the company is poised to benefit on the back of customer additions and robust capital expenditure planning. Notably, capital expenditure toward energy efficiency programs will aid it to support increased demand in service territories.We believe that these factors will aid the company to fulfill its targeted 6% ongoing earnings growth through 2021.Steady Performer & Dividend GrowthPNM Resources has been a consistent performer with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 10%.At the end of the third quarter, the company generated cash and cash equivalents worth $43.1 million, substantially up from the 2016-end figure of $4.5 million.

The company’s net cash flows from operating activities during the first nine months of 2017 amounted to $417.3 million.Additionally we believe that such robust cash flow generating capability encouraged the company to increase annual dividend and reward investors with a dividend hike of 9.3%, recently in the month of December.

109,AEE,"WEC Energy Group’s (WEC  -  Free Report) board of directors recently announced plans of raising quarterly dividend on its common stock to 55.25 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018. This represents an increase of 3.25 cents per share or 6.25% over the current quarterly rate.Post the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend will amount to $2.21 per share of common stock, up from 52 cents of common stock distributed earlier. This revised quarterly stock dividend is expected to be payable Mar 1, 2018, to stockholders of record on Feb 14, 2018.WEC Energy’s Regular Dividends HikesPer management, this plan to raise the quarterly dividend is in line with the company's long-term earnings growth objective. Notably, the company expects to witness long-term earnings per share growth at an average annual rate of 5-7%.WEC Energy has been a consistent performer with its earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.08%. Meanwhile, this utility has been gaining steadily from increased customers in the last few quarters, which in turn has been boosting its revenue growth. Evidently, at the end of third-quarter 2017, the company gained from an additional of 9,000 electric and 18,000 natural gas customers compared with the year-ago quarter.Consequently, these gains got translated into substantial earnings growth, which have encouraged it to reward its shareholders by consistent dividend hike  at regular intervals. In this line ,the company hiked annual dividend rate to $2.08 from fourth-quarter 2015 level of $1.98 in Jan 2017, reflecting an increase of 5.1% return value to shareholders. Notably, the company paid $492.4 million in dividends during the first nine months of 2017, an increase of $23.8 million from the same period last year. Moreover, it boasts a dividend yield of 3.04% much higher than the S&P 500’s growth of 1.77%.Going ahead, the company is currently projecting annual dividends to grow in tandem with earnings and a payout ratio of 65-70%. We anticipate these factors to contribute significantly toward the company’s performance and bode well with its long term strategies as well.Why are Dividend Hikes Regular for Utilities?Utilities like WEC Energy, Ameren Corp (AEE  -  Free Report) and Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report) enjoy more or less stable earnings, owing to endless need for electricity and utility services, which primarily drives the revenues of the Utility sector. This helps the stocks in this space to enjoy a steady flow of revenues.Owing to the nature of steady income generation, these stocks tend to generate consistent profits and reward shareholders with high dividends and WEC Energy is no exception. In line with this, another utility, PNM Resources, Inc. (PNM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has approved an annual dividend hike of 9.3% for the company’s common stocks in December 2017.

111,AEE,"The third-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark. Total earnings for the 327 S&P members that have already released results are up 7.8% year over year on 6.5% higher revenues, with 74.9% beating earnings and 65.7% topping revenue estimates.Combining the results of the 372 S&P 500 members with the index’s members yet to report, we expect total third-quarter earnings to be up 5.6% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on Zacks Utilities sector this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space were expected to drop 3.8% on 1.1% lower revenues as of November 1. Notably, 10 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline. Read more details in the weekly Earnings Outlook.Notably, capital intensive utilities were impacted by increased interest rates in March and June, this year. In addition, the utilities operating in Texas and Florida were severely hurt by the hurricanes (Harvey and Irma).With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, consequently making them a more attractive option for investors.Therefore, to maintain their performance level, these utilities are resorting to cost savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing more on renewable energy to generate electricity with lower emission.  Let us take a sneak peek at the four utility stocks scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3.Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 0.98% in the previous quarter.Last month, Hurricane Irma led to catastrophic losses in Florida. As a result, Duke Energy’s electrical system suffered significant damages in Hardee and Highlands County. The company took several initiatives to address these issues and initiated repair work, which included rebuilding this system. These must have increased the third-quarter expenses of Duke Energy, which we believe might weigh down on its bottom-line.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 7.8% year over year. The same for sales are anticipated to drop 1.1% to $6.75 billion.According to our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proven model does not show that Duke Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.78% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.55, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. Moreover, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). (Read more: Will Irma's Impact Dent Duke Energy Q3 Earnings?).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Energy Corporation QuoteAmeren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.49% in the last quarter.In soon-to-be reported quarter, Ameren’s earnings are expected to be affected by a non-cash estimated charge of 6 cents per share, primarily at the parent company. Again, owing to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, the bottom line will decrease by approximately 23 cents per share.In this regard, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s third-quarter earnings reflects 9.9% decline.Our proven model does not show that Ameren is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.31. Moreover, it carries a Zacks Rank #4.

Though the company didn’t announce any significant damage caused to its power plants, it is expected that the effect of the storm might weigh down on its profitability in the quarter.On the brighter note, the unemployment rate in CenterPoint Energy’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents for third-quarter earnings projects a decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues of $2.02 billion hints at an improvement of almost 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.Our proven model does not show that CenterPoint Energy is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

This decision is likely to act as a strong catalyst for the company’s growth, since it will boost Pinnacle West’s Arizona Public Service unit’s revenues by an estimated 3.3%. Notably the new rates, effective from Aug 19, will increase the residential bill by approximately 4.5% or about $6 per month. We may expect the rate increase to get reflected in improved revenues of APS in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company projects to witness extended outages at its Four Corners power plant, in the second half of this year for the installation of pollution control equipment. This is expected to push up its operating and maintenance cost for third and fourth quarters of 2017, which in turn may dent the bottom line for coming quarters.Our proven model does not show that Pinnacle West is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

112,AEE,"Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3, before the market opens.Last quarter, this utility delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.49%. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 2.83%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the second quarter earnings call, Ameren declared that it expects to incur non-cash estimated charge of 6 cents per share in the third quarter, primarily at the parent company. This charge is the result of revaluation of deferred taxes owing to an increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate, effective Jul 1, 2017.The company also stated that due to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, its earnings will decrease by approximately 23 cents per share in the quarter under review. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s earnings reflects 9.9% decline, for the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, the unemployment rate in Ameren’s service territories is less compared with the national average. An improving economy is also likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Moreover, the company’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the quarter. This, in turn, will result in higher household expenditures on cooling, consequently leading to improvement on the revenue front.Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ameren Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Ameren is likely to beat estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates.

113,AEE,"Electric and gas utility provider, Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) recently enticed investors by announcing an attractive hike of 4% in its fourth-quarter cash dividend. This hike increased its common stock dividend to 45.75 cents per share from the prior quarterly cash dividend of 44 cents.The dividend hike has increased the company’s annualized equivalent dividend rate to $1.83 per share from the prior level of $1.76.The common share dividend will be payable on Dec 29 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 13.Dividend Trends among UtilitiesThe utility sector is a fundamentally strong sector as demand for utility services is generally immune to fluctuations of the economic cycle especially as these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas and water, which can never go out of demand. This makes the stocks in this space as safe-heavens one and they enjoy a steady flow of revenues and cash flows.As a result of steady flow of uninterrupted income in general, these stocks tend to generate consistent profits and reward shareholders with high dividends and Amerenis no exception. In this line, another utility operator, MGE Energy Inc.  rewarded its shareholders a dividend hike of 5% in the month of August. (Read More: MGE Energy  Rewards Shareholders with 5% Dividend Hike)Our ViewAmeren's primary focus for the foreseeable future revolves around core utility customers and creating long-term value for shareholders. It boasts a regular distribution record since 1998 and a dividend yield of 2.91%, much higher when compared with S&P 500’s dividend yield of 1.81%.The company follows a systematic investment strategy, primarily for growth projects and infrastructure upgrade, which enables it to provide reliable services to customers, besides meeting increasing demand. This is evident from the better-than-expected results that Ameren delivered in the previous quarters. Evidently, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in last four quarters with a positive average earnings surprise of 2.83%.In the long term, we believe that the company’s future dividend course will however be based on its earnings growth, cash flows, economic and other business conditions. Toward this, it is imperative to mention that the company expects to spend approximately $11.2 billion during the 2017-2021 time frame, in order to support overall system reliability, environmental compliance, and electric and natural gas utility infrastructure improvements. This indicates sufficient income growth that Ameren projects to generate, which in turn will enable it to make such ample investments.To summarize, we believe the company’s earnings growth profile, combined with a solid dividend yield compared with other utility peers, will be an attractive opportunity for shareholders to invest in Ameren.Price MovementAmeren has outperformed the industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares gained 29.5%, compared with the industry’s increase of 13.5%. Ameren continues to invest systematically in its infrastructural upgrades and grid modernization, which in turn may have driven the outperformance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmerencurrently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Investors can consider better-ranked stocks in the Utility space like NRG Energy, Inc.

114,AEE,"We issued an updated research report on The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) on Sep 7. This global power company follows a strategy of reducing complexity and portfolio simplification through withdrawal of operations in the markets that carry risks.In line with this strategy, AES Corp. sold its combined heating and power coal plants in Kazakhstan, for net proceeds of $24 million, in April 2017. In the same month, the company agreed to sale the undivided interest of its DP&L subsidiary in Zimmer and Miami Fort for $50 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.One of the company’s notable business strategies include reduction of costs. To this end, AES Corp earlier launched initiatives worth $400 million for cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiatives. The initiatives will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements.Moreover, the company is merging its Europe and Asia strategic business units this year that is expected to lead to significant savings. Such initiatives are expected to enable the company achieve $50 million of incremental annual benefits in 2017 and to reach its annual savings target by 2020.Further, to curb carbon emission, AES Corp.’s generation mix includes a large portion of gas and renewables. In this line, AES Corp. is on track with its 1,384 MW Southland Repowering Project in California and has completed the $2 billion non-recourse financing for the project this June. The project is expected to initiate following this financing, in line with management’s expectation.AES Corp. has a 1,320 MW OPGC 2 project in India, which is making steady progress on construction. The project is expected to come online by the end of 2018.These projects are expected to be a key contributor to the company’s earnings and cash flow growth through 2020.On the flip side, the company’s results  has been reflecting lower margins owing to deferred fuel cost following the rate case of IPL in 2016, as well as lower regulated ESP rates at DPL.This might have lead the company to underperform its broader market. Evidently, AES Corp.’s share price has lost 13.9% in the last one year, against its broader industry's gain of 4.8%. The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

116,AEE,"Avista Corp.’s (AVA  -  Free Report) operating division Avista Utilities, recently filed an Electric Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for 2017 with the Washington and Idaho public utility commissions. The IRP is a 20-year plan to cater to the needs of customers by providing them a source of safe and cost-effective energy.The recently filed IRP is in sync with the company’s strategy of meeting customers’ energy demands by 2026, which it intends to achieve through adequate resources and controlled generation contracts.Details of the PlanThe company submits an electric IRP with the authorities every two years containing the details regarding projected growth in energy demand along with new resources required to serve customers over the next 20 years.Per the latest IRP, Avista’s existing generation resources are cost effective and reliable enough to meet the needs of customers over the next 20 years. Additionally, the company is going to develop of a 15 megawatt MW (DC) solar facility for its commercial and industrial customers.Outcome of 2017 IRPAvista’s projected greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation portfolio in this IRP is 29% lower than the projected greenhouse gas emissions as identified in the 2015 IRP. Along with this, the company’s current energy storage costs are also significantly lower than the last IRP, per the current IRP plan.Additionally, the company anticipates customer load growth to decrease to 0.5% in the 2018-2037 IRP timeframe, replacing the 0.6% projected growth in the 2015 IRP. The company currently derives more than 50% of total generation capacity from hydro, wind and biomass renewable sources. Given Avista’s focus on generating more electricity from renewable sources, we expect renewable energy contribution to increase further from the present level.With the help of the new IRP, the company aims to add newer solar resources and additional renewable options to cater to the needs of its customers. Taking into consideration the above factors, the company seems well poised to fulfill the customers’ needs along with balancing environmental responsibility.Price MovementIn the past year, Avista has outperformed the industry.

117,AEE,"We issued an updated research report on Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) on Aug 29. Of late, Entergy is gradually shifting from being a hybrid to a pure-play utility.The company began this process by closing Vermont Yankee power plant in 2014. Going forward, it plans to shut down its Palisades power plant in October 2018 and its Pilgrim plant in May 2019. In April 2020 and 2021, the company plans to close Indian Point Units 2 and 3. The company aims to increase investments toward the modernization of grid buoyed by rising customer demand and favorable regulatory support.Of the recently made investments, in April 2017, the company signed a purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation. Per the deal, Calpine will construct the plant, which will consist of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units with a total nominal capacity of approximately 360 MW. Once completed in 2021, Entergy will purchase the plant for $261 million.To diminish the risk and volatility in the EWC business, the company is gradually reducing its EWC footprint. In line with this, the EWC earned 10.2% less net income in second-quarter 2017 for the company compared to the prior-year quarter’s level.On the flip side, higher nuclear labor costs are hampering the company’s operational growth, which in turn is escalating its nuclear generation expense. Moreover, Entergy recently witnessed lower generation from its nuclear plants, primarily due to an increase in outage days and lower fuel expense which resulted from impairments.This might have lead the company to underperform its broader market. Evidently, Entergy’s share price has gained 2.8% in the last one year, compared to its broader industry's gain of 8%.The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

120,AEE,"PNM Resources, Inc. (PNM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has approved an annual dividend hike of 9.3% for the company’s common stocks.Notably, the revised quarterly stock dividend of 26.50 cents per share will be payable on Feb 1, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Jan 18, 2018. Post the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend will amount to $1.06 per share of common stock, up from 97 cents per share of common stock distributed earlier.Dividend Hike – A Common Strategy for UtilitiesUtility operators like PNM Resources generate more or less stable earnings, owing to endless need for electricity and utility services, which primarily drives the revenues of the Utility sector. This helps the stocks in this space enjoy a steady flow of revenues.  As a result of steady flow of uninterrupted income, these stocks tend to generate consistent profits and reward shareholders with high dividends and PNM Resource is no exception. In line with this, another utility, Ameren Corp (AEE  -  Free Report), rewarded its shareholders with a hike of 4% in its fourth-quarter cash dividend, this October. (Read more:Ameren Rewards Shareholders With Dividend Hike of 4%)PNM Resources’ Strategic PlansPNM Resources aims at fulfilling its strategic goal to deliver above industry average dividend growth in the near term. We believe the latest dividend hike approved by its management is indicative of that strategy.Notably, PNM Resources has been a consistent performer with its earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 10%. Going ahead, the company targets a dividend payout ratio of 50-60% of its ongoing earnings, which depends on the company’s cash generating capability.At the end of the third quarter, the company generated cash and cash equivalents worth $43.1 million, substantially up from the 2016-end figure of $4.5 million. This indicates the strong cash flow position of the company, which in turn will allow it reward its stakeholders with scrumptious dividend payments. Evidently the company paid dividend worth $58.3 million at the end of third quarter, up 10% from the prior-year period.We believe the company’s strong cash flow generating capability will aid it to fund incremental dividends and thereby meet its long-term target of payout ratio, as mentioned above.Price MovementPNM Resources has outperformed the industry in the last six months. The company’s shares gained 14.6%, compared with the industry’s growth of 4.6%. The outperformance may have been driven by the company’s strong cash generating ability.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPNM Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

126,AEE,"Dynegy Inc.  recently concluded the offering of senior notes worth $850 million, with an interest rate of 8.125%, due 2026.Per the offering, Dynegy will use the proceeds from the senior notes offering as well as yields from the sale of Troy and Armstrong facilities in July, and cash in hand worth $480 and $200 million, respectively. This will be utilized to repay a principal amount of approximately $1.25 billion of its outstanding senior notes, carrying interest rate of 6.75%, due 2019.The company will also pay in advance part of its outstanding senior secured term loan worth $200 million, and use the remainder of the proceeds for the fulfillment of payment obligations in relation with fees and corporate purpose expenditure.Ongoing Debt ReductionDynegy has been working on its strategy to strengthen balance sheet and monetize non-core assets, while using the proceeds to fund growth projects and utilize the excess toward debt lowering purposes. In February 2017, the company completed The Illinois Power Holdings (Genco) financial restructuring program and repaid debts worth $640 million.Going forward, the company also has plans to sell a certain portion of assets in Southeastern New England subject to federal approvals. Proceeds from the sales are also to be allocated toward debt reduction purposes.Our ViewThe company exited the second quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in liquidity. Even with the debt reduction initiatives, the debt-to-capital ratio of the company is presently 79.16%, much higher than the S&P 500 level of 41.80%.Given the ongoing increase in interest rate, the rising debt levels can adversely impact the performance of the company. We believe Dynegy should continue with debt restructuring initiatives to improve capital structure and create long-term value for shareholders.Price MovementDynegy has underperformed the industry in the last twelve months. The company’s shares lost 21.5% against the industry’s gain of 8.2%.The price underperformance can be attributed to the earnings volatility that Dynegy has been facing for quite some time now, due to volatility in supply, fuel price volatility, interest rates, and other seasonal factors.Stocks to ConsiderDynegy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors can consider better-ranked stocks like NextEra Energy, Inc.

131,AEE,"We issued an updated research report on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) on Aug 11. The company started off 2017 on a solid note as more natural gas pipelines came online in the second quarter. Shares of NextEra Energy have outperformed the industry’s rally in the last twelve months. Additionally, earnings per share and total revenue in the second quarter were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to significant contributions from both FPL and NEER segments.The company's steps toward lowering emission levels and saving up on electricity bills for customers have aided it to gain a favorable economic environment. This can be attributable to continued shutting down of coal-fired power plants and addition of a natural gas-fueled plant to lower its carbon footprint.In the last two years, FPL has executed contracts with two independent coal-fired power plants with the goal of shutting down both plants, consequently saving hundreds of millions of dollars for customers. The company is planning to shut down one more coal unit, subject to approval from Florida Public Service Commission.Through several clean energy initiatives along with focus on increasing production, the company has saved nearly $8.6 billion in fossil fuel costs for customers since 2001. Further, the initiatives have prevented 108 million ton of carbon emission from the power stations.With long-term earnings growth currently pegged at 7.37%, the company is poised well to carry on its strategic initiatives. Further, NextEra Energy continues to work on its long-term investment in clean energy assets. In sync with the strategy, the company announced plans to add nearly 2,100 megawatts (MW) of universal solar generation across Florida over the next several years and construct a modernized highly fuel-efficient natural gas plant near Fort Lauderdale.NextEra Energy has brought nearly 2,500 MW of renewable power in service in 2016 and anticipates bringing nearly 4,900–8,000 MW of new renewable projects online over the 2017–2018 time period.Another company that is benefiting from systematic investments and strategic initiatives is Ameren Corp.

134,AEE,"Electric services provider, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), has laid down a request for rate increase with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). If the requested new rates are approved by the NCUC, it will come in to effect spring 2018.Other DetailsThis recent filing would reflect an overall 2.5% increase annually, as Duke Energy Carolinas' last rate adjustment request in North Carolina was way back in 2013. Once approved by the state regulators, revenues are expected to increase by $647 million, for an overall average rate increase across customer groups by 13.6%. The average rate increase will be 16.7% for residential and 10.9% rate increase for commercial and industrial customers.Reason for Filing- Duke Energy’s TakeThe current rate request filing by the company is in sync with its aim of modernizing power plants, generating cleaner electricity, by responsibly managing coal ash and improving reliability. This, in turn is likely to increase value for customers and shareholders for a smarter energy future.Energy saving initiatives such as implementation of modern technologies at its facilities to expand scale of operations is likely to bode well, going forward. Notably, the company’s robust five-year capital plan and current plans of investing about $37 billion in growth projects over the 2017-2021 time frame support this notion.Our ViewThe solar energy market in the United States has evolved massively in the past few years. In fact, Duke Energy Carolinas has retired half of its older, less-efficient coal plants which lack state-of-the-art emission controls and had them replaced with cleaner, natural gas-fueled plants. The utility has also supported the sustainable growth of solar energy, helping move North Carolina to second in the nation for overall solar power.We appreciate the company’s efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing newer renewable projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.Another company that is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources is Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report). This utility is currently planning to invest about $4.2 billion in renewables over the next five years. The company expects to bring 3,400 megawatts of renewable generation online by 2020.Price MovementDuke Energy has outperformed industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares gained 13.2% compared with the industry’s increase of 11.2%.Duke Energy’s focus on core domestic regulated assets and highly-contracted renewable business are going to drive performance over the long term.Zacks RankDuke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

135,AEE,"As of Aug 2, 79.3% of the S&P 500 index’ market cap has come up with quarterly results. Out of this, 74% came up with an earnings beat, while 68% surpassed revenue estimates. Overall, earnings are now expected to record a 9.7% increase on 5.4% higher revenues, with 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors expecting positive earnings growth. The picture should become clearer by the end of this week, as a number of the index members are scheduled to come up with results.As far as the Utility sector is concerned, 58.6% of the stocks in this space have reported their quarterly results as of Aug 2. Of them, 64.7% came up with an earnings beat, while 58.8% exceeded revenue estimates. For Q2 as a whole, sector earnings are likely to improve 1.7% on 7.2% higher revenues. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our Earnings Outlook.Notably, companies in this space, characterized by their defensive nature and domestic orientation, need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This is likely to hurt the utilities.On a brighter note, the U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which has further boosted growth prospects for these utilities as opposed to those that are engaged in expanding their renewable resources.   Let’s take a look at four utilities – Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report), Ameren Corp. (AEE  -  Free Report), Vistra Energy Corp. (VST  -  Free Report) and Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.

Hence, we expect the second-quarter’s results to reflect a fraction of this investment.Additionally, the unemployment rate in Ameren’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is also likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Moreover, the company’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the to-be-reported quarter.

137,AEE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Aug 4.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 9.43%. Moreover, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 0.16%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Sempra Energy is likely to beat estimates this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

The announcement also included a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for EPS in the range of 10–11% and completion of 100 megawatts renewable projects, over the same period. Although the overall impact of these plans will be realized over the long term, the company most likely has started taking initiatives toward achieving them, which is expected to get reflected in the upcoming second-quarter results as well.During its first-quarter earnings call, Sempra Energy announced that its IEnova unit projects will complete three natural gas pipelines, worth $900 million by the end of the second quarter. Further updates on this project can be expected once Sempra Energy releases its second-quarter results. If completed, it will successfully boost the company’s growth.On the flip side, the Aliso Canyon gas leak event caused the company to incur estimated cost of $799 million in the first quarter, higher than the prior-quarter figure. Although, the company has resolved a number of key issues related to this event, there still remain a few that might continue to weigh down on the second-quarter results.Moreover, Sempra Energy faces foreign exchange exposure in Mexcio and South America, wherein it does not hedge the additional costs.
