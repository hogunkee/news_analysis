2,CB,"Stocks were higher at midday Wednesday but gave back some gains, as the market tried to find its footing following Tuesday's broad slide.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.4% increase, a leap that came largely thanks to Boeing's (BA) 5% rally to an all-time high. Boeing today beat earnings expectations and gave an upbeat forecast on profit and revenue for the coming year.The S&P 500 was up 0.1% after being up as much as 0.6% in today's market. The Nasdaq also climbed around 0.1% as it also faded from early gains. The main indexes recovered only a fraction of Tuesday's sharp losses and were near session lows. As IBD's signature market analysis column, The Big Picture, has noted, the market has seemed frothy and a larger pullback would not be surprising.Volume was lower compared with the same time Tuesday. Breadth was mixed, with advancers over decliners by 6-to-5 on the NYSE but losers ahead on the Nasdaq by the same ratio.The small-cap Russell 2000 reversed lower and was down a fraction. The Dow transports, however, rose 0.6% as airline and trucking stocks were among the morning's top performers.Brazil-based airline Azul (AZUL) broke out of a cup-without-handle base, gapping past a 29.53 buy point. But volume was unimpressive.A few other breakouts also were fading, including insurer Chubb (CB) (which tried to top a 156.10 buy point) and chip company Aquantia (AQ) (13.90 entry). Chubb missed earnings estimates late Tuesday. Aquantia went public on Nov. 3 and is thinly traded with an average daily turnover of 224,000 shares.Internet retail also was one of the day's winners, as Amazon.com (AMZN) rose to a new high and extended a scorching advance.The stock has risen more than 20% from its 1,213.51 buy point, an increase that justifies taking profits. Amazon.com reports earnings Thursday after the close, and shareholders have the opportunity to lock in gains and sit out the earnings announcement, and thus the risk that comes with any quarterly report.Amazon has been a member of IBD Leaderboard since March 29, 2017.Homebuilders were bouncing back and were one of the 10 best industry groups this morning. D.R. Horton (DHI) beat earnings expectations Wednesday. But the stock met resistance at the 50-day moving average and erased most of its early gains. It was a disappointing move that failed to remove worries about the industry's ability to remain a market leader.Energy, recreational vehicle, steel and some retail industry groups were the weakest. U.S. crude prices fell 0.3% to $64.27 a barrel.

9,CB,"Here's Your Investing Action Plan: what you need to know for Wednesday and beyond.Earnings season gets underway in earnest with reports from Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday and banking giants such as Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) later this week.XFor the third quarter as whole, S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 2% from the same period last year on a 5% revenue gain, according to Zacks Investment Research. That follows double-digit profit growth in the first two quarters of 2017.The technology sector should earnings up nearly 10% as revenue grows 7%. While flagship names Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) will step up to the dock as November dawns, smaller names like Barracuda Networks (CUDA), out Tuesday night, are on tap this week.Estimates for the financial sector have notably worsened over the last two months, as last quarter's back-to-back hurricanes weigh on corporate profits, especially on insurers and reinsurers such as Travelers (TRV), American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB) and Everest Re (RE).Insurers, who account for a quarter of the finance sector's total earnings, are expected to see earnings decline 25% vs. a year ago, contributing to a dip in Q3 earnings for the broad financial sector, according to Zacks.But both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are estimated to grow adjusted profits and sales in the September quarter when they report Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The impact of the storms on insurers may already be priced in, with AIG moving back toward a buy point of 67.57 after bottoming in early September and Progressive (PGR) crossing a 49.11 buy point off a flat base.Transporters and air carriers are also likely to see a hurricane-related knock on profit growth, but Delta Air Lines added 1.9% on the stock market today as the stock moves toward a 55.85 buy point ahead of the carrier's report on Wednesday.Analysts call for Delta earnings to shrink 9% to $1.54 as revenue rises 5% to $11.04 billion, Zacks said. Delta already has reported strong preliminary Q3 unit revenue figures, with United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) following suit on Tuesday.Finally, small-cap companies, which are not part of the S&P 500, should see earnings growth return in Q3. For the S&P 600 index as a whole, earnings are expected to be up 11% vs. a year ago on 5% higher revenue, snapping a run of earnings declines in three of the last four quarters.Small-cap stocks also have been leading in recent months.The finance, technology and energy sectors are likely to drive small-cap growth. Without the finance sector's contribution, small caps' Q3 earnings would drop 0.3%.RELATED:American, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapWal-Mart Sees 40% Online Sales Jump, Sets $20 Billion BuybackMove Over Techs, There's A New Sector Leader On Wall StreetNvidia Shares Jump As It Debuts Computer For Self-Driving Cars

10,CB,"Property and casualty insurance stocks such as Progressive (PGR), Allstate (ALL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and AIG (AIG) are on the decline Monday in the wake of Hurricane Harvey's landfall in Texas on Friday.XHarvey has since been downgraded to a tropical storm from Category 4, but acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke told the Washington Post on Monday that ""we are not out of the woods yet,"" and said Harvey ""is still a dangerous and historic storm.""Officials estimate that about 30,000 people will be forced from their homes, said the outlet. The hurricane has so far reportedly resulted in at least five deaths and more than a dozen injuries.Analysts and insurance executives said the industry has enough capital to withstand losses incurred from claims resulting from the storm, according to the Wall Street Journal.On Monday, Hannover Re told Reuters that the damage Harvey has wrought is projected to be well below the impact of 2005's Katrina ($80 billion) and 2012's Sandy ($36 billion).IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But the Insurance Information Institute said the flood damage caused by Harvey in Texas could match Katrina's impact, according to a separate Reuters story Sunday.Progressive shares were down 2.6% on the stock market today, but remains well above buy range, Allstate fell 1.2% to 90.89, threatening to drop below its buy zone and 50-day average, and Travelers (TRV) dropped 2.7%.AIG lost 0.8%, Berkshire Hathaway dipped 0.5%, and Chubb Limited (CB) fell 1.3%.RELATED:Stock Futures Climb As Houston Flooding WorsensProgressive Joins Rank Of Stocks With 95-Plus Composite RatingBerkshire Hathaway Outbid By Sempra For Oncor Electric Delivery

14,CB,"Drugmakers and financial services firms look like attractive investments after years of being beaten down, said Charles Pohl, a manager of the Dodge & Cox Balanced Fund (DODBX), during a panel session Thursday at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago.Financial services are the $15.8 billion mutual fund's largest sector, with 29% of shareholder money as of March 31.That mutual fund is exposed to foreign financials, including ADRs of Netherlands-based Aegon (AEG), which provides insurance, pension and asset management. It also hold bonds from the U.K.'s Barclays (BCS), which provides banking and other financial services, as well as France's BNP Paribas.Still, the fund's financial services exposure is mainly U.S. based, though those holdings do business globally. The fund's top four holdings are U.S. stocks Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Capital One Financial (COF).In the panel discussion occurring on the conference's first full day, Pohl said rising rates in the U.S. are a tailwind. So are gradually easing regulatory burdens abroad.Noriko Chen, a manager of $63.3 billion American Funds New Perspective (ANWPX), agreed, pointing out that political pressures beating down on financials globally have created buying opportunities.Swiss-based insurer Chubb (CB) is a top-25 holding. So is Hong Kong-based AIA Group, which provides life insurance and other financial services.An aging population is a key factor in making pharmaceutical companies attractive.Among pharmaceuticals, ADRs of France's Sanofi (SNY) and Switzerland's Novartis (NVS) are in the top 10 of Pohl's fund. Britain and Sweden's AstraZeneca (AZN) is also a holding.Chen said she also likes certain state-owned enterprises (SOEs) whose home-country governments mandate that the firms pay relatively hefty dividends. Some of those dividend yields in China and Brazil are 25% or higher, she said.Forty-two percent of her fund's assets are foreign stocks. Fourteen percent are domiciled in the Asia/Pacific region.Panelist Amit Wadhwaney of Moerus Capital Management, another value-oriented investor, said he likes British-based Coats Group, the world's largest manufacturer of thread.

15,CB,"Growth-hungry Cisco Systems (CSCO) has its groove back in cybersecurity — maybe in just the nick of time.With its core network business shrinking, cybersecurity seems a good bet for Cisco, analysts say. Hacker attacks are more sophisticated and widespread, while large companies and government agencies are making digital asset security a priority.And with Cisco being the Dow component and networking giant that it is, it can grow via acquisitions — something it's never been shy about doing. The new head of Cisco's security business, David Ulevitch, came from startup OpenDNS. Cisco acquired the specialist in advanced threat detection in 2015 for $652 million.""I think of us as a very large security startup,"" Ulevitch told Investor's Business Daily in an interview. ""There are only two competitors near our size, IBM (IBM) and Symantec (SYMC). We get to leverage the Cisco customer base and sales organization. But I like to operate like a startup that's growing out into the market for the first time, with products that are extraordinarily competitive, because customers are looking for best in class.""Cisco's security revenue jumped 14% to $528 million in the January quarter, growing at roughly twice the rate of the overall market. For the computer networking giant as a whole, however, fiscal 2017 revenue is forecast to grow a paltry 1% to $48.4 billion. That figure excludes divestitures.Meanwhile, cybersecurity has room to grow, comprising only 6% of Cisco's total revenue now. Cybersecurity is one key to Cisco's shift to a software and services business model from its origins in internet routers and switches. With security and other initiatives, Cisco's goal is to grow recurring revenue from software subscriptions.In late 2016, Cisco combined its networking hardware and security businesses under David Goeckeler, a senior vice president and general manager. Cisco plans to leverage its huge networking customer base and distribution channels to sell security products.Cisco was an early leader in internet firewalls that block unauthorized traffic from entering private networks. But Cisco, along with Juniper Networks (JNPR), let its product offerings grow stale.That opened the door for Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and others that introduced next-generation firewalls better suited for handling web-based applications a decade ago.Cisco took its eye off the security market for a while but has ""woken up,"" said Jonathan Ho, a William Blair analyst who follows rivals such as Palo Alto and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP).There is one caveat, though. Corporate budgets have tightened up since 2015's spending frenzy.""Security is a dynamic market where you cannot rest on your laurels,"" Ho said. ""Their customers want to stick with them, but they weren't offering compelling products before and now they seem to be doing a much better job.""Acquisitions have jelled. The 2013 purchase of Sourcefire for $2.7 billion continues to breath new life into Cisco's network security products, making Cisco a player in next-generation firewalls. Martin Roesch, Sourcefire's founder, is still at Cisco as a vice president and chief architect for the security business group.""(Cisco) has acquired a number of private companies that help them offer a broader solution than the competition,"" Ho added. ""Customers want to buy more capabilities from a single vendor, particularly if they can integrate those solutions. That seems to be the direction Cisco is heading. And the companies they are buying are addressing more forward-looking issues like public cloud and advanced threats.""Some analysts view Cisco as a security industry consolidator that could snap up more public companies, such as Sourcefire. Acquiring Check Point or Palo Alto, for example, would double the size of Cisco's security business. But, there might be too much product overlap and integration risks, analysts say.Instead, Cisco may kick the tires at more private companies. Aside from OpenDNS, Cisco bought Lancope for $452 million in 2015 and CloudLock for $293 million last year.Cisco's investment fund has backed many security startups, including Exabeam, HyTrust, Netronome, Team8, eSentire, and Skyport Systems. As in the case of OpenDNS, Cisco sometimes acquires startups it has backed.Venture capital funding in cybersecurity jumped in 2014 and 2015 after a slew of high-profile data breaches, reaching $2.5 billion in 2014 and $3.7 billion in 2015, says CB Insights.Ulevitch says he expects a shakeout among startups. It could give Cisco an opportunity to acquire emerging security technologies at fire-sale prices.""I think we're in for a Malthusian (unsustainable) environment where all these startups have been funded but there's not enough customer dollars to satisfy them,"" he said. ""There's innovation from startups but not revenue acceleration. It'll be interesting over the next 12 to 18 months. I think you're going to see a lot of consolidation.""UBS estimates that Cisco still garners half of security revenue from firewalls and intrusion prevention appliances, though it's expanding into other security markets.By acquiring Sourcefire in 2013, Cisco obtained firewall, intrusion detection and advanced malware protection technologies.With the purchase of ThreatGrid in 2014, Cisco got ""sandboxing"" technology that executes suspicious code in an isolated environment to test if a program contains a virus or malware. Through those moves, analysts say Cisco has been gaining share vs. FireEye (FEYE) in the advanced malware protection market.Cisco also competes with Proofpoint, an email security specialist. Proofpoint's software spots malware-ridden emails before they arrive in inboxes. Cisco gained email protection tools through the 2007 acquisition of IronPort Systems.With corporate America outsourcing more information-technology department workloads to cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, many security firms have been racing to acquire cloud tools. With the CloudLock acquisition, Cisco gained cloud-access security broker software. Cloud-access security products act as a middleman between a corporate network and web applications hosted externally.Analysts say internet firewalls have become a security hub, meshing various technologies. But, one worry for Cisco is that spending on network security could slow as companies prioritize new security tools.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in an October report, said Cisco could push into identity and access management, where many private companies are active, as well as security vulnerability management. Okta (OKTA), a startup that provides access management tools that authenticate network user credentials, has filed to go public. If Cisco moves into security analytical tools, it would take on Splunk (SPLK) and others.One of Cisco's challenges, analysts say, is in winning back ""thought leadership"" in how companies should combat hackers, some of whom are state-sponsored. With its networking products installed at millions of locations, one of Cisco's strengths is visibility into global internet traffic on a daily basis.To set its security technology apart, Cisco aims to turn its switches and routers into network sensors that gather intelligence and detect threats.""We gave petabytes of data that we analyze on a daily basis, and turn into strategic effectiveness,"" Ulevitch said. He says Cisco has 300 security researchers, some working on artificial intelligence and machine learning.Vijay Bhagavath, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, says Cisco outlined plans at a security conference in March on using its ""Talos"" security research outfit for tracking threats across corporate networks. Cisco expects attacks that flood a website with illegitimate requests for data to increase, for example.""Cisco's moat in next-generation security is driven by scale of the company's 400,000-plus sales-channel footprint and $200 billion networking installed base,"" Bhagavath said in a report.Amid slowing revenue growth, Cisco has restructured to lower costs. In 2016, Cisco cut 5,500 positions, about 7% of its workforce.While Cisco transforms itself, it has steadily hiked dividends. Cisco stock has been trading at the highest levels since the eve of the 2008 bear market. Cisco has $70 billion in cash on its balance sheet, giving it dry powder for shareholder returns and strategic moves.After shooting past the 32 level in mid-February, Cisco shares climbed then retreated. The stock was up 0.2% Monday to 33.02.

16,CB,"Venture capital companies are clamoring to back cybersecurity startups after record hacking last year and calls by President Trump and other global leaders to do more to protect against digital attacks.VC firms invested $3.1 billion in a record 279 cybersecurity startups in 2016, according to research firm CB Insights. That compares with $3.7 billion in 272 startups the year before and $833 million in 117 in 2010.Specialized cybersecurity VC funds have sprouted, suggesting this area of the startup world will stay busy. The latest example is Trident Capital Cybersecurity, which said Wednesday it closed a $300 million fund. Others include Allegis Capital and TenEleven Ventures.""Over time, I think they're going to win,"" said Geoff Beattie, former deputy chairman of Thomson Reuters (TRI) and current General Electric (GE) director who invested some of his own money in Trident Capital Cybersecurity. ""We want to be in on the growth of cybersecurity.""More than 4.2 billion records were exposed during data breaches last year, easily eclipsing the previous record of 1.1 billion in 2013, according to a January report by Risk Based Security. Corporate cybersecurity spending is growing at twice the rate of overall IT budgets and will reach $101.6 billion by 2020, research firm IDC estimates.Governments may pay for more cybersecurity in coming years too, with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu among leaders prioritizing this technology.Trident Capital Cybersecurity leaders Alberto Yepez, Don Dixon, Sean Cunningham and Will Lin increased their fundraising target to $300 million from $200 million last year at the suggestion of pension funds seeking to invest in the field.Yepez, a co-founder, said the firm is tracking about 1,400 startups and has invested in five so far. It has 47 advisors, including Keith Alexander, the former head of the U.S. National Security Agency who met with President Trump and other experts in the field last month.In exchange for their help and participation at biannual meetings, the advisors can invest up to $100,000 in an affiliate fund which, for no fees, allows them to own a share in the firm's portfolio companies. Most have chosen to do so, with the affiliate fund now around $4 million, according to Yepez.

17,CB,"Venture capital funds in the U.S. received the most money during 2016 since the heady dot-com days, but they're moving more cautiously as their investments are slow to realize returns.The U.S. venture industry raised $41.6 billion last year, the highest since 2001, according to a report from research firm PitchBook Data and the National Venture Capital Association, or NVCA, a trade group.However, startup investing slowed last year, while the number of venture-backed businesses that were acquired or went public fell to the lowest level since 2010, the data showed.While VCs are sitting on a gigantic stash, the situation puts pressure on them to help sell more of their startups this year, either to larger companies or the public markets. Otherwise, the firms may not be able to sustain fundraising growth if endowments or pension funds, which have poured cash into venture funds in recent years, start looking for opportunities elsewhere.VCs hope to get things moving on the backs of high-profile initial public offerings anticipated this year, such as Snap, the parent of Snapchat.Last year 726 venture-backed companies were acquired or went public, with just 39 of those in the latter category, the report said. Amid a weakening startup market in 2016, venture firms participated in 8,136 deals, compared with more than 10,000 in each of the previous two years.""It starts to hurt your M&A opportunities if there are fewer and fewer public companies,"" said Bobby Franklin, NVCA president. ""For the economic well-being of the U.S., we have to make sure we have a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem.""This year isn't off to a promising start. The Bloomberg U.S. Startups Barometer, an index that tracks fundraising activity and exits by private companies, has fallen 22% in the last month. That's largely due to a decline in acquisitions, public offerings and young startups raising capital for the first time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The unicorn era, when a growing herd of startups earned valuations of at least $1 billion from investors, may prove to be short-lived.Unicorn creation in the U.S. peaked in the third quarter of 2015, with 16 companies getting their horns, according to a separate report Wednesday from researcher CB Insights. Last quarter there were four, including OpenDoor Labs. Many unicorns have seen their valuations slashed in recent quarters.

18,CB,"Walt Disney (DIS) said late Wednesday that its flagship sports network, ESPN, lost roughly 2 million customers in fiscal 2016 to 90 million, the fewest since 2005, as Americans continue to cut the cord.Disney disclosed in an SEC filing that ESPN subscriptions fell by 2.2% in the latest year. But that's better than 2015's 3.2% fall to 92 million and 2014's 4% retreat to 95 million. ESPN subscriptions peaked at 99 million in 2013.Disney CEO Bob Iger earlier this month, on the fiscal Q4 conference call, said ESPN sub losses ""have abated.""ESPN2 customers sank 3.3% to 89 million, down from a 2013 peak of 99 million. ESPNU had 71 million subscriptions, down 1.4%.NFL ratings have fallen sharply this season. Football had been relatively immune to the cut-the-cord phenomenon, so the early season drop has triggered huge concerns throughout the sports and media circles. Some cite the election season, others blame sub-par games. But others point to the sluggish pace of play and heavy ad loads.Both Disney's Iger and CBS (CB)S CEO Les Moonves have taken a wait-and-see approach about what's to blame for NFL ratings.Meanwhile, Disney Channel lost 2 million subs to 93 million. Freeform, formerly ABC Family, sank 2.2% to 91 million in domestic customers.RELATED:Disney's 'Rogue One' Is No Womp Rat: Up To $150 Million Opening SeenDisney Holds Off On Blaming Election For Ratings Slump; Tax Deal Seen

20,CB,"The potential fees and reputation boost that could come from working on Uber Technologies' initial public offering are the stuff of bankers' dreams.Yet at least two investment banks passed on selling shares of Uber to their high-net-worth clients — shares eventually sold by other banks in January — because the ride-share company wasn't willing to provide financial details about its business, people with knowledge of the matter said.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Deutsche Bank both turned down the opportunity to offer their wealthiest clients the option to invest in Uber, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) ended up selling the shares earlier this year through those firms' private wealth divisions.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were concerned they wouldn't be able to fill demand for the offering given the lack of specifics, the sources said. Deutsche Bank also took into consideration that share sales through banks' private-wealth divisions are unusual, and it hadn't done one before, one of the sources said.The last such offering of a big technology company was more than four years ago. In that case, Goldman Sachs Group (GS) sold private shares of Facebook (FB) to international clients before the company went public in 2012.A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while a representative for Bank of America didn't respond to a request for comment.With a company like Uber, the major banks play a long game of relationship building to be best positioned when the company does pick banks to go public. While the Uber share sale was run through the private wealth divisions, it may still help put the firms in the company's good graces. With the timing of any Uber IPO unclear, banks' willingness to forgo that business is notable.Before that sale, it seemed Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and his management team had most of the leverage. For example, the company told bankers if the firms do any business for its biggest U.S. competitor, Lyft, they'd be less likely to be hired, according to people familiar with those discussions.So far, Kalanick has managed to deflect questions about the timing of the IPO. As recently as last month, he likened Uber to an ""early high schooler"" being asked to the prom. It's still a little too soon, he insisted.That reflected some progress from what he'd said a year earlier: ""We're like eighth-graders; we're in junior high, and someone is telling us that we need to go to the prom.""Uber hasn't had any trouble raising money since its founding in 2009, because investors typically want in on a highly valued startup before it goes public and the banks want a shot at a role when it does.The San Francisco-based company has garnered more than $16 billion in cash and debt since it started more than six years ago, most recently at a valuation of $69 billion. If it were to go public at that level, it would have a higher valuation than almost 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank passed on the opportunity to do business with Uber just as investor sentiment started to change for market-bound technology companies. There was a backlog of closely held internet companies, with more than 144 valued at more than $1 billion, research firm CB Insights said in a report.Colin Stewart, a managing director at Morgan Stanley who oversees tech financing at the bank, said at the time that private placements would no longer be the place to find ""very strong valuations with a plethora of investors hanging around the hoop.""Underwhelming post-IPO performances by some technology companies, including payments company Square (SQ), didn't help. Investors wanted to see a clear path to profitability.The 290-page prospectus Morgan Stanley sent to prospective investors before the January sale didn't include Uber's net income or annual revenue. The document did include 21 pages of risks, namely competition, regulatory hurdles and no assurance that the clients would see any return on their investment.The New York-based bank addressed the lack of data in its prospectus, saying ""the development of insights and big ideas is valuable to the investment process, whereas obsession over incremental 'information' flow is not.""Uber initially asked Deutsche Bank to be on the offering because it wanted to sell the stock to international investors, one of the sources said.Demand for the offering was higher from international clients than domestic, according to two people familiar with the matter. There was demand for more shares than were offered, another person said.Despite passing up on a role in the private offering, JPMorgan advised Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund on its $3.5 billion investment in Uber that was announced in June.

21,CB,"Will corporate spending on cybersecurity insurance siphon away budget dollars from security technology?Insurance companies led by American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB), Beazley and Axis Capital are eyeing the cybersecurity market. Security providers such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Check Point Software (CHKP) are paying attention.Many companies are interested in coverage for ""business interruption"" losses, if computer systems or data are unavailable due to an attack. They are finding that coverage, while other cybersecurity insurance plans cover destruction of data and property and ""reputational harm."" Theft of intellectual property, however, often is not included in such coverage, with too many unknowns for insurers.Inadequate coverage and expensive premiums keep many companies from buying cybersecurity insurance, analysts say, but they also say such coverage is improving and gaining more customers.IBD'S TAKE: At No. 56, IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group doesn't have a high enough ranking among the 197 groups that IBD tracks to warrant too much attention. But there are always areas worth attention, and one way to hone your skills is to take some lessons from IBD University on how to buy stocks.Consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers sees big growth. It estimates that total cybersecurity premiums will skyrocket to $7.5 billion in 2020 from $2.5 billion in 2015. That estimate might be low. Aon Benfield, a reinsurance broker, says cybersecurity insurance premiums will reach at least $10 billion by 2020. Insurance broker March & McLennan estimates that the cyberinsurance market — which includes coverage for business interruption, reputational harm and much more — could multiply by ""three to five times"" by 2020 from about $2 billion in 2014.The growth projections have put security technology providers on alert, but worries that cybersecurity insurance will lower spending on security technology might be overblown, says Rob Ayoub, an analyst at research firm IDC.""There's been wild theories that companies are going to chuck security out the window,"" Ayoub told IBD. ""Companies may spend less, depending on what's covered (in their cyberinsurance). But when you think of fire insurance: Just because you have fire insurance doesn't mean that you don't spend on smoke alarms or fire extinguishers, right?""Cyberinsurance may be part of the equation, but it's not a replacement for security.""Cybersecurity insurance is still evolving and most companies are evaluating how much to spend on network security vs. insurance, and what types or levels of coverage to have.If companies buy insurance, they still have reasons to keep investing in security technology. One big reason would be to get lower insurance rates. Companies might be able to buy cybersecurity insurance at lower rates by demonstrating that they've upgraded to the newest software or that they comply with industry ""state-of-the-art"" practices to deter cyberattacks.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group ranks No. 56 out of 197 groups, with Palo Alto, Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and Proofpoint (PFPT) among the stocks with the highest IBD Composite Ratings.Corporate spending on security has been growing at about a 6% annual rate, but it usually remains at just 4% to 10% of overall IT budgets, analysts say.Spending on security technologies topped $78 billion last year, says research firm Gartner. After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14 targeting such companies as Sony (SNE) Pictures and retailer Target (TGT), many companies rushed to buy security technology. That uptick in ""crisis spending"" drove security software stocks to fresh highs in mid-2015. But spending growth on security software has slowed in the past 18 months as companies reassess priorities and fewer big breaches have surfaced.Rand Corp. in September released a study claiming that the average cost of corporate data breaches is less than $200,000, not the millions of dollars that might justify higher spending on technology.But for big companies that fear the really big losses, cybersecurity insurance has limits. A Morgan Stanley study said coverage limits top out near $35 million, though other sources have said $50 million or more.Chief financial officers and boards of directors are getting more involved in setting security budgets, which generally remain under the purview of chief information officers. CFOs might prefer insurance to a bigger security budget.""At some point, enterprises will allocate incremental budget to insurance to protect against catastrophic events rather than keep on building stronger cyber technology,"" said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a recent research report. ""However, this market is still emerging, with insurance companies tackling the challenge in quantifying and pricing for potential cyber-risk.""One problem for insurance firms, says a PwC report, is a lack of actuarial data when it comes to data breaches. In the automobile insurance market, statistics are used to calculate the risk of various car models being stolen, for example. In cybersecurity, new companies aim to provide threat-trend analytics to insurance firms, not easy when many corporate victims prefer to keep smaller breaches out of the public eye.""There isn't enough historical data to gauge losses resulting from brand impairment or compensation to customers or suppliers,"" said PwC.The PwC report says that because data breaches can remain undetected for several months or even years, potential losses are hard to estimate.Some industries, such as retail and health care, face higher premiums due to potential exposure of customer data. Ultimately, though, more companies may get coverage as cyber-risk models are developed.The devil will be in the details of cybercoverage. Insurance may cover cyberattacks by organized crime rings or ""super-hackers,"" but probably not state-sponsored ones from China or Russia because of the issues involved. And liability coverage in the cybersecurity insurance realm remains limited and varies according to company and industry, observers say.In Congress, Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D.-Colo., in September introduced a bill offering a tax deduction of 15% on the costs of cyberinsurance, but the measure hasn't progressed.Jonathan Ho, an analyst at William Blair & Co. who follows Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet (FTNT), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and other cybersecurity vendors, says cybersecurity insurance will become an normal piece of a company's risk management.""Cyberinsurance is something companies will consider separately as part of risk management,"" he said. ""It doesn't remove the responsibility of trying to defend an organization to the best of your ability.""Making cybersecurity investments still makes sense. Some data losses have been in the hundreds of millions of dollars.""RELATED:Proofpoint 'Continues To Separate From Security Pack'Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint, CyberArk In FavorIs Cybersecurity Supercycle Over?

22,CB,"With LinkedIn (LNKD) sold and Twitter (TWTR) for sale, the social media boom is coming to an end. And valuations for the remaining social media companies are likely to be depressed when the startup bubble bursts early next year, according to Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry.The provocative analyst sees parallels with the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000. Sky-high valuations for startups and dubious companies going public to cash out are some of the signs, he told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: IPOs are a wellspring of innovation and can be huge stock winners. But they can reverse quickly. Read this IPO Analysis: IPO Leaders Can Fall Hardest In A Weak Market. IBD writes about fast-growing companies that went public within the past three years in the IPO Leaders column. IBD also can help you understand strong IPO bases.""The startup bubble is going to burst,"" probably in March or April, he said. Private companies are selling the promise of the next big thing in social media, cloud computing, ride-sharing and other exciting markets. But many of these companies lack intellectual property for innovative technologies that can act as a moat for their businesses, he said.""What is Uber doing that gives it a $60 billion valuation?"" Chowdhry notes. ""This is the height of stupidity and insanity … . When all is said and done, the value of Uber is a $2 billion market cap.""Seemingly every geography, including China, India and South Korea, has its own ride-sharing app company like Uber or Lyft, he said. That's because the business model can be imitated.Other unicorns (private companies with a market cap of $1 billion or greater) that are overvalued include social media firms Snap (formerly Snapchat) and Pinterest, he said. Snap is now valued at $18 billion and Pinterest at $11 billion, according to CB Insights.Consider social-media darling Snap. It is popular with young people with little purchasing power, an unattractive demographic to advertisers, Chowdhry said. He thinks Snap is worth about $1 billion.If those companies go public, they are likely to be the next Groupon (GRPN) or Zynga (ZNGA), overhyped IPOs that quickly fell.Many unicorns have tapped out the U.S. private funding markets and have found investors for now in the Middle East and Europe. But once those investors lose their taste for unicorns, likely around year's end, the bubble will start to collapse, Chowdhry predicted.Some companies are doing initial public offerings to raise cash and to give early investors an exit strategy.""The public markets are bailing out the investors in the private market,"" Chowdhry said.He called recent IPOs of unprofitable tech companies such as Apptio (APTI), Box (BOX), Pure Storage (PSTG) and Twilio (TWLO) a ""junk parade.""RELATED:Apptio Keeps IPO Wheels Turning With Strong Trading DebutThe 'Amazing' IPO Change That May Restart The Flow Of New StocksBreakout Watch: 'Ferociously Cute' IPO Clears Buy Point

23,CB,"Ford Motor (F) and four other investors are putting $6.6 million into Civil Maps, a startup developing 3D mapping technology, joining Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) in the race to develop maps that can help guide self-driving cars.Other investors with Ford include Motus Ventures, Wicklow Capital, StartX Stanford and Yahoo (YHOO) co-founder Jerry Yang's AME Cloud Ventures.Ford shares were down 0.15% on the stock market today, after retaking their 200-day average Tuesday and their 50-day average Monday. Tesla was down 0.5%, its fourth straight loss but still above its 50-day line. Apple fell 1 cent to 98.78 and Alphabet lost 17 cents to 735.63.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla's recent Autopilot accidents have raised some doubts about the future of autonomy, but automakers are scrambling to develop self-driving technology.Civil Maps' artificial intelligence software takes raw data from LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and camera sensors, then packages the information in a machine-readable map format that it says is a fraction of the size of existing technologies.Accurate, detailed maps are increasingly seen as key to developing autonomy that is reliable under a variety of driving conditions.Tesla collects data collected by Autopilot-enabled cars and uses it to refine maps. Apple and Google, which are working on self-driving cars, have also been producing maps. And a consortium of Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz recently acquired Nokia's map business after a hotly contested bidding war.Ford is among at least 30 companies developing autonomous vehicle technology, according to market tracker CB Insights, including General Motors (GM), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), Honda Motor (HMC), and Volkswagen (VLKAY).In May, Fiat Chrysler said it had signed a deal with Google to build 100 prototype autonomous Pacifica hybrid self-driving minivans and the companies plan to have them on roads for testing by the end of this year.

24,CB,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) should turn off its Autopilot driver assistance feature, Consumer Reports urged Thursday, after a driver was killed on May 7 when his Tesla Model S ran into a tractor trailer while in self-driving mode.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) last week sent a letter to the company requesting detailed information about the accident, in which driver Joshua Brown died in a collision near Williston, Fla., with a tractor trailer that was making a left turn in front of his Model S. Tesla is also reportedly being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for not disclosing the collision and death to investors via an SEC filing.The consumer products ratings and information magazine, which has 8 million readers, in an article published Thursday urged the luxury electric vehicle maker to require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel while the vehicle is in auto steering mode and to stop referring to the feature as ""Autopilot.""The magazine said in the article that, ""the incident has caused safety advocates, including Consumer Reports, to question whether the name Autopilot, as well as the marketing hype of its roll-out, promoted a dangerously premature assumption that the Model S was capable of truly driving on its own.""Consumer Reports added, ""We're deeply concerned that consumers are being sold a pile of promises about unproven technology.""IBD'S TAKE: Tesla has reported several quarters of adjusted losses. But driver assistance systems supplier Mobileye has strong earnings growth. MBLY has doubled in the past five months but needs to continue building the right side of its base. Put this stock on your watchlist. Research Mobileye at IBD Stock Checkup.Tesla said in a statement after the accident that ""neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.""Tesla CEO Elon Musk told the Wall Street in an interview published Tuesday that the company has no plans to disable Autopilot.Tesla is one of a group of 30 companies developing autonomous self-driving vehicle technology, a CB Insights reports said, along with Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Hyundai.Mobileye (MBLY),  Intel (INTC) and BMW (BMWYY) recently agreed to produce a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021.Alphabet's Google has been testing autonomous vehicles for years, but it has decided against Tesla's ""beta testing"" strategy. By using self-driving technology that isn't fully ready, human drivers may be distracted and not ready to take over when necessary. The driver in the fatal Model S Autopilot crash was reportedly watching a Harry Potter movie at the time.Tesla fell 0.45% to 221.53 in the stock market today, its third straight slim loss but still above the 200-day moving average. The stock regained its 200-day on Monday following a Musk tweet that he would release a ""Secret Masterplan, Part 2"" soon, perhaps this week.Shares of Alphabet rose 0.9%, Apple 2% and Mobileye 1.2%. GM climbed 0.4% and Ford 0.8%.

26,CB,"Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) and their venture capital units invested more in fintech companies over the past year than their rivals did, but growing concerns about the industry could taper investments this year and boost the odds of consolidation, a new report from CB Insights and KPMG found.Goldman or its corporate venture segments logged nine such deals for fintechs from the first quarter last year to the first quarter of this year, while Citi or its related units had seven, according to the report. Along those lines, two deals were accredited to JPMorgan (JPM) or its venture units, and one each for Wells Fargo (WFC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Capital One (COF).Matthew Wong, an analyst with CB Insights, said the types of investments have run across the fintech spectrum, and banks show growing willingness to collaborate with an industry that could move much of our finances to our mobile devices and overhaul the way bank branches are used.""In some cases, you're seeing banks like Goldman Sachs or others do deals in a lot of these different new areas that are emerging to have a (strategy) -- not just investment -- but being able to monitor how these spaces are evolving,"" Wong said.The investments over the past five quarters included a round of financing in Financeit, a real-time consumer financing firm, that was led by a Goldman affiliate and closed in October. Another division of Goldman led a $40 million round of funding, announced last April, for Hong Kong's CompareAsiaGroup, a site that allows consumers to compare different financial services.Citigroup's venture arm helped lead a $30 million investment, announced in September, in Chain, a company that uses blockchain -- a technology that uses shared ledger databases to cut down on middlemen -- to facilitate transactions.The report comes amid a murkier outlook for the fintech industry. On one hand, investments in fintech companies overall in the first quarter nearly doubled year-over-year to $5.7 billion globally over 468 deals, marking a recovery from the $3.1 billion raised in the fourth quarter, the report said. A recent bond offering from online lender SoFi got a triple-A rating from Moody's.And the report also talked about a massive new front opening up in insurance-related fintech, which Wong said raised more than $2.6 billion last year.""Why consumers have come to dislike insurance is there's a lot of lack of transparency,"" Wong said.He also said that far more tech entrepreneurs have tried to make getting insurance easier through online comparison platforms, brokerages and other avenues than in the past, with the Affordable Care Act even inspiring innovation despite the industry's high barriers.""The regulatory environment, as difficult as it is in other financial services, is extremely difficult to navigate for a lot of startups who are coming in, guns blazing, trying to disrupt the industry,"" Wong said.But the report also said that funding for venture-capital-backed fintech was on pace for a 10% drop in North America this year, and that U.S. investors had lost some interest in payments companies.""In North America especially, there were fewer startups in the payments space during Q1 ’16, likely due to market saturation and the success of market leaders Square (SQ) and Stripe,"" it said.And online peer-to-peer lenders, like OnDeck (ONDK), have faced concerns about insufficient loan volumes. Prosper, another online lender, said in February it would lay off around 28% of its staff.Calls for greater regulation of such online lenders have also grown amid questions about the conduct of some in the sector. The Justice Department said it would investigate online lending platform Lending Club (LC) after its chief executive resigned following a review that found that the company allegedly misled an investor on a loan sale.Shares of Lending Club have thrashed around in recent weeks, crashing after the investigations were announced and rebounding slightly after a group of Singapore-based companies said they had accumulated an 11.7% stake. On Wednesday, shares edged up 0.45%, OnDeck added 0.4%, while Square fell 1.4%. Goldman Sachs rallied 2.3%, and Citi rose 2.35%.Given those challenges, the CB Insights/KPMG report said that ""some consolidation ... is likely over the next 12 months"" in the North American fintech industry overall.And it questioned whether those difficulties could dampen investors' interest in the sector. ""It remains to be seen how the recent announcements by Lending Club and Prosper will impact that appetite and whether the balance of power switches back to more traditional financial institutions,"" Conor Moore, a senior official for KPMG's venture capital group, said in the report.

27,CB,"America Humiliated: What Iran got from detaining and debasing U.S. sailors two months ago could fill a book. In fact, Tehran boasts 13,000 pages of information from their computers and plans a book on the incident.We as Americans, blessed to live in the greatest -- and for over a century the most powerful -- country in the world, are inclined to regard images, symbolism and propaganda as having little ability to harm us. But the world's lone superpower over seven-plus years of the Obama presidency has been in an aerodynamic stall; visuals like the photo of the Iranians pointing guns at our naval personnel are the klaxons in the cockpit sounding warnings to the deaf ears of an incompetent pilot: the commander-in-chief and author of U.S. decline.Some symbolic incidents that America's enemies sought to exploit melt away and are today largely forgotten. In 1984, during the sound check before his weekly radio address, President Reagan joked: ""I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever; we begin bombing in five minutes."" Moscow called the humor ""incompatible with the great responsibility borne by heads of nuclear states"" and Western Europe's left had a conniption fit.But Reagan's actions over eight years proved he was no joker. And far from being the warmonger he was so often called, he proved he was actually a peacemaker -- through strength, of course.The viral video of 10 American sailors, one a woman, held at gunpoint by Iran's Revolutionary Guard on Jan. 12, with one of them later taped while in custody apologizing for U.S. actions, is something that might have been expected to melt away out of the collective memory by now. It is not.On Tuesday, Revolutionary Guard naval commander Ali Razmjou boasted that Iran grabbed hold of 13,000 pages of information from the computers, GPS devices and maps on board the two small U.S. Navy CB-90 fast assault craft. The Pentagon isn't disclosing whether any of it was classified, but it's hard to imagine that a U.S. patrol operating near the world's foremost terrorist state wouldn't have sensitive materials aboard. The Defense Department had previously claimed that all the Iranians secured were two digital SIM cards from satellite phones.Has the White House ordered that a security breach be covered up? We may find out if the Iranians share some of the 13,000 pages. Nevertheless, the image of Iran having the upper hand over our military so soon after President Obama's nuclear appeasement deal refuses to fade out.The details cry out for investigation. How could a U.S. vessel have been allowed to break down in Iranian waters? Is our Navy that badly equipped? Why would a U.S. Navy officer apologize, especially with cameras rolling? How, in spite of Navy training, could a briefly detained sailor be videotaped crying by the enemy?Razmjou added that the Revolutionary Guard will publish a book on the episode -- in other words yet more bang for the Iranian rial is on its way from a single incident of U.S. humiliation.This image-based propaganda victory is symbolic of something very concrete: ongoing American decline.

28,CB,"Decades of research and billions of dollars have poured into developing artificial intelligence, which has crossed over from science fiction to gameshow novelty to the cusp of widespread business applications.Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science where computers are designed to think and operate much like a human brain, supported by advanced forms of computing and software. But it’s only as smart as the amount of information fed into its memory banks. The more information, the smarter it gets. The greatest advancements have been demonstrated in the area of game playing, but AI is now showing its mettle in the business world.""People are starting to kick the tires, looking to see how it can help their business and the bottom line,"" said David Schubmehl, who follows the AI field for research firm IDC. ""The return on investment evidence is not yet clear, but it's starting to happen.""Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM) and Nvidia (NVDA) are among tech leaders with big artificial intelligence ambitions.“We’re starting to see a lot of companies beginning to use different types of AI tech for various uses,” said Schubmehl. “We’re also seeing a lot of venture capital money flowing in and a lot of acquisitions taking place.”IBM, which may have the deepest AI investments and most far-reaching ability of any company, has pitched ""cognitive computing"" as a tool for businesses via its cloud-based Watson platform.Facebook is using AI to decipher the best ways to bring Internet service to remote areas of the world and to make its News Feed feature more relevant to users of the social network.Alphabet is using it to enhance Google search abilities, improve voice recognition and to derive more data from images and video.Nvidia has developed chip technology for AI platforms used in autonomous driving features, and to enhance how a driver and car communicate.Alphabet, Mobileye (MBLY) and others also are tapping AI in the race for driverless cars. It's not enough to have Google Maps loaded up: A self-driving system must identify potholes, weather conditions, traffic congestion and other drivers' behavior -- improvising and improving on the fly.Artificial intelligence, a term coined in 1955, was popularized when IBM’s “Big Blue” became the first computer to beat a reigning world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, in 1997. IBM won again in 2011, when its Watson computer on “Jeopardy!” outsmarted the game show's two top players ever.Last October, an AI computer beat a three-time European champion in the ancient Asian game of “Go.” AphaGo, built by DeepMind, part of Alphabet's Google, beat Fan Hui by 5 games to 0, the first time a computer program has ever beaten a professional Go player and a feat thought to be a decade away. On Tuesday, AlphaGo won the first game vs. Lee Sodol, who is ranked No. 5 in the world. Tuesday's match shows that AlphaGo has made big improvements since beating the No. 633 ranked Fan Hui last year.Google paid $400 million to acquire DeepMind in 2014.But despite rapid advances, artificial intelligence is still in the early stages of business deployment.“A lot of what AI is being used for today only scratches the surface of what can be done,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder and chief scientist at Sentient Technologies. “It will become so ubiquitous that we won’t even call it AI anymore.”Sentient emerged from stealth mode in late 2014 with a massively distributed AI platform that companies can use to boost performance. As shoppers at Shoeme.ca browse through photos of shoes and click on ones they like, Sentient's technology narrows the selection, so people don’t get overwhelmed by choices. There’s no need for text-based searches or drill-down navigation, said Hodjat. The AI technology deciphers what shoppers are looking for, letting them quickly dive deeper into a catalog to find the perfect item that might otherwise go undiscovered.“We’ve revolutionized the user experience on an e-commerce website,” said Hodjat. “It’s a huge change in the way users interact with products online and therefore drives conversion.”Sentient has received $143 million in venture capital funding, the most of any AI startup, according to research firm CB Insights. Since 2010, AI startups have received $967 million in funding. Intel (INTC) alone has invested in 16 AI companies, including Saffron Technology.Saffron says its platform ""mimics the fundamental principles of how humans remember and learn."" In a case study on its website, Saffron helped an insurer to identify fraudulent auto insurance claims. Over 10 weeks, Saffron examined 113,000 claims from one year in one state and found three potential fraud rings. It then detected that these rings were part of a larger ring involved with 38 claims, of which the insurance company had paid out about $400,000 in claims. Saffron was able to collect data that identified relevant and unknown relationships, including different providers, demographics and injury descriptions, creating a knowledge store that had never been done before. Saffron forecasts that the insurer can avoid a payout of tens of millions of dollars a year.AI goes by terms such as machine learning and deep learning. IBM calls it cognitive computing. In October it launched Cognitive Business Solutions, with 2,000 consultants skilled in data analytics, cloud computing and other areas.More than 500 companies have deals to use Watson, as a cloud service, to develop commercial products, apps and services. Turner Broadcasting on Feb. 29 signed a deal to use Watson in its ad sales efforts. The Time Warner (TWX), unit owns TBS, TNT and CNN. Using IBM Watson, Turner expects to parse through all manner of data to help draw in more advertisers and provide them with greater impact.Watson Health is a platform for physicians, researchers, insurers and other companies focused on health and wellness. Medtronic (MDT) is collaborating with IBM on personalized care for people with diabetes. By analyzing patient info and data from Medtronic devices, Watson can predict low blood sugar programs three hours in advance.Artificial intelligence is all about using advanced technologies to help develop brainy reasoning from disorganized information -- unstructured data -- to derive accurate decisions.“What we’ve done with all our research is to really understand how to add unstructured data to a decision,” said David Kenny, general manager of IBM Watson.Unstructured data comes from a multitude of sources that is not organized. It can be the data bits from photos, medical images or video and audio transmissions. It can be the tons of data that flows in from cameras or sensors in buildings or smartphones, from Web traffic, tweets, inside emails, government filings or business documents. The more information an artificially intelligent computer can digest the smarter it gets.Collecting data on a massive scale is among the reasons IBM acquired several Weather Co. properties, including Weather.com, Weather Underground and mobile and cloud-based assets, for a reported $2 billion in October.IBM will be able to analyze data from more than 2 billion weather reference points, over 40 million smartphones and 50,000 airplane flights per day, letting it offer a broad range of data-driven products and services to more than 5,000 clients in the media, aviation, energy, insurance and government industries. IBM said it can provide predictive weather analytics along with real-time analysis of social media chatter, detailed understanding of transportation flows and other data that will benefit retailers and distributors.The Weather Co. assets will serve as the foundation of a new Watson unit focused on the Internet of Things (IoT). Early this year, IBM announced that it would invest $3 billion to build out IoT products and services.
"
29,CB,"“The more we do this, the smarter Watson gets and the smarter AI gets,” said Kenny.As to why AI is becoming more widespread: “It works,” Kenny said. “Users of AI are saving time and money. They’re making faster decisions and getting better outcomes.”An analysis of Facebook and Alphabet's Google by research firm Innography shows a surge in AI patent filings that began in 2010. Alphabet currently has more than 3,000 AI patents that are active or pending government approval. Facebook has about 870.Facebook last June opened an artificial intelligence lab in Paris with a goal of improving the way users interact on the world's largest social network.
"
30,CB,"""It's our hope that this research will ultimately help us make services like News Feed, photos and search even better and enable an entirely new set of ways to connect and share,"" Facebook said at the time. It also has AI research teams at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in New York.Facebook in February revealed its Connectivity Lab project. It used AI to analyze 8.3 million square miles of land, using roads, schools and other structures to determine where and how many people live in a given area. That can tell Facebook's Aquila drones where to go to provide Internet access to less-developed areas, as part of the company's Internet.org initiative.“This data will give us a greater understanding of how populations are dispersed, so governments and others can prioritize investments in infrastructure, from transportation to healthcare and education,” Facebook said.
"
31,CB,"Software developers fear that the rise of artificial intelligence might take away their jobs. That came out as the top worry of the biggest percentage of respondents to a survey of 550 software developers, conducted by research firm Evans Data.In the survey, 29% of the engineers agreed with the statement that their top fear is “I and my development efforts are replaced by artificial intelligence.”This was more troublesome than their software platform becoming obsolete, which was the second-most-cited worry at 23%, or that the new platforms they’re focusing on fail to gain market acceptance, at 14%.According to the survey, the thought of obsolescence due to AI also was more threatening than becoming old without a pension, being stifled at work by bad managers or by seeing their skills becoming irrelevant. While the developers who worried about AI were found across industries and platforms, one strong correlation was that they were more likely to self-identify with being loners rather than team players.Decades of research and billions of dollars have been poured into the development of artificial intelligence, which is quickly expanding from the tech elite to the smallest startups.Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and IBM (IBM) among other tech leaders have big ambitions for pushing the envelope of artificial intelligence.Facebook is using AI to decipher the best ways to bring Internet service to remote areas of the world and to make its News Feed feature more relevant to users of the social network.Alphabet is using it to enhance Google search abilities, improve voice recognition and to derive more data from images and video.IBM, which has perhaps the deepest investments and most far-reaching ability of any company in the field, now offers AI services through its cloud-based platform, used by companies to improve business decisions and operations, based on its Watson cognitive computing platform. More than 500 companies have deals with IBM to use Watson cloud services to develop commercial products and apps.Since 2010, AI startups have received $967 million in funding, according to CB Insights. Among the most active investors is Intel (INTC), which has invested in 16 AI companies.

32,CB,"The private-market value of high-flying “unicorns” is certain to fall as the recent rout in stock markets and the continued weakness for initial public offerings take their toll. Lowered valuations reverberate in several ways, often leading to a slowdown in funding needed to keep companies afloat and also causing highly valued employees to head for the exits, several analysts said. Unicorns…

35,CB,"San Francisco's office market is famous for the number of tech companies gobbling up space. Leading the charge have been hometown favorites Salesforce.com (CRM) and Twitter (TWTR), as well as expanding Silicon Valley-based neighbors LinkedIn (LNKD) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Some 36% of all office stock in the Bay Area is occupied by tech firms, and they accounted for 60% of all office leasing activity in the first three quarters of 2015, said commercial real estate services giant CBRE Group (CBG) in a report published on Thursday.That strong demand for space has pushed office rents to ""near dot-com peaks"" and kept vacancies tight, CBRE said. San Francisco's office market benefited the most, with average asking rents growing 129% since early 2009, to $70 per square foot as of the third quarter.But with concerns swirling over further potential corrections in tech valuations, could San Francisco's booming tech-fueled office market be on the brink of a dot-com-like crash?Maybe not, but a high concentration of young tech outfits in late stages of venture-capital financing pose risks, CBRE said in its report, noting that those founded in the last 10 years take up nearly as much space as tech firms older than that.Riding Unicorns' FortunesConcerns are especially focused on their high valuations —$1 billion or more — and whether in the current slowing environment additional funding may dry up.As Colin Yasukochi, director of Bay-area research and analysis at CBRE, told IBD: ""If they receive less money, they will probably need fewer employees and less real estate. It could potentially have an impact on the office market in San Francisco Bay.""The tech industry has historically been volatile and cyclical. Any downturn would have an impact on the Bay Area,"" he added.And San Francisco would be the hardest hit. Citing research from venture-capital tracker CB Insights, CBRE says 40 of the 60 fast-growing Bay Area tech firms in late stages of private funding and valued at $1 billion or more — referred to as ""unicorns"" by venture capitalists — are in San Francisco.The Bay Area is host to nearly half of the 144 unicorn firms tracked nationally by CB Insights, the largest concentration in the U.S.""It's a big valuation for a private company,"" Yasukochi said of the $1 billion threshold. ""If the values are viewed as too high, it may be hard to raise additional funds. And it may be difficult to go public if valuations are higher than the public markets justify. And so the concern we have, from a real estate perspective, is how that impacts their growth and needs for additional real estate.""'There Is Concern'San Francisco's office real estate could feel the pinch in the next several months or quarters, he says.Of the 40 unicorns in San Francisco, ride-sharing company Uber Technologies holds the highest valuation, at $51 billion, followed by vacation rental's Airbnb at $25.5 billion, says CB Insights.Others highly valued are Pinterest at $11 billion and Dropbox at $10 billion.""It's not a comment on any specific company. Many of these companies are financially strong and doing well,"" Yasukochi said. ""It's just that the (venture capital and stock) markets are telling us that there is concern about these companies as a group.""San Francisco's 40 unicorns account for 16% of the city's tech-occupied space and 4.9% of overall office occupancy, CBRE says.Among other well-known tech outfits taking up space in San Francisco are Zynga (ZNGA), Yelp (YELP), Square (SQ) and Splunk (SPLK).
"
36,CB,"A volatile year for initial public offerings in 2015 is expected to flow into the new year, despite a record number of high-profile ""unicorns"" galloping across the terrain.Unicorns are privately held companies with valuations of $1 billion or more. Research firm CB Insights counts 144 of them, with a combined valuation of $508 billion. In most years, there would be high expectations that many of these unicorns would be very close to making — and likely would make — their IPOs in the coming year.But with the current volatility, all bets are off about 2016 market debuts.The largest unicorn is Uber, the San Francisco-based ride-hailing company with a market valuation reported to be near $65 billion after completing a $2 billion funding round in early December.Following Uber is China smartphone company Xiaomi, valued at $46 billion. Then comes accommodations services provider Airbnb at $25.5 billion. Other high-profile unicorns include Snapchat, Spotify and Pinterest.IPOs by a few of these high-profile unicorns could signal a return to good times. But the poor performance of most IPOs in 2015 complicates whether any unicorns will make an IPO in 2016.""I expect some of these unicorns will fail before getting a chance to IPO,"" Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, told IBD. ""There are also some companies that may be forced to go public because the private market funding might tighten up. They may go public because they have to, not necessarily because they want to.""Pricing WeaknessThe pricing of IPOs has shown that kind of weakness, as investors fear that many unicorns have been overvalued and might not be near profitability.One example is payment processing company Square (SQ), which debuted Nov. 19 at $9 a share, well below its expected $11 to $13. Square stock closed Thursday at 13.09.Square wasn't alone. Many IPOs priced below their expected range in the second half of 2015, and many trade below their IPO price.""I foresee 2016 as a year that IPO buyers will be very discerning,"" said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique. ""It's not good enough to have just a nice top line, they also (must have) a good bottom line, like Atlassian.""Enterprise software company Atlassian (TEAM) turned in a strong performance with its Dec. 10 debut. The unicorn had a private-market valuation of about $3.3 billion but was valued at $4.4 billion at its IPO price. Atlassian raised $462 million, pricing shares at $21, above its expected $19 to $20. Atlassian stock closed Thursday at 30.08.Atlassian was a rare unicorn with fast-rising revenue and profits. In Q3, Atlassian says that it had revenue of $101.8 million, up 50% from the year-earlier quarter, and net income of $5 million.Square, on the other hand, while posting a 46% jump in Q3 revenue to $332.2 million, also posted a net loss of $54 million.While private companies seldom disclose revenue and earnings before filing for an IPO, Uber, Airbnb and many other unicorns are believed to have rung up big losses, spending heavily to boost growth.""Atlassian worked, but it was an extremely unique situation,"" Sweet said. ""It was the first IPO since September that actually priced above range.""Most IPOs in the third quarter priced in-range at best and often below range. Many were postponed, supposedly to 2016, but some were postponed perhaps for good.""Six-Year LowComing off two robust years, the 2015 IPO market fell to a six-year low, according to Renaissance Capital , which manages two IPO-focused ETFs. The year ended with 169 IPOs, down 38% from 2014, and raised a combined $30 billion, down 64%. Alibaba Group's (BABA) record-setting September 2014 IPO, raising $25 billion, skewed 2014 figures, but that's still a big decline for 2015.Renaissance, in a research report, said that the decline was driven by a number of factors, including uncertainties about Federal Reserve and European monetary policies, the Chinese economy's slowing growth, poor IPO performance, declining energy prices and more M&As among private companies.""The IPO market is going through a reset process,"" Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance, told IBD.In the fourth quarter, the average IPO priced 15% below the midpoint of estimated ranges. On the plus side, those IPOs were trading roughly 15% above their IPO price near year-end.""They slashed the price, but that got IPO investors a better return,"" Smith said. ""In 2016, we need to see these returns be positive in order to attract more interest in IPOs.""The unicorns have been sitting in portfolios for a long time, and the money flows from investors are abating. But (before making IPOs) some will have to wait for market conditions to improve while improving their business, because IPO investors are turning away from unprofitable companies.""A big question is whether unicorns can go public at present valuations. ""To some extent, these valuations are frothier than they should be,"" said Nizar Tarhuni, an analyst at research firm PitchBook Data. ""But it's different than the bubble we saw in 1999 in that these companies have revenue and real business models. The valuations are inflated, but they might deserve (such valuations).""According to a study by accounting/consulting network BDO USA, executives at leading investment banks are divided when asked to forecast IPOs on U.S. markets in '16.BDO found that 37% predict an increase in the number of IPOs in 2016, but just 4% believe that it will be a substantial jump. Another 36% forecast a flat IPO year, with 27% expecting a decline.

RadioShack stock last traded at 24 cents a share and no longer meets NYSE listing requirements.RadioShack and wireless carrier Sprint (S) reportedly are in talks on a deal that would see RadioShack sell up to half of its retail locations to Sprint and close down the rest. The transaction would be part of a bankruptcy liquidation, according to Bloomberg and other news services.Meanwhile, Amazon.com (AMZN) is considering using some RadioShack locations as showcases for the e-commerce firm's hardware and as potential pickup and drop-off centers for online customers, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.To date, Amazon has only opened pop-up stores during the holiday season to promote its expanding product line. Amazon's consumer electronics products include Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV streaming video boxes and sticks, Fire smartphones and the new Amazon Echo voice-command personal assistant and stereo speaker.RadioShack has more than 4,000 U.S. stores.RadioShack started in Boston in 1921, with several stores selling equipment to ham radio enthusiasts.

109,CB,"Hurricane Arthur is roaring up the East Coast. It has forced millions of people to worry about the risk to their homes and businesses.And it's a reminder about the importance of gauging your need for flood insurance. Why? Because standard homeowners insurance policies exclude flood losses.You may need flood insurance no matter where you live in the U.S.In the past five years, flooding has caused damage in all 50 states, the Insurance Information Institute says. U.S. flood losses average $50 billion per year.Generally, flood coverage comes from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is part of FEMA. If your community participates in the NFIP, flood insurance is available to local homeowners, renters and business owners.Prices are fixed, depending on how vulnerable your area and your property are to flooding. NFIP flood-insurance policies are sold by private insurers. You may be able to get this coverage from the same agent who handles your homeowners policy.And there is some relief from rising flood-insurance premiums. The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act was signed into law in March.The new law rescinds many of the cost hikes that were created by a 2012 federal flood-insurance law. The new version also generally caps future rate increases to 18% a year.In addition, the 2014 act removes a provision requiring home buyers to pay steep prices for flood insurance. Sellers said that the requirement made it harder to close deals.In some cases, premium refunds are available. If you bought a new NFIP policy after July 5, 2012, contact your agent to see if you can get money back.Paying PremiumsYou can choose any one of seven levels of NFIP coverage. For a residential building, the range is $35,000 to $250,000. For a building's contents, it's $10,000 to $100,000.You can insure your building, its contents or both.The standard premium for maximum coverage (building and contents) is $1,958 a year. That's for a single-family, one-story primary residence with no basement and $1,000 deductibles for the building and contents.Premiums are higher for a vacation home.Preferred-risk policies cost less. They're available to homes in certain flood zones if the house has a favorable flood loss history.The same maximum coverage costs only $414 a year for a preferred risk, or $460 for preferred-risk homes with basements.But NFIP premiums in high-risk areas are steeper than standard. The amount can run into five figures, depending on elevation and building construction.What if you want more than the maximum NFIP coverage, which tops out at $250,000 and $100,000, for building and contents?Some insurers offer flood policies that replace or supplement NFIP coverage with higher payout caps. Companies in this market include Chubb (CB), American International Group (AIG) and Fireman's Fund.Other insurers have been eyeing the flood-insurance market, attracted by the higher NFIP rates under the 2012 law. But the 2014 rates' reversal may have dampened interest among private insurers.If you decide to buy flood insurance through the NFIP, keep in mind that there's usually a 30-day waiting period before your policy goes into effect. That's to keep people from buying coverage right after the TV weather report warns that floods are on the way.

113,CB,"Angel investors pumped a record $1.1 billion into new ventures in 2013. That's up from $929 million in 2012, according to the Halo Report, a survey of angel investments published by Silicon Valley Bank, Angel Resource Institute and CB Insights.The top industries benefiting from the cash influx? Internet, health care and mobile technology.Here's how to invest in the next big thing.• Set realistic goals. Investing in startups means that you don't have all the financial data available to investors in public firms, says David Rose, author of ""Angel Investing"" and founder of venture platform Gust.""The odds are that at least half are going to fail,"" Rose told IBD. ""The ones that succeed have to succeed so big, they have to make up for the losses.""• Brace. Brian Cohen, an early investor in Pinterest and chairman of a group called New York Angels, says that venture capitalists have to be OK with losing large sums of money. He likens finding a winner to finding a unicorn.""Average angel investors are in their mid-50s and want to be helpful,"" he said. ""For them, this is an incredible opportunity to help young people; it's like recapturing youth.""• Go big and fast. ""The company you're looking at has to be doing something that's really big and valuable and can grow very fast,"" said Rose.Like Pinterest. When Cohen invested in the image tool, founder Ben Silbermann valued the company at $2.5 million. Just four years later, the firm is worth $3.8 billion.• Mine personal connections. Folks you know and trust can refer good ideas for which they may have done initial vetting.They also know which ideas are a good match with your interests, talent and background.• Connect. If you're just starting out and don't have many personal contacts, join more seasoned investors. Local outfits such as New York Angels are formal groups that operate in a structured way. They select a handful of companies and screen them rigorously.Gust.com lets you search for groups based on region, investment type and other criteria.Less formal meetups related to new ventures include product or service demonstrations from startups seeking funding, Rose says.• Attend conferences. Uncover innovative ideas at annual industry events. DEMO requires presenters to launch a new product or company. TechCrunch Disrupt showcases more than 200 startups. South by Southwest's Interactive Festival includes a multiday startup competition called Accelerator as well as lectures and panels.""If you see a company, you can follow up and invite them to your angel group,"" Rose said.• Size up leadership. You must meet with the owner of the business during a pitch, Rose said, because ""you're betting on the jockey, not the horse."" You're evaluating the person's leadership skills, vision and integrity. ""If I catch you in the slightest fib, about anything, you're off the table,"" he said.Cohen looks for flexible leaders: ""I look for the ability of the entrepreneur to be able to change, adapt, integrate. Can they deal with the marketplace if the marketplace is not what they thought it would be? Do they have the ability to dance? Can they see something and move in that direction quickly?""• Pick apart pitches. Due diligence is key. Rose looks for possibly overlooked red flags. Is the potential market too small to cover angel investors' return goals?Cohen says that angels look for businesses that they can boost fast and sell. ""Angels look for an exit,"" he said.

148,CB,"In 2017, the insurance industry struggled to survive the wrath of an unprecedented hurricane activity which witnessed the landfall of Irma, Harvey and Maria besides the Mexico earthquakes and the California wildfires. These consecutive calamities resulted in a massive catastrophe loss, catapulting last year to one of the costliest periods ever in terms of such huge deficits. Per a report by Munich Re, overall catastrophe loss amounted to $330 billion with the insured losses coming in at $135 billion (less than half of the incurred losses).The intensity and impact of such catastrophe events shook the insurance industry big time with the losses deeply denting its underwriting results and adversely affecting the insurers’ earnings.The current year kick-started with the early January California mudslides, causing substantial damages to homes and businesses, and the northeast winter storms, which hit the East Coast on Jan 3 and Mar 1, 2018. In fact, among the property and casualty (P&C) insurers, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has projected total catastrophe loss of $305 million, which are likely to affect the company’s first-quarter 2018 results. Losses from the California mudslides are anticipated at $125 million pretax while northeast winter storms will account for $195 million in loss.Catastrophe Loss Impact: Still a Silver Lining in the Cloud?Although the calendar year has just crossed its first quarter, we think that there is still no need for insurers to hit the panic button yet. Analysts from Morgan Stanley have estimated global Q1 insured catastrophe loss to range between $5 billion and $10 billion, which is noticeably below the historical average of $14 billion.Per a report by Fitch Ratings, the insurance industry is expected to regain its substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slow pace. Moreover, combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to break-even. Thus, insurance players can expect a better year in terms of catastrophe losses compared with the tumultuous journey in 2017.Further, catastrophe and rough weather-related events are a necessary evil for P&C insurers to improve their pricing as they eventually reduce competition. Also, occurrence of natural disasters might lead to an accelerated rate of policy renewals.Moreover, the industry has been strengthening its capital position with earnings growth and policyholders’ surpluses. Such solid liquidity profile will help insurers counter near-term volatility as well as the aftermath of adverse events.Given the unpredictable nature of weather-oriented episodes, catastrophe loss will always remain a concern for the P&C insurers and we wait to see how they tackle pressure or buckle under it, as the year progresses.On a positive front, better-than-expected underwriting results, a solid liquidity position and an evolving coverage opportunity should lend the P&C insurers enough support to grow.Interestingly, the industry has outperformed the broader market in the first quarter, evident from a gain of 0.7% against the S&P 500’s decrease of 1.2%. Outperformers in Q1There is a possibility of the catastrophe loss severity negatively impacting the results of insurers from this space in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. However, we expect some insurers to deliver favorable results on the back of a few positive factors.The increase in interest rate in March, which also marks the sixth increase post recession, reflects stability in the economy. Improving rate environment will aid investment income (forming a major portion of their revenues). Fed having promised two more rate hikes in 2018 alone, raises optimism.Lower tax incidence, growing GDP and an improving employment scenario have supported insurers’ performance.This apart, a bullish economic outlook (with the unemployment rate projected to grow at 3.8% in 2018 and the gross domestic product at 2.7%) is likely to add an impetus to the industry.Thus, the aforementioned positives will probably cushion the following stocks to push the envelope and yield profits via an underlying strength and business modification.With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we have boiled down to four stocks poised to beat earnings estimate despite all odds. Our parameters include a positive Earnings ESP, a favorable Zacks Rank and price outperformance compared with the industry in the first quarter. Also, these stocks deliver an average four-quarter positive surprise, highlighting operational excellence.Cincinnati, OH-based American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $1.94, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14.8%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, the company has an Earnings ESP of +2.40% and along with a bullish rank, it ideally comprises the right combination of two key ingredients to beat on earnings this quarter.The company came up with positive surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 26.3%.Additionally, the stock has gained 3.4% compared with the industry’s growth in the first quarter. Headquartered in New York, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) provides a range of commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations as well as individuals in the United states and internationally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $2.77, representing a year-over-year rise of 28.2%.Moreover, the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.58% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which consist of the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.The company delivered positive surprises in the two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 43.1%.Also, the stock has gained 2.4% compared with the industry’s increase in the first quarter. Birmingham, AL-based Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation  provides personal auto insurance products in the United States. The consensus mark for the period to be reported is pegged at $1.31, translating into a year-over-year surge of 40.9%. Additionally, the company has an Earnings ESP of +8.05% and a Zacks Rank of 3, indicative of the right combination of two key ingredients to surpass expectations this quarter.The company delivered positive surprises in the three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 262.3%.Moreover, the stock has climbed 11.7% compared with the industry’s gain in the first quarter.New York-based National General Holdings Corp. (NGHC  -  Free Report) provides various insurance products and services in the United States. The consensus estimate for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $0.51, registering a year-over-year improvement of 34.2%. The company sports a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Also, the company’s Earnings ESP of +5.59% along with its solid Zacks Rank of 1 underlines the right combination of two key ingredients to outpace estimates this reporting cycle.The company came up with positive surprises in the two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 11.5%.Moreover, the stock has rallied 23.8% compared with the industry’s value in the first quarter. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

149,CB,"Everest Re Group, Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) has recently provided catastrophe loss estimate of $100 million for the first quarter of 2018, mainly attributable to the California wildfires and other weather-related events. These losses are net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums.Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer had incurred catastrophe loss of $161.5 million in fourth-quarter 2017, stemming from both the Northern and Southern California wildfires.Last October and December, several areas in California were ravaged by a series of wildfires, causing in massive damages to homes and businesses. The industry’s loss estimates for the fourth quarter of 2017 ranged between $8 billion and $10 billion, which have now increased to more than $13 billion since the year-end. The above-mentioned loss estimates have mainly emanated from both the Northern and Southern Californian wildfires.Everest Re as a P&C insurer, has been significantly exposed to catastrophe loss, rendering volatility to the company’s earnings. In 2017, the company incurred pre-tax catastrophe loss amounting to $1.5 billion, primarily due to the unprecedented hurricane activity as well as two successive earthquakes in Mexico and the California wildfires. As a result, the company saw a sharp decline of 61.5% in its operating earnings in 2017.Moreover, the catastrophe loss also had a substantial impact on the company’s combined ratio, which deteriorated 1650 basis points (bps) year over year in 2017.Nonetheless, we expect improving premiums, fueled by the company’s growing global presence as well as product diversification along with higher net investment income (forming a major portion of the company’s top line) and capital adequacy to lend it enough cushion for delivering overall desirable results.Everest Re is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the period is pegged at $7.10 per share, improving 12.9% year over year. However, this estimate might change once the analysts start incorporating the catastrophe loss impact in the numbers.Further, Everest Re has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.  Shares of the company have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has gained 12.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 17.1%. Among other P&C insurers, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has also released its preliminary net loss estimates with a projected total catastrophe loss at $380 million pretax or $305 million after tax, springing from the Californian mudslides.Stocks to ConsiderTwo better-ranked stocks from the same space are Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report) and CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.      Alleghany Corporation provides property and casualty reinsurance and insurance products in the United States and internationally. The company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.2%.CNA Financial offers commercial property and casualty insurance products, primarily in the United States. The company pulled off positive surprises in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 46.9%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

154,CB,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 50.00%.  Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Chubb’s fourth-quarter underwriting results will be affected by the California wildfires. The company has projected catastrophe loss from the same at nearly $249 million after-tax. While from all other natural catastrophe events, net insured loss is estimated at $34 million after-tax. Such losses are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio in the to-be-reported period is pegged at 89%, a deterioration of 120 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, such losses will render volatility to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.30, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 15.4%.Premiums earned have likely reduced in the soon-to-be-reported quarter due to the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is pegged at $6.6 billion, representing a fall of 6.8% on a year-over year basis.Additionally, the company might have incurred higher expenses, mainly due to higher loss and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, administrative expenses and policy benefits. This in turn will weigh on the Chubb’s operating margin expansion.Nonetheless, the company is anticipated to have witnessed higher net investment income in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $773 million, translating to an increase of 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. This is mainly because of improving rate environment. Also, the company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $845 and $855 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Chubb has an Earnings ESP of -1.06%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.28, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate’s $2.30. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. D/B/A Chubb Limited New Price and EPS Surprise  D/B/A Chubb Limited New Price and EPS Surprise | D/B/A Chubb Limited New Quote Zacks Rank: Chubb holds a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 31. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.

155,CB,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) stands a good chance of leading the property and casualty insurance space, benefiting from compelling products and services. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) property and casualty insurer bears immense potential owing to a few good growth drivers.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share is pegged at $10.64 on revenues of $30.6 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 46.1% for the bottom line and 2.2% for the top line.The expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 10%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Chubb has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last five quarters with an average beat of 14.6%.The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 30. Our proven model shows that Chubb is likely to beat estimates this quarter based on the ideal combination of two strong ingredients: a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +2.12%, which makes us confident about a likely positive earnings surprise.Northbound Estimate Revision: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised 0.2% upward in the last 60 days.Price Performance: Shares of Chubb have gained 11.8% in a year’s time, underperforming the industry’s 27.2% rally and the S&P 500 index’s 23.4% registered gain. Underpriced: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio — the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next — shares are underpriced at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.36, falling significantly below the industry average of 1.67. In fact undervalued shares with growth prospects are the best investment bets. Chubb carries an impressive Value Score of B.  Growth Drivers in PlaceChubb has remained focused on pursuing growth initiatives that pave the way for long-term growth. Chubb expects both organic and inorganic initiatives undertaken in the United States, Latin America and Asia to drive improvement.While the company is intensifying focus on its middle-market business prospects, it is also leveraging cyber insurance that has huge room for growth.Chubb reviews underwriting actions in portfolios that neither meet its risk appetite nor generate decent net premium. Subsequently, the company either terminates or re-insures business to improve its risk/reward profile.Chubb is on track to achieve annual run-rate integration-related savings of $875 million (up from $800 million, guided earlier) by the end of 2018. This in turn will aid margin expansion.The US President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. This tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden to 21% from 35%. A reduced tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line as well as boost margins. The amended tax cut is also expected to make insurers more competitive globally.The gradually improving rate environment will also continue to drive better investment results. The company anticipates quarterly investment income run rate to remain in the range of $845-$855 million (up from the previously guided range of $830-$840 million).A robust financial position enables the company to return shareholders’ value through dividend hikes and share buybacks as well as pursue growth initiatives. While the company had $1.3 billion remaining under its buyback authorization, it targets a dividend payout ratio of 30% of its operating earnings. With the dividend hike approved in May 2017, the company made 24 straight yearly hikes. While Chubb’s dividend yield of 1.92% betters the industry average of 0.76%, its payout ratio of 33.3 outperforms the industry mark of 12.4.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report), Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc.

156,CB,"AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS  -  Free Report) has recently announced preliminary estimates of its total net financial impact from fourth-quarter 2017 catastrophe and weather-related losses as well as its initial assessment of the recently revised tax cut.The property and casualty (P&C) insurer has projected total catastrophe loss, net of tax and estimated recoveries from reinsurance and retrocessional covers including the impact of estimated reinstatement premiums to be $130 million. Such losses are expected to noticeably impact the company’s fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.11, which reflects a year-over-year decline of 2.6%.The loss comprises $54 million stemming from the Northern California wildfires and $38 million each from Southern California wildfires and other weather-related events. The company had earlier expected loss from Northern California wildfires to be between $$35 million and $45 million. Both Insurance and Reinsurance segments have suffered due to exposure to the catastrophe event.Exposure to catastrophe events put a considerable dent in the company’s underwriting results, rendering volatility in the company’s earnings. The fourth quarter too will not be an exception. The company had already suffered underwriting loss of $700 million with combined ratio deteriorating 2240 basis points year over year through the first nine months. The loss stemmed mainly from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and also the two major Mexico earthquakes.  Among other P&C insurers having released respective fourth-quarter catastrophe loss estimates, Arch Capital Group Ltd. (ACGL  -  Free Report) projects pre-tax catastrophe loss between $60 million and $75 million while XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) expects to incur a catastrophe loss of $315 million from the Californian wildfires and other cat events. This apart, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss of about $320 million ($249 million after-tax), stemming from natural catastrophes including the wildfires.Last year, the P&C insurers faced the biggest brunt of a massive catastrophe loss, having largely impacted the industry and qualifying the year as the costliest in terms of incurring weather-related loss. Notably, per Swiss Re, total economic loss from natural and man-made disasters in 2017 are projected at $306 billion. The wildfires in the fourth quarter also added to the woes with catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating losses to reach up to $10.5 billion. However, thanks to a cat loss of huge magnitude, insurers braved price hikes, which remained flat in the past several quarters due to a not so active catastrophe environment. This in turn will help such insurers generate more premiums and mitigate cat loss in the near term.Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective January 2018, the corporate tax rate was slashed to 21% from the pre-existent 35%. As a result, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) will incur a charge of $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to revaluation of its net Deferred Tax Asset. However, the charge will not have a material impact on the company’s fourth-quarter net income.  Shares of AXIS Capital have lost 12.3% against the industry’s increase of 6.8% since the onset of the fourth quarter of 2017. The stock has also witnessed the Zacks Consesnus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved nearly 0.7% south in the last 60 days. Nonetheless, we expect the company’s focus on expanding its business lines, strategic acquisitions to fuel improvement in premiums and a solid capital position to turn the stock around in the near term. AXIS Capital is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 7.  However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because it has a bearish Zacks Rank of 5, which lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocksportfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

157,CB,"In a bid to enhance shareholder value, the board of directors of Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) recently hiked its quarterly dividend by 13% and approved a new $750-million share buyback program.The new dividend payout amounts to 24 cents per share compared with 23 cents paid earlier. The annualized dividend of $1.04 per share yields 2.7%, based on the closing price of $38.54 as of May 24. Shareholders are expected to be awarded with the meatier dividend during the third quarter of 2018.Unum Group boasts an impressive track record of annual dividend raises. The latest hike marks the 10th straight year of increase, translating into a staggering 247% rise over a decade. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) accident and health insurer’s dividend yield betters the industry average of 1.9%.  Also, given its financial position and lower financial leverage compared the industry’s tally, the trend of continuous hikes is likely to sustain for good.Apart from dividend increases, Unum Group engages in share repurchases to lower the share count and boost its bottom line. To that end, the board of directors authorized the company to buy back up to $750 million shares through Nov 24, 2019. The new program replaces the previous $750-million program, scheduled to expire on Nov 25, 2018.With $100 million spent on buying back 2.1 million s    hares in the first quarter of 2018, Unum Group has repurchased $3.4 billion worth shares since the fourth quarter of 2008. The company estimates a $400-million share buyback this year.  The insurer’s concerted efforts to add shareholder value make its stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.A sturdy financial position, backed by a consistent solid operational efficiency by core operations, enables the company to generate enough capital. A lower tax rate is also providing additional cushion. This in turn places it well to augment its payout momentum or engage in other shareholder-friendly moves.Shares of Unum Group have lost 29.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%. However, we believe that the company’s leading status as a writer of voluntary business in the United States, its conservative pricing and reservation practices plus strategic endeavors to boost shareholder value will likely help rebound the shares.  Dividend hikes and share repurchases seem a well-accepted strategy to solidify their investor confidence in the stock. In fact, post the tax rate revamp, tax incidence of the companies has been lowered, driving earnings and widening scope for more capital deployment. Evidently, the board of directors of Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) recently announced a 3% hike in quarterly dividend. Also, CNO Financial Group, Inc. (CNO  -  Free Report) raised its quarterly dividend by 11% while United Fire Group Inc.  increased the same by 10.7%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

158,CB,"MetLife, Inc.’s (MET  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a new buyback authorization of common shares worth $1.5 billion. The recent announcement is in tandem with the company’s goal of returning $5 billion in capital to its shareholders in 2018.Last year, the company had announced a $2 billion repurchase under which it has bought back nearly $1.63 billion worth shares.Shares worth around $370 million still remains under its 2017 authorization.  Continuous buybacks lowers share count, thus providing additional boost to the company’s bottom-line.MetLife has a disciplined capital management policy in place backed by a strong risk-based capital position, sufficient liquidity and a low-debt ratio. Apart from regular repurchases, the company has hiked its dividend regularly since 2013. With the recent increase of 5%, dividend has grown at a five-year CAGR of 17.8%. Its dividend yield of 3.5% betters the industry average of 1.9%.Also a solid Return on Equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) multiline insurer’s ROE of 7.9% betters the industry average of 5.8% for the industry, reflecting its tactical efficiency in using shareholder funds.Shares of the company have lost 4.06% which compares unfavorably with the industry's gain of 2.44% in the past year. Nonetheless, sales growth in Asia and EMEA, rise in operating premiums, fees and other revenues in its Group Benefits segment and an increase in net investment income along with focus on exiting high risk businesses and a disciplined capital management is likely to help the stock rebound.Share repurchase and dividend hike seem to be a well-accepted strategy by companies to instill investors’ confidence in the stock. Recently, the board of directors of CNO Financial Group, Inc. (CNO  -  Free Report) has increased their quarterly dividend by 11%, while the dividends of Chubb Corporation (CB  -  Free Report) and United Fire Group Inc.  were hiked by 3% and 10.7% respectively.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

159,CB,"As the year 2018 set in, the insurance industry started to witness the wheel of fortune turning in its favor with the rising interest rates, improving economy, lower-than-expected catastrophe loss (as compared to 2017, which emerged as the costliest year in terms of cat loss) as well as a noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1, 2018. Hence, the industry is anticipated to deliver better-than-expected results and continue the momentum in the near term as well.Even though the insurers will be faced with challenges to counter in 2018, their primary focus remains on achieving two important objectives — top-line sales growth while bolstering bottom-line profitability.Some of the concerns such as weather-related events and political turmoil are beyond the insurers’ control. Despite these trials, we expect some insurers to generate desirable results and keep the optimism alive among investors on the stock.Here, we will talk about a few driving factors that might help insurers perform well in the near future, allaying apprehensions among investors.Rising Interest Rates: Is it a Blessing?The gradually improving interest rates have been a boon for insurers, who are major beneficiaries of the rising interest rates. The FOMC meeting on Mar 21, 2018, which also marked Jerome Powell’s first Fed meeting as chairman, further strengthened the insurers’ confidence in the regulatory body’s promise to deliver three rate hikes in 2018. The first hike announced at the meeting has put the current interest rate in the range of 1.50–1.75%. In fact, the Fed indicated that there can be a fourth rate raise this year and three more in 2019 (one more than the previously announced two hikes), hinting at an aggressive path of rate hikes.A progressive rate environment will ultimately benefit the insurance industry with regard to insurers’ investment income (forming a major portion of their revenues), thereby accelerating their overall growth in the future. For instance, life insurance companies will get a relief from the operating pressures, resulting from tight credit spreads that the low-rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time. Rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide the required relief to insurers to maintain decent margins.Better Underwriting Performance: An Ambitious Hope?Although the California mudslides and the northeast winter storms are likely to impact first-quarter 2018 results with Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) projecting a total catastrophe loss of $305 million after tax, the insurers are not expecting a huge impact on their underwriting results. Thus, the positivity surrounding a better underwriting performance remains intact, despite such massive inclement weather-oriented losses being incurred.In fact, per a report by Fitch Ratings, the insurance industry is expected to regain substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slower pace, after being badly hit by the unprecedented hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017. Moreover, combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to a break-even point.Capital strength displayed by the insurers will assist them to counter near-term volatility and the effects of adverse events.Other High Points for a Winning PerformanceThere are a few other factors poised to boost the insurance industry this year. The unemployment rate is projected at 3.8% in 2018 while the gross domestic product is likely to grow 2.7% (an increase from the earlier estimate of 2.5%). Both represent a bullish economic outlook, further picking pace in the recent months.This apart, a recovering housing market looks set to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written.Moreover, the tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is an attractive option for most corporates including insurers, as it will aid the companies’ bottom-line, boosting margins directly.A strong liquidity profile, attributable to continued capital inflow into the industry, will not only back the insurers to counter near-term volatility and impact of hostile occurrences but will also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Key PicksDespite a slew of headwinds posing a threat to insurers this year, tailwinds like rising interest rate environment, better underwriting results and steadily thriving economy will probably cushion the following stocks to raise the performance bar and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification.We have zeroed in on four stocks outperforming despite all odds. We expect these stocks to continue the bull run given positive estimate revisions, a favorable Zacks Rank and an impressive VGM Score of A or B.

160,CB,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has recently released its preliminary net loss estimates, which is likely to impact its first-quarter 2018 results. The loss estimates are attributable to natural catastrophes including the California mudslides, which occurred this early January.The property and casualty P&C insurer projects total catastrophe loss, stemming from the aforementioned cat events, at $380 million pretax or $305 million after tax. Losses resulting from the California mudslides are anticipated at $125 million pretax. This apart, the company has issued loss estimates pertaining to the northeast winter storms, which hit the East Coast on Jan 3 and Mar 1, 2018. Net loss from these storms is expected to be $115 million and $80 million, respectively, on a pre-tax basis.Further, other net losses related to natural catastrophes to date globally in the first quarter, are projected at $60 million pretax.It is important to mention here that these loss estimates are net of reinsurance including reinstatement premiums and are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities.Chubb’s status as a P&C insurer has significantly exposed it to loss from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other weather-oriented events, rendering volatility to its underwriting results. In fact, in 2017, the company’s underwriting income plummeted 58.7% from the tally of 2016.Also last year, the company incurred after-tax catastrophe loss of $2.2 billion, primarily due to the unprecedented hurricane activity as well as two successive earthquakes in Mexico and the California wildfires. As a result, the company’s combined ratio came under pressure, having deteriorated 600 basis points (bps) in 2017 compared with the level in 2016.However, we expect improving commercial property and casualty (P&C) pricing in the company’s numerous international businesses as well as premiums to lend it enough cushion for delivering overall desirable results.The company is set to release its first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the first quarter is pegged at $2.57 per share, improving 3.6% year over year. However, this estimate might change once the analysts start incorporating the catastrophe loss impact in the numbers.Further, Chubb has an Earnings ESP of -0.20% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Shares of the company have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has lost 1.2% versus the industry’s rally of 16.2%.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has moved 0.7% south while the same for 2019 has slipped 0.4% in the last 60 days. Calamities affecting underwriting results will possibly be a drag on the share price.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Radian Group (RDN  -  Free Report), CNO Financial Group (CNO  -  Free Report) and American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.        Radian Group offers mortgage and real-estate products and services in the United States. The company delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.9%.CNO Financial develops, markets and administers health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance products for senior and middle-income markets in the United States.

161,CB,"In a bid to share more profits with its shareholders, the board of directors of Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) recently announced a 3% hike in quarterly dividend to 73 cents per share. Shareholders of record as of Jun 22 will have the meatier dividend in their pockets on Jul 13, 2018.The annualized dividend of $2.92 per share translates into a yield of 2.2% based on the closing price of $134.45 on May 17, 2018. This is substantially above the industry average of 0.6%. Chubb Limited has an impressive track of raising dividends each year. In fact, the company has been paying dividends each quarter since it became a public company in 1993 and has doubled its quarterly dividend since 2010. The latest increase marked the 25th straight year of dividend hikes.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) property and casualty insurer has more than doubled its dividend since 2010, with its yield outperforming the industry average.Apart from a strong quarterly performance by the companies, lower tax incidence owing to  the new tax rate implementation, widened the scope for more capital deployment.Chubb also resorts to share buybacks. The company has a $1-billion buyback program under its authorization. The company boasts a strong capital position, helping it engage in such shareholder-friendly moves. The company’s total capital position now exceeds $66 billion.Shares of Chubb have lost 7.9% year to date, underperforming the industry’s decline of 0.3%. Nonetheless, organic initiatives to ramp up growth, prudent acquisitions and effective capital deployment will likely help the stock rebound. Dividend hikes and share repurchases seem a well-accepted strategy among insurers to instill investor confidence in their stock.

(CNO  -  Free Report) hiked its quarterly dividend by 11% while United Fire Group Inc.  increased  the same by 10.7%.Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock from the property and casualty industry is Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

162,CB,"On Thursday, Hurricane Irma continued its path of destruction through the Caribbean after hitting Barbuda, St. Barthélemy, St. Martin, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico yesterday.Many industries have felt the impact of Irma already, and the storm has yet to make landfall here in the United States.According to the National Weather Service, the storm is projected to hit the central Bahamas by Friday, and then make landfall near Miami, Florida by Sunday morning as a Category 4 hurricane, “bringing high winds, abundant rainfall and potentially dangerous storm surge.”From the greater travel industry to airlines and restaurants, companies that have broad exposure to Florida have seen their shares slide on anticipation of Irma’s impending arrival. For more information, read:Hurricane Irma Hammers Travel StocksAs Hurricane Irma Gets Stronger, Restaurant Stocks Get WeakerHurricane Irma Hits Airline StocksIrma, as well as the aftermath of Harvey, has also taken a toll on the insurance market, and this past Tuesday marked one of the worst days of 2017 for insurance stocks. Today is no better, and the S&P 500 Insurance Industry Index (IUX) is down over 2% in afternoon trading, on pace for what could be its worst daily performance since Brexit lows back in June 2016. The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE  -  Free Report) is down nearly 2.5%.Like other industries, insurance companies with a huge presence in Florida are being hit the hardest. HCI Group (HCI  -  Free Report), known for its largest subsidiary Homeowners Choice Property & Casualty Insurance Company, is down over 10% in afternoon trading.

(PGR  -  Free Report), and Travelers Companies (TRV  -  Free Report), all of which have seen their stocks move downwards today.Companies who offer reinsurance, or when multiple companies purchase insurance policies from other insurers to limit the total loss the original insurer would experience in case of a disaster, are also at risk. Everest Re (RE  -  Free Report) and RenaissanceRe (RNR  -  Free Report), for example, are down 6.76% and 3.6% today.Experts are already predicting that Irma could be the biggest ever in insured damage in the U.S., even surpassing the record held by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

163,CB,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest providers of property and casualty (P&C) insurance and reinsurance, lending specialized insurance products such as personal accident, supplemental health and life insurance to individuals.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer have gained 3.1% in a year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 15.8%. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current and next-year earnings being revised upward over the last 60 days. While 2018 estimates moved north by 1%, the consensus mark for 2019 was nudged up 1.4%. This upward estimate revision boosts analysts’ confidence in the stock.Chubb carries an impressive Growth Score of B.Let’s focus on some factors that make Chubb a lucrative stock for greater returns.Improving Top Line: The top line at Chubb soared by nearly 80% over the last five years owing to increased net premium earned and higher investment income. Factors like a compelling product suit, increased scale, efficiencies, strategic initiatives undertaken in the United States, Latin America and Asia should continue to drive growth for the stock.Increasing Investment Income: Investment income has been improving over the last couple of years. Courtesy of a rising interest rate environment, the Fed has recently hiked the rate to 1.75%, indicating two more raises in 2018 and three in 2019. We expect this trend to continue in the long run.  The company expects its quarterly investment income run rate in the range of $865-$875 million.Strategic Initiatives: To ramp up its growth profile, the company has been pursuing various strategic initiatives like focusing on middle-market businesses, both domestic and international, reviewing underwriting actions in portfolios that do not meet its risk appetite as well as generating lower net premium. The company is also shoring up its Australian presence and consolidating its Asian footprint too.Effective Capital Management: A strong capital position helped Chubb more than double its quarterly dividend since 2010. The company aims to achieve a 30% dividend payout ratio of its operating earnings. Also, it has a $1-billion worth share buyback authorization through 2018.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $10.75, representing a year-over-year climb of 33.9%.  For 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share stands at $11.27, translating to a year-over-year rise 4.8%.Chubb has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%.Underpriced: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio — the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next — shares are underpriced at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.25, falling below the industry average of 1.38.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked property and casualty insurance stocks are Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report), Everest Re Group, Ltd.

165,CB,"The untold damage and misery caused by Hurricane Harvey is not just being felt by the residents of Texas. Markets were also singed by the tropical cyclone on Monday, with energy and financials bearing the brunt of the pain. Stocks of energy companies suffered after key refineries in Texas had to close due to widespread flooding. But losses for insurers were possibly the most alarming, with the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF losing 1%.This was possibly a reaction to the enormous level of claims likely to be generated in the aftermath of this disaster. However, industry watchers think that the industry has the ability to absorb resulting losses and may even gain in the months ahead via higher rates. Adding select property and casualty insurers to your portfolio makes for a prudent option at this point.Insurers Possess Sufficient Capital Market watchers believe that insurers and reinsurers possess sufficient capital reserves to withstand the losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey. The damage generated by this Category 4 storm is yet to be correctly estimated. However, it is the fiercest hurricane to impact Texas since 2008. Even now, continuous rainfall is flooding the affected areas of the state. Current projections are that the hurricane may cost the U.S. nearly $30 billion.However, insurers serving individuals and businesses currently sport appreciably high levels of capital. Additionally, they do not require such funds to back existing obligations. Given such a state of affairs, Hurricane Harvey is unlikely to dent insurers’ financial position. At most, insurers with business concentrated in the storm-affected areas would experience a fall in quarterly earnings.Gains Likely in Months AheadIn 2005, insurers had suffered losses in the immediate fallout of Hurricane Katrina. Yet, over the next three months, industry heavyweights such as Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report), The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) and The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) notched up heavy gains. While Progressive and Allstate shares increased 20% and 10%, respectively, shares of Chubb skyrocketed over this period, gaining 27%.A similar scenario is likely to develop this time around as well. First, analysts think that the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program will have to bear the lion’s share of losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey. Second, insurers will once again be able to raise rates in the aftermath of a storm of such ferocity. Reinsurers will also likely benefit since over the medium term they will gain the ability to increase their insurance rates. In the aftermath of Katrina, the likes of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC  -  Free Report), which is an insurance broker, notched up gains in keeping with insurers.Our ChoicesDespite initial losses, insurers should withstand the impact of Hurricane Harvey without much difficulty. Appreciably high capital reserves provide them sufficient cushion for such an eventuality.Further, they could actually move higher in the months ahead as they begin to raise rates. Investing in property and casualty insurers looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

167,CB,"In a concerted effort to share more profits with shareholders, the board of directors of Horace Mann Educators Corporation (HMN  -  Free Report) has approved a 3.6% hike in its quarterly dividend. The company will now pay a quarterly dividend of 28.5 cents per share compared with 27.5 cents paid on Dec 29, 2017. Shareholders of record as of Mar 19 will now be rewarded with the meatier dividend in their pockets on Mar 30, 2018.Notably, the increased dividend denotes an annualized payout of $1.14 per share. Further, the company’s current dividend yield is 2.7%, which is slightly better than the industry average of 2.5%.Prior to this, in Mar 2017, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 3.8% to 27.5 cents per share. Historically, the company boasts a diligent increase in dividends with the metric having witnessed a six-year CAGR (2012-2018) of 14%.The recent dividend hike represents the company’s 10th consecutive yearly increase, thereby reflecting the Multi line insurer’s solid operational performance in 2017. Moreover, the company’s solid financial position provides enough support to participate in shareholder-friendly moves like dividend hikes and share buyback authorization. In fact, Horace Mann’s annualized 2017 shareholder dividend of $1.10 per share reflects a 4% rise from the same in 2016 with total dividends paid amounting to $46.1 million in the year.Banking on a robust capital position with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows, Horace Mann has been consistently making efforts in improving long-tern shareholder value and remains focused on sustained profitable growth.Apart from approving dividend hikes, the company has been authorizing share repurchase programs and has bought back shares worth $72.2 million since December 2011.Such steadfast endeavors instill confidence among investors and make it an attractive pick for yield seeking investors. We expect the company to indulge in such measures in the near term as well, which will continue to enhance the shareholder value.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementHorace Mann carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

168,CB,"The board of directors of FBL Financial Group Inc. (FFG  -  Free Report) has approved a special dividend, a quarterly raise and a share repurchase authorization. These effective capital deployment moves reflect the company’s concerted efforts to enhance shareholders’ value.With a 4.5% hike, the company will pay out a meaty dividend of 46 cents per share on Mar 29 to shareholders of record on Mar 15.

Notably, the insurer has been paying the same for the last four years. To that end, it deploys excess capital to make the special payout. At 2017-end, the company had about $40 million of excess capital.Concurrently, a $50-million share buyback program was also sanctioned by the company. However, the new program that remains open till Mar 31, 2022, will come into effect once the previous authorization expires on Mar 31, 2018.FBL Financial Group’s stable balance sheet position, cushioned with a solid substantial operational performance, will likely support its payout.

169,CB,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) has recently announced preliminary net catastrophe loss estimates for the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as its initial assessment of the recently revised tax cut.XL Group anticipates net catastrophe loss of about $45 million, stemming from the recent wildfires in Southern California and another $20 million from other weather-related events. These estimated losses will be evenly divided between the company’s Insurance and Reinsurance segments.The property and casualty (P&C) insurer has projected total pre-tax catastrophe loss, net of reinsurance, reinstatement and adjusted premiums plus redeemable non-controlling interest amounting to $315 million to noticeably impact the company’s fourth-quarter results. The abovementioned loss estimate comprises the previous projection of $250 million pertaining to the October 2017 Northern California wildfires and other cat events.These losses are expected to put a considerable dent in the company’s underwriting results, rendering volatility in the company’s earnings. Throughout the first nine months of 2017, the company suffered underwriting loss of $909.1 million, which compared unfavorably with the underwriting profit of $431.9 million. Moreover, the company’s combined ratio will take a hit on such losses. Combined ratio for the first nine months of 2017 came in at 111.6%, deteriorating 1770 bps from the same period in 2016.Among other P&C insurers that have released their respective fourth-quarter catastrophe loss estimates, Arch Capital Group Ltd.’s (ACGL  -  Free Report) projects pre-tax catastrophe loss comes in between $60 million and $75 million while RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur a catastrophe loss of $90 million from the California wildfires. This apart, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss of about $320 million ($249 million after-tax), stemming from natural catastrophes including California wildfires.Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective from January 2018 onward, the corporate tax rate was slashed to 21% from the pre-existent 35%. As a result, the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) P&C insurer will incur a charge of $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to revaluation of its net Deferred Tax Asset. It is important to note here that the charge will not have a material impact on the company’s fourth-quarter operating net income.Shares of XL Group have lost 10.8% since the onset of the fourth quarter of 2017 against the industry’s increase of 6.8%. However, we expect the company’s focus on its insurance and reinsurance business lines, resulting in the best return on capital over pricing cycle along with a solid capital position to turn the stock around in the near term.  XL Group is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 7.  However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because it carries a bearish Zacks Rank of 5, which lowers the predictive power of ESP and also has an Earnings ESP of 12.26%, which leaves the combination inconclusive.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

170,CB,"With a slew of events and weather-related occurrences making waves in the insurance industry, it will be interesting to see how the industry will fare in the fourth and final quarter of 2017. Starting from massive catastrophe loss to a gradual rise in interest rates along with an improving employment scenario and other economic conditions, the insurance industry has seen it all. Amid such changing conditions, the industry still managed to hold its own and we expect it to do the same in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Below we will discuss the various scenarios that have influenced the Property and Casualty Insurance industry in particular to a great extent.Facing the Storm: Catastrophe LossesThe property and casualty insurers faced the biggest brunt of a massive catastrophe loss, having largely impacted the industry and qualifying the year as the costliest in terms of incurring weather-related loss. Notably, per Swiss Re, the total economic losses from natural and man-made disasters in 2017 are projected to be $306 billion.Further adding to the woes without respite, the fourth quarter also witnessed the Northern California wildfires resulting in catastrophe losses, posing a threat to dent the P&C insurers’ underwriting profitability. Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimated preliminary loss for the fourth quarter attributable to natural calamities of about $249 million after tax largely stemming from the Californian wildfires.In view of such losses, the insurers will experience weak underwriting results, disrupting the overall performance. But there is a silver lining in this catastrophe cloud, as the insurers braved price hikes, which remained flat in the past several quarters due to a not so active catastrophe environment. Nevertheless, there are a few insurers with an encouraging track record of weathering such setbacks and emerging winners on the back of their core fundamental strengths.Gradual Improvement in the Interest RatesThe steady increase in interest rates has benefited the insurance industry. The Federal Reserve delivered in its promise to raise the rates thrice in 2017 by announcing the third and the final interest rate hike at its last FOMC meeting held on Dec 13. The interest rate now ranges between 1.25% and 1.50%.  A progressing rate environment has lessened the pressure on the insurers’ investment income, boosting their earnings in process. Moreover, a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive, further supporting carriers to grow. It is important to note here that investment income constitutes a major component of insurer’s top line.Other Factors Influencing the IndustryWith cyber attacks on the rise, the P&C insurance industry has seen improvement in cyber security insurance, which has led to noticeable premium growth. This apart, advancement in technology has enabled insurers to enhance operational efficiency, starting from underwriting and policy administration to claims and risk management.Additionally, there are a few other factors impacting the industry performance during this time period. To that end, low inflation has remained at 1.7%, falling shy of the 2% target, which is considered good for the economy. Moreover, a reviving housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written. Plus, an improving employment scenario and a positive consumer sentiment buoy optimism.Price PerformanceDespite all odds, the industry has scored better than the S&P 500 index in the fourth quarter, riding on core strength. While the industry has gained 6.7%, the elite index has risen 6.4%. Industry RankThe P&C Insurance industry is currently ranked at #92, falling within the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) of the Zacks Industry Rank.Outperformers of Q4Despite adversities spurting concerns for insurers this year, positives like a rising interest rate environment and an improving economy have helped the following stocks perform well in the fourth quarter and yield profits through core strength and business modification.Here is a list of four top-ranked insurers that outperformed the industry in the last quarter. These stocks hold promise to deliver favorable results, banking on operational strength. Also, an impressive Value Score of A or B combined with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) makes these stocks worth investment bets. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Northbrook, IL-based The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) deals in property-liability insurance and life insurance business in the United States and Canada. Shares of Allstate Corporation have rallied 13.9% in the fourth quarter, outperforming the industry’s increase of 6.7%. The company has a Value Score of A. Shares of Santa Ana, CA-based financial service provider First American Financial Corp. (FAF  -  Free Report), have gained 12.2% in the fourth quarter, outpacing the industry’s rise. The company has a Value Score of A. Mayfiled Village, OH-based The Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report) provides personal and commercial property-casualty insurance, and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services primarily in the United States. Shares of Progressive have climbed 16.3% in the fourth quarter, ahead of the industry’s increase. The company has a Value Score of B. Greenwich, CT-based W.R. Berkley Corp.

171,CB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Chubb has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Chubb’s current PE ratio noticeably above its midpoint (which is 11.6) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 29.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Chubb has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 20.5, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.    P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Chubb has a P/S ratio of about 2.1. This is somewhat lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Chubb currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CB a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Chubb is just 12.1, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2.6. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 9.6, which is much better than the industry average of 15.2. Clearly, CB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Chubb might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F. This gives CB a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 14.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined 3.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:D/B/A Chubb Limited New Price and Consensus  D/B/A Chubb Limited New Price and Consensus | D/B/A Chubb Limited New QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineChubb is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 29% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other. He believes in its short-term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019. Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report.Download it free >>

172,CB,"Residents of southeastern Texas are bracing for the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which continues to wreak havoc on America’s fourth-largest city with heavy rainfall. The record-flood situation is likely to turn worse as the deluge is expected to continue for some days, as per Bloomberg. It is predicted to become the first storm of Category 3 or higher to hit Texas in the last 12 years.Needless to say, a catastrophe of this level is most likely to mess up citizens’ lives. With them, several effects on corporate life are likely to be noted.Energy As per Reuters, Harvey has thumped a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and over 10% of U.S. refining capacity. The area is a major hub for oil refineries. Several energy companies have shut down their operations. The last major storm that lashed this region in 2008 was Hurricane Ike, which cost the refining industry roughly $30 billion.This sparked off concerns about oversupply situation in the U.S. Lower demand from refineries is likely to pressure crude oil prices and ETFs like United States Oil Fund LP (USO  -  Free Report). Oil exploration ETF like The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report) this may lose ahead due to lack of activity.However, demand for finished product gasoline should rise. Gasoline futures on Monday jumped to a two-year high level, which should benefit United States Gasoline Fund (UGA  -  Free Report).  The difference in the price of crude oil for October delivery and Nymex gasoline futures for September — the ""crack spread"" — doubled to about $24 on Friday, as per an article published on CNBC. This should benefit VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK  -  Free Report) (read: 4 Sector ETFs Winning on Revenue Growth).Insurance Severe destruction is likely after Harvey’s passage as flooding in Texas may be identical to that of 2005's Hurricane Katrina -- “the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, said an insurance research group.” Insurance stocks normally fall over 1% in the month following the disaster caused by a Category 3 storm and severe flooding.John Dickson, president of NFS Edge Insurance Agency, estimates about 15% of the Houston area to be insured for flood. As a result, property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Insurance companies like Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report), The Allstate Corporation ALL, Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp. PGR are likely to be hurt. The insurance ETF iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Fund (IAK  -  Free Report) will feel the brunt (see all Financials ETFs here).Agriculture As per Bloomberg,the rain is washing away the largest U.S. cotton producer, drenching extra supplies stored on fields by many Texas farmers. Ports like Galveston will remain closed till Harvey dies out.The Bloomberg article went on to point out that ports at the Texas Gulf make up about 24% of U.S. wheat exports, 3% of corn shipments and 2% of soybeans. Naturally, this pseudo supply crisis will likely push up crop prices, benefiting ETFs like iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN, Teucrium Wheat Fund (WEAT  -  Free Report), Teucrium Corn ETF (CORN  -  Free Report) and Teucrium Soybean ETF (SOYB  -  Free Report). In fact, in such a heavy downpour, livestock is also at risk, which may push up iPath Pure Beta Livestock ETN LSTK (read: Should You Ride the Momentum in Grain ETFs?).Transportation Rail transportation near Houston has been delayed and massive gridlock on highways is expected. As many as 1,847 flights were canceled on Sunday at airports in Houston, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas, and an additional 1,580 were called off for Monday, according to FlightAware and quoted on Bloomberg. Naturally, transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) may feel the pressure ahead (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

173,CB,"The insurance industry has been shaping up well this reporting cycle with robust earnings from leading players.

175,CB,"Assured Guaranty Ltd.  announced that its subsidiary Assured Guaranty US Holdings Inc. has acquired a minority interest in Cadia (Malta) Limited. The acquisition is in sync with the company’s strategy to invest in alternative investments.Cadia (Malta) Limited is the holding company of Rubicon Infrastructure Advisors (Rubicon), an investment banking firm in the global infrastructure sector. The acquirer has invested in Rubicon to back its global expansion.Assured Guaranty is focusing to diversify its revenue stream. The company is strategically choosing to pump its resources into various businesses other than its core financial guaranty business with similar risk profiles but yielding superior returns.  This in turn is likely to help lower the company’s excess capital. Last year, the company purchased a limited partnership in a fund. Assured Guaranty also acquired a minority stake in investment advisory, Wasmer, Schroeder & Company.In a separate development, last week, the board of directors of Assured Guaranty approved a 12% increase in dividend to 16 cents per share in its endeavor to enhance shareholders’ value. The company has an impressive track record of paying quarterly dividends and raising the same for seven straight years. The company has grown its dividend by nearly 256% from 4.50 cents paid in November 2011. Notably, the company has tripled its quarterly payout since it went public in 2004.Shareholders of record as of Mar 7, 2018 will receive the hiked dividend on Mar 21. The annualized dividend of 64 cents yields 1.8%, based on the closing price of $34.68 as of Feb 27.Recently, the board of Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) announced its intention to propose a 2.8% increase in annual dividend while Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company’s (WLTW  -  Free Report) board members have hiked the company’s quarterly dividend by 13%.

The annualized dividend of $2.40 yields 1.5%, based on the closing price of $161.21 as of Feb 26. Shareholders are expected to fill in their pockets with this meatier dividend come Apr 16.    Willis Towers has been increasing its dividend since Willis Group and Towers Watson merged to form Willis Towers Watson in 2016. The company has ever since raised dividend by 25% over a couple of years. This should further help maintain its target dividend payout ratio of the same percentage.Apart from dividend raises, Willis Towers engages in share buybacks to lower the share count and boost its bottom line. The board members hence authorized an extra $400-million repurchase to its $1.2-billion buyback program of 2016 with $600 million remaining for repurchase. Shares will be bought back through the current and next year.Willis Towers repurchased shares worth $710 million in 2017 and expects to buy back in the range of $600-$800 million in 2018.The insurance broker’s consistent endeavors to improve shareholders’ value make it an attractive stock pick for yield-seeking investors.A sturdy financial position, backed by continued solid operational performance by core operations, enables the company to generate enough capital.

The company estimates a free cash-flow generation between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2018.Shares of Willis Towers have rallied 27.3%, outperforming the industry’s 21.6% gain. Strategic attempts to add to shareholders’ value will not only make this stock an attractive pick for investors but also drive its shares higher.Willis Towers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).    Dividend hikes and share repurchases seem a well-accepted approach among insurers to solidify investor confidence in their stock.

177,CB,"The second-quarter earnings season is gathering pace with 19% members of the S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for 97 index members (accounting for 28.1% of index’s total market capitalization) that have reported financial numbers, have increased 8.4% on 5.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 78.4% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 72.2% outperforming top-line estimates.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance so far. 53.3% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index that have revealed quarterly results shows 7.2% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 81.1% for the bottom line and 66.7% for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which will weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Few insurers have estimated to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events occurred during April and May in the U.S.Horace Mann Educators Corp. (HMN  -  Free Report) estimated between $31 million and $34 million, hurting the bottom line by 49–53 cents. While Donegal Group Inc. (DGICA  -  Free Report) estimates a catastrophe loss of about $20.1 million and sees loss between 7 and 9 cents per share.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion that has built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting their confidence in the improving economic conditions. The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters. An improving rate environment not only aided an increase in Net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Also, improving economy means more disposable income and better consumer sentiment. This in turn, is likely to have supported more policy writings, driving premiums higher, which contribute a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been easing pricing, leading to soft pricing.  Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were the once mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have benefited insurers.This week will see more than 800 companies reporting their quarterly results, including 183 S&P 500 members.Let’s find out how these four insurers might perform when they release their quarterly numbers on the above announced date.Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest providers of property and casualty (P&C) insurance and reinsurance. In the last reported quarter, Loews beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.64%. The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +0.80% complicate the surprise prediction. The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.51 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.49. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. However, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5), that should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Chubb is expected to have witnessed an improved top line, courtesy its strategic buyouts and organic endeavors. Premiums have increased on diversified product mix. Given gradually improving rate environment, Chubb expects its quarterly investment income run rate to remain in the range of $830–$840 million. However, escalating expenses might weigh on margin expansion while exposure to catastrophe loss likely has induced volatility on underwriting results.

183,CB,"The first-quarter earnings season has already seen 154 members of the elite S&P 500 index reporting financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25.4% increase in total earnings on 10.3% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and a 72.1%, outperforming on the top-line front. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings growth in the first quarter is registered as the strongest in seven years.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a sturdy performance till now with earnings increasing 27.5% on 8.7% robust revenues. The beat ratio is solid with 80.5% companies exceeding bottom-line estimates and 61% outpacing the top-line mark. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 27% on 5.8% more revenues.Integral to the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, a favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have boosted higher net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line. Though the same is far from reaching a historical high, yet it is showing an upward trend. With economic growth gaining traction, the Fed has hiked rate five times since December 2015 and has hinted at two more raises this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to weather the low rate environment, they stand to benefit from the increasing rates as investment yield improves.The first quarter is likely to benefit from the tax cut.  Per the implementation of the new tax rate effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. This rate reduction will probably provide an additional drive to insurers’ bottom line.Although the first quarter witnessed a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the calamities still might not dent the company’s underwriting profitability. Insurers having already suffered the severities of cat loss last year, should have managed to withstand the shortfalls in the first quarter of 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion.Nonetheless, underwriting profitability is mildly strained. Recently, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) reported a drag of 64 cents on its bottom line attributable to cat loss.Improved pricing, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning as well as resorting to reinsurance covers are expected to have helped insurers weather the deficits.Diverse product portfolio, expanded geographies and strategic acquisitions might have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Apr 30.Loews Corporation’s (L  -  Free Report) quarterly result is likely to be aided by a consistently better performance at CNA Financial, a Lowes subsidiary. Loews Hotels is likely to have continued to deliver a strong performance, banking on solid operations at its hotel properties. Boardwalk Pipeline is expected to have delivered better numbers on the strength of its growth projects.  However, lower day rate and lower rigs working are expected to have weighed on Diamond Offshore (DO) segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 10.3% year-over-year decline. Loews carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Nonetheless, combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes our surprise prediction difficult as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Loews Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Loews Corporation Quote (Read more: Can Solid CNA Financial Results Drive Loews Q1 Earnings?)You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) is likely to have witnessed higher premiums on new business growth as well as a solid retention.

184,CB,"First-quarter earnings season has already witnessed 130 elite S&P 500 index members having reported quarterly results so far.Let’s see, how the quarter pans out for the life and non-life or the property and casualty (P&C) insurance space.The insurance industry is likely to deliver solid earnings in the first quarter, riding on the strength of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.An Improving Rate EnvironmentReflecting economic stability, the Fed has hiked interest rate for the sixth time since December 2015, the recent being in March this year. The rate environment has improved to 1.75% from the near zero level.The first quarter thus continues to enjoy the positive impact of a favorable rate environment, driving the insurer’s investment results and the performance of life insurers.Although insurers have lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to weather the low rate environment, they stand to benefit from the increasing rates as investment yield improves.A Benign Catastrophe EnvironmentThough the first quarter encountered the California mudslide and the northeast winter storms, the insurers escaped a severe magnitude of catastrophe loss. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between $5 billion and $10 billion.Insurers having already suffered the extremities of cat loss last year could manage to brave its first-quarter damages as well. Nonetheless, first-quarter earnings are burdened by catastrophe loss. Underwriting profitability is affected, albeit to a lesser degree. Recently, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) reported a drag of 64 cents on its bottom line attributable to cat loss.Prudent underwriting standards and cost control measures will likely support profitability.Impact of Tax ReformsThe new tax rate has been implemented effective first-quarter 2018. The overhaul of the tax system slashed the tax rate to 21% from 35%. A lower tax incidence is expected to boost net income, the bottom line as well as the scope for more capital deployment.Progressing Economy: A TailwindAlso, a progressing economy reflects a better employment scenario and the GDP translating into a more disposable income plus a better consumer sentiment.Growth in job opportunities has been solid through the first three months of 2018 with an average of nearly 0.202 million, above the year-ago tally of 0.182 million.  This, in turn, might have supported more policy writings, thus driving the premiums higher. Premiums contribute a lion’s share to an insurer’s top line.Other FactorsDiverse product offerings, portfolio repositioning, geographic expansion, cost-curbing efforts, share repurchases and strategic integrations should have propelled better performances.Ways to Pick the Perfect Insurance StocksWith tailwinds rallying around the industry, investors can comfortably bet on stocks, poised to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the upcoming reports.  Choosing the right stock for one’s portfolio from too many participants is certainly a tough task for investors. But an easy way to shorten the list is by selecting stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which help surpassing the estimates.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks with the best chances of delivering an earnings beat in the next announcement.

189,CB,"Estimates for Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) have been revised upward over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 1.7% and 0.8% to $10.42 and $11.21, respectively.Chubb is one of the world’s largest providers of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, providing specialized insurance products such as personal accident, supplemental health and life insurance. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) property and casualty insurer have lost 6.8% in a year against the industry’s 12.5% rally. Let’s focus on the factors that make Chubb a stock to hold on to for greater returns.Growth Initiatives: Chubb has been identifying and investing in various strategic initiatives that paved the way for its long-term growth. Chubb has grown to become a leader in cyber risk assessment and underwriting. To capitalize on cyber insurance, which currently has immense room for growth, the company introduced Chubb Cyber Index, an enhanced interactive platform. The company has been consolidating its Asian presence as well as shored up Australian base.Improving Top Line: The top line at Chubb soared by nearly 80% over the last five years, driven by increased net premium earned and higher investment income. A compelling product portfolio, heightened scale, efficiencies plus strategic initiatives undertaken in the United States, Latin America and Asia should continue to drive premiums and in turn, revenues for the company.Increasing Investment Income: Investment income has been improving over the last couple of years, courtesy of a rising interest rate environment. With the Fed’s intention of two more rate raises in 2018 and some more in the near future on the back of a strengthening economy, the company expects its quarterly investment income run rate in the $885-$885 million range. This in turn should aid its top-line growth.Effective Capital Management: Chubb boasts a healthy balance sheet with solid cash position and an improving debt-to-capital ratio. A low reliance on debt provides adequate financial flexibility to the company. This in turn bolstered the company to double its quarterly dividend since 2010. The latest increase marks the 25th straight year of payout hikes. The company’s dividend yield of 2.2% betters the industry average of 0.6%, making the stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.Chubb also has a $1-billion worth share buyback program under its authorization.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $10.42, representing a year-over-year increase of 29.76%. For 2019, the consensus mark for the bottom line stands at $11.21, up 7.65% year over year.Chubb has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: The company flaunts a stellar earnings surprise history, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last several quarters. This outperformance in turn underscores the company’s operational excellence. The average four-quarter positive earnings surprise is 23.02%.Underpriced: Shares of the company are trading lower than the industry average. Considering the company’s price-to-book ratio, the trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.21 falls below the industry average of 1.42.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report), Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) and RLI Corp.

191,CB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Chubb has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.09. This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.50.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts Chubb’s current PE among its highs over the observed period. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance – Property and Casualty industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.31. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Chubb has a P/S ratio of about 2.14. This is higher than the Zacks categorized Insurance – Property and Casualty industry average, which comes in at 1.74 right now.CB is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Chubb’s P/CF ratio of 9.70 is much lower than the Zacks classified Insurance – Property and Casualty industry average of 13.04, which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect.PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important, it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well. One can easily do that with the PEG ratio (ratio of the P/E to the expected future earnings growth rate).The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P/E ratio.Chubb’s PEG ratio stands at just 1.41, compared with the Zacks Insurance – Property and Casualty industry average of 3.41. This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Chubb currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Chubb an apt choice for value investors, and all of the listed metrics make it pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Chubb might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘C’ and a Momentum score of ‘F’. This gives CB a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘C’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending downwards lately. The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to two higher, while the full year estimate has seen four downward revisions and two upward revisions in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:D/B/A Chubb Limited New Price and Consensus D/B/A Chubb Limited New Price and Consensus | D/B/A Chubb Limited New QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and why we fear that the company might disappoint in the near term.Bottom LineChubb is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the Bottom 11% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #4, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall.In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Insurance – Property and Casualty industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

192,CB,"The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 18. Last quarter, this company delivered a 1.47% negative earnings surprise. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing this Past QuarterProgressive’s top line is expected to have benefited from improved premiums as well as the investment income in its second quarter.The company’s diversified product portfolio, coupled with a competitive pricing, has probably aided a solid retention ratio.Policies in force across Personal and Commercial Lines are expected to have remained healthy in the quarter to be reported.However, overall expenses are estimated to have increased due to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses, rise in policy acquisition costs and escalating other underwriting expenses.With respect to an earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters, but with an average negative surprise of 4.95%.  The company’s share price has been trending up over the last few days and is currently trading at $45.58. We wait to see how the stock performs, post the earnings release.Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Progressive Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Progressive is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP as well as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Progressive has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 60 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Progressive has a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.Importantly, the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the P&C insurance space with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter are:Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) is set to report its second-quarter earnings on Jul 24. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The company is slated to post its second-quarter earnings on Jul 25.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

193,CB,"The board of directors of W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) recently approved a 7.1% increase in dividends as well as a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share, banking on a solid capital position.The company will now pay a dividend of 60 cents per share annually or 15 cents quarterly, yielding 0.8% based on the closing price of $76.47 as of May 31, 2018.

The company’s dividend has grown 50% over the last five years. Its payout ratio of 33.2 betters the industry average of about 18.With respect to special dividend, the recent one marks the seventh approval since 2012. Shareholders of record on Jun 11 should be rewarded with the meatier dividend on Jun 18, 2018.W.R. Berkley’s engagement in shareholder-friendly moves is well-supported by its firm capital position, driven by operational efficiency. This property and casualty insurer maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows.We expect such effective capital deployment to sustain in the long run as the company continues to benefit from a growing contribution by new startup units, well-poised international business, rate increases and a reserving discipline driving solid cash flow generation. The overhaul of tax rate should also lend additional support.W.R. Berkley carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Year to date, shares of the company have gained 6.9%, outperforming the industry’s decrease of 1.4%. Its operational excellence aiding effective capital deployment should help continue the stock's bull run.  Dividend hikes and share repurchases seem a well-accepted strategy to solidify investor confidence in the stock. In fact, post the tax rate revamp, tax incidence of the companies has been lowered, driving earnings and widening scope for more capital deployment.

194,CB,"After providing loss estimates from the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has come up with loss estimates due to Hurricane Maria and two Mexican earthquakes. The insurer projects $220 million pre-tax or $200 million post-tax losses from Maria.These losses are net of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums. Pre-tax losses of $152 million or $135 million after-tax will drag Chubb’s commercial and personal property as well as casualty insurance operations. Reinsurance businesses will be hurt by $53 million loss. Despite the deficit, the estimated reinstatement premiums are pegged at an extra $15 million pre-tax.With respect to Mexican earthquakes that struck in September, the company expects to incur insured losses of $25 million pre-tax or $24 million post-tax, plus net of reinsurance and inclusion of reinstatement premiums.Chubb also anticipates to have incurred a catastrophe loss of about $107 million pre-tax or $86 million after-tax from all other damages for which, it had not yet provided any estimates.Recently, Chubb has calculated losses amounting to $650 million pre-tax or $520 million post- tax from Harvey, while the same from Irma is expected to be between $800 million and $950 million pre-tax or $640 million and $760 million after-tax. Per Moody’s Analytics, economic losses from Irma are estimated at $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion.Being an insurer, Chubb could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results. Despite catastrophe losses, expense efficiencies from the merger and impressive combined ratios helped Chubb generate strong underwriting profitability through the last two reported quarters.Shares of Chubb have lost 1.9% in the third quarter, underperforming the industry’s increase of 5.9%. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised downward 21.7% while the same for 2018 has slid 0.4% in the last 30 days. Calamities affecting underwriting results will possibly be an overhang on the share price. Chubb carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here..Insurers are hit hard by a number of natural disasters in the third quarter. This will be a drag on underwriting profitability. Due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment, insurers could strengthen reserves, though pricing was hurt.Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) counts pre-tax catastrophe loss from Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) projects loss between $100 million and $300 million from Irma. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

195,CB,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has evaluated pre-tax catastrophe loss stemming from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as earthquakes in Mexico. Loss from Harvey is projected to be $650 million pre-tax or $520 million after tax. Loss from Irma is anticipated to be between $800 million and $950 million pre-tax or $640 million and $760 million after tax.These losses are net of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums and are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the third quarter is currently pegged at 46 cents per share, plummeting 84.1% year over year. We expect this estimate to move further south as analysts incorporate the catastrophe loss impact.Being a property and casualty insurer, Chubb could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results. Through the first half of 2017, the company incurred $316 million in catastrophe losses.

200,CB,"AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (AFSI  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates emanating from inclement weather events in third-quarter 2017. The company projects catastrophe loss between $40 million and $65 million.The losses stemmed from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Mexico tremors and were attributable to contracts bound by AmTrust at Lloyd’s. The company at Lloyd’s is entitled to a multi-event catastrophe coverage for losses in excess of $10 million per event.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 30 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year slump of 58.9%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.To compensate the loss effect, AmTrust Financial maintains comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance coverage. As of Jul 1, it had coverage for losses in excess of $20 million with per event limit of $830 million. Again in August, the company had signed a new quota share reinsurance contract to lower exposure to catastrophe losses.Being a property and casualty insurer, AmTrust Financial cannot escape the disasters caused by natural calamities. The last reported quarter too has largely suffered due to such a loss. Combined ratio deteriorated 990 basis points.

201,CB,"The first-quarter earnings season is in its first leg with 87 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate 25% increase in  total earnings  on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 82.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 67.8% outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a sturdy performance till now with earnings growing 27.8% on 9.1% stronger revenues. The beat ratio is solid with 89.7% companies exceeding bottom-line estimates and 51.7% outpacing the top-line mark. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 27% on 5.4% more revenues.Integral to the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.Although the first quarter witnessed a California mudslide as well as northeast winter storms, the calamities still might not heavily weigh on the company’s underwriting profitability. Insurers having already suffered the severities of cat loss last year, should have managed to withstand the first-quarter shortfalls. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates first-quarter global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion.Improved pricing, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning as well as resorting to reinsurance covers are expected to have helped insurers survive the deficits.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have boosted higher net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line. Though the same is far from reaching a historical high, yet it is showing an upward trend. With economic growth gaining traction, the Fed has hiked rate five times since December 2015 and has hinted two more raises this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.The first quarter is likely to benefit from the tax cut.  Per the implementation of the new tax rate effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. This rate reduction will probably provide an additional boost to insurers’ bottom line.Apart from the above-mentioned tailwinds, diverse product offerings, a wide geographic footprint and strategic consolidations are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.With 682 companies (178 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand ahead of their quarterly releases on Apr 24.Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has projected catastrophe loss at nearly $125 million while loss from northeast winter storms is estimated at $195 million for the first quarter.Premiums  have probably increased on an improved commercial property and casualty pricing across numerous business lines as well as a compelling product portfolio. Higher net investment income is expected to have cushioned the company’s top line. Chubb expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $845 million and $855 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.24 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 9.7% year-over-year decline. Chubb carries a bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Further, combined with an Earnings ESP of -0.17%, makes surprise prediction unlikely as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.(Read more: Can Catastrophe Loss Mar Chubb's Q1 Earnings Prospects?)Chubb Limited Price and EPS Surprise Chubb Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Chubb Limited Quote You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Travelers Companies, Inc.’s (TRV  -  Free Report) premiums are predicted to increase on the back of higher retentions and renewals, improving pricing environment, rise in new business as well as an expansive product portfolio. Pricing and underwriting actions implemented are forecast to consistently drive results in auto business.Given a not-so-active catastrophe environment and prudent underwriting practices, underwriting profitability has possibly improved. A lower tax rate provided an additional impetus to the bottom line. Nonetheless, a higher debt-level due to an increase in interest expenses constrain the margin expansion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.68 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 24.1% year over year.  Though Travelers has a favorable Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -1.21% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

202,CB,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 37.23%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Chubb’s first quarter underwriting results will be affected by the California mudslides (which occurred in early January). Chubb has projected catastrophe loss from the same at nearly $125 million after tax while the total catastrophe loss is estimated at $305 million after tax. This apart, the company has issued loss estimates pertaining to the northeast winter storms, which hit the East Coast first on Jan 3 and later on Mar 1, 2018. Net loss from these storms is anticipated to be $115 million and $80 million, respectively, on a pre-tax basis.Further, other net losses related to natural catastrophes to date globally in the first quarter, are projected at $60 million pretax.It is important to mention here that such loss is attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s combined ratio is pegged at 89%, a deterioration of 100 basis points from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.24, reflecting a 9.7% year-over-year decrease.Additionally, the company might have incurred increased expenses, mainly due to higher loss and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, administrative expenses as well as policy benefits. This in turn will possibly weigh on the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, higher net investment income is expected to have cushioned the company’s top line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $780 million, representing a rise of 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. This is mainly owing to the improved interest rates as well as better-than-expected private equity distributions. Also, the company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $845 million and $855 million.Moreover, the company is likely to report increased premiums in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, driven by an improved commercial property and casualty (P&C) pricing across its numerous business lines as well as a compelling product portfolio.Strategic buyouts are expected to have contributed to this probable increase in premiums.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Chubb has an Earnings ESP of -0.17%.

203,CB,"Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (SIGI  -  Free Report) has announced catastrophe loss estimates of about $26 million, emanating from winter storm that impacted the east coast of the United States in early January 2018 and the Nor'easters in March.This apart, the company also estimated non-catastrophe insured property loss of $28 million from early January deep freeze in the company's footprint states and a relatively large number of severe fire loss.  Selective Insurance noted that the company’s total loss exceeded its expectation by about $33 million, dragging the bottom line by 44 cents.Property and casualty insurer Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has issued cat loss estimates of $305 million from California mudslides and northeast winter storms.However, pre-tax net favorable prior-year casualty reserve development of $8 million and 3.2% higher standard commercial lines pure renewal pricing will limit the downside for Selective Insurance Group to some extent. The company expects the bottom line to be boosted by 11 cents owing to favorable prior year casualty reserve development.The company is set to release first-quarter earnings results on May 2. Our proven model does not shows that the stock is likely to beat estimates this quarter, This is because  an unfavorable Zacks Rank #4 (Hold) combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise positive prediction difficult. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of 2018 is pegged at 45 cents, reflecting 47.7% year-over-year decrease.Being a property and casualty insurer, Selective Insurance has been prone to suffering losses due to catastrophe events.

The company estimates combined ratio for 2018 to hover around 95% with catastrophe loss impact of about 350 basis points.Nonetheless, the insurer remains focused on achieving a standard Commercial Lines written renewal pure price increase, improving renewal underwriting quality while maintaining strong and stable retention and undertaking underwriting actions in Excess and Surplus Lines segment to improve profitability.The company believes that these initiatives coupled with lower tax incidence strongly place the company for long-term growth.

204,CB,"RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $625 million (net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums) in the third quarter.The loss will emanate mainly from hurricanes Harvey ($225 million) and Irma ($175 million). The Mexico earthquake and hurricane Maria, together, will cause $225 million of losses.   The loss is expected to weigh on the company’s combined ratio. The company incurred 14% year-over-year higher claim expenses of $0.34 million in the first half of 2017. The recent cat loss will further amplify claim loss, draining margins.A meaningful portion of reinsurance and insurance written by the company provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes. So its results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, and the coverages offered.The company continues to suffer from soft pricing in the reinsurance market, which has been continuing for the last seven years now. Year to date, the stock has gained a mere 1.2%, vastly underperforming the industry which recorded growth of 11.4%.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation was seen in parts of the United States which was ravaged by a trio of hurricanes one after another.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in regions across the Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner had the country heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed as a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion, as per Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry-insured losses for Hurricane Maria in the Caribbean between $ 40 billion and $85 billion.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax. Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimates $200 million post-tax cat losses from Maria, $24 million from Mexican earthquakes, $520 million from Harvey and between $640 million and $760 million from Irma.On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning around the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price hardening in certain lines of business that have been affected  the most.RenaissanceRe carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

205,CB,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions over the last 60 days. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 40.7% downward and for 2018, moved 0.5% south.  Shares of Chubb have gained 17.5% in a year, lagging the industry’s growth of 24.6%.The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an unimpressive Growth Score of F. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks.The underwriting profitability of non-life insurers in the third quarter will be hampered by a strings of catastrophes — Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and two Mexican earthquakes. Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the estimate for insured losses from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. The Mexican tremors will cost the insurance industry billions, per the same catastrophe risk modeler.Chubb being a property and casualty insurer will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events. Chubb estimates $520 million post-tax cat loss from Harvey, between $640 million and $760 million from Irma and $200 million from Maria. With respect to Mexican tremors that struck in September, the company expects to incur insured losses of $24 million.Chubb also anticipates to have incurred a catastrophe loss of about $86 million from all other damages which the company is yet to provide any estimates for. Through the first half of 2017, the company shelled out $316 million in catastrophe losses.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at a loss of 30 cents per share, representing a year-over-year decline of 110.5%. Revenues for the quarter are also estimated to decrease 3.9%.Chubb has also been witnessing increasing expenses, weighing on operating income expansion and thus inducing volatility to the bottom line. Operating return-on-equity, a measure of profitability, has also been declining over the last four years.Notably, no hike was made in interest rate in the last Fed meeting held in September. This information did not come as a surprise though. Inflation rate is expected to remain at 1.6% — falling short of the 2% target that the Fed had benchmarked. Neverthetheless, Chubb expects quarterly investment income run rate to remain in the range of $830-$840 million.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to weather the loss to some extent.Also, capital influx, conservative underwriting, an improving rate environment must pave the way for growth prospects.Choosing the StocksThere are other attractive stocks in non-life space that may not be as big a name as Chubb but promise greater returns.We have boiled down to three favorable stocks with potential to enhance one’s portfolio.

206,CB,"American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates stemming from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria and two Mexican tremors. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $105 million or 95 cents per share post-tax.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $1.62 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.3%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.To offset the loss effect, American Financial maintains comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance coverage. It includes $15 million per occurrence net retention for property and casualty operations. Additionally, it maintains supplemental fully collateralized reinsurance coverage up to 95% of $200 million for catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million of traditional catastrophe reinsurance via a catastrophe bond.Being a property and casualty insurer, American Financial will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events. The company’s earnings have traditionally been affected by inclement weather conditions. Even drought, which does not otherwise qualify as a calamity, had impacted the company’s earnings.Irrespective of catastrophe mitigation techniques deployed by the company, exposure to weather-related calamities makes its earnings volatile.

207,CB,"The curtain has already been raised for the second quarter earnings season with banks started reporting their quarterly results. The insurance industry is all set to announce its results shortly.  Underwriting results, the major indicator of profitability of any insurer, is likely to be affected. This is due to 16 severe wind and hail catastrophe events which occurred in April and May. The catastrophe losses not only have deteriorated the combined ratio but have also been a drag on the bottom line.The insurance industry has been building its capital reserve, courtesy a benign catastrophe environment. We expect some prudent underwriting standards to guard the insurers from erosion of the same.The interest rate environment has been slowly improving with Fed (Federal Reserve) raising interest rate thrice in three consecutive quarters. This reflects Fed’s confidence in the improving U.S. economy. An increased rate positively impacts the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other positives.Though the Property and Casualty Insurance industry is currently ranked at #229 (lies in the bottom one-third of the Zacks Industry Rank for the 252+ industries), it has outperformed the S&P 500 in the last one-year period by registering a gain of 15.64%. The index, on the other hand, climbed 13.36%.In this scenario, we focus on two leading property and casualty insurers ahead of the earnings release by the insurers. The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) is the second-largest property-casualty (P&C) insurer and the largest publicly-held personal lines carrier in the U.S., while  Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest providers of property and casualty (P&C) insurance and reinsurance and the largest publicly traded P&C insurer. While Allstate has a market capitalization of $32.46 billion, Chubb has a market capitalization of $67.79 billion.Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report), flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Price PerformanceAllstate has outpaced the industry with its shares rallying 28.44%, whereas Chubb has underperformed the industry with merely 12.29% gain. Allstate emerges a clear winner in this round ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple, used for valuing insurers.

209,CB,"The third-quarter earnings season is gaining pace with 87 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported quarterly numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of these index members (accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization) indicate that total earnings have increased 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 71.3% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 70.1%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 50.7% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported results so far shows 7.8% earnings growth on 3.3% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 71.4% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 50% for the top line is lower than the same of the S&P 500.  Insurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 1.5% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma to come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion. Mexican tremors have all the more added to the woes.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect pricings to have been strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though rate environment is improving at a very slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) set to report results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.Chubb Limited’s (CB  -  Free Report) third-quarter underwriting results will be affected by a string of cat events. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio is currently pegged at 101%, a deterioration of 980 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Premiums earned likely have reduced the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is currently pegged at $7.2 billion, reflecting a decline of 2.8% on a year-over year basis.However, higher net investment income and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. The company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $830 million and $840 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss is 26 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a 108.9% year-over-year slump. Chubb currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Further combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.

210,CB,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.40%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterChubb’s third quarter underwriting results will be affected by strings of cat events. Chubb has projected catastrophe losses from Hurricane Harvey is estimated to be nearly $520 million after-tax, whereas from Irma, it is expected to range between $640 million and $760 million after-tax. Such losses are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio is currently pegged at 101%, a deterioration of 980 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Premiums earned likely have reduced in the soon-to-be-reported quarter due to the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is currently pegged at $7.2 billion, reflecting a decline of 2.8% on a year-over year basis.Additionally, the company might have incurred higher expenses, mainly due to higher loss and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, administrative expenses and policy benefits. This in turn will weigh on the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, higher net investment income and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is currently pegged at a loss of 26 cents, compared to the earnings of $2.88 in the year-ago quarter. Also, the company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $830 and $840.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Chubb has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

211,CB,"Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates, originating from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and two Mexican earthquakes. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $503 million, net of reinstatement premiums.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $7.02 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 25.4%. We expect estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.Being a property and casualty insurer, Markel will bear the brunt of the disaster caused by these catastrophe events, weighing on its underwriting profitability. Nonetheless, the company’s underwriting profit has been improving over the years owing to its niche focus, effective management of insurance risk and focus on developing and maintaining underwriting as well as pricing guidelines on existing products and new product development.Notably, the company’s combined ratio has been better than the industry average over the last five years through 2016, though the same deteriorated 500 basis points in the first half of 2017 due to less favorable development on prior-year loss reserves.Irrespective of catastrophe alleviating techniques, severe blows from weather-related calamities make earnings unstable and hazardous. Nonetheless, Markel is capable of meeting insurance claims, courtesy a sturdy balance sheet.Shares of Markel have rallied 20.8% year, outperforming the industry’s increase of 12.3%. Strong operational results driven by insurance, investments and Markel ventures should continue to drive shares.Markel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

212,CB,"Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates emanating from inclement weather events in third-quarter 2017. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $378.9 million.The catastrophe losses constitute $146.4 million from Hurricane Harvey, $163.2 million from Irma, $57.7 million from Maria and $11.6 million from the Mexican tremors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 73 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year slump of 28.9%. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct 26.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Validus Holdings is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because the company’s current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) lowers the predictive power of ESP, which further combined with an Earnings ESP of -10.35% makes surprise prediction difficult.Last quarter, Validus Holdings had incurred net losses amounting to $3 million in the property lines at Western World segment from major disasters like 14 U.S. weather-related events, Colorado floods and the tropical storm Cindy. Nonetheless, sustained growth and portfolio diversification helped it generate 51.3% loss ratio.

213,CB,"Riding high on an improving economic backdrop, increasing interest rates and a benign catastrophe environment, the insurance industry seems well-placed to facilitate players in ramping up their growth profile.Recently, the Fed has raised the interest rate by 25 basis points under the new chairman Jerome Powell and the rate now stands at 1.75%. The Federal Reserve has hinted at two more hikes in 2018 followed by three in 2019 and two in 2020, thus pushing up the rate to 3.4%.An increased rate is expected to positively impact the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other upsides.Underwriting results — the major indicator of profitability for any insurer — are expected to improve on the back of a favorable catastrophe setting. Though, the first quarter escaped the wrath of Mother Nature, there were a few cat events like California mudslide and northeast winter storms. Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has estimated $305 million of cat loss for the first quarter of 2018.Nonetheless, price increases by insurers will help generating improved premiums.Also, President Donald Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul of tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden. The tax rate was slashed to 21% from 35%, calling for a $1.5-trillion tax cut.Interestingly, due to lower tax incidence, net profit available to shareholders will be higher, thereby leaving room for higher dividend payout by the companies.The Property and Casualty Insurance industry is ranked at #200, denoting the bottom half of the Zacks Industry Ranks for 265 plus industries. However, the industry’s registered rise of 1.3% has outperformed the S&P 500 index’s loss of 0.8% year to date. Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) and The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report). While the former with a market capitalization of $37.88 billion provides commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance products and services in the United states and internationally, the latter provides personal and commercial auto insurance, residential property insurance as well as other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services, primarily in the United States with a market cap of $35.7 billion.A better-ranked stock from the same industry is CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank stocks here.Zacks RankTravelers carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Progressive has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Travelers emerges a clear winner in this round.Price PerformanceShares of Progressive have soared 55.9%, outperforming both Travelers’ rally of 15.9% and the industry’s increase of 17.2% in a year. The Progressive stock undoubtedly performs better with this metric. ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers because of its variations in quarterly earnings. The industry’s P/B ratio is 1.43. However, both Progressive and Travelers with a reading of 3.84 and 1.59, respectively, are overvalued compared with the industry’s tally. Yet with a comparatively lower P/B ratio, Traveler’s shares are cheaply priced and hence the stock wins this round.  Debt-to-EquityTravelers has a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 27.6 compared with the industry average of 29.1% and Progressive’s leverage ratio of 35.6.  Therefore Travelers has a visible edge over Progressive here.  Return on EquityProgressive with a return on equity of nearly 16% exceeded the industry average of 4.8% as well as Travelers’s reading of 8.6%. Return on equity is a profitability measure, identifying how the company is effectively utilizing its shareholders’ money. Hence Progressive wins hands down this time. Dividend YieldBoth Travelers and Progressive underperform the industry’s dividend yield of 6.73%. Yet with 2.07% yield, Travelers scores higher than Progressive’s yield of 1.84%. Combined RatioCombined ratio, the percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses, determines an insurer’s underwriting profitability.Progressive’s combined ratio was 93.4 in 2017 while Travelers’s is 97.9. Thus Progressive edges past Travelers with this parameter.Earnings ESPBoth companies are set to report their earnings in the latter half of this month. Per our proven model, Travelers is set to deliver a positive surprise with the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank of 2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.00%. While Progressive’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes prediction inconclusive although it has a favorable Zack Rank of 3.Earnings Surprise HistoryAs far as the companies’ surprise history goes, Travelers earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 43.06%.Progressive’s metric too has outpaced the consensus mark in the last two quarters with an average four-quarter surprise of 5.01%.Travelers visibly beats Progressive in this round of the comparison game.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth Projections    Progressive’s 2018 earnings estimates have moved 5.1% north in the last 30 days. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has been revised 2.6% upward. The consensus mark for 2018 reflects 40.7% growth on 17.5% revenue increase. For 2019, the bottom line is expected to rise 5.2% on 12% higher revenues. The projected long-term earnings growth is pegged at 7.3%.For Travelers, the consensus mark for 2018 earnings has been raised 0.3% in the last 30 days while the same for 2019 has been revised upward only by a cent. The  consensus estimate for 2018 reflects 45.9% surge on 2.6% revenue improvement. For 2019, the bottom line is likely to increase 6.2% on 3.9% higher top line. The anticipated long-term earnings growth stands at 7.5%.This round lends equal weightage to both competitors.To ConcludeTravelers scored higher than Progressive on the basis of a solid Zacks Rank, valuation, sturdy leverage ratio, strong dividend yield and a robust earnings surprise history. However, considering yardsticks like price performance, return on equity or a combined ratio, Progressive seems better-equipped than Travelers. Per our comparative analysis, Travelers is thus, a more economically feasible investment option for investors than Progressive.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The outlook for these aforementioned credit ratings remained stable.  Notably, following this news release, shares of Chubb had inched up 0.3% in the last trading session.  Ratings Representation of the North American Property/Casualty Subsidiaries The ratings of the core North American property/casualty units represent each subsidiary’s solid risk-adjusted capitalization, outstanding underwriting and overall operational performances, along with continued competitive advantages within its broad standard and specialty commercial plus high net worth personal insurance businesses. The ratings also acknowledge the units’ all-inclusive and rooted enterprise risk management, strict underwriting standards, solid franchise recognition and accessibility to additional capital mechanisms offered by the property and casualty insurer, Chubb.  However, intense competition within the market, exposure to catastrophe losses and a modest level of historical adverse loss reserve development, related to asbestos and environmental (A&E) liabilities, can partially offset the abovementioned positive rating factors.  The rating agency anticipates the catastrophe losses — following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, along with the recent earthquakes in Mexico — to remain within Chubb’s risk tolerance limits. Notably, the rating agency will continue to supervise the developments connected to such events and their apparent impact on the insurer itself.  Details Behind the Ratings of Some Other Subsidiaries The ratings of another unit, Chubb Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd., represent its ownership of Chubb Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., forming the majority of the company’s financial profile along with the benefit of being part of the Chubb organization.  However, the abovementioned arm’s limited stand-alone business profile, its modest scale in comparison to subsidiaries and affiliates as well as the increased risk profile of variable annuity reinsurance business, might partially offset the positive rating factors.  On the other hand, the ratings of ACE Life Insurance Company reflect benefits received by the unit for being part of the parent Chubb organization, together with the sufficient risk-adjusted capital position, which supports the unit’s risk profile.  However, its narrow business profile and statutory losses that resulted in decreasing its absolute capital position in the past few years, have a possibility to offset the aforementioned positive rating factors. Additionally, the Combined companies’ ratings represent the perks they receive for belonging to the Chubb organization and their continued revenue growth trajectory, to name a few.  However, their current volatile earnings performance, an instable capital reserve and an elevated credit risk of the investment portfolio, are likely to offset the positive rating factors.  Interestingly, the upgrade made to Chubb Seguros Panama S.A.’s Long-Term ICR takes into account its consistent solid risk-adjusted capitalization, extended business profile as well as the company’s association with the parent entity, to name a few. However, the unit’s recent thriving market share within its insurance industry and the stiff competition within its insurance sector, can lead to a rating downgrade in the future. Lastly, the ratings of Chubb European Group Limited consider its brilliant stand-alone risk-adjusted capitalization, sustained operational performance and an outstanding business profile as commendable positives. This apart, the unit’s ratings derive benefits obtained from Chubb, the ultimate parent company.  Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an instrumental role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe such ratings to help Chubb retain investors’ trust as well as write more businesses going forward.  Zacks Rank and Share Price Movement Currently, Chubb carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of the company have gained 10.6% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 12.6%.
