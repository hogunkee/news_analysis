4,ADBE,"Dow Jones futures rose Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Pure Storage (PSTG), Micron Technology (MU), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Shopify (SHOP) and SailPoint Technologies (SAIL) were notable movers overnight on news.Meanwhile, China will cut its auto import tariff to 15% starting July 1 from the current 25%. That's good news for Tesla (TSLA) and other luxury brands that don't make cars in China.Pure Storage topped first-quarter estimates, but still fell. Micron Technology, up sharply Monday on raised guidance, announced an Intel (INTC) deal and a big buyback after the close. In addition to its own repurchase plan, Adobe said it will buy Magento, a key rival to e-commerce software firm Shopify, which tumbled. SailPoint Technologies slid on a follow-on stock offering.The stocks are generally highly rated. Adobe enjoys a 98 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Micron and Shopify have 95 Composite Ratings. Pure Storage has a 92 CR. SailPoint, which came public last November, has a 74 CR. The Composite Rating combines several IBD proprietary ratings into a single score.

The memory chip giant and Intel said their jointly developed QLC NAND flash memory is now available. Micron stock popped 5.1% in Tuesday's premarket. Early Monday, Micron raised its fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue guidance to above consensus views. Micron rallied 3.9% to 55.48 on Monday. It's working on a consolidation with a 63.52 buy point.Pure Storage reported a smaller-than-expected loss and topped revenue views. But a dip in gross profit margin and in-line revenue guidance didn't satisfy investors, as shares tumbled 9.25% early Tuesday. That would wipe out all of the flash-memory storage device maker's breakout from a 21.43 cup-with-handle buy point. If Pure Storage undercuts that entry, it would roundtrip a 13% gain at Monday's intraday peak of 24.31. A 10%-plus roundtrip is an automatic sell signal.Pure Storage closed down 0.4% at 23.58 on Monday.Adobe will pay $1.68 billion for Magento, a major rival to Shopify. Adobe also announced a new $8 billion buyback program, helping to lift shares about 0.7% late.

5,ADBE,"When it comes to how to invest in the stock market, it would be a lot easier if you could simply rely on cliches like ""sell in May and go away."" But as the general market and leading stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Adobe (ADBE) have proved in recent years, that can be a strategy for missing, instead of capturing, some big gains.   As with most sayings that have stuck around for decades, there is an element of truth to the ""sell in May"" maxim. This year, the old axiom may or may not prove prescient, given the age of the current bull cycle and the rise in volatility we've seen this year.But that's speculation, not strategy. And even if ""sell in May and go away"" were a reliable rule, what's the foolproof saying that tells you when it's time to get back in? And what happens if the market falls apart in April? Should you just hang out — and suffer losses — until you start getting invitations to Cinco de Mayo parties?Here's a more sound approach to spotting the best time to buy and sell stocks. Are the major indexes in a strong uptrend, clear downtrend or just muddling along with no clear sense of direction? Find out by checking the The Big Picture to see which of three possible stages the stock market is currently in.Knowing what environment you're operating in and basing your investing decisions on that is a much better strategy than relying on a random date on the calendar.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs IBD founder William J. O'Neil has said, ""Trade your stock first. The market second.""In other words, always keep the overall market action in mind when deciding whether to buy, sell or hold. But ultimately, that decision comes down to how your own stock is performing.Is it flashing clear sell signals? Or is it finding support or showing resilience in the face of overall market weakness? That's what matters most — regardless of what month we happen to be in at any given time.If you had decided to sell in May 2016 — with no rule for when to get back into the stock market — you would have missed out on some remarkable runs. The Nasdaq ended April 2016 at 4775.36. While it did show some roller coaster action over the next several weeks, it actually closed higher in May and then began to soar in late June. From the end of June 2016 through Jan. 26, 2018, the Nasdaq rose around 55%.In April 2016, Amazon was just breaking out of a cup with handle. If you had decided to sell in May, you would have gotten out right as Amazon began to soar 168% through March 16, 2018. As we enter May this year, Amazon is working on a later-stage base as it tries to keep climbing higher.Nvidia also showed the folly of the sell in May cliche. The artificial intelligence and self-driving car technology leader broke out in March 2016, rising over 650% in just two years. Like Amazon, Nvidia is consolidating, but remains below its 50-day line.Adobe is another case in point. The maker of data analytics and creative software began forming a series of tight chart patterns in May 2016, which subsequently sparked a gain of over 100% over the next 24 months.Looking back on each of those moves, was it a sound strategy to turn your back on those stocks and the general market just because the calendar was rolling into May? Hardly.Just like a broken clock is right twice a day, market maxims like ""sell in May and go away"" can prove prescient in some cases. But they can also be dead wrong.So to keep the odds of success in your favor, stick to a sound game plan based on what the market and leading stocks are actually doing, not on what any pundits or proverbs say they ""should"" or ""will"" do.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Q1 Earnings: Which Stocks Expect 50%-Plus Growth?3 Rules For How To Buy Stocks Like Salesforce.com In Earnings Season

6,ADBE,"From A to Z — Adobe Systems (ADBE) to Zoetis (ZTS) — $17.8 billion MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) has the sort of leading stocks that lift the portfolio into the ranks of top mutual funds.Additional top stocks like Netflix (NFLX), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are also big reasons why the fund is in a groove, outperforming the broad market as well as its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. over short, intermediate and long periods, ranging from year-to-date to one, three, five and 10 years.So far this year, going into Wednesday, the fund was up 8.22% vs. 5.27% for its direct rivals and 1.79% for the big-cap bogey. Netflix was up 75% this year. Adobe advanced 32%. Amazon was up 29%. Lululemon had gained 20%, while Zoetis climbed 19%. Netflix, Lululemon and Amazon happen to be members of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, for one, is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing-trading environment. Details on past trades are accessible to SwingTrade subscribers and trialists. Free trials are available.Paul Gordon, who manages the fund along with Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel, says the fund uses a classic investment strategy. ""The underlying philosophy is that over time stocks follow earnings and cash,"" he said. ""We look for companies that grow earnings and cash flow above market-average rates across economic cycles. We look for companies with strong competitive positions in growing industries that have pricing power, good management teams and quality characteristics such as recurring revenue, low capital intensity and attractive balance sheets.""And the fund is patient. ""We have a long investment time horizon, which you see in our low (annual) turnover,"" he said.The fund has not changed its approach during the recent market volatility. But the fund added to some names on price dips. ""Volatility in the market sometimes provides an opportunity to collectively add to secular growth companies that we like,"" Gordon said.Netflix's earnings per share grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past six quarters.As IBD reported Tuesday, Netflix stock gapped up that morning after it crushed expectations for new subscriber growth in the first quarter and guided higher than views for the current quarter.The streaming service's push into original programming is a key strategy.""Netflix has about 120 million subscribers around the world,"" Gordon said. ""They've had success ramping up subscribers. The real excitement (generated by their) January (earnings) call was the lack of (departures by customers) following their price increases, which proves the market's confidence in their long-term pricing power.""Lululemon's share price has uptrended for nearly a year, reversing an approximately yearlong downtrend. ""The issue that Lululemon faced was that it grew very rapidly for a number of years,"" Gordon said. ""They took several years to reinvest in the company, which hurt profitability. Now they seem to be coming out the other side.""Gordon added, ""As revenues continue to increase and costs increase at a slower pace, it benefits their earnings growth.""The fund trimmed modestly in recent disclosures. Gordon describes the trims as ""just selectively trimming some into (share price) strength.""Amazon, Gordon says, is firing on all cylinders. ""Its e-commerce business continues to take significant incremental share of every retail dollar that's spent,"" he said.He calls Amazon Web Services the No. 1 player in its space. ""To drive down costs to customers and invest in new services, a web services provider needs scale,"" he added. ""Amazon has that scale."" Also, it continues to post significant revenue growth, he says.The segment of Amazon's e-commerce business that involves third parties selling through Amazon — its so-called 3P business — has higher-margin growth than its 1P business, sales of inventory owned by Amazon itself, Gordon says.Adobe's share price barely slipped during the recent market volatility. Adobe owes its resilience to its leadership status and to its switch to subscription revenue from sales of packaged software. ""Adobe has very strong competitive positions in growing markets,"" Gordon said. ""And it continues to experience the benefits of moving to a subscription-based business model.""The MFS team likes both faces of Zoetis' business. Its farm-animal medicine business is steady because farmers can't afford to lose livestock. Its pet-medicine business thrives on sentimentality. ""The company calls it the humanization of pets,"" Gordon said. ""In the 1950s your dog slept in a doghouse. Now the dog sleeps on the bed with you.""Gordon added, ""Zoetis is the largest competitor in animal health, an industry growing in the mid-single digits with fewer risks than human health, given that there is no third-party payer risk.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeRetirement Savings: More Americans Than Ever Have $1 Million Or More

23,ADBE,"Cryptocurrencies, social media, automation and virtual reality are just some of the trends at the forefront of consumers' minds in 2018, and are topics the retail sector should be aware of, according to Adobe (ADBE) analysts.""As we look at technology, it becomes so embedded in everything that we do that it becomes impossible to ignore it,"" Adobe Strategic Digital Insights Director Tamara Gaffney told Investor's Business Daily.""So everything from blockchain to VR to automation and self-driving cars — the experience-led business is now really driven by technology.""Gaffney and Constellation Research's Ray Wang compiled their top 10 list of predictions for the year, presented Tuesday evening in Las Vegas at Adobe Summit 2018, a marketing conference. They made their predictions exclusively available to Investor's Business Daily ahead of time.High on the list is bitcoin and blockchain. People are aware of the cryptocurrency trend but feel pretty mixed about it, said Gaffney, noting that ""Christmas, apparently, was very big for bitcoin awareness."" (There was certainly no shortage in December of guides on how to gift bitcoin.)IBD's TAKE: Watch our exclusive interview with Adobe's Tamara Gaffney, above, as she breaks down how she thinks blockchain and virtual reality will factor into the retail experience in 2018.And there's interest in using blockchain as a ledger system beyond cryptocurrencies. In a survey of IT and marketing leaders, ""less than 9% have actually started to implement blockchain, 10% are doing a proof of concept and 33% are in the process of thinking about how to get there, which is a really high amount"" for such a technology, said Wang.""Imagine you're in high-end luxury goods, and you want to trade your latest Gucci bag or trade the latest Rolex in the used market,"" said Wang. ""How do I know it's real? When we think about provenance and authenticity, that's where it's going to play a role.""He said he can see blockchain being used not just in retail and commerce but how people trade personal data with marketers, allowing customers to opt in and out of being contacted about their interested in alcohol or cars, for example.Gaffney also sees virtual reality continuing to be a hot topic this year, but not necessarily as an at-home entertainment device, calling out The Void's Disney (DIS) VR experience in Southern California, for example.""This could be the new replacement for all of that mall space that is empty,"" she said. ""(It) could be, in my opinion, VR entertainment/theme parks coming to a mall near you.""And when it comes to at-home entertainment viewing habits, over half of all respondents across age groups still subscribe to a cable or satellite service, which she expects will translate to stabilization in the media space.""As far as the death of television is concerned — there's still people out there using it,"" said Gaffney. Still, streaming services are booming, with customers often subscribed to more than one platform. Over 77% of respondents said they use Netflix (NFLX) at least once a month, and 75% said they use Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube at least once a month.

29,ADBE,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

30,ADBE,"The outlook for growth stocks is good, based on projections for corporate earnings growth, say mutual fund managers that IBD spoke with. What managers aren't sure of is whether the pace of corporate earnings growth — and thus the outlook for growth stocks — will continue to speed up.""We continue to see a constructive environment for earnings,"" said Charles Shriver, lead manager of $2.5 billion T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $437.4 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. ""But earnings may have hit a peak in the first quarter. We do still see opportunities. But they will be driven more by individual names.""But John Wilson, lead manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund (LEGAX), sees an ongoing clear runway for growth stocks in the technology space, where he finds the bulk of his opportunities. ""We continue to have a strong earnings backdrop,"" he said. ""In technology in May, we saw a continuation of many of the same trends we saw in 2017: strength as companies moved to digitize their business operations, and an ongoing move to more digitization moving forward.""And digitization is getting a boost from federal government policy. ""A lot of companies have additional cash flow from tax reform last year, so we see companies deploying that within technology and other capital projects to improve their competitiveness,"" Wilson said. ""That helped outperformance in May by technology stocks and growth stocks more broadly.""The S&P 500 gained 2.41% in May. That helped power U.S. diversified stock mutual funds to a 2.90% advance on average, led by small-cap growth stock funds' 7.00% jump.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBest Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportSmall caps thrived amid headlines that drove investors to seek safe havens in U.S. stocks. The on-and-off prospect of a trade war was one factor that pushed investors into small caps, which tend to derive the bulk of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., said Shriver.In addition, May headlines focused attention on Italy, which was about to elect a populist coalition that is seen as skeptical of the European Union. ""When there is concern about overseas events, U.S. small caps tend to outperform,"" Wilson said.Reflecting that tilt toward U.S. stocks, world equity funds lagged U.S. diversified stock funds, losing 1.09% on average last month.China region funds were the only foreign stock fund category to gain in May, climbing 2.82%. In sharp contrast, Latin American funds plunged 12.48%.Among sectors, science/technology funds outpaced all other categories, gaining 6.29% in May. Global sci-tech funds were close behind, rising 6.12%. Health/biotechnology funds tacked on 4.82%. The energy sector was also strong.Wilson said the digitization trend benefits growth stocks that enable customers to shift to cloud computing from on-premise software. It also benefits companies that are involved in digital advertising and marketing, he said. ""Whether it is Microsoft (MSFT) or Adobe (ADBE) or Salesforce.com (CRM) or ServiceNow (NOW), we're seeing strong end demand drivers based on the need for a lot of corporate America to take important steps to make themselves part of the growth in the digital economy,"" Wilson said.Microsoft continues to benefit from growth in its Azure cloud computing service. ""Microsoft is doing a strong job of using their legacy enterprise relationships to help companies migrate their business processes and operations to the cloud,"" Wilson said.Wilson added that corporate America sees the shift to the cloud as a key strategy for survival. Two to four years ago, companies' purchasing managers talked with Microsoft about their computing needs. ""Today these discussions involve CEOs and CFOs,"" he said.His fund also holds Micron Technology (MU). ""They're a leading provider of memory, which is now going incrementally into new applications in data centers as well as into artificial intelligence and machine learning,"" he said.In health care, Abiomed (ABMD) was a top holding of $11.2 billion Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) as of March 31. The fund was a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner for having outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 and in the three, five and 10 years ended last Dec. 31.Four of the fund's top-10 stocks were in health care. Abiomed makes cardiac pumping devices. Share price was up 103% through May 31. Abiomed has IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or higher are considered leaders. The stock also has a three-year earnings per share growth rate of 44%.Abiomed joined the S&P 500 on May 31. The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's medical-products industry group, which in turn ranks No. 1 among all 197 IBD industry groups.IBD'S TAKE: Check out IBD's Stock Checkup feature to learn more about how Abiomed stacks up against rivals in its medical-products industry group.Shriver says his multi-asset group is evenly weighted between growth and value stocks. ""We like the prospects for secular growth companies such as those in technology and consumer discretionary,"" he said.But in general his group is overweight in non-U.S. stocks by about 2.75 percentage points. ""That's where we find valuations more attractive, in general,"" he said.Led by U.S. Treasury funds, taxable bond funds as well as municipal bond funds in general gained ground in May.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Retirement Savings: What's The Easiest Way To Save $1 Million?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

The move came as the company announced a new deal with Elliott Management to boost efficiencies and shareholder value. RPM has managed to hold the bulk of those gains.Electronic components maker Kemet (KEM) recently jumped past a 25.79 entry in a deep and later-stage cup with handle. The IBD 50 stock went on a massive run from a low of 1.34 in February 2016 to a high of 27.35 in October 2017. After a sharp decline following that move, Kemet has rebounded and now sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.0 up/down volume ratio. Note how the 10-week line is now back above the longer-term 40-week moving average — a sign of renewed technical strength.

36,ADBE,"Have you noticed how some top growth stocks seem to make the IBD 50 week in, week out? Or, after taking a brief vacation outside the list, some of these market leaders knock on the IBD 50's door, saying ""I'm home""?One reason for that: high-quality growth in quarterly sales and earnings. Consider Adobe Systems (ADBE). What is high quality? How about the digital imaging and marketing company growing earnings per share 48%, 39%, 45%, 42%, 44%, 47%, 40% and 65% in the past eight quarters?A second reason: strong price-and-volume action. Adobe's relative strength line, a gauge of performance vs. the S&P 500, climbs higher over the long term. That RS line doesn't show a big break in its upward trend, especially on a weekly chart.Want a third reason? High relative industry group strength. Adobe helps fulfill the L in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The ""L"" stands for leader, not laggard.Stocks showing excellence across the broad industry sector or specific industry group tend to do much better than stocks that belong to an industry group that's merely bumbling along. No wonder, then, that the IBD 50 tends to have a tilt toward the strongest sectors over the past three to 12 months.So an experienced stock picker will not be surprised to find that the computer, finance, medical and consumer-oriented sectors occupy the biggest tracts of real estate within the IBD 50.As of Thursday, the computer and finance sectors held the highest number of slots in the IBD 50, with nine stocks each. The related bank sector had one member, SVB Financial (SIVB). Medical was third with seven.Grubhub (GRUB) shows how some special stocks in the current market uptrend seem to straddle two or more sectors at the same time.You don't call Chicago-based Grubhub on the phone and ask them to order pizza or sushi on your behalf. Grubhub is an internet and mobile-based platform. It brings restaurants ever closer to customers. This business model is not exactly new, but the managers are executing growth with the precision of an all-star slugger.Trade Desk (TTD) hails from the business services sector. As of Thursday, it ranked No. 4 among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables. The sector has advanced 11% since Jan. 1. Trade Desk is up 82% year to date. Why? Here again, fundamentals matter.The Ventura, Calif.-based company has created a self-service platform in which ad buyers and agencies can efficiently select when and where to place their ads. The goal: maximize return on investment. Judging by Trade Desk's sales, its ""omnichannel"" and ""programmatic"" features are attracting more advertising dollars and bigger corporate customers.Trade Desk's sales grew 61% in the first quarter to $85.7 million. In Q4 last year, the top line bulged 42% and hit the $100 million mark for the first time. Sales rose on average 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters.That kind of sales growth tends to lead to fantastic bottom-line growth. Trade Desk, which in some respects can be seen as an internet sector play, is no exception.

37,ADBE,"Dow Jones futures were little changed late Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. President Donald Trump has approved a revised China tariffs list, according to multiple reports. Adobe Systems (ADBE) topped earnings views and guided higher, but its stock fell. AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) rose late as the Justice Department won't seek to stay Tuesday's court ruling blessing their merger. Meanwhile, red-hot Chinese livestreaming IPOs iQiyi (IQ), Huya (HUYA) and Bilibili (BILI) extended big gains from the regular session.During the regular session, the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly to a new high, fueled by strong gains in FANG stocks such as Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB), with software and internet IPOs (including iQiyi, Huay and Bilibili) continuing to shine. The S&P 500 index rose slightly, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped as energy and retail stocks slumped.Dow Jones futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. So were S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed a fraction.President Donald Trump reportedly has approved tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with a revised list affected products.

The IBD 50 stock also guided higher for the current Q3.Despite the seemingly positive news, Adobe stock fell 3.4% in late trade. That action offers three lessons for investors.Don't buy an extended stock: Adobe has run up 38.5% since its January breakout. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has consistently hit new highs. While Adobe could keep running, it would not be surprising to see Adobe pull back for a short period or consolidate over a period of weeks or months.Be cautious about buying a stock into earnings: Earnings reports are high risk, high reward. A strong report can send a stock soaring, but huge losses are also possible. Adobe's after-hours action is relatively muted give the stock's recent run. But investors should consider buying call options to minimize the downside risk while reaping any upside gains.Don't trust after-hours action: Whether it's Adobe stock or Dow Jones futures, overnight action doesn't always translate into trading in the next regular session. Perhaps Adobe will pull back modestly on Friday. But the stock could show a sharper loss or close with a gain.The Justice Department won't seek a stay to Tuesday night's federal court ruling. That would let the AT&T-Time Warner merger close, though the DOJ later could appeal the ruling itself. Time Warner stock rose 2% after hours. AT&T stock edged higher.During the regular session, Baidu (BIDU) spinoff iQiyi ran up nearly 17%, YY (YY) spinoff Huya jumped 13%, and Bilibili climbed 2.1%.

Adobe's updated Creative Suite, dubbed Adobe Creative Cloud, has been a centerpiece of this transition.Analyst consensus expects the company to report a strong 51% EPS gain when it delivers its first quarter results on June 14. That is about even with the average gain over the past three quarters. Sales growth is projected at 22%, just below the three-quarter average.Adobe stock price took a dip Tuesday in mildly lighter than average trade, dropping for another test of its 10-week moving average after breaking out from a flat base in January. The stock is up about 17% since that breakout at 186.37. A series of tight weekly closes, just above support at the stock's 10-week moving average, are a good sign. These suggest institutional investors are holding steady ahead of earnings.Adobe has rebounded off support at its 10-week line twice since its January breakout. That makes the current rebound a bit more risky, but still actionable. The stock should only dip nominally below the line, if at all, before a rebound. The higher the volume on the bounce, the better. The buy range is the same as with any buy point: 5% above where the stock price touches the line.For its part, Stamps.com has a market capitalization of less than $4 billion. That puts it near the low end of the midcap spectrum.Headquartered in El Segundo, Calif., the company introduced internet-based postage to the market under the name StampMaster in 1996. It went public under the stamps.com name in 1999 and turned profitable on an annual basis in 2005.Since 2010, the company has increased sales and earnings every year. But the first quarter may mark an inflection point. Analyst consensus expects a mere 4% gain in EPS, while revenue growth is projected to slow to 17%. That would be the company's weakest performance in both categories in 15 quarters.For the year, consensus views see Stamps.com earnings down 19%. Meanwhile, sales are expected to grow a healthy 37%.The first-quarter earnings view sets a low bar. If Stamps.com were to top that target, investors may or may not drive shares higher. Some may be looking for an exit ahead of slowing earnings. At the same time, Stamps.com has itself been discussed as an attractive acquisition target for Amazon.com (AMZN).In any case, the stock is hovering just above a 215.86 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. It is still about 6% below its October high. That could present some mild overhead supply issues as investors who bought during the stock's big August gap-up look for a point of exit.But Stamps.com's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a healthy B. Its Up/Down Volume Ratio is also in good standing, at 1.2. This suggests institutional investors are in buying mode. And the stock's relative strength line has been trending higher since December, reinforcing a possible breakout.RELATED:Adobe Systems Seen Bumping Heads With Salesforce.comAdobe Launches Ad Network As Stock Faces A Key TestStocks With Rising Relative Price Strength: Stamps.com

39,ADBE,"Learning how to read stock charts helps you get in early on winning stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX). Charts also help you spot the right time to sell and take your profits.In part 1 of this series on chart reading for beginners, we answered two basic questions: Why use charts? What's in a stock chart?In this second installment, we'll go over three telltale clues to look for in a stock chart to help you know when it's time to buy, sell or hold. Once you know how to spot these signals and understand the concepts behind them, you'll be ready to capture solid gains with the three most profitable chart patterns.TIP: Watch our free Stock Charts Decoded webinar for an overview of how to read stock charts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's easy to overcomplicate chart reading. But as we saw in part 1 of this series, charts simply tell you a story. And to understand what tale is being told, you really just need to answer the three basic questions discussed below.So keep it simple. You'll be surprised by how much you can learn about the health and potential of a stock just from these three clues.Editor's Note: If you come across terms or concepts you're not familiar with, check out part 1 of this series for more details.The first question to ask when looking at a stock chart is, ""What's the trend?"" There are basically three possibilities: uptrend, sideways, downtrend.As simple as that concept may sound, it's also quite important. You want to buy stocks when they're going in the right direction — up.Why buy a stock that is clearly heading south? Yes, it may eventually find a bottom and reverse that trend. But why jump in when it's headed the wrong way? Wait until it shows clear signs of renewed strength and begins moving in the right direction.When a stock is moving sideways, there's no clearly defined trend. You don't know if the stock will jump higher or take a nosedive. Again, why take the risk at this stage? You're better off waiting for the stock to show signs of a new uptrend.Charts tell a story. They show you if a stock is being heavily bought or aggressively sold by large investors. But the only way to decipher that story is to look at the changes in share price together with the changes in volume (i.e., the number of shares traded that day or week).Share prices fluctuate daily, up or down. To see if the buying or selling is serious — and to see if the underlying trend is changing — you need to check the volume.For example, say a stock normally trades 1 million shares a day. If the share price rises or falls a bit one day and volume is around 1 million shares, that's nothing unusual. But if the stock suddenly trades 3 million shares one day as it gains 5%, you know something is up. You want to pay particular attention to those kinds of unusually heavy-volume days or weeks.Let's look at some different scenarios and what they mean.Price GAIN In Unusually Heavy Volume: Look at the weekly chart for Netflix below. The video streaming giant's share price has been rising sharply since the end of 2016. And as indicated by the arrows in the chart, there were several weeks where Netflix's share price rose sharply and volume also spiked.What story does such behavior reveal? That mutual fund managers and other large investors are aggressively scooping up shares. This so-called ""institutional demand"" is exactly what you want to see, since it's these large investors that provide the fuel a stock needs to make a sustained climb.Nvidia, which rose over 650% after being highlighted in the IBD 50, offers another example of strong institutional demand. In the daily chart below, look how the stock was trading in a tight range right along its 50-day line in April and May of 2017 (1). The stock then gapped up on May 10 in volume 268% higher than normal (2). And note how volume continued to come in well above average as the stock moved higher in the days that followed (3). Large investors were clearly in buying mode. The stock spiked again in heavy volume on June (4).Price DROP In Unusually Heavy Volume: This is the exact opposite of the scenario above. A large drop in price accompanied by a big spike in volume shows large investors are aggressively dumping shares. In other words, the selling is serious. As the example of 3D printing stock 3D Systems (DDD) shows below, it's especially worrisome if the stock is crashing below the 50-day or 10-week moving average line when that happens.Look how volume rose sharply as the stock crashed right through its 50-day line (1). And the same thing happened as the stock failed to find support at the 200-day line (2). These were both signs that after a big run prior to 2014, 3D Systems' trend had changed.Price GAIN In Unusually Light Volume: If the share price is rising significantly, but volume is normal or below average, what does that tell you? That, at least for now, large investors are not buying aggressively. In other words, there's not a lot of conviction for the move.Such moves can turn out to be a head fake, which was the case for Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) in the chart below. The stock broke out from a base, but volume was well below average (1). On the day of a breakout, you want to see a 40% or larger spike in earnings to show strong demand. Old Dominion fell well short of that.In the days that followed, note how volume rose sharply as the stock fell (2, 3). So a light-volume breakout attempt turned into a heavy-volume sell-off. Such behavior is a clear sign that large investors are in selling, not buying, mode.Price DROP In Unusually Light Volume: When a stock falls but the number of shares traded is much lower than normal, it tells you large investors are not selling aggressively. This is an important clue that can help you sit tight and hold on for bigger gains down the road.The example of Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) below proves that point. While Ollie's was building a new flat base, note how volume on down weeks was below average (1). It was also finding support at the 10-week line. As the arrows in the chart indicate, the stock broke out of that base in heavy volume and showed several heavy-volume up weeks as the stock climbed higher for months. It's a clear example of how you can see what fund managers are up to by looking for unusual spikes in price and volume in a stock chart.Last but not least, see if your stock is finding support or running into resistance at key lines like the 50-day and 10-week moving averages. Also look for support or resistance at important price areas, such as new or recent buy points in a chart pattern.How your stock performs at these testing grounds reveals a great deal about its strength. Why? Because many fund managers and other large investors closely follow these benchmarks.If these big players still favor the stock, they'll often step in to pick up more shares and protect their positions when it pulls back to the 50-day or 10-week line. Their buying will keep the stock above those benchmarks. But if the stock crashes below the moving average in heavy volume, it's a sign that large investors have shifted into selling mode.Take Alarm.com (ALRM) as an example. As it was making a nice run in 2017, the stock consistently found support at its 10-week moving average (1, 2, 3). It was in a clear uptrend, and there were several heavy-volume up weeks — a sign of institutional demand.But note how that trend changed toward the end of that year. The stock failed to find support at the 10-week line and crashed below it in heavy volume (4). After that, note how the 10-week moving average changed from an area of support to a line of resistance (5, 6).Lines Of Defense: You can think of the 50-day and 200-day moving average lines as a stock's first and second lines of defense. (On a weekly chart, the equivalents are the 10-week and 40-week moving averages.) If a stock fails to find support at the 50-day line, see if it can at least hold its ground at the 200-day moving average. In the case of 3D Systems discussed earlier, you can see how the stock failed to find support at either benchmark, and crashed below both of them in heavy volume (1 and 2, above).Steppingstones: E-Trade Financial (ETFC) shows how stocks will often form steppingstones as they climb higher. This happens as the stock hits resistance (1) and pulls back, then finds support (2) and rises again. It's very healthy action to see a stock turn a former ceiling of resistance into a new floor of support.In the next installment of this series on chart reading for beginners, we'll go over the three most profitable chart patterns: cup with handle, double bottom and flat base.As we do that, you'll see how each of the three telltale clues discussed above come into play:You can also learn more with our free lessons on how to read stock charts.

44,ADBE,"Dow Jones futures retreated Friday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as U.S-China trade war fears heat up once again. President Donald Trump is set to OK tariffs on $50 billion in China goods, with reports that he's close to finalizing duties on a further $100 billion in Chinese products. China said it will respond ""instantly."" A trade war could hit big U.S. multinationals such as Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL) Deere (DE). Meanwhile, Adobe Systems (ADBE) fell early Friday despite beating views and raising guidance.President Trump is going ahead with tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with reports saying the list of affected products is smaller and more focused on tech. An official announcement likely wil come Friday, though it's not clear when the tariffs will go into effect. China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs, matching the U.S. dollar for dollar.All that was largely expected, but Reuters reported that Trump is close to finalizing tariffs on a further $100 billion in Chinese goods. Not only would that ratchet up the trade war and spur further retaliation, but the U.S. duties themselves could affect American companies. Keep in mind that the Apple iPhone and many other products and components are made in China but for U.S. companies.China is a huge market for Boeing jets and Caterpillar construction equipment.

53,ADBE,"Dow Jones futures rose Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, after the stock market averages reversed lower Wednesday. The chip sector, which usually is a key part of stock market rallies, is quietly tumbling. Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU) and Nvidia (NVDA) stock breakouts have failed, while Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO) and many others never got to a buy zone.On Wednesday, the major stock market averages initially rallied as President Donald Trump softened his stance on China investment restrictions. But the Nasdaq composite reversed lower, closing down 1.5% to just above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index sank 0.9%, settling below its 50-day line for the first time since May 8. The Dow Jones retreated 0.7% after reclaiming its 200-day line intraday.The stock market rally, already under pressure, is in more distress now.Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbled 2.5% to below its 200-day line. Except for a few days two months ago, the Philly Sox chip index hasn't been below that level in two years.Intel stock has fallen 15% from its June 4 peak. On June 18, the world's largest chipmaker fell below a messy flat-base buy point and the 50-day line. Intel stock has kept falling.Nvidia stock had cleared a flattish double-bottom buy point of 239.25 on May 4, reclaiming its 50-day as well. Shares of the graphics chipmaker rallied to 269.20 on June 14, but then began retreating. By June 25, Nvidia had fallen below its 50-day and round-tripped a double-digit gain to close below its buy point.Micron Technology ran up in the right side of a cup base in late May on earnings guidance and buyback news, briefly topping a buy point but never closing above it. Micron stock then tried to form a high handle formation, but has fallen back despite strong earnings and guidance last week. This week, Micron stock has tumbled below its 50-day line.Taiwan Semiconductor stock, the world's largest chip foundry, hit its worst levels since last August. Broadcom stock, a notable Apple (AAPL) iPhone chipmaker, has been struggling for the past seven months.Semiconductors tend to take part in any significant stock market uptrend. So if Intel stock, Micron stock and other chips are struggling, it's hard for the broader market to move forward. The Philly Sox index hit a short-term peak on June 7, below their March 13 record high, a few days before the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones began topping out.Why do they matter? Chip stocks account for a big share of stock market capitalization, especially in the Nasdaq. But they're also used in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to servers to under the hood of your car. So if chip stocks are struggling, it's a bad sign for many end products as well.Energy groups accounted for the five top-performing industries Wednesday out of the 197 that IBD tracks.

62,ADBE,"A trade war. Rising interest rates. Anti-EU sentiment in Europe. A nuclear showdown with North Korea. After a series of worries — or even shocks — to start the year, what jolts await in the stock market forecast for the next six months?After an unusually calm and productive 2017 for the major stock indexes, 2018 has been like a ride over sand dunes. The S&P 500 ended a 10-month winning streak in February. The market that seemed unflappable in 2017 became sensitive to headlines and faced new risks.The first tremors came Feb. 5. Stocks plunged as new inflation signs sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to a four-year high of 2.88%. The Nasdaq went on to slide nearly 12% in February, its worst decline in two years. For the first time since June 2016, IBD's market outlook was downgraded to ""correction.""The market recovered, but the volatility remains with the recent gyrations over the tit-for-tat trade drama.""We're in the late stages of one of the longest bull markets in U.S. history, and this year's volatility comes as investors wonder when and how it could end. Every potential threat is magnified,"" Christopher M. Hyzy, chief investment officer for Bank of America Global Wealth & Investment Management, said in a midyear review.Yet for all its mood swings, the stock market made progress in the first half comparable to the six-month mark of 2017. The Nasdaq is still the leader, up 8.8%, with the S&P 500 up just 1.7%. At the end of June 2017, the Nasdaq was up 14.1% and the S&P 500 8.2%. The Dow has lagged more. It's down 1.8% compared with a year-ago gain of 8%.Growth investors who have navigated the ups and down have found plenty of opportunities. Dozens of breakouts have resulted in sizable gains. Heart implant maker Abiomed (ABMD) soared as much as 125% from a breakout in early January. Adobe Systems (ADBE) climbed nearly 40% from a January breakout. Leaderboard, one of two IBD stock-picking products, is up about 18% in the first six months.But the current stock market faces big hurdles. Trade disputes with China, Canada and other nations threaten to raise costs for many industries and consumers. Some fear President Trump's tariffs may trigger a full-blown trade war and a recession. The Federal Reserve has signaled four interest-rate increases for this year, one more than was forecast at the end of last year. Foreign markets are much weaker than a year ago. Will these risks derail the market?Right now the IBD's Market Pulse puts the rally under pressure. Think of it as a caution flag in the wake of heavy selling in the latest week. But if the Nasdaq and S&P 500 can regain their footing yet again and push higher for the rest of year, the credit will likely go to four themes driving the current stock market.By asset class, small-cap stocks have been a big driver of the 2018 market. The Russell 2000 is up 7%. That's nearly as much as the Nasdaq, which has been dominated by major gains from Amazon (AMZN) (45%) and Netflix (NFLX) (105%). President Trump's push for import tariffs and retaliatory moves have made small caps relatively more attractive because of their domestic focus. In other words, small-cap stocks have less exposure to foreign markets.There are other reasons. Last year's tax cut reduced the effective tax rate of Russell 2000 companies from 33% to 21%, says Scott Hood, CEO and Portfolio Manager for First Wilshire Securities, a Los Angeles firm that specializes in small caps.By sector, technology, health care and financials have contributed the most to small caps' performance. This year's outperformance in small-cap stocks reflects a shift from a period that saw big caps dominate, Hood says.""Small cap returns are similar to large caps for the trailing five, four and three years, but small caps begin to pull ahead in periods of two years or shorter,"" Hood said.But value stocks have lagged among small-cap stocks. It's been the growth camp of small caps that shouldered the increase. The Russell 2000 growth index is up about 15% this year, vs. 8% for the Russell 2000 value index.Larger stocks show a similar trend. The S&P 500 Value index declined 3.5%, while the S&P 500 Growth index was more than 6% higher over the same period.Big earnings gains typically drive the best stocks higher. The same generally is true for the overall stock market. S&P 500 earnings growth in the first quarter topped 20% for the first since 2010, extending a sharp recovery in profits. S&P earnings rose 25% in Q1 as nine of 11 S&P sector posted double-digit gains, according to FactSet. Q1 also had a record number of profit surprises, with 77% of companies beating EPS estimates. That ties for the highest since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. Technology had the highest percentage of beats: 90% of companies exceeded earnings forecasts.But the excellent earnings didn't necessarily translate to big rewards for shareholders. Stocks often had a muted response to strong results, and data show it's getting harder to impress investors.S&P 500 companies that beat expectations in Q1 saw their share prices rise a modest 0.2% on average in the two days before and the two days after the earnings report, FactSet found. That's way below the five-year average increase of 1.1% for earnings beaters. That's the fifth consecutive quarter that profit winners lag the five-year average. In Q2 and Q4 of last year, the price reaction to positive profits was negative, on average.As profits expand, comparisons will become harder to beat. Some moderation in profit growth is expected. FactSet estimates that for the second quarter, companies are expected to report earnings growth of 19% and revenue gains of 8.7%. For Q3, earnings are expected to grow 21.4% and revenue 7.5%. For Q4, profits are seen rising 17.2% and revenue 5.8%. For the whole of 2018, earnings are estimated to rise 19.8% and sales 7.6%. Upward revisions to these numbers would push the market higher, while lowered expectations could become a serious drag.Among 67 stocks in IBD's database that went public this year, the average gain from the IPO price is more than 30%. That includes winners such as Huya (HUYA), DocuSign (DOCU) and iQiyi (IQ), which have given back big chunks of their advances.The IPOX index, which tracks stocks that have gone public in a trailing four-year period, is up 7.5% this year. That's in line with the Jan. 1-June 22 average for the past five years of 8.3%, according to Chicago-based IPOX Schuster. From a year-ago level, the index was up 21.7%.Pay special attention to new companies that are profitable and growing, or at least expect to turn profitable. Take Huya, which analysts expect will grow earnings in the triple digits the next two years.In 2017, foreign stocks and ETFs generally performed about as well as Wall Street. Many experts expected them to outperform in 2018 partly due to high U.S. stock valuations. But in fact, the U.S. is nearly alone, far outperforming major global indexes and emerging markets.Each region and country seems to have its own reason for flopping this year, whether it was corruption, trade squabbles, a populist wave or a commodity shock. But if there was a single factor that touched foreign markets, it's been the strength of the U.S. dollar, says Dina Ting, Head of Global Index Portfolio Management at Franklin Templeton's LibertyShares ETF family.In Asia, for example, Japan is a bedrock of good valuations, low unemployment and solid fundamentals, Ting says. Brazil, where the Bovespa's 20% drop this year, would qualify as a bear market, and Templeton sees an attractive market. The firm offers exposure to Brazil with its Franklin FTSE Brazil ETF (FLBR). Brazil's sell-off, Ting adds, ""has been priced into the markets already.""IBD's 2018 market outlook on Jan. 1 noted that since 1963, the S&P 500 averages a 7.5% gain in the years following a 15% or higher annual gain. So far this year, the S&P lags that average, but is still higher.The question is: Will this continue? The return of market volatility makes forecasting the second half of 2018 more difficult. Three factors loom large.Companies facing new tariffs were punished twice: first by the risk of higher costs and then by investors who sold off shares. On June 21, for example, Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) warned that Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made cars will likely hurt profits. Daimler's U.S. shares fell 4.5% on the news; Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) skidded 5.9%. Many Chinese stocks were bludgeoned in June as tariff issues intensified.Each headline on tariffs also shook the broad stock market. But with no clear direction on tariff policy, U.S. indexes often battled back from tariff-related selling. For example, on June 20, when the European Commission approved a 25% duty on $3.2 billion of imports on U.S. products, the Nasdaq made a new high.The looming trade war is the biggest uncertainty on Wall Street. While all-out conflict has yet to materialize, some economists sense a growing danger. President Trump's mercurial views on the subject only add to the uncertainty.""A decline in confidence and supply chain disruptions could amplify the trade shock, leading to an outright recession,"" Michelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist, warned in a research note. ""We continue to believe that the probability of a full blown trade war is low, but the risks are rising and it remains a key uncertainty to our outlook.""As the Federal Reserve has grown hawkish, the yield curve has flattened. Some analysts wonder if the Fed will overshoot its target, the type of policy error that has marred the central bank in the past. Just like it was in February when the stock market crumpled, monetary risk remains an issue with broad implications.Whenever the yield on the 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, it's a pretty good signal that a recession looms. The U.S. is not there yet, but the trend is headed in that direction. The spread between the two yields was 100 basis points a year ago. Today, it is around 35 basis points.""We are actually concerned about the shape of the yield curve because market worries of a 'Fed mistake' are gaining real traction,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a June 18 note. ""The yield curve seems destined to go to zero in the next 3 to 6 months. After that, the recession fuse is lit and stocks can still rise but they are living on borrowed time.""Polls continue to show the Republican Party losing control of the House of Representatives in November, although the margin is narrowing. But with Senate control and Trump in office, the GOP would still wield considerable power in Washington.""We think it is fair to say that markets have embraced the business-friendly aspects of a Trump White House and Republican-controlled Congress. At the margin, they would therefore prefer this status quo over a shift in House control to Democrats,"" Colas said on June 21.""The cross currents of sector/market cap returns year to date do not indicate a strong market view on midterm elections. ... Regional bank stocks — one group with clear exposure to Republican-led deregulation — have done well this year. While a Democrat-led House could not reverse recent bank-friendly moves, they could certainly stop any future initiatives. This is certainly one group to watch going into midterms.""It's impossible to predict the stock market one month out, let alone to the end of the year. But so far the 2018 stock market shows scant signs of a major breakdown. The IBD/TIPP Poll in June saw its Economic Optimism Index at 53.9, well above the 50 neutral level. Americans' view of their personal finances strengthened. The six-month economic outlook was at 51.2, below 55-plus readings in the two months after President Trump signed the tax cuts into law in December.The unemployment rate in June was close to a 50-year low. The Conference Board forecasts GDP will accelerated in the second quarter to 3.3% (from a 2% rise in Q1) and increase a bit more to 3.5% in Q3 and Q4.The IBD 50 list of the market's best growth stocks is up more than 16% this year, outpacing even the hot Nasdaq and Russell 2000. The leading sectors include software, apparel, retail, health care and consumer stocks — hardly a picture of despair.To be sure, growth stocks are relatively pricey. Value stocks are at the cheapest levels since at least 2005, while growth stocks are at the highest relative valuation since 2005.""All this suggests that it might be viewed as a good time to rotate into value and out of growth. We don't necessarily agree,"" wrote CFRA Research Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell. ""While valuation is important, we can't ignore that technology accounts for at least 40% of the Growth indices (and only 7% of the Value index). Because of that, we believe the growth rally can continue over the next several months, if not through the end of this year.""While cautioning that the U.S. economic expansion is in the late innings, Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2800 to 2900, up 4.8% to 8.5%.""Our favorable outlook for most U.S. equities is based on a broadening economic recovery, driven by household and business spending,"" strategists Sameer Samana and Scott Wren wrote in the bank's 2018 Midyear Outlook. ""Faster economic growth and modest inflation should drive corporate sales growth."" The corporate tax cut should result in ""significant margin expansion.""Other institutions echo those sentiments. Wells Fargo's main picks for the remainder of 2018 are financials, industrials and consumer discretionary — cyclical sectors that tend to benefit the most from rising interest rates.A choppy market makes it harder for investors to hold for sizable profits.

63,ADBE,"The Dow Jones industrial average and, briefly, the S&P 500 index undercut their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq composite pulled back from a record high. Fears that President Donald Trump will impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese tech and telecom products worried investors and slammed Boeing stock. Trump also blocked Broadcom (AVGO) from buying Qualcomm (QCOM), though chip stocks still outperformed. United Airlines raised forecasts and faced yet another public relations fiasco. Adobe Systems (ADBE) rallied on earnings and guidance. General Electric (GE) dove on dividend fears.Stocks ran into turbulence amid concerns that President Trump will soon levy stiff tariffs on Chinese goods over their trade and investment practices. Trump also nixed a possible Broadcom (AVGO) takeover of Qualcomm (QCOM). Boeing (BA), which sells a lot of planes to China, tumbled through its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average, which reclaimed its 50-day line on Monday, fell back below that level, led by Boeing. The S&P 500 index undercut its 50-day line on Thursday, but moved back above that area on Friday. The Nasdaq composite hit a record high Tuesday intraday, but reversed to close lower that day and in the next two sessions.Broadcom (AVGO) withdrew its $117 billion bid for rival chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) after President Trump signed an executive order blocking the deal on national security grounds. Broadcom is shifting its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cited concerns about its ties to China, including firms like Huawei. The interagency body also was worried that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm was acquired by the notoriously low-R&D Broadcom. Analysts say Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms. A day after abandoning its pursuit of Qualcomm, Broadcom reported fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets, but gave in-line revenue guidance for the current quarter amid a sharp decline in wireless chip sales.The digital media and marketing software firm earned an adjusted $1.55 a share, up 65% year over year, on sales of $2.08 billion, up 24%, in its fiscal first quarter ended March 2.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLumentum Holdings (LITE) will buy Oclaro (OCLR) for $1.8 billion in cash and stock, raising speculation of consolidation among fiber-optic component makers. Lumentum stock has outperformed its optical peers in 2018, owing to its push into a new market as a supplier of 3D sensors to Apple. That stock run-up gave it ammunition to purchase Oclaro. While much speculation centers on Finisar (FNSR) as a possible buyer, its stock has lagged. Analysts view Acacia Communications (ACIA), Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), and NeoPhotonics (NPTN) as possible targets.United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) hiked their first-quarter unit revenue forecasts, against a backdrop of solid travel demand. At an airline conference, United defended its decision to keep adding flights, while American Airlines (AAL) said Wall-Street sell-offs to signs of more expansions, competition and in turn fare discounting were an ""overreaction.""

Two senators also introduced a bill to prohibit storing animals in overhead bins.Coupa Software (COUP) topped fourth-quarter profit estimates as revenue jumped 41% to $53.8 million.

The firm cut its price target on GE stock to 11.China Lodging Group (HTHT) tumbled after the hotel operator badly missed on earnings while revenue just fell short. Meanwhile, online travel agency Ctrip.com (CTRP) also took a dive after reporting Wednesday, despite EPS falling less than expected and revenue rising 34% to $980 million.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) beat earnings estimates, as did its full-year earnings-per-share outlook. While revenue and same-store sales missed, the retailer expects ""stronger product innovation from select key partners"" and ""less margin pressure than previously expected."" The results come as sports retailers face heavy competition and discounts. Dick's last month said it would stop selling assault-style rifles completely and ban gun sales to customers under 21 following a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) edged past earnings estimates with sales in line.

FireEye (FEYE) jumped on speculation that it could be a takeover target.Dollar General (DG) investors had a few dollars more in their pockets after the stock spiked Thursday on bullish guidance for 2018. The firm met expectations with EPS of $1.48, while same-store sales growth was above some estimates.Industrial supplies distributor HD Supply (HDS) punched through its 50-day line after reporting a Q4 beat and giving bullish guidance Tuesday. Earnings rose to 49 cents a share while revenue was $1.18 billion.Williams-Sonoma (WSM) beat fourth-quarter expectations on what the upscale home furnishings retailer was ""substantial acceleration in e-commerce and retail revenue growth."" The company also hiked its dividend and expanded its buyback program.Toys 'R' Us will liquidate all its U.S. stores amid stiff competition and high debt payments from a private-equity buyout. Thousands of jobs will be lost, while Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT) dove on fears of lower sales.Tiffany (TIF) reported better-than-expected holiday fourth-quarter earnings, but global same-store sales growth came in light for the upscale jeweler. Shares fell Friday. Signet Jewelers (SIG), which owns the mall-based Kay and Jared chains, tumbled 21% for the week on weak guidance.Ahead of the 2019 launch of its stand-alone streaming platform, Disney (DIS) reshuffled its businesses to add a direct-to-consumer and international segment, to be headed by Kevin Mayer, most recently its chief strategy officer.

Concentration matters.Want to hitch your portfolio to companies that gallop past the major equity benchmarks? Stay ever mindful of the strongest industry sectors that are leading the charge.That's what many savvy growth-focused fund managers do. They assess the economy, new technologies and innovations.

72,ADBE,"The IBD Stock of the Day is Akamai Technologies (AKAM), which is hovering just below a buy point. Akamai is nearing the potential entry just after cloud services rival Amazon (AMZN) moved into its own buy zone last week.The cloud-based internet content delivery provider is trading just below a cup-with-handle buy point of 77.69. The stock first tried to clear that level on May 22, but hit resistance and reversed lower.The buy point for Akamai Technologies, which is in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, remains valid because the stock only fell as much as 3.5% from that level. A sell signal for the stock would be triggered at a 7%-8% loss.Shares rose 1.4% to 77.07 in Monday's stock market trading.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmazon, with its fast-growing Amazon Web Services unit, competes with Akamai in internet content delivery services. Amazon stock cleared a buy point of 1,617.54 on Wednesday. It eclipsed the old peak of 1,638.10 on Thursday, offering another entry point. Both moves came in light volume. Amazon climbed 1.45% Monday to 1,665.27, a new high.Akamai's key customers include software stocks Salesforce (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK), as well as online brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).If and when Akamai attempts a breakout, look for heavy volume on the upside as that indicates support from institutional investors. Also keep an eye out for an upward-sloping relative strength line, which measures a stock's price performance vs. that of the S&P 500. Right now the RS line is trading somewhat sideways. An RS line at a new high during a breakout is a bullish indicator.This base has a handle. When a stock forms a handle on a cup base, that's a positive development. It provides a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock moves higher.Akamai earns an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of 99. The Composite Rating includes a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance.Last quarter, the company broke a streak of quarterly earnings declines, with growth of 22%. Akamai also saw its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. The tech firm is expected to issue its next quarterly report near the end of June.The Internet-Network Solutions industry group ranks No. 35 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.

73,ADBE,"Small caps have been moving up the ranks among diversified growth stock funds, based on year-to-date performance through May 30.The three small-cap growth funds making the ETF performance table all finished in the upper half, led by iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Growth's (IJT) 11.1% year-to-date gain. That's well ahead of the S&P 500's 3.1% return. The ETF is just off a recent record high and is trading near the top of a buy range from a 181.77 buy point.The $5.9 billion fund's biggest sector weighting as of May 31 was health care at nearly 21%. Industrials followed at 20%, information technology 16.5%, and consumer discretionary and financials at roughly 13% each. Top holdings included Chemed (CHE), FirstCash (FCFS), Stamps.com (STMP) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND).A large-cap growth fund, PowerShares S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG), came in second with a 10.1% year to date gain. RPG is working on the right side of a shallow base with a potential 117.44 entry. The $2.5 billion fund is topped by Netflix (NFLX), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Align Technology (ALGN), Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon.com (AMZN), which together account for just north of 10% of assets.Third place went to iShares Russell 2000 Growth (IWO), which provides access to small-cap U.S. companies with an above-average earnings growth rate vs. the market.

74,ADBE,"McDonald's, Chevron and Home Depot each gained 2 points in the stock market today and helped push the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 0.5% higher in afternoon trading Thursday. Tesla rallied again as crude oil rose sharply.Among the Dow Jones' 30 components, eight stocks rallied at least 1 point as U.S. Treasury bonds fell, pushing up yields. Oil rallied sharply.Meanwhile, software stocks dropped en masse, pressuring the Nasdaq. Chip equipment firms, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), also took it hard on the chin. Both of these former big winners in 2017 are now in basing mode.At 2:15 p.m. ET, the tech-centered composite fell 0.9%, slightly cutting early losses. The Nasdaq 100 slumped 1.2%, poised to halt a four-day winning streak. The S&P 500 traded virtually flat, down 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 fell 0.4% after rising four sessions in a row.Enterprise software shares took a break. In the IBD Sector Leaders screen, Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), RealPage (RP) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) all slid 2% to 3% or more in brisk volume.Tesla (TSLA) has been rising on comments earlier this week by CEO Elon Musk that he's confident the electric vehicle pioneer will ramp up weekly production of the pivotal Model 3 sedan to 3,000 units per week by month's end.The stock has rebounded as much as 35% from its near-term low of 244.59 on April 2. Over the same time frame, the Nasdaq composite has gained 13%.However, please check out the MarketSmith daily chart on Tesla, and you'll see that Tesla is having some trouble climbing back above the 200-day moving average.The 200-day line traces the average closing price of a stock over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months' worth of action. As a growth investor, you want to see a stock rise not only above its 50-day moving average but the 200-day line as well.Most of the top dogs in the IBD 50 show such a trend. They're hitting new highs, leading their 50- and 200-day moving averages higher.On the positive side, Tesla now stands just 17% below its 52-week and all-time peak of 389.61. That price represents a fantastic gain since the transportation innovator initially broke out of a stage-one base near 40 back in April 2013.The current base is first stage. Watch to see if the stock can keep muscling higher, slashing through a very visible overhead supply of willing sellers at the 350 to 360 price range.Tesla's sales jumped 68% last year to $11.76 billion, breaking the $10 billion barrier. But the Palo Alto, Calif., company also lost $8.66 a share. The Street sees Tesla bleeding more red ink this year (an estimated net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018), but then earn $2.37 a share in 2019.The company has a $54 billion market cap and 170 million shares outstanding.In contrast, Toyota Motor (TM) has a $201 billion market cap (share price times total shares outstanding) and 1.47 billion shares outstanding. The global car and truck titan had $265 billion in sales in 2017, up 4%.Toyota shares are forming a saucer with a droopy-looking handle. In a bull market, the handle should show a maximum decline of 8% to 12% from high to low. In Toyota's case, the correction within its three-week handle is an acceptable 9%. The provisional buy point is 138.68.McDonald's (MCD) surged more than 3% to 168.48 in active turnover. The world's largest restaurant chain hit a nearly four-month high and is carving a new saucer-style base. The current buy point for now is 178.80.Elsewhere in stocks today, Five Below (FIVE) destroyed short sellers with a 22% gain, extending its run to five sessions. Shares notched an all-time high of 99.91, up 487% from its July 2012 IPO at 17 a share.The operator of stores that sell items at $5 or less reported late Wednesday that earnings in the April-ended first quarter catapulted 133% to 35 cents a share, the biggest for any first quarter. Sales jumped 27% to $296.3 million.Five Below, based in Philadelphia, has aggressively expanded its chain into new markets in the Midwest, Southwest, and California. The stock entered IBD Leaderboard as a call options play ahead of Wednesday's quarterly results.The stock has also risen 27% past a recent breakout point of 78.38 in a well-formed base on base. A seven-week flat base makes up the upper portion of this bullish chart pattern.WTI crude oil futures rallied 1.7% and got as high as $66.07 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased to 2.95%.Chevron (CVX) posted a bullish gap up, rising 3.75, or nearly 3%, to 127.13. Volume is running mildly above average.Despite the nice gain, the integrated oil major is not yet at a proper buy point.Right now, watch to see if Chevron can rally past the handle portion of its five-month cup with handle. The handle' s high is 131.08, thus generating a 131.18 buy point.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, leading industry sectors in the stock market, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Should You Buy Stocks Or Sell Now?

79,ADBE,"The stock market looked poised to end the week on solid ground Friday as several Dow stocks outperformed with gains of around 1% more.Outperformers in the Dow included Walmart (WMT), American Express (AXP) and Caterpillar (CAT), although they've been lagging the market in recent weeks.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn IPO news, Zscaler (ZS) priced last night at 16, above the proposed range of 13-15. Shares opened at 27.50 and were trading around 30.96. The provider of cloud-based network security solutions isn't profitable yet, but the company reported sales of $45 million in its latest quarter, up 53% from the year ago period. Separately, the highly-anticipated Dropbox IPO is scheduled to price Thursday and start trading under the ticker DBX. The proposed range is 16-18.In the stock market today, Adobe Systems (ADBE) outperformed, rising 3%, after reporting another strong quarter late Thursday. Earnings of $1.55 a share handily beat expectations. Sales rose 24% to nearly $2.08 billion, marking the 11th straight quarter of 20%-plus sales growth; pretty impressive for a company with a market capitalization north of $100 billion. Adobe is well-extended after a breakout from a base in January and is a member of the Leaderboard portfolio of top-rated growth stocks.The market's response to Broadcom's (AVGO) earnings wasn't as good as shares gave up 4.5% to 255.45. Earnings topped expectations but sales guidance for the current quarter was mostly in-line with expectations.Heavy-volume gainers included small-cap Smart Global (SGH).

The company has delivered strong sales growth in recent quarters, but annual earnings are expected to decline in 2018 and 2019.Also in the IBD 50, Five Below (FIVE) added 0.7% to 69.13 ahead of next week's earnings report.

81,ADBE,"The 2018 stock market has not been for the faint of heart, having already notched all-time highs and the biggest correction in two years. But some stock mutual funds have found ways to both post gains and surpass major indexes, often with investment strategies that include such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX) and Salesforce.com (CRM).X For the year through March 8, Fidelity Investments' Will Danoff and John Roth have deftly ridden such stocks to a nice 6.48% gain in the fund they manage: $28.5 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX). That compares with the S&P 500's 2.84%. The legendary Danoff is best known for managing the $129.6 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) since 1990, and with which he's outperformed every other stock fund with $100 billion or more in assets in the past 15 years.Many of their top holdings are riding a megatrend — people spending more time on the internet — that they see driving earnings growth and price appreciation for years to come.A key to the winning investment strategies they've used since New Insights' inception in 2003 is change. ""We always look for change,"" Danoff told IBD, ""and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition.""While New Insights is solidly in the large-cap growth camp, Roth brings in expertise in midcap stocks and a slight value tilt, which adds a level of flexibility to the managers' investment process as they navigate 2018 stock market trends.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportIn a wide-ranging Q&A, Danoff and Roth share how their flexible investment strategies allow them to uncover opportunities even as the bull market ages and many growth stocks get pricey. They also discuss their major holdings, including why they're bullish on Amazon, Netflix and Adobe.IBD: What is the strategy of your fund?Will Danoff: Fidelity Advisor New Insights is a capital appreciation fund with a growth bias. Both John and I believe that stocks over time follow the underlying earnings per share of the companies. I've joked in the past: You get two fund managers for the price of one. We created a sleeve structure two years ago: Will is running 60% of the fund, John is running 40% of the fund. John has a more value orientation, I have a more growth orientation.IBD: What is the main trend in the market today and how are you integrating it in the fund?Danoff: I'm looking for the best stocks in the market and companies that have a sustainable competitive advantage but are growing in this environment, gaining market share, are able to leverage technology and find certain trends like Cloud or SaaS (Software as a Service) or just more and more people and more and more companies spending more time on the internet. That's probably the megatrend that we're all living in.John Roth: I've spent half my time at Fidelity as a value-ish analyst and half as a growth analyst. I prefer to buy growth stocks — I think they're more fun, more interesting. But I think you can also make money in turnarounds and other things that the market has left by the wayside.Nine years into a bull market, I think there's some valuation concerns on the growth side, so that's taken some of my growth money out, but I still have a growth bias. I think the key is to be versatile and really take advantage of the opportunities the market gives you.Danoff: We're flexible and we'll go anywhere, so I really think that helps the fund. There aren't many constraints on what we can do. And John has been really good at anticipating which out-of-favor groups might come back into favor. And by looking for out-of-favor groups, that forces you to look at your existing names and say ""Wow, maybe all the good news has been discounted here.""IBD'S TAKE: As an individual investor, you want to stay in sync with the market. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.IBD: Speaking of which, could you give a few examples of trades in the past 12 months?Danoff: We were up 28% last year and tech helped a lot. Amazon was a nice overweight, Activision Blizzard (ATVI), PayPal (PYPL), Facebook (FB), Adobe — these were larger technology companies that grew very nicely.We always look for change and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition. When something's happening, Fidelity can hopefully move quickly.Last year was about avoiding some of the defensive names, General Electric (GE) obviously struggled with their earnings. ... We were underweight in a big way.IBD: Your fund profile talks about companies that are undervalued by the public. But obviously the public is focusing on the big tech names, so how are they undervalued or what is the additional value that you're seeing in them?Danoff: John and I are looking for misperceptions by the public. If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger (and) video. ... We're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer. I think I am more bullish on Facebook than the consensus and I own a lot of it.Roth: A lot of times these big names are right in front of you and it doesn't mean they're not going to be great stocks. Apple (AAPL) has been the poster child. Back in 2007, people got excited about the potential for the company to have $6 billion in revenue, and no one thought they'd go to $250 billion. And it unfolded slowly over the years right in front of you.IBD: What are your thoughts on the fact that we're late in the economic cycle and valuations are high?Danoff: Yes, we've had a long run since the bottom of the spring of 2009, earnings have more than doubled, stocks have more than tripled. The crisis of 2008-2009 I think was felt more deeply than people realize. … (The economic impact) was quite drastic.There was this massive footrace to put on the brakes — cutting costs, cutting capital spending. Sort of the whole world froze. I think Apple and Google were two of the only companies I'm aware of that grew earnings in the first two quarters of 2009.My point is, the starting point was quite drastic. And so even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing the costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending.The other observation I have is the world is much more global and U.S. companies are now able to sell their products all over the world. The big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive; they're high margin, they're high growth and they're highly cash generative. Yes, I think the market is expensive, but the market is not what it used to be. The quality of the companies is higher and estimates are going up.IBD: Would you look more outside of the U.S. to find good stocks?Roth: Our philosophy is turn over as many rocks as you can. The more you turn over, the higher the probability to find something good. If we find that the U.S. has less opportunities, then maybe we'll look harder in Europe. Europe has been slow to recover and there are some interesting names there. And the same would be true in Asia. You might see more names in the fund because we're trying to find new ideas.Danoff: The global research effort helps us so much. The global economy is much more integrated. We can talk to Asian tech companies who are part of the supply chain, or Samsung, which is a supplier and a competitor to so many of the big tech companies, and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). It's hugely helpful to understand where we are in the cycle in that particular industry.The trends we're seeing overseas are often similar, sometimes ahead of the trends that we see in the U.S., sometimes behind. But in terms of the big global companies, often the Nestles (NSRGY) and Unilevers (UN) are more defensive, and right now defensive is out of favor. So we're trying to pay attention to out-of-favor, but right now these stocks are not leading the market. This is the tension and the balance we have to find.IBD: The market had a short correction recently. How do you react in this kind of environment?Roth: We went through a very long period of no volatility and to the extent we see more volatility in the future as the economy heats up and the Fed gets more aggressive, it just means that we have to tighten our game up and look for dislocations every day. We've had some really big swings in the market where you could open up and then all of a sudden be down a fair amount, and so on an individual stock basis we're looking for bargains on the names that we really like. We do have some cash in the fund and we can be opportunistic. So a little bit of volatility is not a bad thing at all.IBD: Do you sell anything in those times?Danoff: You have to stay flexible and when fundamentals change, we all have stories when a top 10 position discloses some bad news and the stock is down and you start saying, ""Oh my God, one of my big positions is under pressure."" If there's competition from Amazon, or there's regulatory changes, or there's unexpected margin pressure, you can't stand still in this business.When the whole market sells off, John and I are looking for higher-quality companies that we can upgrade to.IBD: Considering the current increasing inflationary pressures, do you see any sector rotation or areas that may pop up that would be more advantageous for investors in 2018?Roth: We are seeing wage inflation. Everyone from Walmart (WMT) to most big companies have started to pay their employees more. These bonuses that are coming as a result of the tax cut will have the same effect.Who benefits? It's probably the financials to some extent, probably the energy companies, materials, gold. We have exposure to all of that, and we can easily shift if it looks like it's going to become more prevalent.IBD: What is your outlook for some of the big names in your fund?Danoff: Good news is good news. In an expansionary environment, Netflix is crushing it overseas. They're adding 5 million subs overseas a quarter and a couple million subs in the U.S. They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding, it's a subscription model offering great value for roughly $10-$11 a month. The average subscriber is spending 10 hours a week watching their content. Margins are going up and I am quite positive.Adobe has made a shift from licensed to Software-as-a-Service to the recurring revenue model. More and more people are spending more and more time on the web, so companies and individuals purchase Adobe software more frequently. Revenues are growing more than 20%, margins are going up and the company is generating a huge amount of free cash flow, so the outlook is very bright for Adobe. Could it sell off because it's expensive? Yes, both Adobe and Netflix could see multiples compression near-term, but I think over time both companies are very well positioned to grow, looking out three to five years.Amazon — wouldn't you want to partner with the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos? A week does not go by where somebody doesn't tell me, ""I love Amazon."" AWS, which is their cloud-computing business — they started before anybody else realized that could be a business — it's now I think an $18 billion business, growing roughly 40% a year; it's nicely profitable. In e-commerce, he's pushing hard into India, into food, in apparel — he's gaining market share. He's got a long way to go. Maybe I'd like him to show a little more profit because I think stocks follow earnings over time, but I'm confident that everything Amazon is investing in is ultimately going to generate a very strong return, and if that's the case, then profits will come over time.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners401(k) Experts Warn When NOT To Use A Target Date Fund2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltThe New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles And Ciscos?

82,ADBE,"Think technology is an important sector this year? Without techs, the S&P 500 would be down for the year.The S&P 500 owes its entire year to the technology sector's 8.5% increase and a 25% weighting, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a report Wednesday. No wonder then, four technology ETFs are in this month's ETF Leaders screen, including First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology (QTEC).The fund tracks the technology companies in the Nasdaq 100 index. That brings it most of the largest techs, including titans such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC).Because the index is equal-weighted, midcaps such as Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Intuit (INTU) have about the same weighting as Apple and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The fund has 37 holdings, with more than 40% in semiconductors, 35% in software, 10% internet and the rest in hardware, telecom and services.With performance spread out among the components, the fund can better withstand a plunge like Baidu's (BIDU) 15% slide the past couple of weeks. In a cap-weighted portfolio, Baidu's loss would hurt more. But the index's structure also means big gains from major components will be muted.That approach hasn't necessarily hurt First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology, and in some regards it has helped returns.As of April 30, the ETF had climbed more than 27% in the past 12 months. It rose about 22% in the past three years and 23% over five years. By comparison, SPDR Technology (XLK) was up 22%, 17% and 18% in the one-, three- and five-year periods. IShares U.S. Technology (IYW) was up about 23%, 17% and 19%. Both are also among IBD's ETF Leaders.First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology, which is up about 9% this year, is rebalanced four times a year — in March, June, September and December. The Nasdaq 100 tech index is reconstituted once a year.The ETF's chart closely resembles the other technology funds in ETF Leaders: They are all forming double-bottom bases with handles. For First Trust Nasdaq 100, the buy point is 80.06. Some investors saw an entry May 10, when shares climbed past the 78.90 buy point from the middle peak in the pattern. Shares remain near that level.With its components culled from the Nasdaq 100, the ETF is mainly a large-cap fund. The median component's market capitalization is at $33.76 billion. These tech stocks tend to command a premium valuation, resulting in an average price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7 as of April 30, according to the First Trust website.The ETF, with $2.54 billion in assets, does face some sector risks. For example, chipmakers have cited slack demand from smartphone manufacturers.RELATED:The Year's Best Sector And How To Invest In ItActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexHow Does The ETF Leaders Index Achieve Its Performance?

It also confirmed it has become the second-largest shareholder in Apple (AAPL).In an SEC filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of March 31, the company said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts worth about $693 million. This is up from 18.9 million ADRs worth $358 million the previous quarter.Health insurers shares slumped after Buffett, Amazon (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced January a joint venture whose aim is to cut U.S. health care costs.""We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder's meeting earlier this month. ""The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.""However rivals are betting against the plan, with power player Jana Partners revealing Tuesday new positions in Anthem and Cigna (CI), while Omega Advisors and billionaire investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management have taken new positions in UnitedHealth, according to their regulatory filings.Teva had been under pressure since Mylan's (MYL) generic version of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone was approved in October and amid challenges facing the U.S. generic medicines industry.To contend, Teva announced a restructuring plan to trim $3 billion in spending by closing plants and cutting drug programs. In February, Teva said it was well on its way to realizing half those savings by year's end.One Buffett decision that hedge fund managers seem to agree with is his increased Apple holding.

In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

96,ADBE,"This year's top-performing U.S. diversified stock funds have regained or are very close to retaking their 50-day moving averages, thanks to Friday's market rebound.Though four small-cap exchange traded funds made the list of biggest year-to-date gainers through May 2, large caps still dominated. With the exception of one midcap ETF, First Trust Dorsey Wright Dynamic Focus 5 (FVC), the rest were big-cap names.PowerShares S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) topped the list with a 4.5% return, according to Morningstar Direct. The ETF tried to recaptured its 50-day line Friday as it works on a base with a potential 117.44 buy point. The $2.4 billion fund, which tracks the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index Total Return, provides access to S&P 500 stocks exhibiting strong growth traits. Growth is measured based on sales growth, earnings change to price and momentum.Information technology accounted for the biggest sector weighting at nearly 40% of assets, health care 21%, consumer discretionary 15%, and financials 9%. Top holdings as of May 3 included Netflix (NFLX), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) is also in its portfolio.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, came in second with a 4.1% year to date gain. The $59.8 billion fund reclaimed its 50-day line Friday, powered in part by a 4% jump by Apple, its biggest component. Apple, now on IBD's Leaderboard, soared twice during the week: Friday after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he added to his Apple stake in Q1, and 4% Wednesday after an earnings and sales beat.

Top holdings as of May 1 included hospice care provider Chemed (CHE), pawnshop operator FirstCash (FCFS) and Stamps.com (STMP).Another small-cap, iShares Russell 2000 Growth (IWO), was just behind with a 3.5% year to date gain.

101,ADBE,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have been heavily buying shares in big-name industry leaders, including Bank of America (BAC), Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Charles Schwab (SCHW), investing well over $1 billion in each during that period.X BofA led the group, with top fund managers scooping up more than $2 billion of the financial giant's shares. Boosted by that demand, the stock is now around 25% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared in September.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) and software and analytics leader Adobe (ADBE) both came in just shy of the $1 billion mark, getting investments of approximately $982 million and $932 million, respectively.The IBD 50 screen identifies the top growth stocks that are strongly displaying the key traits typically shared by the biggest stock market winners.Seven of the names on this month's list of new buys by top funds are also currently on the IBD 50, including Applied Materials, Adobe, Abiomed (ABMD), Lam Research (LRCX) and S&P Global (SPGI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn addition to BofA, seven other bank stocks made the list, joined by six financial sector companies, including Charles Schwab, which was named one of the best online stock brokers for 2018.Leading portfolio managers also continued to pick up shares in semiconductor stocks, including the aforementioned Intel, Applied Materials and Lam Research, as well as Microsemi (MSCC) and KLA Tencor (KLAC).Portfolio managers also showed a healthy interest in medical stocks, with five companies from that sector joining Abiomed and Abbot Laboratories on the list, including Express Scripts (ESRX) and Cantel Medical (CMD).Just because mutual fund managers have been buying a stock doesn't mean it's time for individual investors to pick up shares, especially given that the overall market has come under selling pressure recently. Be sure to run all your stock ideas through a buying checklist and do additional research before making any investment decisions.On Tuesday, Applied Materials cleared a 58.83 buy point in a later-stage, and therefore riskier, double bottom. Its relative strength line has been trending sharply higher and is just shy of new high ground.Lam Research is also working on a late-stage double bottom, and has now climbed within 5% of the 218.58 entry.Scanning and tracking solutions leader Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) leapt past a buy point in January, but pulled back as the stock market fell sharply in early February. But on Feb. 22, Zebra soared on its Q4 earnings report and is now 27% above the initial 112.49 entry.Adobe also launched a successful breakout in January and has now climbed 14% above the 186.37 buy point.IBD 50 member SVB Financial (SIVB), which owns Silicon Valley Bank and was just featured in the IBD Stock Analysis, broke out past a 263.19 entry on Tuesday, but is now testing support at the buy point after the resignation of Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn rattled the market.Despite being among the top new buys this month, Boeing topped the list of stocks being sold, with 42 net sellers (123 funds selling minus 81 buying).American Express (AXP) was second, with 40 net sellers (90 funds selling minus 50 buying).Managed care provider Humana (HUM) and Motorola Solutions (MSI) also saw a significant number of net sellers.You May Also Like:What Are Today's Fastest-Growing Companies?Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsVideo: How To Quickly Find Top-Performing Mutual Funds

102,ADBE,"Major indexes felt investors' chill over news that Gary Cohn is leaving his White House role as chief economic advisor, but the Nasdaq composite continues to prove that it is the index to beat in 2018. However, as seen in recent sessions, the U.S. equity markets continue to show rapid seesawing action as well.X Due to a recent spate of heavy distribution, or pronounced institutional profit-taking, from Feb. 20 to March 1 in both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, IBD's current outlook continues to stand at ""Uptrend under pressure.""At 3 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved its mild losses and is trying to hold above the breakeven level, up 0.1%, despite having multiple large-cap and megacap companies that do business overseas. But in the wake of continued uncertainty over the possibility of trade spats between the U.S. and China, the rest of Asia, and Europe, clearly the selling has been more focused on industrial companies.The Dow Jones industrial average, down at one point 1.4%, has cut its losses to around 0.7%. During session lows, at least half of the 30 components sank 1 point or more. IBM (IBM) was the sole stock within the Dow Industrials to rise 1 point or more.The S&P 500 slid nearly 0.8%, then cut the loss to less than 0.4% with an hour to go in Wednesday's session. At 2707, the large-cap benchmark has shaved its year-to-date gain to 1.6%.The Nasdaq is up 6.7% since Jan. 1.The Russell 2000 gained 0.7% as small caps outperformed. Perhaps institutional investors hold a general view that a budding trade war that focuses on tariffs on select products would hurt larger multinational companies more than smaller firms that sell primarily in the domestic market.The S&P SmallCap 600 is up 0.6%, and at 955 is now up 2% since Jan. 1.While steel stocks are emerging as a new leading sector thanks to strong gains by the likes of United States Steel (X), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE), the software, consumer and China sectors of the market continue to do well.Alibaba (BABA), Weibo (WB) and TAL Education (TAL) continue to show nice long-term uptrends and high relative strength. (See a detailed analysis of TAL's chart action near the bottom of this article.)Alibaba, a big winner in 2017, continues to a long trend of higher highs and higher lows. Notice on a daily chart how the Chinese and international facilitator of e-commerce and mobile payments had sold off in line with the early February correction that took the Nasdaq down nearly 12% from its perch. Yet Alibaba, hitting a 2018 year-to-date low of 168.88, did not undercut the Dec. 5 near-term low of 164.25. That's bullish.Plus, Alibaba has been weaving above and below its still-rising 50-day moving average. Such action indicates that the stock is trying to form a new base that could serve as a launching pad for a new breakout and a new run to price highs.When a stock breaks out and hits new highs, everyone in the market is happy, except for short sellers.Alibaba broke out of an eight-week cup with handle at 192.59 on Jan. 24, rallied 7%, then got reeled back into the belly of that chart pattern. So, a new base that potentially forms would technically serve as a base next to a base.Autodesk (ADSK) gapped up on very strong results and gave a rosy outlook based on success with its transition into a ""software as a service"" business model. Adobe Systems (ADBE) has already shown it's succeeded by selling its products online and giving users flexible subscription-based offerings.Both Autodesk and Adobe are members of IBD Leaderboard, which currently shows nine names on its Leaders list. Each of those Leaders has an annotated daily and weekly chart to help users find the right time to buy and the best time to sell to lock in gains and minimize losses.Autodesk jumped past a 131.20 buy point in a three-month base that can be viewed as a double bottom. Last week, the stock briefly surpassed the 119.34 entry in the double bottom. Add 10 cents to the middle peak between the two lows to locate the traditional buy point.Autodesk's sales grew 16% to $553.8 million, posting its best top-line results in more than four years.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

The leader in for-profit education for China's fast-growing middle class inched up on Wednesday, but more importantly, the large-cap consumer spending play continues to hold near a 36.26 buy point in a new four-month cuplike base.TAL, which has a relatively limited float of 182 million shares, has performed exceptionally well since it initially cleared a 12-week perfect cup with handle at 13.07 on Jan. 19, 2017 (adjusted for a 6-1 stock split later in the year). On that day, the stock vaulted 7.4% in very heavy volume and sprinted past the highest price within the downward-slanting handle within the base. Add 10 cents to a handle's high to find the exact buy point.To see that exact breakout, MarketSmith offers excellent easy-to-use historical charts that allow users to go back decades in time.On the day of TAL's January 2017 breakout, the correct buy point was 77.93, a dime above the handle's high, before the big stock split. In the handle portion of the base, TAL fell just 5% to 74.06. The handle indicates the final shakeout of remaining uncommitted shareholders before fresh new institutional demand comes in to lift the stock and spur the breakout to new highs.Since that breakout, TAL has advanced 200%.Over the same time period, the S&P 500 has gained as much as 27%, excluding dividends.TAL grew its revenue 39%, 38%, 43% and 68% over the past four years. In the fiscal year 2017 ended in February that year, the top line was $1.04 billion, hitting the billion-dollar level for the first time.The Street sees earnings rising 14% to 32 cents a share in FY 2018 (which just ended in February), then leaping another 62% to 52 cents in FY 2019 on revenue increases of 63% to $1.7 billion and 52% to $2.59 billion, respectively.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 2.3% to $61.14 a barrel despite reports that weekly U.S. crude oil inventories came in higher than expected at 2.4 million barrels, suggesting continued strong domestic output. In the prior week, inventories were higher at 3.0 million barrels.Bond traders have been conducting relatively quiet trading, at least from the view of U.S. Treasury long bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood at 2.88%, relatively unchanged for the past two sessions and seven basis points below the year-to-date peak of 2.95%.The CME Fed Watch tool for analyzing fed funds futures currently shows no significant change in the probability that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates four times by December. The probability that the fed funds rate will hit a 2.25%-2.5% target range is 34%. This means the majority of bond traders see just three increases of a quarter point each for 2018, with the first one coming up after the Fed holds a two-day meeting on interest rate policy on March 20-21.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on top growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and other financial markets.)RELATED:Hot IPO LeadersDo You Know How To Spot This Money-Making Bullish Stock Chart Pattern?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWill More Hot Growth Stocks Begin Forming This Key Pattern?Autodesk Shines After Its Q4 Results

110,ADBE,"The stock market reversed lower in afternoon trading Wednesday, in another sign that volatility and uncertainty remain issues for investors.X The Nasdaq erased moderate gains and was down 0.6%. Semiconductor stocks performed worse than most sectors, weighing on the technology-heavy composite.The S&P 500 reversed to a 0.2% loss and was pulled back just as it tried to rise back above its 50-day moving average. The Russell 2000 was up 0.1%. Volume was lower compared with the same time Tuesday.

The Dow had climbed back above its 50-day moving average before gains receded.Some of the 30 stocks in the average are trying to rally from their 50-day lines.

118,ADBE,"Having a growth strategy has paid off well for American Century All Cap Growth Fund (TWGTX) since the start of the 2009 bull market. And the fund's early purchase of its largest holding Alphabet (GOOGL) in early 2009 might have something to do with it beating the S&P 500 since then.X The $1.2 billion fund is up 4.09% this year through Feb. 22, ahead of S&P 500's return of 1.41% and its large-growth Morningstar category's 4.12%. The fund also has returned a stellar 20.75% in the past year, plus average annual returns of 10.42% and 14.22% in the past three and five years, beating the S&P 500 for the one-year, but slightly lagging it for the other periods.The fund recently changed managers. Gregory Woodhams, senior vice president and co-chief investment officer of American  Century's global growth equity, and Joe Reiland, vice president and portfolio manager, took over the fund's management as of Feb. 16. Before that, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott comanaged the fund for the past nine and six years, respectively.American Century All Cap Growth strives to invest in companies that show continuous accelerating earnings growth and a strong price momentum. While it can invest in companies of all sizes, over 70% of its holdings fall into the large-cap category, 25% comprise midcap stocks, with the remaining allocation in small caps. It primarily invests in U.S. stocks, but had a less-than-5% allocation to foreign equities as of Dec. 31.Last year, the fund benefited from the risk-on rally that began shortly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2016. Growth stocks were lifted on expectations of President Trump's stimulus package for individuals and businesses, a solid earnings season and overall economic strength.Stock selection played a large role in the fund's performance in 2017, as much on the positive as the negative side. Its top-10 holdings represent 37% of the fund and include names such as Alphabet, IBD Leaderboard member Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Mastercard (MA) and FedEx (FDX). These stocks soared between 33% and 53% last year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmong the fund's largest sectors are technology at 30% of the portfolio, consumer cyclical 17%, health care 15% and financials 12%.

The maker of GoToMeeting, OpenVoice and join.me also recently announced it will acquire cloud-based phone system provider Jive Communications and Unified Communications. Shares of LogMeIn advanced 20% last year. The stock is 13% off its Feb. 15 all-time high, having sliced through its 50-day moving average after the company reported 94% gain in earnings that beat expectations, but was light on revenue.Within the software space, creative design program maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) and customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com (CRM) also did well, each jumping 70.2% and 49.3% last year, and 15.3% and 12% year to date. Adobe, which successfully transitioned to cloud-based recurring subscription services recently announced that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring. The maker of Photoshop and Acrobat plans to grow its e-commerce business.

Its stock is up 8% so far in 2018 after advancing 19% last year.The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank SVB Financial reported accelerating earnings and sales growth in the last five quarters. In the most recent quarter, earnings per share rose 53% on revenue growth of 32%. The stock rose 36% in 2017 and 5% this year.Among key detractors to American Century All Cap's performance in 2017 were biotech stocks such as Shire (SHPG), where despite reporting good results, ""investor concerns over competitive threats to the company's hemophilia franchise weighed on the shares,"" notes the latest fund annual report. Shire's stock fell 6.3% last year.Natural gas producer Range Resources (RRC) also was a drag on performance due to unfavorable weather conditions and gas prices. The stock declined over 50% last year and has continued its slide this year.RELATED:What's Will Danoff Into These Days?What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

139,ADBE,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 rose Wednesday morning after the major averages rallied from morning losses for a third straight gain on Tuesday. Inflation data before the open could be a big market mover.X The market is not in a confirmed uptrend, but here are software stocks to consider for your watch list: Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Paycom (PAYC), Workday (WDAY) and LogMeIn (LOGM).As for the overall stock market, the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite have now climbed for three straight days. Over the next several days, the major averages could confirm a new market uptrend. But corrections often have short-lived rally attempts, followed by renewed selling.

Microsoft arguably is a buy. LogMeIn is setting up in a cup-with-handle base with earnings on tap Thursday. All are highly rated: Adobe Systems, Paycom and LogMeIn have best-possible 99 Composite Ratings. Workday has a 97 Composite Rating. The Composite Rating is an overall score for stocks based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. All-time stock winners often have CRs of at least 95 near the start of their runs.Microsoft's CR is just 89. That reflects a lackluster 67 EPS Rating, but investors have rewarded the software maker for its rapid growth in cloud computing.All five stocks have relative strength lines at or near highs. The RS line — the blue line in the charts below — tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market will go next.

Read the Stock Market Today columns and The Big Picture to keep you in sync with market trends and turns.Microsoft stock rose 0.8% to 89.83 on Tuesday after reclaiming an old 86.30 entry and its 50-day line on Friday. But is that buy point still valid? Microsoft erased an 11% gain from the entry during the market sell-off. Normally, a stock that round-trips a double-digit gain means that the entry no longer applies. But given the stock's relatively strong performance in the correction it would be understandable if investors bought it in a hypothetical confirmed market uptrend.Adobe stock edged up 0.7% to 193.48 on Tuesday, reclaiming a 186.37 entry on Friday. The stock hasn't closed below its 50-day line during the recent market correction.Workday advanced 0.9% to 116.63 on Tuesday after moving back above a 114.98 entry on Monday. Shares tested their 50-day line last Friday but rallied for a gain that day.Paycom shot up 5.2% to 88.90 on Tuesday, back above an 86.20 entry point. Paycom had sold off during last week's tumble, but didn't quite fall enough to invalidate the entry point.LogMeIn rose 1% to 125.95, closing in on a 128.45 handle entry. Shares tested their 50-day lines last week but never closed below that key support.On Thursday, LogMeIn is expected to report an 87% earnings-per-share gain to $1.16. Revenue should spike 216% to $278 million, in large part due to LogMeIn's merger with former Citrix Systems (CTXS) unit GoTo.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Now Face These Key TestsSeveral Key Earnings Due, But Market May Swing On This: Action Plan Why The Stock Market Sold Off — And What You Should Do NowThese New Highs Hint At Shift To QualityHubSpot Swings To A Profit; Revenue Beats, Guidance Above Expectations

But with the broader market still in a correction, all buys are riskier than usual. The ETF advanced 10% from a prior rebound off the 50-day in early January to its Jan. 29 intraday high. It was featured in this ETF column on Dec. 28.The $1.1 billion fund, which will mark its 17th anniversary in July, tracks the S&P North American Technology Software Index.

141,ADBE,"But gains for the major stock indexes faded Monday morning, but it didn't take long for buyers to back as indexes were near session highs in afternoon trading.X The Dow Jones industrial average led the way, up 1.7%. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 picked up about 1.3%. Small caps lagged badly early in the session but picked up the pace, with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%.Volume on the both exchanges was tracking well below Friday's levels. On the NYSE, advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by more than 2-to-1.The S&P 500 fell below the 200-day moving average Friday but found support, rallying 1.5% in higher volume. The NYSE composite and Russell 2000 showed similar action. The strong price action came after a robust rally Tuesday in higher volume.Gold miners and oil stocks outperformed. Steel stocks also fared well as President Trump's infrastructure plans came into more focus.The 10-year Treasury yield edged up 1 basis point to 2.86%, while U.S. crude oil futures added just over 1% to $59.88 a barrel.Big gainers in the Dow included Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), American Express (AXP) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), with gains of around 3%. Cisco's earnings report is due Wednesday after the close. It's holding support nicely above the 50-day moving average.In the stock market today, General Dynamics (GD) slipped 0.1% on news it's buying IT defense firm CSRA (CSRA) for $9.8 billion, including debt. Shares of CSRA surged 31% to 40.40.Inside the IBD 50, Adobe Systems (ADBE) picked up nearly 2%.

It gapped above the 50-day line after a failed breakout from a late-stage base with a 142.90 buy point.

Dow futures sank 0.6%.Those moves are off morninglows and far more modest than in the last couple of overnight sessions, but higher than normal in recent months.X The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow rallied into Tuesday's close for solid gains after another wild session, wi the Nasdaq reclaiming its 50-day moving average. Tech leaders Facebook (FB) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) found support at the 50-day and finished back in buy range.Facebook and Adobe Systems both boast best-possible 99 Composite Ratings. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary IBD ratings, including for earnings and other key fundamental and technical data. All-time stock winners often have CRs of 95 or above near the start of their runs.The market uptrend remains under pressure. Investors should be extremely cautious about buying any stocks and should consider taking profits in winners and being quick to cut losses.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.After-hours and premarket action do not always translate into trading for the next regular session. Stock futures fell sharply before Tuesday's open, and the major averages did tumble early, but eventually moved higher in a roller-coaster session.Facebook hit a record high of 195.32 on Feb. 1, above a 184.35 flat-base buy point. But shares tumbled with the market on Friday and Monday. The stock closed at 181.26 on Monday, just below its 50-day moving average.On Tuesday, Facebook fell to 177.75 intraday, but rebounded to close up 2.2% at 185.31 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Volume was 78% above normal, and was higher than in the prior two down days.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, has held steady at short-term highs and not far from the consolidation's peak.However, with stock futures lower, Facebook was down 0.55% to 184.30 in the premarket, suggesting the stock will again test its entry point.In related news, Facebook rival Snap (SNAP) surged late Tuesday on strong revenue and user growth, in what was the Snapchat operator's first truly upbeat quarterly report since coming public in March 2017.

Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Red Hat (RHT) and ServiceNow (NOW) have each surged more than 70% this year.Better yet, an ETF that holds these hot AI stocks could soon present a buy opportunity: iShares North American Tech-Software (IGV) is looking for support near its 50-day moving average.

146,ADBE,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

161,ADBE,"When putting together your watch list, focus on stocks with an 80 or higher RS Rating. Microsoft (MSFT) just met that criteria with a new score of 81. X IBD's proprietary RS Rating identifies technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks matches up against other publicly traded companies. Decades of market research reveals that the top-performing stocks typically have an 80 or better RS Rating in the early stages of their moves.Microsoft broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 74.52 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to take shape. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. In terms of fundamentals, Microsoft has posted three quarters of increasing earnings growth. Top line growth has also increased over the same time frame. The company holds the No. 3 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Desktop industry group. Adobe Systems (ADBE) is the top-ranked stock within the group.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Improved Technical Action?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

163,ADBE,"Is the IBD 50 trade war-resistant? Judging by the current composition of the list, one could argue, ""Yes, reasonably so.""More than a week after President Trump signed off on a 25% tariff on steel imports from most countries and a 10% hike in aluminum on March 8, the major indexes have taken it in stride. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are up since that day's close. The Nasdaq holds a nice cushion above its 50-day moving average.However, angst over the consequences of the protectionist trade strategy still hangs over the bull market. Will China and Europe retaliate? Which sectors could suffer the most if countries engage in tit-for-tat measures? Will the Scots and Brits really stop drinking Kentucky bourbon if prices skyrocket in the U.K.?No one knows. But in the IBD 50, very few of the companies making the list at the end of Thursday sell a commodity. Such physical goods appear to have a higher risk of getting punished by quotas or tariffs imposed by other countries. Warrior Met Coal (HCC) is the sole coal play in the list and sells in U.S., European, Latin American and Asian markets.In a November release on Q3 results, management expressed confidence it will remain a top exporter of high-quality metallurgical coal for the steel industry.""Strong sales volume coupled with high price realization and an exceptionally low cost structure enabled us to achieve strong free cash flow conversion,"" CEO Walt Scheller said in the release.

The latter is expected to boost its earnings 33% this year to $4.55 a share.Trump clearly cares about working class families that rely on a strong manufacturing and industrial base. That's good. But the U.S. economy is truly diversified. The savvy IBD reader recognizes that entrepreneurs deliver innovative new products and services that span a wide swath of industries.Take Casa Systems (CASA).

The Chinese social media giant has climbed 141% from a breakout at 58.89 in May 2017, but the stock's long-term uptrend remains intact.

171,ADBE,"The end-of-summer blahs and elevated geopolitical uncertainty took their toll on the stock market and stock mutual funds in August, which notched their first losses of the year.XAfter having fallen nearly 2% around mid-August, the broad stock market in the form of the S&P 500 rallied to close the month with a 0.31% gain. It was lifted by such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Visa (V) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as well as technology leader Grubhub (GRUB).Lagging, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 0.35% on average. Large-cap growth funds did best, tacking on 1.47%, while small-cap value funds did worst, losing 2.44%. ""Overall, investors generally treaded water in August,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""The good news pretty much offset the bad news. The market did not turn decisively either way.""The broad benchmark's modest gain extended the market's winning streak to 10 months. The S&P 500 edged up to an 11.93% gain year to date. U.S. diversified stock funds were left with a 9.05% year-to-date return.Mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD expect many of their opportunities for new gains to come from technology innovators and from ""quality"" companies — firms capable of churning out earnings growth even in a slow economic growth environment.Factors that heartened investors last month included a weak dollar, which boosted U.S. exports, said manager Daniel Strickberger, whose $211 million Touchstone Large Company Growth Fund (TSAGX) topped 95% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct in August. In addition, manufacturing showed strength, based on the monthly Institute of Supply Management report. Overall U.S. employment posted gains, though less than in July.""Retail sales and consumer sentiment were pretty good,"" Joy said.But negative factors included soft inflation numbers, which is a sign of tepid overall economic growth. The defeat of health care reform signaled that tax reform and infrastructure spending are uncertain, Joy said.And geopolitical tension involving North Korea contributed to investors' skittishness, Strickberger said.In addition, low inflation could help persuade the Federal Reserve to slow its interest-rate hikes. ""Interest rates are heading to where they were six to nine months ago,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 97% of its large-cap growth rivals last month. ""Over the long run, falling rates usually help utilities and hurt financials.""In contrast to U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, world stock mutual funds eked out a 0.84% gain in August. Latin American funds led that charge, rising 4.35%.Many investors sought safe havens last month. Taxable bond funds in general advanced an average of 0.51%. They were led by U.S. Treasury bond mutual funds, which gained 1.93%. Muni funds also advanced on average. And precious metals stock mutual funds topped sector fund categories, racking up a 6.10% advance.Despite August's market blahs, Ameriprise's Joy is guardedly optimistic going forward. U.S. economic growth remains muted but positive, he said. Global growth, at least in developed markets, is at its strongest since the recession. Many foreign central banks are continuing monetary policies that support stocks. And he expects large U.S. businesses to continue to benefit from a weak dollar through at least year-end.Model portfolios that Ameriprise recommends to its financial advisors' clients remain overweight in the technology sector, which in general still has room to run, Joy said. Those model portfolios' weightings in emerging markets stocks have also been boosted but are still underweight.China remains strong. Latin American economies are healing, he said.Fidelity's DuFour also sees attractive trends in the tech sector. Digital advertising, electronic payments and the growth of exchange traded funds (ETFs) ""are areas to get excited about,"" he said. He cited holdings as of July 31.A digital advertising name in which he had a stake was Adobe Systems (ADBE). Its business model has morphed. It used to sell its programs via computer disks through brick-and-mortar retailers. Customers would have to upgrade by buying new disks every few years.""They've evolved into software-as-a-service, where you pay on a monthly basis, and you've always got access to the latest version of a program,"" DuFour said.Once you create your digital product, Adobe also can monitor the online traffic it attracts and help clients manage online advertising campaigns. In addition, they have a commercial image library. That multiservice approach positions Adobe to benefit from the growth of digital media and online advertising, DuFour said.""PayPal (PYPL) is growing with the growth of electronic payments around the world,"" DuFour said. ""They have done a good job of increasing the number of places that accept PayPal, and they have a higher percentage of online transactions than physical store ones. As online commerce grows at the expense of physical stores, they are net gainers.""PayPal also owns Venmo, which is a payments service that lets users divvy up payments for shared goods or services. It is popular among millennials.S&P Global (SPGI) is poised to benefit from the growth of ETFs. The company has exited education books and ownership of Businessweek to focus on three areas in which the company provides data to clients. One of those areas consists of the indexes that customers like State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) license for the ETFs that they build and operate. ""S&P Global's business is very exciting and has very substantial margins,"" DuFour said.In other sectors, Touchstone's Strickberg cites Zoetis (ZTS) as ""the sort of quality, predictable growth company we like. We want companies that will prosper whether U.S. GDP growth is 0% or 3%,"" he said.Roughly half of sales by the developer of animal medicines and vaccines are for livestock rather than pets. Commercial agricultural sales don't fluctuate much in economic ups and downs. That steadiness makes it ""the kind of business we look for,"" Strickberger said.The $9.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX), a large-cap growth fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, edged up 0.36% last month. It owns ASML Holding (ASML), a Dutch maker of lithography systems used to create computer chips. Shares have climbed 39% this year.The stock has a very strong 98 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.IBD'S TAKE: ASML's A SMR Rating means the semiconductor equipment maker is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula. Buying stocks with high SMR ratings at proper buy points increases your chances of investment success.  RELATED:Here's An Easy Routine To Get You Started In Stock InvestingWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Some Investors Turns More Defensive Even As Market Rises Again

174,ADBE,"The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all hit record highs during the week, but they ended little changed. Apple (AAPL) fell sharply amid iPhone and Apple Watch concerns while oil prices topped $50. The Federal Reserve will start paring its balance sheet and stuck to its hawkish plan for raising interest rates, pushing Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks toward buy points. Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced a big defense takeover.The Dow industrials rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 index edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq dipped 0.3%, after all three major averages hit record highs during the week. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed. Apple was a drag on the major indexes but oil stocks rallied with crude futures while bank stocks climbed on a hawkish Fed and rebounding Treasury yields. Some recent breakouts, such as Apple and Tesla (TSLA), faltered during the week. Several other stocks topped buy points, but not by much and in light volume.Crowds were light for the iPhone 8 as it went on sale Friday, confirming reports of light pre-orders, as many customers await the high-end iPhone X due Nov. 3. Apple admitted that its cellular-enabled Apple Watch Series 3, which also went on sale Friday, has connectivity problems. Apple shares fell 5% to 151.89, below a flat-base buy point of 156.75 and its 50-day line.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google announced that it will pay Taiwan-based HTC $1.1 billion to acquire and staff assets to make Pixel smartphones.

Policymakers also stuck to their plan for four interest-rate hikes by the end of 2018, including one more this year. That raised market odds of an increase by December. Treasury yields continued their rebound, helping Citigroup (C), Bank of America and other big banks hit or near buy points.RELATED: The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltNorthrop Grumman (NOC) announced it would buy Orbital ATK (OA) for $7.8 billion in cash and assume $1.4 billion in debt. That comes out to $134.50 a share for Orbital. The acquisition will give Northrop key missile-defense assets as Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for the Boeing (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The deal could even help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and will be a test case to see if the Trump Administration and Pentagon still have concerns over the size of prime contractors.RELATED:Why The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop GrummanOPEC and noncartel members did not extend or deepen production cuts at Friday's meeting, but a move for increased monitoring and other steps hinted that production would not soar in 2018. Crude futures rose above $50 a barrel earlier in the week on Iraqi hints of extended output curbs, and they closed above that key level. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 4.59 million barrels in the latest week according to the Energy Information Administration, more than expected.

Alnylam spiked 52% Wednesday after reporting strong late-stage data for a rare-disease drug, prompting rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) to plunge 8.8%. Adamas, on Tuesday, hit a 20-month high after announcing it will charge $28,500 per patient per year for its Parkinson's drug, Gocovri. Aerie, though, dipped to a three-week low after the FDA set a committee review date for its glaucoma drug, Rhopressa.

177,ADBE,"February's stock market performance serves as a reminder that volatility can still take a bite out of market leaders like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). After a stunning 2017 in which everything worked, the market entered January with aggressive buying, sending the major indexes to all-time highs.X But February started with a shocking reversal. The market experienced its first correction, defined as a 10% drop, in two years. The S&P 500's 10.2% decline was as swift as it was dramatic. It lasted just nine days, ending Feb. 8. But the damage was done.Despite bouncing back the last three weeks, the benchmark ended the month down 3.89%. It's first monthly loss since March 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.3% in February, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 3.61% according to Lipper Inc. Surprisingly, S&P 500 Index funds beat the index by 18 basis points, down 3.71%, according to Lipper.General domestic taxable bond funds average a loss of 0.8% in February and were down 0.75% year to date.""The past month has been a snapback of the previous month,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds. In January investor sentiment turned aggressive, especially in technology, buying went a little too far too fast, Hackett said. Then at the beginning of February it reversed, partly triggered by the specter of rising interest rates.""It was indiscriminate selling,"" said Hackett. ""Even the names you would think of as safe havens didn't work because people thought of the defensive stocks, like telecom and utilities, as bond proxies and sold them. The fact we had a correction is not the slightest bit unusual and actually a healthy thing. You get a pressure valve release, so things don't get overheated and people don't get too complacent.""David Joy, the chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said he wasn't surprised the market recovered quickly, ""because there was no change in the fundamental outlook. We think the economy will be quite strong and that we're going to get growth close to 3% this year.""The February bounce back came because of two events from Washington, the spending bill and tax reform, which combined should increase gross domestic product over the next two years by 50 basis points, said Lawrence Kemp, the portfolio manager of the BlackRock Capital Appreciation Fund (MAFGX). The fund was up 6.75% year to date going into Friday vs. the S&P 500's return of 0.49%, according to Morningstar.""That's positive for additional money for the consumer to spend and for corporations to invest and to increase dividends and buy back stock,"" said Kemp. ""It's a very positive tailwind regarding U.S. fundamentals and for very strong earnings growth.""We're overweight in technology,"" said Kemp. ""Financials will benefit from a rising rate environment.""Among the fund's top 10 holdings are five technology stocks, Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline Group) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).His top financial picks are Visa (V) and Bank of America (BAC). He also said he thinks the health care sector and consumer discretionary stocks will do well this year. He likes UnitedHealth (UNH) and Constellation Brands (STZ), a beer and wine company.Hackett and Joy agree that technology and financials are likely to do well. Other technology companies to look at are the ones repatriating income back to the U.S., such as Apple (AAPL), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).As for financials, they say look at the large money center banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).  They both also see potential in late-cycle winners like industrials. This would include Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX)) and 3M (MMM).The names that were down because of interest rates have not bounced back nearly as much. Hackett said real estate is down 9% year-to-date, telecom is down 8% utilities are down 7% and consumer staples are down 7%, Names that were defensive and that you would expect to perform well in a volatile period to perform have not and are not viewed as defensive but as interest rates sensitive, and are suffering because of that.""We're also constructive on the international markets,"" said Joy. ""We like equity market in most parts of the world, developed and emerging, as there is a global recovery. There are not too many countries where the economies are not expanding. You still get very accommodative central bank policies in Europe and Japan and cheaper valuations.""""Even with huge upside in the U.S., we think foreign markets are one of the best places to be at this point, with the dollar weakening, the rest of the world lags the U.S. by two or three years,"" said Hackett, who said optimal international equity exposure would be 40%.RELATED:See What Leading Stocks Are Driving This American Century Growth FundNew To Stock Investing?

180,ADBE,"The popular Super Bowl commercial laid out a tongue-in-cheek crisis in the future of AI. Amazon.com's (AMZN) digital assistant Alexa loses her voice. What to do in a world dependent on artificial intelligence in business and at home?X Enter a series of stand-ins, including actor Anthony Hopkins, who goes into creepy Hannibal Lecter mode and unnerves the people he's supposed to help. Thankfully, Alexa recovers her digital voice and restores order. AI proves its value.Corporate America is on the cusp of a plunge into this future of AI in business. And giant technology companies — which stand to benefit by both harnessing their own artificial intelligence applications and helping other companies make the leap — are immersed in it now.Artificial intelligence innovations are well along at Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Alexa, found on Amazon's Echo devices, is just one example. Digital aides like Google's aptly named Assistant on its Home smart speaker and Apple's Siri on its Home Pod can help with shopping, entertainment, school work and other tasks.Tech companies also are busy at work on deploying AI in self-driving cars. And companies ranging from giant IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) to a wave of startups are competing for talent and technology so they can cash in as AI spreads to non-tech enterprises.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportOutside Silicon Valley, companies are dipping a tentative toe into AI. Surveys show that most companies plan to evaluate how artificial intelligence can make them better, whether in making sales forecasts, automating tasks now done manually, improving existing products or enabling new ones. Budgets could more than triple in the next few years.""There's a lot of interest and experimentation; companies are still in the proof-of-concept, project phase,"" said Nicholas McQuire, vice president of enterprise research at CCS Insight. ""We'll see more deployment in about one or two years.""Artificial intelligence software programs — essentially computer algorithms — analyze huge amounts of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes.Companies are developing AI software that could save lives through early cancer detection. Other projects might someday thwart a cyberattack.Banking, retail and health care are among the sectors pushing into AI with pilot projects. Conversational ""chat bots"" are popping up on company websites, answering questions and improving customer service.Walmart Stores (WMT) harnesses AI to optimize inventories and supply chains by predicting future demand and reordering stock. Monsanto (MON) uses artificial intelligence to identify the most promising molecules in bioengineering. John Deere (DE) expects AI to reduce chemical spraying volumes in farming. And shale oil producer Devon Energy (DVN) uses AI to guide drilling gear.IBD's Take: The so-called FANG stocks are leading the way in AI in consumer apps and cloud computing. Learn more about Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google at IBD's FANG stocks news page. To keep up to date on the latest in artificial intelligence, bookmark our AI trends and news page.There's more. Banks see the future of AI in detecting money laundering and fraud. Manufacturers see AI as helpful in scheduling equipment maintenance. In health care, AI could predict diabetes and other diseases before they develop and identify the most promising treatments. A new algorithm from Google can help predict heart disease via retinal scans.In e-commerce, marketers expect AI tools to personalize website content to spotlight products or services that each online shopper is most likely to buy and to target ads more effectively. The telecom, oil and gas, media, entertainment and agriculture industries also are expected to embrace AI in their business.""A lot of companies see AI as transformational, but maybe not quite yet,"" said Jeff Cotrupe, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan.Industry disruptions and AI-based business models are off in the future.""The enterprise has been a bit slow,"" said Aditya Kaul, research director at Tractica. ""Many companies are still in the early stages of understanding what is AI, what problems can be solved, what is possible.""IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on AI hardware, software and services will jump to $58 billion by 2021, up from just $12 billion in 2017.""AI is not a budget line-item at this stage,"" said CCS's McQuire.JPMorgan estimates that AI will account for 1.8% of global enterprise IT budgets by 2021. Though still small next to, say, the 8% spent on cybersecurity, that would be up from a scant 0.3% in 2016.An AI spending boom would boost growth at enterprise software firms, cloud computing providers and IT service providers such as Microsoft, IBM, Accenture (ACN), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle.""The AI killer app has emerged: cost savings,"" Brent Bracelin, a KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent note to clients. Aside from customer service, he says many time-consuming, back-office tasks  such as human resources, finance and accounting will be automated with AI.One key to the future of AI will be to make it easier for companies to forge ahead with artificial intelligence projects, say analysts. Salesforce.com, AT&T (T) and Google are among those seeking a faster track for AI in business.AT&T, with an open-source software project, aims to make developing AI predictive tools as easy as building a website.  Working with IT consulting firm Tech Mahindra, AT&T has launched an open-source artificial intelligence software project with the Linux Foundation.""There is some confusion that doing AI is very expensive if you look at the R&D budgets of Google and Amazon,"" said Kaul. ""But you don't need billions of dollars to get AI projects started. There is open source software — it's a big trend within AI — that helps companies build their own solutions.""Salesforce.com has a mantra to help customers build AI tools ""with clicks not code."" That means companies don't need their own programmers to write algorithms that can find patterns or make inferences from sales data.Salesforce has a line of tools it calls Einstein that use a company's historical lead and account data to predict which deals are more likely to close.""What companies need is the ability to apply AI to their business. There's not a lot of off-the-shelf AI, like Salesforce's Einstein,"" said CCS Insight's McQuire. ""But technology is advancing quickly. We're going to see a lot more technology that helps companies automate the creation of custom AI models, which will speed up the market.""McQuire says nearly 60% of companies surveyed by CCS Insight are testing or studying AI. One problem is that high-tech companies are willing to pay much higher salaries for AI specialists, which increases their expenses.If they lack in-house expertise, McQuire says many companies are turning to cloud computing vendors — Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google — to get a head start.Cloud computing vendors aim to provide AI-as-a-service. Companies can run artificial intelligence apps on powerful computers rented by the hour to crunch massive quantities of data.""All the public clouds are fighting over who has the best AI platform,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a report.Google is focused on providing cloud customers with tool kits for ""machine learning,"" one type of AI. Google's AI tools enable cloud customers such as a hospital radiology department to focus computer vision algorithms so they can spot lung cancer.Many midsize or large companies lack internal technology staffers who can build AI-powered apps. That gives information technology services firms such as Accenture and IBM an opening as companies look to develop custom AI apps, says Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair. IBM, which has focused its Watson AI platform on health care, is moving into new markets such as digital marketing.Wall Street analysts anticipate that AI tools will be integrated with existing big data, business intelligence and industry-specific enterprise software. Kaul says many industries are still in the early stages of digitizing records handled as paperwork. Once that data is available, AI tools can go to work to help deploy AI in business.""Although Google, Facebook (FB), Baidu (BIDU), Apple, Microsoft and Amazon may have taken early advantage of their large data sets and established platforms, enterprise  software vendors like SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce are gradually embedding AI into their offerings,"" said the JPMorgan report.Software companies pushing into AI include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Coupa Software (COUP), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), HubSpot (HUBS), Splunk (SPLK) and Workday (WDAY).The fact that most non-tech companies need a helping hand getting into artificial intelligence also provides an opportunity for startups pushing into the enterprise market. Among them: Sentient Technologies, DataRobot, Clarifai, Algorithmia, Affectiva and SpaceKnow.At this early stage of AI in business, corporate America is using what's called ""machine learning"" for the most part as opposed to more complex ""deep learning."" With ML, algorithms are trained to create predictive models or identify patterns. ML helps predict what a particular customer is likely to buy or detects insurance claims fraud.Tech companies use machine learning to personalize web content and other tasks. But they also are plowing ahead in applying deep learning, which mimics neural networks in the human brain, for classifying images and other purposes. Self-driving cars will require deep learning to map their surroundings and detect hazards.Technology giants are in an AI arms race. They're funding or acquiring startups and paying super-salaries to hire AI computer scientists.Amazon isn't stopping at Alexa-powered digital assistants. Its Amazon Go retail stores use computer vision and AI to do away with cashiers.Apple uses artificial intelligence software for facial recognition in the new iPhone X. And Apple is developing AI health care mobile apps.For Facebook users, AI lurks behind the scenes, playing a central role in what advertisements or news they see. And at Netflix (NFLX), programming recommendations are getting better as software algorithms are trained to identify movie matches.What sets the tech giants apart is commitment. For them, the future of AI is now.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai makes a point to show this. On earnings calls and tech conferences, he now calls Google an ""AI first"" company.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?No. 1-Ranked Stock With 118% Growth Breaks Out With Earnings DueBirth Of An Industry: Early Investing  Hot Spots In Artificial IntelligenceIt's An AI Arms Race: What China Has To Offer Vis-A-Vis U.S.

181,ADBE,"A solid concentration in top-performing stocks, including Facebook (FB,) Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC), and a strong fund management team have helped Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX) beat the S&P 500 and its large-growth Morningstar category in the past one, three and five years.X Those leading stocks, along with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), account for nearly a fifth of the $30 billion fund's assets.Since its inception in 2003, New Insights has been managed by the legendary Will Danoff, who ran it identically to its widely followed $134 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX). In 2013, John Roth, who also manages $8 billion Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock (FMCSX), joined as co-manager, bringing with him his midcap expertise. Since late 2015, Danoff and Roth have been splitting the management of the fund 60%-40%.The fund focuses on companies that have strong growth prospects, solid management teams and whose potential is misperceived by the public.""If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, video ... we're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer,"" Danoff told IBD.Having two managers may well be the reason why New Insights is more diversified at the top than Contrafund with top 5 holdings representing 17.3% vs. Contrafund's 24.1%. In addition, 26.7% and 37.9% of each fund's assets are in the top 10 holdings, further drawing the distinction.New Insight also holds nearly 10% more midcaps, is somewhat underweight technology and has a lower overweight in financials vs. the benchmark and its peers than Contrafund. Both sectors have been strong performers in the past several years.As a result, New Insight's performance has been trailing a bit that of Contrafund's, returning 22.91%, 11.89% and 14.35% the last one, three and five years vs. Contrafund's 27%, 13.45% and 15.92%. Both funds pulled back slightly in the recent, albeit short, market correction, but quickly recovered ground and are up 5.44% and 6.57%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 2.41% year to date.Regarding concerns that we're late in the economic cycle, Danoff notes the differences between now and conditions that led to bear markets like 2008-09.""The starting point (after the crisis) was quite drastic,"" said Danoff. ""So even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing their costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending. ... The world is much more global, U.S. companies are able now to sell their products all over the world and the big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive, so they're high margin, high growth and they're highly cash generative.""But it's not just the top hot stocks that determine a fund's longevity and strong performance. Other winning names include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), PayPal (PYPL), Visa (V), Estee Lauder (EL), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and United Health (UNH), each of which soared between 40% and 87% last year, compared with the S&P 500's 21.8% return.Netflix, which the fund has owned since early 2015, has been benefiting from a strong international momentum for its brand and stronger-than-expected subscriber additions in the U.S. and overseas."" Netflix is crushing it overseas,"" said Danoff. ""They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding and it's a subscription model offering great value.""The top name for creative design programs, Adobe has successfully transitioned to a recurring revenue model by moving its product lineup to the cloud. Last month, the company said that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring, though he'll stay on until they find a replacement. Adobe's earnings jumped at least 40% in each the past four quarters, while revenue increased 22% to 27%. The company also raised its fiscal Q1 and 2018 guidance after adjusting for President Trump's tax cuts. Adobe's stock is up 12.5% year to date.Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder has been experiencing strong growth. Its most recent Q2 results saw a 25% EPS rise on sales that grew 17%, primarily driven by strong advances in its skin care product lineup. Analysts expect the company to grow its market share from a current 15% as the company further builds out its e-commerce business. It also stands to benefit from the recent tax reforms. The stock is up 9.8% this year.Customer relationship software maker Salesforce.com (CRM), which rallied 49.3% last year and has risen 6.6% so far in 2018, stands to benefit from a growing product offering and low customer attrition despite strong competition in the sector. The company earnings accelerated in the past two quarters, jumping 63% in the most recent one. Sales grew 25%. Salesforce.com also raised its 2018 sales guidance to $12.5 billion and plans to reach $20 billion by fiscal 2022. Earnings guidance was also upped. It is due to release its next earnings report Feb. 28.In the midcap arena, the fund holds names such as Under Armour (UA), U.K.-based Metro Bank and LogMeIn (LOGM). The fund bought Under Armour last quarter as a starting position and Roth says they'll continue to work on it going forward.""It's a great brand, the stock got to be pretty expensive and expectations were pretty high, they struggled a bit and they got massively re-priced, the Street turned on them and investors turned on them, and then it became an interesting opportunity. ... The ultimate bet is that brand's still good.""RELATED:In A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course?

182,ADBE,"Major indexes remained moderately lower in late-afternoon trading Thursday in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to begin reducing its massive bond and mortgage holdings. Volume is running lower on both exchanges vs. the same time Wednesday.XThe Nasdaq composite paced the downside, down nearly 0.4% around 3 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials sank 0.2%. The latter two indexes are still on track for a mild weekly gain.The S&P SmallCap 600 was virtually break-even.Apple (AAPL) dropped another 1.5% to 153.78 to follow Wednesday's 1.7% slide. That day, the iPhone giant closed below the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than two months on news that there may be some glitches with its phone-connecting new-generation Apple Watch.A drop back below Apple's newest buy point from an 11-week flat base at 156.75 is certainly disappointing for new shareholders. But such pullbacks are not unusual, especially given the slowdown in the market's current uptrend.Longer-term holders can watch to see if Apple will hold near the 50-day and 10-week moving averages or perhaps form a new base on top of the latest flat base pattern.Apple remains up 30% after breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9.Autohome (ATHM) fell more than 3% to 63.02; volume exceeded 900,000 shares and is on track to top its 50-day average turnover of 1.03 million shares.While the point drop is likely to be the largest on a daily basis since the Chinese auto website's breakout past 36.11 in early May, the stock is not necessarily triggering a sell signal. For starters, the stock is holding well above the 50-day moving average. And in fact, a new base may be forming.Watch for a potential flat base, which must be a minimum five weeks or 25 trading sessions on a daily chart, to form. Autohome clearly has seen resistance near 68.Autohome, which scored $888 million in 2016 sales, up 62%, sports a top-notch A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) from the IBD Stock Checkup tool.Adobe Systems (ADBE) fell for a second straight day following a good quarterly report, but limited its losses as shares fell less than 0.3% to 149.52, not far beneath the 50-day moving average.The digital marketing and graphics software giant had reported a fourth quarter in a row of 40% or more EPS growth (+45%, +42%, +44% and +47%), which clearly makes it more challenging to continue to increase earnings at such a rapid rate. Plus, the current P-E ratio at 38 times 12-month trailing earnings is nearly double that of the S&P 500. However, data from IBD sister company William O'Neil + Co. show that the current price-to-earnings ratio is still below its five-year peak of 60.Analysts see profit in the November-ending fiscal fourth quarter rising 29% to $1.16 a share on a 21% increase in sales to $1.95 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Did you know that the flat base, which reflects an unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares, often serves as a launchpad for big breakouts and tremendous price gains for many growth stocks?

The stock is trading just below a 175.59 buy point in a very tight, flat base.Tesla shed nearly 2% at the open after Jefferies initiated coverage on the stock with an underperform rating and a price target of 280 —  26% below its current level.Among IBD 50 stocks, organic LED maker Universal Display (OLED) narrowed to a 3% gain after popping 5% at the stat of trade.

The first quarter number was revised downward to -$113.5 billion. Consensus views had projected the second-quarter balance at -$115.1 billion.Import and export prices both increased 0.6% in August, according to Labor Department estimates.

186,ADBE,"Microsoft (MSFT) saw a welcome improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Monday, with an upgrade from 79 to 83. X This proprietary rating measures market leadership by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that identifies how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks matches up against other publicly traded companies. Over 100 years of market history reveals that the best stocks tend to have an RS Rating of over 80 in the early stages of their moves.Microsoft is still within a buy zone after climbing above a 72.99 buy point in a flat base. The proper buying range is up to 5% above the initial entry. Once a stock hits that benchmark, it's best to wait for it to set up another buying opportunity.. In terms of revenue and profits, the company has posted rising EPS growth over the last three quarters. Sales growth has also risen during the same period. The company holds the No. 3 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Desktop industry group. Adobe Systems (ADBE) is the No. 1-ranked stock within the group.RELATED:Stocks With Rising Relative Strength RatingsWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

187,ADBE,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Thursday after the major averages closed  up Wednesday but well off intraday peaks. The Nasdaq added an eighth distribution day, this one for stalling.XIn a choppy market, with the uptrend under pressure, some stocks will continue to have successful breakouts. Vantiv (VNTV) has powered ahead while Apple (AAPL) is hitting all-time highs. Vantiv, a payment processor, is extended from a buy point while Apple is still in range. But for a savvy investor, you want, to paraphrase ""The Hunger Games,"" for the odds always to be in your favor.S&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.1% vs. fair value while Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.1%. Dow industrials futures were a fraction higher.Salesforce.com (CRM) rose 1.7% on Wednesday to 92.24, just clearing a 92.09 buy point in volume that was just above average. Ideally you'd like to see trading activity rise sharply, reflecting institutional buying. Still Salesforce looks positively flush with volume next to Adobe Systems (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), Electronic Arts (EA) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Adobe Systems rose 1% to 151.82, just clearing a three-weeks-tight entry at 150.50. A three-weeks tight offers a chance for existing buyers to add a few extra shares. But Adobe, which has been a big winner in 2017, rose Wednesday on volume 45% below normal.Microsoft rose slightly to 73.65 on Wednesday, after retaking a 72.99 buy point on Monday, following a decent rebound from the 50-day line last Friday. But trading volume continues to dry up, suggesting little enthusiasm by deep-pocketed mutual funds.Electronic Arts rose 1.55% to 119.25 on Wednesday, in volume that was 33% below average. Electronic Arts retook a 116.14 flat-base buy point on Monday, in volume that was slightly below normal.Wal-Mart has edged higher for three straight sessions, retaking an 80.57 cup base buy point on Monday. Monday and Tuesday volume was light. Wednesday's suddenly spiked, but the stock really didn't move — up 0.3% to 80.96.A 0.5% cushion over the buy point is fairly threadbare heading into Wal-Mart's second-quarter earnings report Thursday morning.Investors shouldn't rush into cash. The market rally is still valid. But you should be extra cautious about buying stocks in the current market, and extra quick to take profits and cut losses.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Stall; Does That Threaten Market's Bounce?These 5 Techs Are Near Buy Points In This Classic Bullish PatternThese Two Global Retail Giants Will Deliver 1-2 Punch: Investing Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

189,ADBE,"With the Nasdaq composite breaching the 50-day moving average amid geopolitical uncertainty, here's a look at five top tech stocks within the big-cap Nasdaq 100 that are finding support at that key level.Netflix (NFLX) has been under pressure after Disney announced plans to cut ties with the streaming service in 2019 in favor of its own over-the-top platform. Shares on Thursday threatened a round-trip from a flat-base entry at 166.97, which coincides with the 50-day line, but the stock rebounded Friday, climbing 1.3% to 171.40.Microsoft (MSFT) also shot higher Friday, rising 1.5% to 72.53, after testing support at the 50-day line Thursday. Shares are now less than 1% below a buy point of 72.99 that was initially cleared several days before the company's July 20 earnings report.IBD'S TAKE: Stock research taking up too much of your time? We make it easy for you in several ways. Our Leaderboard is a curated a list of strong growth stocks with actionable trading opportunities, complete with annotations. MarketSmith screener tools allow you to filter stocks based on a variety of metrics. And on our Stock Lists page, you can find sector leaders, stocks hitting new highs and more.Celgene (CELG) is back within the 5% buy range from a 127.74 entry initially cleared on June 21. The stock dropped almost 4% Thursday, hitting the 50-day line, but edged 0.2% higher Friday to 130.61.Activision (ATVI) and Adobe (ADBE) are both well extended from their last base breakouts. But Activision is just below an add-on, three-weeks-tight entry at 63.29 as it finds support at the 50-day line. Adobe is pivoting higher from its 50-day line as well. Looking at a weekly chart, it's Adobe's fourth test of the line since its January breakout.RELATED:Earnings Preview: How To Play These 2 Dow Retailers In, Near Buy RangeStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

190,ADBE,"Ah, those sociable humans, they're always up to something online — texting, tweeting, messaging, Googling.HubSpot (HUBS) Chief Executive Brian Halligan says he's staying on top of all that, and making it work to his company's advantage.X""We are really watching the way the marketplace and humans are changing, and building products to match that,"" Halligan said on a recent company earnings call.HubSpot is an 11-year-old maker of sales and marketing software based in Cambridge, Mass., and it sells to small- and midsize businesses. Its own pitch is that potential customers — aka those sociable humans — find businesses through digital channels like blogs, internet search engines and social media. HubSpot's expertise lies in attracting people to websites and optimizing content so that visitors are converted into paying customers.Its mantra: Help customers create more personalized interactions with their prospective buyers to close the deal. The strategy has helped HubSpot see its revenue shoot up 38% to $171 million in the first six months of 2017. Shares are up 52% this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2018 revenue growth to slow to 25% from 34% this year. HubSpot could beat those earnings estimates if new initiatives gain traction, says Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen & Co.""Their rate of growth has come down. Marketing tech in general is a tough market to scale. It's fragmented with lots of small vendors. So to come out as a single winner and take a lot of market share has been challenging,"" said Wood, who has a neutral rating on the stock.Further, HubSpot's main challenge is maintaining a sales growth rate that will support its valuation.HubSpot has evolved into a multi-product company — adding sales automation and customer relationship management (CRM) software. Many of HubSpot's customers have 10 to 50 employees, with some in the low hundreds. Analysts say HubSpot targets firms with up to 2,000 employees.The company has focused on the midmarket as opposed to competing head-on for large corporate accounts vs. the likes of Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM), SAP and Adobe Systems (ADBE). That way HubSpot has avoided the cost of investing in its own sales staff to chase down and close deals, says Wood.""What's different about these guys is the focus on midmarket. They have to keep the new-customer growth engine going. They're looking at new ways to acquire customers,"" said Wood. ""Also going into new markets, like they're doing with sales force automation and CRM, is going to drive growth. But I don't think you'll see them go upmarket into (larger) enterprise (firms).""HubSpot's customers mostly engage in business-to-business marketing. They buy online subscriptions to software that ranges from $2,500 to $30,000 annually. The average marketing customer spends about $13,000 a year.HubSpot also has laid claim to what it calls ""Inbound Marketing."" Halligan and co-founder Dharmesh Shah wrote a book on using Google, social media and search-friendly blogs to attract customers via the internet. HubSpot sells tools that track the online activity of website visitors and personalize content as their interests are identified.Halligan says people are spending less time texting, emailing back-and-forth, or searching on Google. Instead, Halligan says, they're using messaging platforms more, including Slack, in the workplace.And, humans consume tons of video. So HubSpot helps its customers evaluate video platforms such as Facebook (FB) Live for marketing purposes.""If you look how people spend their day, they're spending an awful lot of time on social media,"" Halligan said on the earnings call. ""There are big shifts going on, and HubSpot's going to be there to help our customers through it.""HubSpot has used Twitter (TWTR), Facebook and Instagram to build its own follower base. In late September, HubSpot will host its annual ""Inbound"" user conference to rally the troops.Still, there's more to HubSpot's marketing than social media engagement. HubSpot has built up sales channels, such as website design and marketing agencies, that point people toward its products. About 40% of revenue comes from customer-referral channels, says Wood.HubSpot aims to borrow some techniques from Intuit (INTU) and Autodesk (ADSK), which have successfully targeted accountants and architects, as partners. HubSpot aims to partner with sales agencies. HubSpot also works with industry players. HubSpot has growing ties to Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn and its sales tools.IBD'S TAKE: HubSpot has formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern with a buy point of 76.20. The stock is hovering near its 50-day moving average. Alarm.com, Realpage, and Appfolio have the highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, of companies in IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group.The company also provides help in integrating its software with Salesforce.com's bigger platform. And, HubSpot's tools work with e-commerce payment platforms such as Shopify (SHOP).HubSpot recently rolled out a $50 monthly marketing starter package. New visitors to its website are greeted with offers for free versions of HubSpot products. After using free versions for a while, or ""freemiums,"" the company figures users will upgrade to paid products.""If you roll the clock forward two, three, four years, that's just the way I think humans are going to buy products because they're going to want to try it and use it (first),"" said Halligan on the earnings call. ""This freemium thing is going to be here to stay.""Indeed, HubSpot has added two new board members — one from software firm Atlassian (TEAM) and one from data storage provider Drop — both of which use freemium business models.HubSpot has more than 34,300 customers, up 40% from a year ago, with roughly 27,000 of them buying marketing tools. Average revenue per customer has been falling, however, due to the lower-priced offers.Nate Cunningham, a Guggenheim Securities analyst, says HubSpot has a ""greenfield"" opportunity to target small companies that never bought marketing software. He says HubSpot needs to improve operating margins as it adds customers in new ways.""The No. 1 determinant of HubSpot's growth is probably not competitive displacement, to gain share vs. Salesforce or IBM,"" said Cunningham. ""It's more about how can they get people to try their product who never have had a marketing product before. I think greenfield is where the bulk of the opportunity is.""HubSpot had over 5,000 ""Growth Stack"" customers as of June 30, up from 3,000 at the start of the year. These high-spending customers buy more sales, CRM and marketing software tools. And, they're more likely to renew subscriptions annually as opposed to leaving.Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair, says HubSpot is on the right track.""We believe HubSpot's customer growth is a good indication of the health of the business,"" he said in a note to clients, ""and provides significant up-sell and cross-sell opportunities longer term, which we believe could ultimately lead to an acceleration of the business as soon as next year.""Shares of HubSpot have been in decline while forming a deep handle, but were up 2.2% at Friday's close to 67.35.RELATED:This Education Company Reaps Newfound Disposable Income In ChinaAd Tech Firm Does Bidding For Customers, One At A TimeBiotech Finds Its Stride With Kidney Cancer Treatment

191,ADBE,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations. But, as IBD reported, analysts see a potential slowdown in its stronger full-year outlook.After pulling back Thursday and Friday, shares were up 10% for the year.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)

193,ADBE,"Digital media and marketing software maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) received several more price-target increases to its stock on Thursday in the wake of its beat-and-raise fiscal second-quarter results late Tuesday.XAdobe stock got price-target increases on Wednesday from at least four Wall Street firms, with the most bullish being Piper Jaffray, which kept its overweight rating and raised its target to 180 from 160.Adobe ended trading down 0.4% to 143.69 on the stock market today. On Wednesday, Adobe hit a record high of 147.45.On Thursday, Morgan Stanley maintained its equal-weight rating on Adobe, but raised its price target to 150 from 137. CFRA stuck with its hold rating on Adobe, but upped its target to 152 from 129. Baird reiterated its outperform rating and increased its price target to 160 from 140. And Canaccord Genuity stayed with a buy rating and hiked its target to 165 from 145.IBD'S TAKE: Adobe stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it has outperformed 98% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Adobe, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Q2 saw continued strong execution in the core top-line growth engines of the Adobe story — additions to the annual recurring revenue (ARR) base for Digital Media again exceeded expectations, while revenue growth in the Digital Marketing business trended higher,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a note to clients. ""Current targets for fiscal 2017 look quite conservative.""Adobe is benefiting from its shift to a cloud-computing business model for its creative software, which includes programs like Photoshop and Illustrator. It also is riding a growth curve for its digital marketing business, analysts say.""We call Adobe one of our secular buy 'compounding' stocks, which means that investors should rationally expect Adobe shares to roughly double within a five-year window,"" Canaccord analyst Richard Davis said in a note to clients.RELATED:Adobe Stock Hits Record High On Beat-And-Raise Earnings Report

194,ADBE,"XAdobe Systems (ADBE) shares spiked to a record high on Wednesday following the company's beat-and-raise fiscal second-quarter report released late Tuesday.Adobe was up 2.4% to close at 144.24 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, it hit an all-time high of 147.45.The digital media and marketing software maker received at least eight price-target increases from Wall Street analysts after the report. Of those eight, five were from analysts with buy ratings on the stock and three were from firms with neutral or sell ratings.Piper Jaffray was most bullish, raising its target to 180 from 160. Pivotal was most bearish, reiterating its sell rating, but upping its target to 114 from 112.San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe earned an adjusted $1.02 a share, up 44% year over year, on sales of $1.77 billion, up 27%, for the quarter ended June 2. Analysts had expected 95 cents and $1.73 billion.For its fiscal third quarter, Adobe expects to earn an adjusted $1 a share, up 33% year over year, on sales of $1.815 billion, up 24%. Analysts were modeling for 97 cents and $1.8 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Adobe stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it has outperformed 98% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Adobe, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""We've got great products and a market tailwind where everyone is trying to digitally transform their company and that is benefiting both the creative side of the business as well as the digital marketing side of the business,"" Adobe Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett told Investor's Business Daily.He also credited the company's solid strategy and strong execution for its outperformance of late.For its full fiscal year, Adobe expects its total revenue to grow about 23%, up from its prior forecast of 20% growth, given in December. Analysts on average were targeting 22.4% sales growth this fiscal year.""The foundation of the Adobe Cloud Platform and integration across both Creative and Marketing Clouds sends a highly differentiated message to the market as none of the company's competitors can tie the two worlds together so completely,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk said in a report.

195,ADBE,"After a ho-hum 2016, $12.1 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is having a hi-ho 2017. The fund's 2.62% setback last year badly lagged the S&P 500's 11.96% gain. It trailed 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. But its 21.24% gain this year going into Thursday more than doubled the big-cap bogey's 10.32% return and trumped 89% of its direct rivals.XThe fund's rally reflects the market's shift away from defensive, low-growth staples-providers and higher-dividend stocks, which dominated for much of last year, to the sort of higher growth stocks that the fund favors. Fund co-manager Patrick Burton — on this job since early 2013 — says leading technology stocks in particular have been buoyed by market-share gains and strong earnings. Burton and lead manager Justin Kelly are with subadvisor Winslow Capital.Reflecting that market tilt, the fund has been boosted this year by such holdings as Alibaba Group (BABA), which is up 66%. The fund also holds graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 46% this year. Digital-media and marketing-software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) is up 39%. Biomed Celgene (CELG), which is up 14%, is a fast grower in health care.""Alibaba is the No. 1 player in e-commerce in China,"" Burton said. It is benefiting from the shift to mobile devices. Gross sales are still growing rapidly despite its size. And Alibaba Cloud, like Amazon Web Services, is growing very fast, he says.Nvidia is benefiting from a shift toward the use of graphics processing units (GPU), away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, Burton says.Adobe is shifting from selling software licenses to annual subscriptions. ""Customers churn less and buy more"" under that model, Burton says.Celgene stock is up due to a combination of decent earnings and attractive valuation ""since biotech has been under pressure for a couple of years,"" Burton said.Over the past 10 years, the fund's 8.18% average annual gain topped 72% of its rivals. Winslow's Kelly has been at the helm since late 2005.The fund aims to navigate through various market phases by adjusting its allocations among three types of growth stocks.One bucket holds stocks that the managers see as long-term, sustainable earnings growers. The second bucket holds quality cyclical growers, which may be more volatile. And the third holds stocks in newer industries with rapid growth.Visa (V) is a sustainable grower. Its takeover of Visa Europe boosts economies of scale and leads to better coordination of global marketing campaigns, Burton says, adding, ""It's a really steady Eddie, consistent grower.""Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is one of the fund's cyclicals. They supply radio frequency filters for Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Chinese cellphones. ""What's changing is that they are moving into other products that need wireless applications like Tesla (TSLA) (cars),"" Burton said. ""They are pushing to get involved in the internet of things.""ServiceNow (NOW) is a new-industry stock, which is expanding from IT management for clients into new areas like cybersecurity and human resources.Celgene, whose cancer drug Revlimid is its flagship, is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. The group is ranked No. 8 among 197.Wall Street expects earnings per share to climb 23% this year. Pretax margin last year of 50.4% was its highest in at least nine years.IBD'S TAKE: You can check out more of Celgene's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Illumina (ILMN) and Netflix (NFLX) were new additions to the fund's portfolio in the second quarter.Illumina is a leader in low-cost gene-sequencing equipment. Burton said, ""We believe Illumina will demonstrate an accelerating growth profile over the course of this year and next, driven by the launch of its new gene-sequencing instrument, Novaseq. We believe this acceleration will drive upside to (analysts') consensus (earnings) estimates.""Netflix returned to the portfolio after being sold. Its EPS rose 50%, 71%, 114% and 567% in the past four quarters.Netflix is facing increasing competition from Hulu and stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN) and YouTube-owner Google (GOOGL) — both also owned by MainStay Large Cap Growth. Netflix's drivers are its original programming and global expansion, Burton says.RELATED:MainStay Large Cap Growth Sees Market Tilting Toward Its Favorite Types Of Growth Stocks

196,ADBE,"Indexes came off session lows and turned solidly higher, looking set for a third-straight market advance.X The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.6%. All remained below their 50-day moving averages.The Dow transports were up 1.1%, as logistics and airline industry groups showed relative strength. Some retail, building products, metals and education stocks also outperformed.The Nasdaq got some lift from software and e-commerce stocks, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index came back to break-even.Paycom Software (PAYC) jumped back above the 50-day moving average in active trading, a bullish move after the stock grew volatile after Paycom's Feb. 6 earnings report and volatility also rose in the general market. Shares are back above the 86.20 buy point as well, but an uncertain market and a past sell signal make this new entry suspicious.The cloud-based human resources software company raised its stock buyback by $100 million, and KeyBank upgraded Paycom to overweight from sector weight.Many leading stocks are finding support after pulling back around the 50-day moving average. That normally puts stocks in new buy areas, but investors must weigh a couple of factors.First, only the first or second pullback after a base breakout is where these opportunities exist. Second, the buy areas must be above the buy point of the breakout. Also, the market outlook trumps all buy and sell decisions, and with the market in a correction, it's a bad time to be adding stocks.In the IBD 50, Weibo (WB), Nvidia (NVDA), Skechers (SKX), Total System Services (TSS) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) are some making good rebounds from their 50-day lines and are worth watching.Weibo beat profit expectations this morning. Chip leader Nvidia suffered a shakeout as the market started to slide last week, but has been recovering and has been steadier since Thursday's earnings report. Adobe has been added this week to IBD Leaderboard.IBD's TAKE: An easy way to find buy points is to check the chart analyses in the IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 lists published in IBD Weekly. Buy areas are noted at the bottom of each chart.Paylocity Holding (PCTY) fell 2% in big volume. The stock has triggered the 7%-8% sell rule after a breakout past a 50.62 buy point failed.Brighthouse Financial (BHF) continued a steep decline, dropping to its lowest price level since September. The company, which was spun off from MetLife (MET) last year, has tumbled below its 50-day line, another bad sign.RELATED:Weibo Earnings, Revenue Top; Parent Sina Reports Strong Top-Line GrowthSolarEdge, SunPower Set To Report Earnings As Industry StrugglesApple Entering Post-Supercycle Era, But iPhone Installed Base Still Growing

197,ADBE,"Big-cap techs Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are all well-known S&P 500 index components ended last week within 2% of buy points. But that doesn't mean they're all equally enticing. Nvidia broke out on Monday to a new high, but even that chip leader has some question markets.XApple outpaced the S&P 500 from May 2016 to May 2017, but since then has been moving with the market, lagging in the past couple of weeks. Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe Systems and Salesforce.com have a more recent history of S&P 500 outperformance than Apple. Unlike Apple, they significantly outperformed the market in the last week as they built the right side of bases.Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce are all the No. 1 stocks in their industry groups. Then again, so is Apple.Nvidia, PayPal and Adobe are all members of the IBD 50. PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce.com are also on the IBD Big Cap 20.Apple closed Friday at 175, less than 1% from its 176.34 flat-base entry. Apple's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been slumping for the past two months. Apple rallied 3.4% last week, but that wasn't much better than the S&P 500's 2.6% gain and even with the Nasdaq's 3.4% rise.Apple shares fell 0.4% to 174.35 on the stock market today, as the major averages rallied once again.The RS line is actually below where it was last May, when Apple was last significantly outperforming the S&P 500.Apple briefly broke out past the buy point on Dec. 18, but just barely and on volume that was only slightly above normal. The RS line wasn't close to confirming the breakout. Shares quickly fell back until finding support near their 50-day line.Apple could easily retake its buy point in the near future, and that move could work. But the odds of success are lower than with a truly leading stock.Nvidia jumped 3.1% to 222 Monday in strong volume, clearing a 218.77 cup-base entry.Nvidia's RS line is still lagging somewhat vs. its prior high. You'd like to see that RS line confirm the breakout.Keep in mind that Nvidia is a late-stage base. Late-stage bases are more likely to fail.Nvidia shot up 11.3% to 215.40 last week. It crossed its 50-day moving average in heavy trading on Wednesday, offering an entry point for aggressive investors.Chip stocks, which had struggled in late 2017, are roaring back. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index popped 5.8% last week, with several chip stocks moving back above their 50-day lines and carving the right side of bases. Chip stocks rose modestly overall Monday.Nvidia will have a presence at the CES 2018 tech show in Las Vegas this week. Nvidia on Sunday, in a pre-CES event, said it is teaming up with Uber on self-driving cars and expanded an artificial Volkswagen (VLKAY) partnership announced in mid-2017.Nvidia is already involved in several significant autonomous driving initiatives with various automakers and tech companies.IBD'S TAKE: Check out this Investor's Corner or on how the 50-day moving average or 10-week line offers buying opportunities.PayPal climbed 6.9% last week to 78.70, 1% below a 79.48 flat-base buy point. PayPal retook its 50-day line on Wednesday, but volume was only 11% above normal.PayPal rose 0.4% to 79.05.Leading stocks' performance is closely tied to their industry groups. And payment stocks are once again acting well. Square (SQ) moved back over its 50-day line Friday after a big retreat. Mastercard (MA) broke out past a buy point during the week, but on below-average volume.Adobe Systems advanced 5.8% last week to 185.34, less than 1% from a 186.37 flat-base entry. Adobe also reclaimed its 50-day line, but on below-average trade.Adobe dipped 0.2% to 185.04.Salesforce.com rose 5.7% to 108.10 last week. That's about 1% from a 109.29 entry in a flat base. Salesforce moved above its 50-day on Tuesday, but in average volume.Salesforce climbed 0.7% to 108.86, advancing to 109.14 intraday.One more observation on Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce. After running up so much last week, these stocks — and the overall market — are ripe for a pullback. That would not necessarily be a bad thing. Ideally, the stocks will ultimately break out in heavy volume, moving convincingly past the buy points to let their RS lines confirm the advance.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Alibaba Leads 5 Top Chinese Stocks Setting Up In BasesAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesStocks To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top Funds?The Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018

198,ADBE,"What's going on with the stock market? After more than a year of gradual to solid gains, investors suddenly discovered that stocks can go down, sharply.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite saw more than a week of heavy selling in whipsaw action, breaking key support lines and leaving them 10% off their highs as of the Feb. 8 market close. Leading stocks crumpled under selling pressure.But despite the breathless coverage of ""record losses"" for the Dow, the stock market has not had some historic meltdown. After an unusually calm 2017, the major averages are in the midst of their biggest pullback in years — and pullbacks and corrections are normal parts of healthy markets. The market has now moved into a correction.The major averages has rallied for past three sessions and was on track for another gain on Wednesday. That's encouraging, but investors should look for further evidence before assuming a new market uptrend is underway.Here's an in-depth analysis of recent stock market action and how you should respond as an investor.The stock market hasn't crashed, though you might not know that from the news. But its losses signaled a change in market direction for the immediate term.After several months of gradual, steady advances, stocks rose sharply for the first few weeks in 2018. The Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rose about 8%, with Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and energy stocks among the big winners.That followed a strong 2017 with few hiccups in the stock market. Investors became complacent with the stock market rising and never suffering a bad loss. Up until Jan. 30, the S&P 500 index hadn't fallen 1% or more since last August. The market hadn't had a cumulative pullback of even 4% since the presidential election. Eventually that had to change.One big change affecting the market is interest rates, which have climbed sharply in 2018 to multiyear highs in the U.S. and around the world as economies have picked up steam.A surprising jump in U.S. wage gains intensified concerns about inflation and the likelihood of a more aggressive Federal Reserve. This week's congressional budget deal that boosts federal spending sharply — on the heels of the big Trump tax cuts — pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to a four-year high of 2.88%. The 10-year bond had ended 2017 at 2.41%.The Dow and other major stock market indexes hit record highs on Jan. 26. The S&P 500 was already up 7.5% in 2018, with the Dow industrials up 7.7% and the Nasdaq 8.7%. Amazon and Netflix had sprinted 20% and 43%.But on Feb. 1, IBD switched its stance on the market direction from confirmed uptrend to uptrend under pressure. The market had finished mixed that day after an up-and-down session. That followed a few mild distribution days — days with selling in above-average volume — since the market top.IBD'S TAKE: Staying in sync with the market direction is one of the most important things an investor can do. Investor's Business Daily lets readers know at a glance what the current state of the stock market is. The Market Pulse graphic in The Big Picture column lets you know if the market is in a confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure or a correction. Subscribers also can find the market direction arrow clearly displayed on the Investors.com home page.Meanwhile, more leading stocks showed weakness. Alibaba (BABA) tumbled on earnings, while several other top China internet stocks struggled as well. Homebuilders and RV makers, two leading groups that began to sell off sharply near the stock market top, continued to slide. Yet there were still some new breakouts.That switch in market direction was a clear warning sign for investors. Market direction is critical and lets you know whether you should be looking to buy stocks, take profits or move to cash. In a confirmed uptrend, most stocks are likely to rise and leading stocks are more likely to deliver huge gains. In a correction or bear market, even top-rated stocks find it hard to make headway. When the market is under pressure, breakouts may occur but are more likely to fail, and other leading stocks struggle.On Friday, Feb. 2, the January U.S. employment report showed that average hourly wages rose 2.9%, the biggest annual gain since 2009 and much higher than expected. That pushed yields even higher, raising the odds of a more aggressive Fed just as Jerome Powell took over as chairman from Janet Yellen. Meanwhile, Apple led a sell-off in the broader iPhone ecosystem on its weak handset sales and current-quarter guidance. Fellow Dow stocks Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) plunged on earnings.Stocks sold off significantly, including the Dow's ominous 666-point tumble, capping the worst weekly percentage losses in two years for the major averages.The next Monday, Feb. 5, stocks plunged in violent action. Talk erupted about the Dow falling 1,175 points, its biggest point loss ever. But that point loss reflects the fact that the Dow is so much higher than it was in prior drops, such as in 1987 or 1929. In percentage terms, the Dow's 4.6% fall was the biggest since August 2011, but only the 25th largest since 1960. For perspective, the Dow plunged 22.6% in its Black Monday crash on Oct. 19, 1987.Still, that Feb. 5 loss was significant. The S&P 500's 4.1% drop was also the worst since August 2011, while the Nasdaq composite's 3.8% was its biggest since the post-Brexit-vote sell-off in June 2016. On a technical basis, the market undercut important support areas. The major averages all fell through their 50-day moving averages, along with many leading stocks. Laggard Apple (AAPL) undercut its 200-day line.The stock market had clearly worsened since Thursday, Feb. 1. The market's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, skyrocketed to multiyear highs. Psychological indicators like the VIX are secondary market gauges to the major averages and leading stocks, but can be contrarian signals. When fear hits extreme levels, it's often a sign of at least a short-term bottom. IBD left the market direction at uptrend under pressure.The stock market went on a wild ride Tuesday, in part because of volatility related to VIX-related products. Stocks sold off sharply intraday but closed higher. The Nasdaq and some leading stocks retook their 50-day lines.But one good stock market day isn't meaningful. In fact, most of the best percentage gains in history are in the midst of deep corrections or bear markets.On Wednesday, stocks whipsawed again, and this time closed lower as a renewed rise in Treasury yields spooked investors again. The Nasdaq fell back below the 50-day line while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials found resistance there. Chips, energy and some China stocks were notable losers.On Thursday, shares opened higher but quickly turned lower as Treasury yields moved back to recent multiyear highs. The Dow Jones fell 4.15%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 undercut Tuesday's intraday lows. Leading stocks reeled. After a week of negative action, most stock breakouts from the last several weeks had failed while longer-term winners were slashing gains and falling through support areas.This combination of negative action triggered a shift to an outright market correction, signaling that investors should move to the sidelines. At Thursday's close, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials were 10% off their highs, the traditional level for a correction.On Friday, big swings continued. The Dow tumbled intraday through its Tuesday, Feb. 6 low, joining the other key indexes. The S&P 500 index briefly undercut its 200-day average for the first time since mid-2016. But the major averages then rebounded strongly, closing with gains of 1.4%-1.5%.Even with that gain, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell just over 5% for the week, their worst performance in two years.For a return to a confirmed market uptrend, the major averages must rebound over several days, with at least some strong gains in heavy volume. Friday's rally was encouraging. But as Tuesday's rebound showed, one good day isn't enough.The major averages rose more than 1% on Monday, closing above their Friday intraday highs, passing an early test. Stocks rose modestly on Tuesday, rebounding from morning losses.On Wednesday, the major averages opened lower on hot inflation data. But stocks soon reversed higher, even as the 10-year yield hit 2.90%. The Nasdaq composite rose more than 1% in afternoon trading, moving back above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones advanced more modestly, still below that key support level. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index fell sharply. Look for a rally attempt to be confirmed by one or more price gains in heavy volume in at least one of the major averages.The Dow industrials get a lot of popular attention, but the index represents only 30 stocks. The broader Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index are usually the gauges you should focus on.Another confirming sign of a market uptrend will be if leading stocks break out of bases into buy zones. If there's nothing to buy, the market may be telling you it's too soon to return.Some leading stocks were entering or reclaiming buy points or hitting new highs by Wednesday.Back in December and at the start of the new year, IBD explained why stock market gains in 2018 could be smaller than in 2017, with more corrections during the year.The S&P 500 rallied 19.4% last year, double the historical norm. It was one of only 19 times that the index had returned more than 15% since 1962. After such a strong year, stocks typically rise but not as much. In only one of the 19 cases was there a stronger gain (1997), while there were only four times when the next year was negative. The average gain was 7.5%.Meanwhile, few signs indicate a bear market is looming. Bear markets are typically associated with a recession. That seems unlikely in the near term, with economic growth strong across the globe for the first time in several years.While bond yields are rising as a result, inflation is still low. The Federal Reserve aims to raise rates toward more normal levels. But the Fed, like other central bankers, does not want to unnerve financial markets.Earnings are robust, with more S&P 500 companies beating profit views than at any time since 2009. Companies are hiking 2018 earnings forecasts on the new Trump tax cuts.Some people say we're due for the nine-year bull market to end, but stock market cycles don't follow a set calendar. Bear markets typically are preceded by a sharp ascent. Good examples include the tail end of the dot-com rally in early 2000 and the housing bubble run-up to 2007.While January 2018 was a strong month, for much of last year the major averages were just grinding higher. And there were few climax runs in leading stocks. Square (SQ) exhibited some climax-like characteristics, but that stock was turbocharged as part of the Bitcoin climax top in December.Another harbinger of a bear market — big year-over-year increases in margin debt — also is relatively low. However, the rise of double- and triple-leverage ETFs means that margin levels may not reflect speculation and investor exposure as well as before.If the market had moved into a full-blown bear — often defined as stock market down 20% or more — you'd see sustained heavy selling, breaking through multiple support areas in heavy volume. Rebound attempts would be short-lived. The vast majority of stocks would fall, with leading stocks breaking down en masse.Pay attention to the market by following the major averages and leading stocks. IBD's daily market analysis, including the Stock Market Today articles and The Big Picture, will keep you in sync with the S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq as well as top stocks and groups.Don't fight the stock market. Most stocks move with the market, so a correction is a time to sell stocks and move to the sidelines.For those determined to stay invested, you should probably take at least partial profits. Follow sell rules. If a stock falls 7% to 8% below your buy point, just sell. Don't let stocks that had run up 10% or more turn into losers. Remember, if you get out and a stock bounces back, you'll get another chance to buy — or you'll have capital for another quality stock.Keep in mind that these rules apply to individual stocks. When it comes to diversified mutual funds and ETFs, long-term investors may take a different approach. Whereas specific stocks might not bounce back in the next upturn, the broad market eventually will recover. Investors can use market pullbacks and corrections to add to holdings of diversified funds.Still, there is a way for fund investors to reduce losses and capture gains in the next upturn through market timing. The ETF Market Strategy uses the current market direction in IBD's Market Pulse feature to determine when to buy and sell a broad stock index ETF like PowerShares QQQ (QQQ).When the stock market clearly resumes an uptrend — whether it's next week or months from now — you want to be ready.  The market can turn very quickly. When a new rally takes hold, the first leading stocks that break out often turn out to be big uptrend winners.So stay engaged with the stock market. This is a great time to build a watch list. Buying right solves most of your holding and selling problems.Look for highly rated companies with strong and rising relative strength lines. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. If the market corrects or moves sideways, these stocks may set up in bullish patterns and be leaders in the next uptrend. Good examples of top stocks with RS lines at or near record highs include Adobe Systems (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW) and AbbVie (ABBV).For more help finding quality stocks, check out IBD's premium products Leaderboard and Marketsmith.You can also look for stocks that found support at their 50-day line and didn't give up too much ground.A great place to find potential stocks to watch during a downturn is via IBD's stock lists, including the IBD 50, the Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders.Keep editing your watch list during corrections. Some stocks that hold up well initially will break down, while others will begin to outperform.When everyone is bullish, nobody wants to sell but there are no longer many people left to buy. That's why excessive bullishness can mark at least short-term tops. Markets rise on a wall of worry. They need investors coming off the sidelines and buying stocks. So a dose of fear in investors is healthy.Pullbacks and corrections clear the decks and set the stage for a new strong uptrend. Leading stocks can set up in bases, and you can buy these first movers when the major averages confirm the new stock market rally.The original version of this story published on Feb. 8.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:When To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains

Volume was about average. You want to see at least 40%-50% above-normal trade when a stock breaks out. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks the stock vs. the S&P 500 index, was well below its Nov. 1 high. In fact, the RS line has not made much headway since late July.On Thursday, Facebook dipped 0.2% to 184.33, dropping just below its buy point.Obviously, Facebook could easily retake that entry area on Friday.

207,ADBE,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages to record highs helped by Trump tax cut momentum. Bitcoin futures had a successful launch on the Cboe Global Markets (CBOE). Walt Disney (DIS) agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox (FOXA) while also launching ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" The Federal Reserve raised rates while the FCC repealed net neutrality. Adobe Systems (ADBE) had strong earnings and guidance while Oracle (ORCL) missed on cloud revenue and cloud guidance.X The Nasdaq rose 1.4%, the Dow industrials 1.3% and the S&P 500 index 0.9%, all hitting record highs Friday as the GOP finalized its tax legislation with apparently enough support to pass. The Federal Reserve offered few surprises. Media stocks were in focus with Disney buying most of 21st Century Fox and the GOP-led FCC rolling back net neutrality.Bitcoin futures on the Cboe (CBOE) got off to a strong start, trading at their best levels on Friday amid typically volatile moves for the cryptocurrency. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion.

Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers.

Bluebird Bio (BLUE) soared Monday after it reported improvement in patients using its LentiGlobin therapy to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Fellow CAR-T player Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), though, retreated nearly 22% in two days despite strong data in patients with a form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Investors wanted more data, analysts said. On Tuesday, GlycoMimetics (GLYC) rocketed on data from its drug in acute myeloid leukemia, but Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) sank following its presentation of its sickle cell disease drug.

208,ADBE,"Workday (WDAY) stock fell Tuesday after Citigroup downgraded the enterprise software maker, which is removing guidance on its billings as it adopts new accounting rules.Workday late Monday reported fourth-quarter revenue and profit that topped expectations and forecast full-year fiscal 2018 revenue slightly above views.Workday announced it adopted a new revenue recognition standard, known as FASB 606, a full year before required implementation. Workday said it is the first software company to adopt FASB 606, which makes revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.""Management took away billings guidance for future periods and is making further changes to the sales force to incrementally focus on midmarket,"" said Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst in a report. ""Both these could cause investor angst and we look at midmarket as a lower-return market vs. enterprise. The company is adopting 606 early, which will bring quarterly revenue backlog disclosure with a likely realization in Q1 that annualized backlog grew slower than total.""Morgan Stanley analysts noted: ""Unfortunately, early adoption of FASB 606 and the withdrawal of billings guidance results in lack of clarity on the near-term growth trajectory.""Shares of Workday sank 8% to close at 82.93 in the stock market today, tumbling well below a buy point of 88.10.IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Western Alliance Bancorp, and Broadcom are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the 606 rule takes effect in 2018 or fiscal 2019. It will affect many companies but likely will have the most impact on businesses with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue, contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks, or third-party sales distribution channels.FASB 606 is the biggest change in accounting standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Workday, like bigger Salesforce.com (CRM), has a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model and customers buy renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time software licenses.Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Splunk (SPLK) are among software stocks that are transitioning to SaaS but still have considerable licensing revenue.Some analysts downplayed Workday's removal of billings guidance.""We believe that the removal of billings guidance only represents a temporary gap in transparency and expect the company to give further metrics around contracted revenue on the 1Q earnings call,"" said Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst in a report.Justin Furby, a William Blair analyst, said in a report: ""Management elected to discontinue providing billings guidance, as 606 drives an even bigger disconnect between billings growth and future revenue growth (it can now recognize revenue ahead of invoicing for ramped deals).""RELATED:Workday Swings To Profit, Revenue Outlook Bullish, But Stock FallsWorkday Stock Pops, Signs Wal-Mart In Its Biggest Deal EverThese 4 Software Stocks Are In Buy Range Right NowMeet The 'Fastest-Growing' $1 Billion Enterprise Software Firm

214,ADBE,"Salesforce.com (CRM) aims to more than double its annual revenue to $20 billion, but its shareholders might settle for a different, near-term goal: better stock performance after a disappointing 2016, marked by its first earnings miss in several years.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com seems on track to hit $10 billion in revenue in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2018, bolstered by numerous acquisitions. It's expected to end up with revenue of roughly $8 billion for its fiscal 2017 ending Jan. 31, up from just more than $1 billion as recently as 2009.Salesforce.com stock fell 12.6% in 2016, after hitting an all-time high of 84.48 in May, but it's up 15% in 2017, rising a fraction to near 78.73 in the stock market today.What's preventing Salesforce.com's from hitting $20 billion or of being a 2017 comeback stock?In both cases, Microsoft (MSFT) might be the better answer than Salesforce's two longtime top business-software rivals Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). Increased competition from Microsoft as it integrates business social media platform LinkedIn, acquired last month for $26.2 billion, continues to loom over Salesforce.com.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft is trading near record highs. For a look at companies hitting 52-week highs, listed according to Composite Ratings, regularly check IBD's New Highs list.It's not all about fighting Microsoft, though, says Andrew Bartel, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.""The real issue is what are the additional product categories that Salesforce.com can add that positions them for growth,"" Bartel said. ""Microsoft is a competitor, but there's more involved in Salesforce.com hitting that $20 billion target.""Salesforce.com's bread and butter remains its cloud software-as-a-service, sold under a subscription model and designed to helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. Software users track deals and manage client interactions.Microsoft, though, has been pushing into the cloud customer relationship management, or CRM, market itself, undercutting Salesforce.com's pricing.Analysts expect Microsoft to bundle more Office 365 and office productivity SaaS software with LinkedIn's enormous database and ""Sales Navigator,"" its sales lead and client interaction tools. Microsoft now can provide more products to help customers generate sales leads and close deals, analysts say.Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the Microsoft threat might not be overstated. In a recent research report, Weiss said Salesforce.com continues to add share at the high end of the CRM market. Microsoft, he says, has gained in great part with small and medium-sized companies, mainly at the expense of Oracle and SAP.Weiss says Salesforce.com's strength is its broad offerings that span sales automation, marketing and customer services.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says Salesforce.com's quest to the $20 billion revenue mark depends largely on share gains in marketing and customer services software, two areas where it can leverage its CRM customer base. Salesforce.com's $2.5 billion purchase of Exact Target in 2013 jump-started its move into marketing software.In marketing software, Salesforce.com's main rival is Adobe Systems (ADBE), but Pritchard expects Microsoft to make acquisitions as it aims to recreate the best parts of Salesforce.com.""We see the only way for Microsoft to make enough headway to be competitive with Salesforce.com — and this at the low end of the market — would be to acquire Zendesk (ZEN) and HubSpot (HUBS) — the only assets left with scale in customer service and marketing,"" Pritchard wrote. ""We expect the appetite to do this for the next 12 to 18 months is low, as Microsoft is likely focused on driving value from the purchase of LinkedIn before diving back into meaningful M&A.""Microsoft, though, already has something major that Salesforce rivals Oracle and SAP don't: a fast-growing cloud computing service branded Azure. With Azure, Microsoft is a leader in platform-as-a-service (PaaS), selling applications and software, including business management and database services, that run on cloud infrastructure.Salesforce.com last year selected Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services as its public cloud infrastructure provider. But the partnership could fray like the one-time close Microsoft-Salesforce.com relationship, analysts say. AWS leads in IaaS, infrastructure-as-a-service, with Azure No. 2.The battle between Salesforce and Microsoft is shaping up to be long term. both Microsoft and Salesforce.com are investing heavily in artificial intelligence. Salesforce.com debuted its ""Einstein"" AI initiative late last year.Salesforce.com aims to embed data analytics and ""machine learning"" into its CRM and marketing software, making it easier for customers to automate tasks. Microsoft launched its AI-based Dynamics 365 sales SaaS software late last year.While Salesforce.com has made at least nine AI-related acquisitions, Microsoft has gobbled up startups as well. And Microsoft's R&D budget, at $12 billion annually, is roughly 15 times that of Salesforce.com, estimates Pritchard.Salesforce.com doled out more than $4.6 billion in 2016 making acquisitions, including the purchase of e-commerce firm Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. At $2.8 billion, Demandware was Salesforce's largest acquisition. Salesforce.com has a cash balance of about $1.75 billion.Although Salesforce.com backed away from a Twitter (TWTR) purchase last year, concern lingers that any large deal would require a big chunk of stock that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders. The bear argument also says acquisitions might be artificially lifting bookings.""A clear management message that it will pause on large deals for the next 12 months … could go a long way in reassuring investors,"" said UBS analyst Brent Thill in a research report analyzing how Salesforce.com ""could be the turnaround story of 2017.""Morgan Stanley, in a report, said it expects ""more of the same"" from Salesforce.com, namely smaller ""tuck-in"" deals. In 2016, smaller deals included marketing data specialist Krux; business analytics platform BeyondCore; and Quip, a developer of a cloud-based word processing app that competes with Microsoft's Office.One startup that could interest Salesforce.com is Slack, says Forrester's Bartel.A list of the company's potential takeover targets, revealed in a resentation to Salesforce's board of directors, leaked in mid-2016. It included ServiceNow (NOW) and Pegasystems (PEGA) as well as much bigger rival Adobe Systems. ServiceNow's core business is software for information technology service management, or ITSM. ServiceNow has expanded into human resources, customer service and security.Salesforce.com last year shot down interest in Adobe, though there could be synergies. Adobe's Marketing Cloud is bigger than Saleforce.com's similar business and ""is expected to continue strong annual growth of 20% in revenue and 30% in bookings through 2018,"" said UBS' Thill.Aside from UBS, analysts from Canaccord Genuity, BTIG Research and Piper Jaffray also have called Salesforce.com, the leader in software-as-a-service, a top stock pick in 2017.Piper Jaffray and Drexel Hamilton, though, say Salesforce.com itself could be a takeover target. But Forrester's Bartel says the ""moment in time has passed"" for a Microsoft purchase of Salesforce.com. The pair reportedly broke off talks in May 2015.Salesforce.com has taken steps to stop relying on Oracle's database technology to run its business software. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, a 13-year Oracle executive before he left to start Salesforce, have exchanged numerous barbs over the years.In a Dec. 19 research report, though, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White says, ""Who is to say that Microsoft, Oracle or another large company would not be interested in acquiring Salesforce in the coming years.""RELATED:Salesforce.com Fiscal Q3 Beats, Sales Guidance Top Views, Shares UpMicrosoft Hits Record High On Bullish Reports

Fixed income ETFs saw $13.41 billion in net inflow last month, following the record $90 billion of fresh assets they gathered in 2016.Bartolini and Mazza suggest that truly exuberant ETF investors should consider allocating to ETFs which are tracking sectors that may benefit from President Trump's policies, such as real assets, oil and gas producers and regional banks.Other ETF investors may want to position for downside risk in the stock market and consider investing in gold, they added.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017These are among the year's best-performing ETFs in some key asset classes, screened for trading volume:First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted (QQEW) gives every stock in its underlying tech-focused, nonfinancial index an equal share of assets.

220,ADBE,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) has earned rave reviews for its successful transition to a cloud computing business model from the legacy business model of selling perpetual-license software.Under CEO Shantanu Narayen, Adobe has evolved from a provider of mostly desktop software for creative professionals (think Photoshop and Illustrator) to a full-service provider of digital media and marketing software and services.San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe is a key player for consumer-facing companies working to digitally transform their businesses. Adobe brings together content-creation tools with data insights — allowing companies to determine such things as which online marketing and advertising campaigns work best and how people are engaging with their content.After a five-year run-up to a record high of 111.09 on Oct. 24, Adobe stock has plateaued the past two months. It's stayed above its 200-day moving average since March, but has been tested at the 50-day support level since early November. Adobe stock closed Friday at 102.95, down a fraction.Narayen recently spoke with IBD about industry trends and his thoughts on the year ahead:IBD: How is Adobe helping companies digitally transform their operations?Narayen: When people think about digital transformation, among the things they think about is what's the customer journey and how do we map out that customer journey across all of the channels?Once we map out all of that customer journey across all of the channels, what's the segmentation of the customers that we're trying to target? And what are the campaigns we have to run in order to attract these customers? What's the experience they get when they interact with us?On the digital marketing side: enabling all of those digital experiences across all touch points — web, mobile apps, in-store devices. All of that is being delivered through digital marketing. But all of that content is being created through digital media.One of the things we say is: We're helping people make, manage, measure, monetize and mobilize that experience. The digital media side helps with the making and the managing in many ways, and the digital marketing helps in the monetization, measurement and mobilization of that experience.IBD: Is Adobe becoming more of a business intelligence company, helping enterprises make better decisions using all the data available nowadays?Narayen: We definitely believe that data is going to be more important. If you go back and look at why we bought Omniture in 2009, we said, ""We're going to be the Big Data company for marketers.""A big part of our technology agenda is all about: How do we normalize this data? How do we get insights from the data? How do we make it actionable for the enterprise to use that data in a pleasing manner for their customers?IBD: Where does Adobe's recently completed acquisition of advertising software platform provider TubeMogul fit in?Narayen: We have always been very bullish about video. For many years we have been saying that video is going to completely move to IP(internet protocol)-based networks.Adobe already has a leadership role on the video-content creation side with products like Premiere and After Effects. And we have a product called Primetime for the delivery and monetization of video content.IBD'S TAKE: The good news, Adobe ranks No. 1 in its industry group. The bad news, it's group ranks low. See what else you can learn about Adobe, or any stock, at IBD Stock Checkup.TubeMogul beefs up Primetime in that it becomes more of a one-stop shop for publishers and advertisers to monetize their video assets.IBD: You must be proud of the successful transformation of Adobe over these past few years.Narayen: I have to acknowledge and thank the incredible execution effort by Adobe employees. Externally, it has been written up as the textbook of transitions. Everybody now is trying to use our playbook. But it's the execution that sometimes gets taken for granted.We always had the right motivation, which is: How can we innovate at a faster pace? How can we aggressively acquire new customers and how can we continue to build a more predictable and recurring revenue stream?Customer satisfaction for our creative products is significantly higher because people know that as soon as there's a change in the environment Adobe is going to do it now rather than the traditional 12- or 18-month cycle (for the release of a new version of perpetual license software).As a product company focused on delivering innovation, as long as we can continue to have innovation front and center, everything else takes care of itself.We're in rarefied atmosphere in terms of companies that have the kind of top-line growth and bottom-line profitability and cash flow that we have.IBD: What can Washington do to support the tech industry?Narayen: The two things that would be top of mind for me are continued promotion of R&D and innovation, and looking at corporate competitiveness and taxation globally.We've had a history in this country of promoting R&D and innovation. As long as we can continue to promote R&D and innovation, that would be a good thing from the new administration.The second issue that's important to me is competitiveness, for ourselves and as a country, and corporate taxation. We continue to be one of the more heavily taxed countries. Like many tech companies, we have a lot of our funds offshore. So bringing that back and using that to drive more innovation and jobs in our country is near and dear to our heart at Adobe. RELATED:Adobe Systems Sees Clear Skies Ahead For Cloud Businesses

222,ADBE,"Shortly after Donald Trump was elected, leaders from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and many others met the president-elect for a cordial tech summit.But that honeymoon is over after President Trump's executive order to temporarily close off the U.S. to refugees and people from seven largely Muslim nations in the Middle East and Africa.Since the order was signed Friday, the tech sector has been particularly vocal in its opposition to the ban compared with other areas of the business world. Apple, Facebook (FB), Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the chorus of firms denouncing the order or expressing concern and support for their employees.Software development company GitHub is reportedly organizing a meeting Tuesday in which tech leaders will discuss filing a friend-of-the-court brief to back a lawsuit against Trump's order.The meeting, reported by Reuters, marks the latest attempt by the tech industry, which has turned to workers outside the U.S. to fill highly skilled positions, to hit back at the ban. The White House says the order is intended to strengthen national security against terrorism, not to target Muslims.But tensions between the White House and Silicon Valley appear likely to become more charged. Bloomberg reported that a draft executive order from the White House would change work-visa programs in an attempt to steer businesses toward American workers when making hires.GitHub has invited Google (whose parent company is Alphabet), Netflix (NFLX), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), Box (BOX) and others to attend, according to Reuters. It's not clear which tech firms will send representatives.Amazon and Expedia (EXPE), both based in the Seattle area, have already sent in filings expressing their support for the Washington state attorney general's suit against the ban, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations has filed its own suit, Reuters noted. What lawsuit the companies might get behind is not clear, Reuters said.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's executive order also suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which could slow the visa-renewal process for frequent international travelers, some analysts say, potentially leaving airlines exposed. Apple closed down 0.2% in the stock market today but rose late after reporting strong quarterly earnings and sales, while Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon lost 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively.  Alphabet shares have tumbled below a buy point this week following last week's earnings miss.

Jim Foote, chief operating officer since October, will temporarily assume the CEO position.The Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 stock had just cleared a 55.09 buy point in a flat base, ending 4% above that entry.On the Dow, Boeing took over the top slot, rising 0.5% as the stock looks to add a fifth week to its recent rally.Pfizer (PFE) jumped 0.8% at the start of trade, after announcing the Food and Drug Administration approved two doses of its rheumatoid arthritis treatment Xeljanz for active psoriatic arthritis. The gain put shares just below below a 36.88 buy point in an eight-week flat base.IBD 50 stock Adobe Systems rose 1% in early trade.

But Adobe's growth rate is seen slowing to a more ""normal"" trajectory from fiscal 2019 on, he said.Adobe has transitioned its business from perpetual license software sales to cloud-computing services. Plus, the company is seeing lengthening sales cycles in its digital marketing business, its main growth driver, Amladi said.""It appears that the marketing segment has hit an air pocket as the scale in the business hits the $2 billion mark,"" Amladi said.IBD'S TAKE: Adobe stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 95, meaning it has outperformed 95% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

229,ADBE,"As the late 2016 Trump Trade fades in the rearview mirror, $10.3 billion American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) is shining brighter. Boosted by such leading stock holdings as Cognex (CGNX), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Netflix (NFLX), the fund's 28.07% gain this year going into Thursday topped 76% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct. In all of 2016, the fund advanced just 4.38%, beating only 58% of its peers.X""2016 was overall a value-style year where the Russell 1000 Value Index outperformed the Russell 1000 Growth Index by over 10 (percentage points),"" said client portfolio manager Kevin Lewis. ""In that context Ultra's higher growth portfolio, which should be rewarded over time, faced a headwind.""The fund lagged the most in the fourth quarter. ""Coming out of the (2016) election, investors were excited about the prospect of government stimulus helping the economy,"" Lewis said. ""With that, many cyclical stocks did well. Many of those we don't own because they are value-oriented and we are a growth-oriented fund.""But this year growth stocks have grabbed back performance leadership. That has allowed Ultra's strategy to strut its stuff. ""Our focus is on higher-quality businesses with extensive growth opportunities over the long term,"" Lewis said. ""We invest in many innovative companies creating disruption and creating new ways of developing products and services.""Reflecting that appetite for innovation, the fund's top sectors as of Aug. 31 were technology, consumer discretionary and health care, with asset weightings of about 40%, 19% and 17%, respectively.The portfolio's day-to-day decisions have been made by lead manager Keith Lee and managers Michael Li and Jeffrey Bourke since 2008. This year's fund showing is more in line with its longer-term record, like its five-year average annual gain of 17.71%, topping 80% of its rivals.What's driving some of the fund's key holdings?The fund began its current stake in Cognex last June. ""They are a machine vision company with products that are essential to automated production and also quality assurance at high rates of production speed,"" Lewis said. ""Their machine vision software systematically interprets what is being seen by the camera and is focused on guiding, inspecting, gauging and identification across a multitude of scenarios such as guiding a robot to put a screen on a smartphone.""Key customers in 2016 included BMW and Apple (AAPL).Cognex earnings per share rose 87%, 75%, 91%, 19% and 91% the past five quarters. That's helped lead the stock to a No. 1 ranking in IBD's Electronics-Scientific/Measuring industry group. In addition to beating analysts' expectations for third-quarter earnings and revenue, the company guided Q4 revenue estimates higher.IBD'S TAKE: Cognex is ranked No. 14 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.June is also when the fund began its current position in Adobe Systems — which also happens to be ranked No. 1 in its industry group. The company provides software for digital publishing and marketing. The stock ""is high quality as shown by their operating margin of over 25%,"" Lewis said. ""We believe there will be sustained growth opportunities for them due to a shift of advertising spending from traditional media to digital media, an increasing usage of video content in ads and a shift from desktop to mobile, which needs new content creation.""The managers also like Adobe's transition to a more subscription-based customer revenue model, which provides greater stability, Lewis says. Adobe is another IBD 50 stock.Netflix is yet another stock ranked No. 1 in its IBD industry group (Leisure-Movies & Related). Its earnings per share have grown at a triple-digit pace in three of the past four quarters. ""Our long-term thesis is that Netflix is benefiting from cord-cutting,"" Lewis said, referring to consumers who are dropping cable subscriptions in pursuit of lower-cost entertainment through streaming services like Netflix's.""People are moving away from traditional cable, to over-the-top entertainment options,"" Lewis added. ""Netflix's revenues were up 30% last quarter and cash flow was up about 97%. Subscriber growth is strong, and it's growing overseas as well.""Ultra Fund's lineup of innovators includes Amazon.com (AMZN). Lewis says the fund's managers are confident that the stock's recent slowdown in EPS growth is due to investments that will pay off long-term. ""Amazon has been reinvesting (cash flow) to drive growth in the long term,"" Lewis said. ""Meanwhile, it remains very disruptive in retail and cloud computing.""Likewise, Facebook (FB) has been a core holding for a long time, Lewis says. ""Their core social platform is dominant, and they are just starting to monetize Instagram and Messenger,"" he said.""They're really benefiting from the shift to digital advertising from traditional platforms,"" he added.Early this month, Facebook's third-quarter results beat views. But shares have traded sideways since the company disclosed plans for increased spending, in part to boost security after disclosures about Russia's misinformation campaign during the U.S. presidential campaign, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in congressional hearings.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Dow futures climbed 0.25%.Microsoft fell 0.3% to 85.35 in Wednesday's stock market trading, holding just below an 86.30 flat-base buy point. Microsoft rebounded from just above its 50-day moving average starting on Dec. 5.The stock rose 0.3% in Thursday's premarket.Microsoft is seeing huge growth in cloud-computing services, moving the needle as its legacy PC-based Windows business stagnates. Microsoft on Wednesday rolled out new features for its Bing search service powered by artificial intelligence, including one that highlights reputable sources.The other half of the Wintel duopoly also is moving past PCs finally, finding strong demand for its chips in data centers — partly a reflection of cloud-computing demand. And Intel acquired Mobileye last year to provide fuel for its autonomous-driving efforts.Intel rose 1 cent to 43.34 on Wednesday, continuing to close above its rising 50-day moving average. It's a critical test, especially with most leading chipmakers trading below that key support area. If Intel rises strongly in high volume, it could offer a new buying opportunity. The chip giant also boasts a 47.40 entry from its ongoing flat-base consolidation.Intel was not yet active Thursday.Apple rose 0.3% to 172.27 on Wednesday. The iPhone titan needs a few more days to complete its flat base, or base-on-base formation.

Finisar will make vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers used in the iPhone X to power its Face ID identification software and other apps.Finisar shot up 23% to 23.70 during the regular session, then rose 2.7% in premarket trading Thursday.Finisar's gain was seen as coming at the expense of Lumentum. Lumentum shares plunged as low as 44.05 intraday, but closed down just 2.85% at 50.28, near session highs.Lumentum rose 2.6% early Thursday, nearly recouping Wednesday's loss.The maker of adhesives and industrial coatings and systems earned $1.38 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter vs. $1.39 a year earlier. But that beat views for $1.32, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue swelled 13% to $573.9 million, well above views for $543 million. Nordson also gave first-quarter guidance that was well above analyst forecasts.Nordson shares shot up 11% in premarket trading to 141. That strongly suggests that Nordson will retake a 127.71 cup-with-handle buy point and hit a record high at Thursday's open.Nordson rose 2.2% to 126.91 on Wednesday, retaking its 50-day line.The stock's Relative Strength Line has been lagging since late May, reflecting Nordson's underperformance vs. the rising S&P 500 index over that span.RELATED:The Big Picture: Are These Leading Growth Stocks Acting Well?Disney's Disturbance In The Force, Adobe Earnings: Investing Action Plan2 Drug Stocks Among These 3 Leaders Taking Out Buy PointsDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

All together, the fund was up 29.4% in 2017 going into Thursday, according to Morningstar Direct.That's well above its 2.21% gain for all of 2016. ""We were doing well for most of 2016, but (we) lost a lot of ground in November on the 'Trump Trade,' "" said co-manager Paul Gordon. He was referring to the late 2016 stock market rally in which many investors favored lower-quality, more-cyclical stocks that they expected would benefit from policies enacted by a Republican White House and Congress.But the fund caught up big-time when investors started favoring growth stocks at the beginning of the year.The fund's performance relative to its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct has slipped somewhat in the past three months too. ""September '17 was a lighter version of the same (low-quality, cycle-focused) trade on the prospects of tax reform, which set us back a little that month,"" added Gordon. ""However, we maintain our focus on owning cross-cycle, above-average growers.""That translates into seeking stocks whose growth is above average and is sustainable no matter which way the political winds blow. ""We are looking for stocks that can grow earnings and free cash flow at rates above the market's growth for the long duration,"" Gordon said, referring to himself and co-managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel.Gordon likes the long runway that he sees still in front of Nvidia. ""The thesis here is that Nvidia is exposed to some of the areas of technology with the largest potential addressable markets, and they have strong competitive market strengths in each,"" Gordon said.Nvidia chips have been popular in gaming, which provides about 60% of the firm's sales, Gordon says. In addition, data center operators have seen in recent years that strings of GPUs (graphics processing units) can power their computer needs more efficiently than regular CPUs, so now Nvidia's GPUs are being used in high-performance data centers, machine learning and driverless automobile functions.""Growth has accelerated in their data center business as well as in their autonomous-driving business,"" Gordon said. ""Nvidia has leadership in each. And it's able to spend to build share in each.""Adobe's earnings per share (EPS) growth has accelerated, rising 42%, 44% and 47% in the past three quarters.Gordon likes the stock's strategic position. ""We like the market they're in and their transition to subscriber selling (from legacy software),"" Gordon said. ""It expands the number of people who've bought the product, it reduces piracy, it makes revenue more recurring and it improves free cash flow conversion.""Gordon likes the firm's rate and duration of growth, which he says should lead to higher incremental margins.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Adobe's strengths — like its 48% three-year EPS growth rate — stack up against its peers' at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Netflix EPS grew at a triple-digit clip in three of the past four quarters. The fund has built its stake in recent portfolio disclosures.Gordon expects the internet content distributor to keep doing good things in the near term. ""They've been able to offer an incredible amount of content at attractive prices,"" he said. ""So they've done a tremendous job of raising their subscriber base in the U.S. and internationally. That's led to an ability to get pricing (increases) because they provide value.""Gordon added, ""We think there are still huge opportunities for (their subscriber) number to grow in the coming year.""Amazon is another name in which the fund has boosted its stake in recent disclosures. He likes both halves of its business. ""We think of Amazon as almost two companies within one,"" he said, citing Amazon Web Services and the firm's e-commerce side. ""We see potential for both businesses to be much bigger down the road.""Nor is Gordon antsy about Amazon's hefty investment spending. ""Amazon has always spent and typically run fairly low margins, and it's paid off over time,"" he said. ""It's an area to watch. But they have earned the trust of investors that their investments will pay off in time as future market-share gains.""Facebook is a third name in which the fund has been building its stake. ""The core Facebook business is still growing at a high rate,"" he said. ""And they've only started to monetize businesses like Instagram and WhatsApp.""Facebook has also positively surprised many investors. ""About a year ago they guided that the core business could decelerate as they slowed ad loads — ads that you see in Facebook streaming. But demand has been so strong that revenues this year are coming in better than the market expected.""RELATED:Retirement Investors Have Gained From Tech And Financial Stocks Driving MFS Growth FundYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

236,ADBE,"Tech stocks got a much-needed lift early Tuesday, although a 0.9% intraday gain for the Nasdaq composite was pared to 0.1% in afternoon trading.Signs of institutional selling in the Nasdaq have been easy to see in recent days amid broad-based weakness in semiconductor stocks and some selling in FANG names like Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX).X The Dow Jones industrial average gave back 0.4% and the S&P 500 eased 0.3%.

Early Tuesday, CNBC reported that Disney and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) are close to a deal in which Disney would acquire Fox's movie studio and TV production assets, while Fox would hold on to its news and sports assets. Shares of 21st Century Fox added 0.6%.Microsoft (MSFT) outperformed in the Dow, rising 0.9%, as it gets support at the 50-day moving average for the first time after a breakout from a flat base in late August.

238,ADBE,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were essentially flat early Tuesday morning, while Dow industrials continued to outperform and Nasdaq 100 futures pulled back.X For a second straight session, the S&P 500 dipped Monday as top techs such as chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), Micron Technology (MU), ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) crashing through key support in recent days, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbling through its 50-day line on Monday.Losses by chips and leading techs such as Facebook (FB), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) offset gains by financials, retailers, transports and media companies.It's hard for the market to advance without the chip sector. Not only are key parts of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index, but they are involved in so many other tech fields. Nvidia is a great example with its graphics chips and cards expanding from PC gaming fields to autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and even Bitcoin mining.S&P 500 index futures were just a fraction above fair value. Dow industrial futures climbed 0.3% after blue chips added 0.2% in Monday's stock market trading. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.3% after the composite closed down 1.1%.Nvidia tried to retake its 50-day moving average on Monday, but reversed hard to close down 5.6% to 186.66, nearly 15% off its Nov. 20 peak.The recent heavy-volume retreat suggests investors may consider taking profits in the highflier. The stock is still slightly extended from a 174.66 buy point, but don't let a 10%+ gain turn into nothing or a loss.Nvidia fell 0.9% in premarket trading.Micron Technology has fallen for six straight sessions, starting when Morgan Stanley predicted that memory chip prices will fall.

239,ADBE,"Technology stocks fell again on Monday as Republicans met to meld the Senate and House tax reform measures and investors fretted that the tech sector's gains may disappoint vs. those of banks and other industries.While financials have rallied, the technology sector has given back some of its year-to-date gains. One reason tech leaders — including FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — are getting hit is that fund managers are raising cash to buy financials, says BMO Capital Markets.From a macroeconomic perspective, JPMorgan says that higher bond yields are another factor in a market rotation out of growth stocks such as technology and into financials.There's also the nitty-gritty of tax reform. The Senate's version, passed late Friday, would cut the U.S. corporate rate from 35% to 20%; limit interest deductibility to 30% of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization); and lower the tax on repatriated overseas cash to 14% from the current full 35%.It also will allow the immediate expensing of capital spending over the next five years, which was helping telecom and cable companies on Monday. Comcast (CMCSA) surged 4.9% to close at 40.32, AT&T (T) was up 2.1% to finish at 37.27, and Verizon Communications (VZ) gained 0.9% to end the day at 51.72.The trouble for tech companies, though, is that they hold the most cash overseas, and the Senate's proposed 14% tax rate on such earnings is higher than expected. President Trump had proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings, while the House has proposed an 8.5% rate.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among companies with the most overseas cash.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.While tech companies may bring back some cash if Congress passes tax reform, the legislation disallows some accounting measures by multinational companies. Another concern for tech companies is what happens with the research-and-development tax credits many companies use.Many biotech, pharma and manufacturing companies benefit from a research-and-development credit under which firms recoup some of the costs for spending on innovation, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is often for the wages of scientists and engineers.The GOP tax plan could hurt the R&D tax credit in lieu of retaining the corporate alternative minimum tax, a provision that was initially expected to go by the wayside in the plan. Companies worked over the weekend to change congressional opinion on the tax ahead of the late-hour Senate vote.Amazon was down 2.4% to close at 1,133.95 on the stock market today, Netflix fell 1.5% to finish at 184.04, Facebook slid 2.1 to end at 171.47, and Google dropped 1.3% to 1,011.87. Apple was up a fraction to 169.80.Among stocks in the IBD 50, IPG Photonics (IPGP) plunged by more than 10% to 200.80, Cognex (CGNX) dropped 8.6% to 63.31, and PayPal (PYPL) fell 8.6% to 70.97. Adobe Systems (ADBE) stumbled by 6.2% to finish at 168.44, Nvidia (NVDA) fell 5.6% to close at 186.66, and Alibaba Holdings (BABA) lost 2.9% to 169.58.The Nasdaq dropped 1.1% to close at 6,775.37.RELATED:Bitcoin Futures Trading To Start Even Sooner; These Brokers Are ReadyBank Stocks Rise As Senators Add These Last-Minute Perks To Tax BillThese 3 Dow Stocks Have Entered Buy ZonesHow The Senate And House Tax Bills Would Affect You

For more information on Adobe stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Adobe ended fiscal 2016 with annualized recurring revenue (ARR) from its digital media businesses of $4.01 billion, up 39% from a year earlier.Adobe believes it can growth its digital media ARR by 25%, or an incremental $1 billion, in fiscal 2017, Garrett said.Adobe is modeling for 20% or greater ARR growth in its digital media business through fiscal 2018, Garrett said. The growth is coming from migrating legacy Creative Suite users over to the Creative Cloud, bringing in new users, getting customers off promotional prices and enticing them to subscribe to more services, he said.Adobe has had ""five years of really solid execution"" since the company decided to switch to cloud computing services from licensed software sales, Garrett said.The switch has given Adobe a direct, one-to-one relationship with its customers and a more stable revenue stream, he said.""People in the past would skip versions (of software) from us. You could buy Creative Suite version 3 under the old perpetual model and might skip versions 4 and 5 and not pay us anything for the next two years,"" Garrett said.

250,ADBE,"The ""FANG+"" stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) — are all in or near buy range as the Nasdaq found support at the 5500 level and bounced to another new high Friday.X Netflix is solidly back in buy range ahead of its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday. Shares initially broke past a 129.39 cup-with-handle entry on Jan. 4 and, after testing the entry point last week, are now back in buy range with a 3.5% gain to 133.70 on Friday.

251,ADBE,"Digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) got a lift Wednesday from a Cowen report that called the stock one of its ""top ideas for 2017.""Adobe shares were up 1.8% to close at 103.36 on the stock market today, getting back above its 10-day moving average. The stock has been forming a flat base over the past month, with a possible buy point of 111.19.""Adobe is at the forefront of all things digital — be it powering digital content creation and experiences; streamlining digital marketing and advertising spend; or analyzing customer behavior and online interactions,"" Cowen analyst Derrick Wood said in a research report.

Other IBD 50 companies include RV maker Thor Industries and mortgage-insurance firm Essent Group.Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The biggest is Creative Cloud, which includes software for creative professionals, such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Adobe is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close on Dec. 15.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the San Jose, Calif.-based company to earn 86 cents a share excluding items, up 39% year over year, on sales of $1.59 billion, up 22%. It would mark the sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth of 20% or higher.For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling Adobe to earn 85 cents a share ex items, up 29%, on sales of $1.65 billion, up 19%.""Given the volatility in tech stocks seen in recent weeks, we believe Adobe provides investors with a nice balance of top line growth, margin expansion and real EPS power, such that even if valuation multiples were to compress across the space, its unique earnings power positions Adobe to outperform its growth peers,"" Wood said.RELATED:Adobe Systems To Buy TubeMogul For $540 MillionAdobe, Microsoft Hit New Highs On Cloud ProspectsAdobe Systems Riding Strong Tailwind In Online Marketing

252,ADBE,"Red Hat's (RHT) fiscal Q3 earnings, to be posted after the close Wednesday, are expected to be among its best in more than a year.Analysts expected earnings per share minus items of 58 cents, up 21% from the year-earlier quarter and matching its biggest percentage gain in six quarters. Revenue for the quarter ended on or near Nov. 30 is expected to be $621.7 million, up 19% and matching its biggest growth for the past nine quarters.For the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the No. 1 provider of open-source Linux software to post 17% EPS ex items growth, to 61 cents, on 17% growth in sales, to $637.7 million.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks are lacking in the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, while semiconductor, optical and wireless gear firms are well represented. Red Hat stock fell 1.3% to 79.39 in the stock market today. Shares are down 4% in 2016. Red Hat has the highest Composite Rating of the eight companies in IBD's Computer-Software Desktop group, but the group ranks only No. 144 out of 197 industry groups. Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) also belong to the group.Red Hat stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, with a buy point of 82.83 from a flat base.Red Hat's Linux software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Analysts are looking for traction in Red Hat's public cloud business as customers shift computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a Red Hat partner.Red Hat took part in the late-November AWS re: Invent developers conference, noted Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a research report.""Post-AWS re: Invent, we come away believing that Red Hat's role in the public cloud is secure medium term, and we expect management will continue to bring evidence that large cloud adopters are purchasing more on-premises,"" Pritchard wrote.The company's biggest revenue generator is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Red Hat aims to sell customers a broader set of software for managing application servers and data storage.Red Hat's cloud revenue mainly comes from customers using RHEL software on a ""pay as you go,"" or software-as-a-service, basis.RELATED:As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant CiscoMicrosoft Stock Gets Price-Target Hike As Cloud Bets Pay OffRed Hat Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Q3 Guidance Top Views, Stock Rises

253,ADBE,"JCPenney (JCP) said that same-store sales fell 0.8% in November and December, making it the latest department store giant to put up uninspiring holiday results as malls become increasingly barren and Amazon.com (AMZN)-led e-commerce thrives.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) late Wednesday cut profit forecasts due to tepid holiday sales, with both saying November-December comps slid 2.1%. Macy's also said it planned to slash 10,000 jobs as it closes 68 stores as part of a plan to shut 100 locations over time. The forecasts also came after Macy's in November expressed optimism about the holiday quarter.Meanwhile, Sears (SHLD) said this week that it would sell Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and close 150 Kmart and Sears locations.JCPenney fell 3.7% to 7.57 in the stock market today after tumbling 7.2% on Thursday.The retailer said the first three weeks of November were ""challenging,"" but that comps from the Thanksgiving week through the end of December were positive. Sluggish sales in women's apparel continued to weigh on the chain's results, JCPenney said.The picture was a brighter for appliances, jewelry, outerwear, boots, toys and Sephora beauty products. JCPenney's e-commerce division saw ""double-digit growth,"" the company said, and it held to its EBITDA goal of $1 billion for fiscal 2016.""As we prepare for a new fiscal year, our turnaround in profitability remains on track, and I am pleased that we expect to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating profit,"" CEO Marvin Ellison said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: As traditional and specialty retailers struggle amid the galactic expansion of Amazon, off-price retailers have done better. Burlington Stores, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, was among the few growth stories in retail. As retailers reel, Adobe (ADBE) this week reported that online holiday sales rose 11% to a record $91.7 billion. Meanwhile, the December jobs report showed that nonstore retailers reported a 5.5% employment gain over the past 12 months. While neither report named Amazon, other surveys suggested that it was grabbing a huge share of overall e-commerce sales.Amazon rose 2%, continuing to advance after clearing its 50-day moving average earlier in the week.Macy's dipped 0.1% Friday after crashing nearly 14% Thursday.

254,ADBE,"The holiday retail numbers are rolling in, and they do not look good. Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) shares were set aflame late Wednesday (and continue to burn Thursday) on same-store sales declines and slashed earnings targets.The dismal department store results have also singed Michael Kors (KORS), Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE) and Fossil (FOSL). The accessories brands are feeling the heat following Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren's comment that handbags and watches performed poorly over the major selling period.""Accessories was the single consistent 'negative' at both"" retailers, wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy. ""This leads us to believe the (North American) handbag category is tracking for another flat to down quarter, which likely impacts KORS.""Some specialty retailers are logging worse-than-expected holiday sales results. Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works parent L Brands (LB) said comparable sales declined 1% for the five weeks ended Dec. 31, and now projects fourth-quarter per-share profit toward the lower end of guidance for $1.85-$2, below consensus views for $1.98.The decline surprised Street analysts who had been expecting a comp increase of 1.5%.Shares of Macy's collapsed 14% on the stock market today, and Kohl's plunged 19%. L Brands sank 7.9%, Fossil tumbled 7.6% and Michael Kors fell 3.2%. Coach dropped 2.6% but Kate Spade, which could put itself up for sale, rallied to close up 0.7%. lost 2%.IBD'S TAKE: This year will be one of ""reckoning"" and ""awakening,"" said NPD Group's Marshal Cohen, as retailers grapple with modern consumption habits.But it's not all coal in Christmas stockings, at least in the e-commerce realm. Adobe (ADBE) said the November and December holiday season brought in an 11% year-over-year online sales rise to $91.7 billion, a little more than a tenth percent above predictions for $91.6 billion.And among individual retailers, Costco (COST) logged a 3% comp gain for December, which Retail Metrics said is the warehouse retailer's greatest monthly comp gain in two years.Shares of Costco were up 2% Thursday.Children's Place (PLCE) ""was one the few bright spots in retail so far reporting a solid 6.9% holiday same-store sales gain for the November-December period,"" said the research firm's president Ken Perkins in a report.Comparable retail sales rose 6.9% in the first nine weeks of Q4, prompting the company to raise Q4 and full-year earnings guidance.Children's Place shares fell intraday to 100.35 but closed up 0.1% at 104.20.

255,ADBE,"Apple (AAPL) and FANG — (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL)) stocks all gained on Thursday, as Apple trumpeted App Store sales and Amazon basked in holiday-season e-commerce sales reports after several large brick-and-mortar retailers disclosed disappointing sales.Apple stock edged up 0.5% in the stock market today to 116.63. The tech giant's App Store raked in $240 million in purchases on New Year's Day, its biggest sales day ever. Apple stock has formed a cup pattern over nine weeks, with a technical buy point of 118.12. Apple reports fiscal Q1, December-quarter earnings on Jan. 31.The e-commerce giant's stock popped 3.1% to 780.45. Amazon stock moved above its 50-day moving average, a key support level, for the first time since Oct. 27, when its Q3 earnings missed views and its guidance disappointed. Amazon extended gains to 782 in late trade.Online sales rose 11% to a record $91.7 billion, Adobe Systems (ADBE) said Thursday, topping its own estimate. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion. Earlier reports have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth.The video streaming website's stock on Thursday gained 1.85% to 131.81 in solid volume, setting a record close. Netflix continues to rally after poking above an alternate 129.39 buy point. Netflix on Wednesday had a low-volume breakout from a cup-with-handle formation. Netflix reports Q4 earnings on Jan. 18.Google-parent Alphabet's stock rose 0.65% to 813.02. Google stock has been consolidating after several failed breakouts.

256,ADBE,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

257,ADBE,"Software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies will continue to lead in revenue growth in 2017 in the software sector, says RBC Capital, whose top stock picks include Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE), HubSpot (HUBS) and Shopify (SHOP).Salesforce.com has been a pioneer in SaaS. Adobe, like Microsoft (MSFT), has migrated to a web-based SaaS subscription business models from one-time licensing fees or packaged software. SaaS companies tend to have low customer turnover, high renewal rates and book recurring revenue over the long term. Customers receive automatic software updates through secure network connections.RBC Capital's top software picks also include Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) among large caps. In the small-cap sector, besides HubSpot and Shopify, RBC likes security firm Mimecast (MIME) and data analysis firm Varonis Systems (VRNS).IBD'S TAKE: IBD tracks 11 different computer software groups. The enterprise market — large companies and government agencies — spans e-commerce platforms, big data analytics, security and more. The IBD 50 roster of top-performing stocks at the moment doesn't have any enterprise software stocks, but it's led by chipmaker Nvidia.Adobe stock rose 1.7% in the stock market today to 105.29, near its 50-day moving average.

Shopify stock slipped a small fraction, while Salesforce fell 0.52%.""For 2017, we are modeling 23.6% growth in actual SaaS dollar spending vs. 30.7% in 2015,"" said the RBC Capital research report.

The space could continue to benefit from consolidation as many of the smaller vendors remain attractive acquisition candidates.""RBC Capital is cautious about the software security sector.""The call is that with an increase in cloud-based workload, we believe many organizations will reprioritize thinking around cybersecurity spending. Overall, we favor software only solutions, preferably away from the firewall market given increased competition and a lack of easy share gains,"" said the report. ""Our favorite security vendors include Palo Alto Networks (PANW) in large cap and Proofpoint (PFPT) and Mimecast in small cap.""That said, we are incrementally more cautious on the overall network firewall market."" RELATED:Sharks Eye Appetizing Multiples In SaaS Software DealsWill Security Stocks Escape Penalty Box Next Year Amid Cloud Shift?Cisco, Palo Alto, Symantec Gear Up For Cloud Cybersecurity Shift

267,ADBE,"Oracle (ORCL) reports quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday, with analysts looking for more insight on its transition to cloud computing and its acquisition of NetSuite.The Wall Street consensus is for earnings per share minus items to fall 5% from the year-earlier quarter to 60 cents, on a 1.7% revenue uptick to $9.14 billion, for its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30.The enterprise software giant has been steadily transitioning more of its business to the cloud and away from selling on-premise, licensed software.On Nov. 7, Oracle completed its $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite, a provider of cloud-based customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning software. Oracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison owned a nearly 40% stake in NetSuite.But UBS recently said several software vendors have hinted that the U.S. election and Brexit-related uncertainties have extended sales cycles and caused deal slippage.IBD'S TAKE: Oracle stock is up about 10% this year as it trudges through a flat base with a 42.10 buy point. Oracle moved above its 200-day moving average on Dec. 7, a bullish indicator. But the stock has a week IBD Composite Rating of 39, meaning it has been outperformed by 61% of stocks in the past year.Adobe Systems (ADBE) will also report earnings after the market close Thursday. Adobe also went through a cloud computing transition that is now paying off. Cowen recently rated Adobe as one of its top ideas for 2017.

268,ADBE,"Institutional investors continued to show a healthy appetite for stocks in late afternoon trading Tuesday and Apple (AAPL) as the iPhone giant and fellow megacap techs helped send the Nasdaq composite into new high ground.Apple rallied more than 2% to 115.62 and got closer to a potential second buy point of 118.79 in a base-on-base entry. The initial entry was 110.33 from a cup with handle, and the stock is now getting extended from the old buy point. The two bases form part of a long bottoming base process in the former huge market winner.The Nasdaq composite at one point rose more than 1.3% and hit an all-time high of 5486, extending its year-to-date gain to more than 9% with nary three weeks left in the trading year. The Nasdaq 100, comprising the 100 largest nonfinancial companies, jumped more than 1.5%.Other indexes lagged the Nasdaq, yet still joined the upside. The S&P 500 gained 0.7%, helped by big gains by stocks in the newspaper, automaker, international oil exploration, internet retailing, generic drug, internet content, desktop software and telecom consumer products industries.The NYSE composite was up 0.5% as selloffs in medical software, metal ores mining, specialty steel, trucking, oil drilling, heavy construction and mortgage REIT stocks buffered that index's ascent. The Dow Jones industrials also rose 0.5%. The Russell 2000 fell 0.1%.Volume was running higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE vs. the same time on Monday. Apple originally staged a breakout on Sept. 14, moving past a 110.33 entry within a multimonth cup with handle. The breakout was good enough to send shares up almost 8%, but the stock then faded and did a round-trip.However, Apple got critical buying support at the 200-day moving average and never triggered the golden rule of selling — that is, cut your losses short in every stock at 7%-8% or less.The reason for that?Research by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil shows that when you buy a stock properly as it breaks out, if it's destined to become a great winner, capable of gains of 20%, 200% or more, then it rarely falls 7%-8% below the proper buy point.Analysts are posting bullish commentary not on the iPhone 7 being sold today, but the next edition, the iPhone 8. As pointed out in the IBD Click tech blog, Citi Research analyst Jim Suva foresees a major iPhone upgrade cycle next year.Meanwhile, the company continues to innovate with brand-new products and may see serious revenue pickup in the long term in emerging new markets such as India.Apple's 56 RS Rating is normal for a big-cap stock that has lumbered through a long base. When a stock forms a shorter base in the span of 13 weeks or less and has already made a big move, you'd expect the Relative Price Strength Rating to be well north of 90.Apple's 0.9 up/down volume ratio, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is not terrible and thus gets a cautionary yellow dot at Stock Checkup, but you'd like to see that go up and eclipse the neutral 1.0 level.Other companies to watch in the stock market today with the potential of staging fresh breakouts include:Qualcomm (QCOM), up 2% to 69.79: The wireless chip expert is getting near a 71.72 flat-base entry.Adobe Systems (ADBE), up 1% to 106.15: The No. 1 firm in digital content creation software is retaking its 50-day moving average and may be forming a new base on base with a 111.19 entry. The stock gained 10% past an earlier entry at 100.66 before retreating last month. Adobe reports fiscal Q4 results Thursday.Intel (INTC), up 1.8% to 36.62: The leader in microprocessors has regained its 50-day line and is forming a cuplike pattern since peaking at 38.36 on Oct. 10. Prior to that, the megacap had rallied nearly 16% after surpassing a long saucer with handle base at 33.10 on July 7.Applied Materials (AMAT), up 0.2% to 32.07: The chip equipment titan is still in buy range after a successful test of buying support near its recent flat-base buy point of 31.17. To find the proper entry in a flat base, add a dime to the highest price within the base, which is usually on the left side of the pattern.The 5% chase zone in Applied extends up to 32.73. The IoT phenomenon could play well into Applied's hands as more devices get connected to the internet and some translate digital information into physical movement via chips called actuators. More demand for chipmaking equipment would boost Applied's fortunes.  The Street sees FY 2017 profit jumping 37% to $2.39 a share and sales rising 17% to $12.7 billion.Applied's fiscal year ends in October.Applied scores a 93 EPS Rating and an equally bullish 89 Relative Price Strength score.RELATED:How To Spot The Bottoming Base, Part IHow To Spot The Bottoming Base, Part IIWhich Stocks Are Joining Apple In Attempting New Breakouts?

269,ADBE,"The Trump administration's chances of pushing through tax reform legislation are improving and will pressure so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — and other momentum stocks with high hedge fund ownership, says JPMorgan.X ""For managers overweight growth/momentum, taking a defensive approach to tax reform appears prudent,"" said the JPMorgan report published Thursday. ""While passage of tax reform may provide mid-single digit upside to the S&P 500, we also estimate that equity allocations for most investor types are near historical highs, potentially leaving them less willing to increase allocations to U.S. equities further. Thus, passage of tax reform is likely to result in style implications for equities (i.e. value vs. growth).""JPMorgan recommends ""protective strategies"" for high growth/momentum stocks with high hedge fund ownership. They include: Facebook, Salesforce.com (CRM), Applied Materials (AMAT), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Qorvo (QRVO), Marriott International (MAR), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Autodesk (ADSK).Also on the list are: Micron (MU), Align Technology (ALGN), Netflix, JD.com (JD), Activision-Blizzard (ATVI), Red Hat (RHT), Lam Research (LRCX), Mercadolibre (MELI,) PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Stocks rose early Thursday as investors eyed a pending tax reform vote in the U.S. Senate. After a technology sector sell-off on Wednesday, all of the FANG stocks traded higher, led by Netflix. Goldman Sachs led the Dow, continuing a rally in banks and financial stocks.""Passage of tax reform, or increasing speculation thereof, could cause a continued rotation out of growth/momentum,"" said JPMorgan.

270,ADBE,"With Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google dominating the cloud-computing platform battle, those companies will seek to strengthen their respective positions through alliances with other major tech firms next year, market researcher IDC predicts.""I think we'll see those top three make some very interesting alliances and maybe even some acquisitions,"" IDC Chief Analyst Frank Gens told Investor's Business Daily, adding that ""2018 will be a really interesting year.""Gens says he looks forward to seeing how companies like IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) position themselves as the trio of major cloud players scale up, he said.Using the ""cloud,"" or employing third-party digital services via the internet, is the next major computing platform in the wake of the client-server age. And the major cloud infrastructure providers have amassed computing resources and Big Data capabilities that other companies can't match, Gens said.Competition among those big three will create opportunities for other major tech companies to extract favorable terms for cloud resources, Gens said. The deal-making likely will lead to partnerships where one cloud firm is named a preferred provider, such as the arrangement Adobe Systems (ADBE) has with Microsoft.Gens likened next year's expected cloud market activity to a game of musical chairs.""By the end of 2018, everyone will have found their seat in this new marketplace,"" he said. ""It feels like the entire industry is realigning around the fact that those three companies want to beat each other so badly.""IBD'S TAKE: The FANG group of closely watched internet stocks is made up of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. For the latest news on the group, visit IBD's page on FANG stocks.One of the driving factors behind the realignment is that cloud-computing infrastructure providers are becoming platforms for artificial intelligence as a service, Gens said.On Tuesday, IDC released its annual predictions for the year ahead and beyond for information technology.IDC predicts that an ""AI war"" is looming as the major public cloud service providers offer an ever-expanding variety of AI-powered services.The research group forecast that 40% of enterprise digital transformation initiatives will use artificial-intelligence services by 2019.IDC also predicted that enterprise spending on cloud services and infrastructure will be more than $530 billion by 2021 and in excess of 90% of enterprises will use multiple cloud services and platforms.RELATED:Microsoft Talks Up Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, Quantum ComputingOracle's Cloud-Computing Guidance Raises Concerns About GrowthWhy Cisco Is Good Fit For Google's Push In Cloud Computing

271,ADBE,"Software companies transitioning to the cloud is not a new story, as notable tech names like Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) have made the move and lived to tell about it.XBut a lesser-known company's move to the cloud, that of Guidewire Software (GWRE), may be more impressive because of the clientele it serves — the property and casualty insurance market.""The thinking a year ago was that insurance companies are too conservative with data (storage) to adopt a cloud strategy, but given the changing demand environment, Guidewire has embraced (the cloud) pretty quickly,"" JMP Securities analyst Rishi Jaluria told Investor's Business Daily.The leading software provider for insurers, Guidewire is leveraging relationships with technology partners Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Salesforce (CRM), which are its cloud providers. It expects cloud subscription sales to rise from 6% of its $514.3 million in fiscal 2017 revenue to a range of 20% to 30% in fiscal 2018.The Foster City, Calif.-based firm's shift to a cloud-based subscription model can be likened to that of Adobe, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Nandan Amladi.""Adobe gets written about as a company that's done (the transition to the cloud) well. I think Guidewire is just starting that process at this point,"" Amladi told Investor's Business Daily.Guidewire offers two property and casualty core platforms: InsuranceSuite and InsuranceNow. In a recent report, research firm Gartner called Guidewire's InsuranceSuite platform, which has captured a large share of Tier 1 insurers, the leader in property and casualty core platforms in North America. Tier 1 insurers have at least $5 billion in annual written premiums.Only nine of the 227 total deployments of InsuranceSuite as of March 31 were cloud-based, rather than on-premises, according to Gartner. InsuranceNow, on the other hand, is an all-in-one cloud-based offering for smaller-size insurers, and it results from an acquisition of ISCS in early 2017.""I like that they're both embracing the cloud but they're not forcing it or trying to do anything unnatural to get things in that direction,"" said JMP's Jaluria.IBD'S TAKE: Guidewire is a member of the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks, which is compiled based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, return on equity, price performance and more. See how the IBD 50 can provide hot stocks for your watch list.That approach has helped Guidewire capture a considerable market share. The Gartner report noted that Guidewire has secured nearly 33% of the new customer wins in the property and casualty market, which is three times as much as its nearest competitor.Another factor that sets Guidewire apart is its narrow focus on the property and casualty market — it doesn't sell into any other sectors of insurance, helping it establish ""pretty clear market leadership,"" according to Amladi.In a recent earnings conference call, Chief Executive Marcus Ryu said: ""The increased market dynamism in both demand and competition motivate greater investment to expand our addressable market and to build on our market leadership position.""Guidewire has more than doubled the number of its customers from 158 in fiscal 2013 to 328 in fiscal 2017, with 25 of those customers in the Tier 1 category of more than $5 billion in annual premiums each. And Guidewire isn't focused just on North America, either; it has a strong global presence, Amladi says.MetLife (MET) is a notable customer win for Guidewire. In a ""first-of-its-kind"" project, the company recently deployed InsuranceSuite Cloud, in which Guidewire not only built the solution but is operating it on behalf of MetLife. Jaluria notes that while the product has negative margins at the onset, at a scale seen at 12-15 customers, InsuranceSuite Cloud is expected to reach 65% gross margins.The momentum that Guidewire is seeing is extending to its stock action. Shares are up more than 60% this year, and could be entering a buy zone soon. The stock, a member of the IBD 50 list of leading growth names, is finding support at the key 50-day moving average as it works on the right side of a flat base with an 81.56 buy point.While shifting to the cloud is key for any software business given the current environment, the transition will make Guidewire's financials look ""messy"" in the near term as revenue recognition for subscription deals is delayed compared to its term licenses.The company also expects gross margin to decline to between 62% and 64% next year ""due primarily to the significant increase of lower margin services revenue,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Hart said on the company's fourth-quarter conference call in September.""Fiscal 2018 will also be one of increased investment as we capitalize on opportunities to address a larger addressable market,"" Hart said. ""We plan a significant increase in hiring of development professionals to meet our product development road map.""Hart added that Guidewire also plans to expand its cloud production services staff and invest in the automation of operational processes.Guidewire will issue its next quarterly report in late November. Revenue is projected to climb 7% to $100.6 million, while the bottom line is expected to reverse to a loss of 14 cents a share from earnings of 2 cents a share last year.Guidewire announced the acquisition of Cyence, a machine learning technology startup that serves the property and casualty market, on Oct. 6 in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $275 million, including $140 million in cash and 1.4 million shares. The deal is expected to close early in the January quarter.Hart said at the company's investor day on Sept. 28 that he expects Guidewire to continue to be acquisitive, with one to two acquisitions per year, according to Jaluria.The analyst notes that the acquisitions could be consolidating deals, extending product features, or expanding the company's global footprint.Amladi notes that Guidewire is ""not dependent on acquisitions for growth,"" but could competitors give it a run for its money?""The competition isn't sitting still,"" he said. ""Guidewire is the leading vendor at this point, but if you're out front, you always need to look over your back to see how other people are catching up.""Shares ticked up 0.7% to close at 80.96 on Friday.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

272,ADBE,"Hoping to get a jump on the holiday shopping season, Amazon (AMZN) on Wednesday said it was opening a Black Friday Deals store that is intended to offer sales markdowns and promotions by borrowing the name of what had been retail's biggest day of the year for decades.Amazon said the Black Friday site will provide sales on everything from toys and electronics to holiday entertainment essentials and apparel.

274,ADBE,"Product-design software has been one of the slower sectors to move to the cloud from on-premises, but CAD leader Autodesk (ADSK) long transition has taken root and will spark growth, Canaccord Genuity said Friday in upgrading Autodesk stock to buy from hold.In a research note following Autodesk's analyst day Tuesday, Canaccord analyst Richard Davis also gave a big price-target hike to Autodesk stock, to 95 from 70.""While other sectors are a decade into this (cloud) transition, design engineers have finally discovered the advantages of back-end (cloud) computing, multiplatform file access and collaboration, and modern user interfaces,"" Davis wrote in his research report.Autodesk stock fell 0.76% to 81.12 in the stock market today, but earlier it rose a fraction to 83.08, hitting a record high for the third straight day.

At that time, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a 31-cent loss on sales of $487.5 million.The company's rivals, in some markets, include Adobe Systems (ADBE), which also is making big headway in transitioning users to cloud, software-as-a-service versions of its software.

280,ADBE,"One of the most important market turning points in recent years did not actually feature a bullish follow-through day.Nevertheless, did you catch the U.S. equity market's major inflection point in early November? If yes, great. If no, can you learn something by studying it? For sure.The past nine months have illustrated that good buying opportunities, in both individual stocks and ETFs, can emerge when the stock market suddenly shows unbridled demand after a mild pullback within a general uptrend. Consider the sell-off that occurred in the end of October. As the daily chart of the Nasdaq composite shows, the major benchmark suffered a nine-day sell-off as tensions over global terrorism, the Federal Reserve's intentions on interest rates, and uncertainty over the U.S. presidential elections grew.The nine-day decline (1) amounted to a 5% pullback, which isn't deep. Yet it was enough to send the Nasdaq below the 50-day moving average, which itself was flattening out. (The 50-day moving average computes the average closing price of a stock or index over the 50 most recent trading sessions. A rising line means that the stock or index is in a general uptrend.)On Nov. 4, the Nasdaq hit 5034, down 5.8% from its recent high of 5342. The healthy decline kept investors honest, but it was not a serious correction. An intermediate correction is by definition a minimum 10% drop from a high; a bear market, at least 20%.Only in the latter two situations would you expect to see the market follow through with a big up day in heavier turnover, four days into a new rally attempt or later. But the market got hot on the eve of the Nov. 8 U.S. elections as IBD coverage noted a good chance that Donald Trump would land an upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. The following day on Nov. 9, with Trump's victory confirmed, the Nasdaq bounced sharply off early lows to rise 1.1% and jump back above its 50-day moving average (2). Notice how volume soared to the highest level in months (3). The large charts PDF that is linked to the daily Big Picture column shows the 50-day line (in dotted form) very clearly.Although that was Day 3 of a new rally attempt and thus would not normally qualify as a follow-through because it was too soon into the rally, the Nasdaq showed a true change in character. So did the S&P 500. On the same day, The Big Picture column noted that the current outlook was upgraded to ""Uptrend resumes,"" which means that the prospects of good breakouts were higher and it's the best time to actively form a watch list and be ready to pounce.XThe next few days were bumpy, but stocks continued to roar ahead. Through Thursday, the Nasdaq has risen from the Nov. 9 close of 5251 to 6352, a 21% lift.Examples of solid winners since then range from Adobe Systems (ADBE), Apple (AAPL), Alibaba (BABA) and Netflix (NFLX) on the big- and megacap end to TAL Education (TAL), Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) (Jan. 12 breakout; $1.8 billion market cap), Arista Networks (ANET) and TransUnion (TRU) on the small- to midcap end.IBD's TAKE: After you spot an emerging market uptrend, be sure to actively use the IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders, Stocks Near A Buy Zone and IPO Leaders to identify new bases, follow-on entries, and important exit points.

But gamemakers are at a crossroads as consumers must decide in what form they want to purchase new game software.The strength in online sales did not carry over to foot traffic in brick and mortar stores. According to RetailNext, combined sales on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday at physical retail stores fell 5%, with a 7.9% decline in transactions.""We believe part of the softness in Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday sales is attributable to the earlier start to promotions ahead of the Thanksgiving weekend,"" wrote Alan Rifkin, an analyst at BTIG, in a research note.  ""Discounts were heavy on Black Friday, resulting in strong, albeit promotionally-driven sales.""Rifkin said store checks ""suggest a promotional environment with consumers very price conscious.""The National Retail Federation said more people shopped online than in stores over the weekend. It said the number of shoppers rose to 154 million from 151 million in 2015, on a 4.2% rise in online shoppers and a 3.7% drop in in-store shoppers.From Nov. 24 through 27, Adobe said, U.S. online sales brought in $9.36 billion, a 16.4% increase, with heavy discounts.Mobile accounted for 56% of visits and 37% of sales, Adobe said.Nov. 1 through Nov. 27 U.S. online retail sales of $36.5 billion rose 7.1% from the year-earlier period, with 26 of the 27 days generating over $1 billion.Multiple retailers jumped on the online sales bonanza, with big promotions by Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (T) and others. Wal-Mart said it tripled its online assortment. Target said it's seeing strong demand for Apple iPads and Watches.Also getting in on the action is China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) though its Tmall.com website.Alibaba's Tmall Global website for the first time has partnered with several U.S. brands, including Macy's (M), Costco Wholesale (COST) and Target to launch the ""Same Products, Same Time, Same Price, Same Black Friday"" campaign, Alibaba said. Chinese consumers have the opportunity to purchase select products for the same prices at which they're sold offline on Black Friday in the U.S.Alibaba has the world's biggest online shopping event, Singles Day, on Nov. 11.Brian White, an analyst at Drexel Hamilton, in a research note said Apple remains one of the best positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7, new Apple Watches and a new MacBook Pro.Apple stock slipped a fraction, to 111.57, in the stock market today. Amazon stock fell 1.7% to 766.77, while shares of Alibaba rose 0.8% to 93.76.RELATED:Black Friday Deals, Thanksgiving Sales, Fuel Online Buying

289,ADBE,"Look for more software partnerships to surface at Amazon.com's (AMZN) annual cloud computing conference this week, says Citigroup.Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business of the e-commerce giant, will likely announce more products for the enterprise market as it battles Microsoft (MSFT), says Citigroup. Re:Invent, AWS' annual Las Vegas conference, runs from Tuesday through Friday. AWS has forged partnerships in 2016 with Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in software-as-a-service, as well as VMware (VMW), whose software is widely used in corporate data centers.Rather than unveil products that compete with enterprise software providers, AWS is likely to tout its growing list of partnerships, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard, which now includes Freeport-McMo-Ran, Jack-in-the-Box and tech stocks Broadcom, Veeva Systems and Celegene. Holiday season e-commerce activity will be a key for Amazon. ""The tide has shifted in 2016 with more AWS partnering with software vendors,"" wrote Pritchard. ""We believe the market may be overly concerned around impact on Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK) and VMware.""He noted that Salesforce.com, Splunk, VMware as well as Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK) and Intuit (INTU) are slated to take part is RE:Invent sessions.""We expect to hear AWS partnering more to keep up with Microsoft and IBM (IBM) in hybrid cloud deployment,"" Pritchard said.""We expect investor sentiment coming out of re:Invent to continue to focus on its disruptive impact on the enterprise market with significant traction with big-name customers,"" he said. ""We note that AWS as a development platform lags its position in infrastructure, but we see many of these customers presenting on how AWS is becoming key to its custom app development effort, replacing the likes of IBM, Microsoft and Oracle (ORCL).""AWS announced a new round of cloud computing price cuts in November.Citigroup lowered its price target on Amazon.com to 960 from 965 on Monday, on possible margin impact from the price cuts.In Q3, Amazon said AWS revneue jumped 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, topping analysts' estimate of $3.19 billion.Amazon stock fell 1.7% in the stock market today to 766.77.

291,ADBE,"XThe Nasdaq continued to hold the leadership baton in afternoon trading Wednesday, helped by another solid showing for biotech stocks as well as a couple of strong earnings reports from two high-profile software names.Among biotechs, Celgene (CELG) soared past a 127.74 buy point, rising more than 4% to 131.86. But after seven gains in the past eight sessions, the daily chart has a straight-up-off-the-bottom look to it, making Celgene's latest base a bit lopsided.The Nasdaq added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 showed modest losses. Volume on both exchanges was tracking close to Tuesday's levels.West Texas Intermediate crude oil for July lost nearly 3% to $42.31 a barrel after U.S. government data showed a second straight weekly decline for crude inventories, along with a rise in domestic production.Wall Street cheered earnings reports from two well-run software names that have transitioned successfully to the cloud. Red Hat (RHT) soared 10% after reporting a 12% rise in quarterly profit and 19% increase in sales to $676.8 million. It's extended in price at this point, meaning it's too late to buy. Shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE) jumped 2% as adjusted earnings rose 44% to $1.02 share. Sales grew 27% to $1.77 billion.Another software name working toward a cloud-based model is Oracle (ORCL), which reports today after the close. Shares rose 1% to 46.26 ahead of the results as it works on a flat base with a 47.09 buy point.Elsewhere, RV-maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) broke out of a downtrend with conviction, rising 11%, after reporting better-than-expected earnings and its fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Aggressive investors got an early entry into Winnebago on Wednesday even though the stock is still 17% off its high.CarMax (KMX), which operates used-car superstores in the U.S., reversed in spectacular fashion. Shares edged higher after rising 8% intraday. Headed into the report, CarMax was working on a cup-with-handle base with a 65.90 buy point, but it was a flawed pattern because of recent uncertain action around the 50-day moving average. Handle areas should always form comfortably above the 50-day line.In economic news, existing home sales for May came in slightly better than expected, but homebuilders didn't move much on the news. iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB), an exchange-traded fund, was mostly unchanged around 34.

292,ADBE,"XStocks opened higher and clung to narrow gains early Wednesday, as a string of positive earnings reports boosted early trade.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each fought to hold gains of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq jumped 0.3%,with CA (CA), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Broadcom (AVGO) leading the Nasdaq 100.Intel (INTC) staked out the weak spot among Dow stocks, down 1.6% after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral, from buy. Nike (NKE) jumped 1.1%, the best early move among Dow industrials,Intel may also have felt some pressure from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which surged 8% after introducing a new line of high-power, low-cost processors aimed squarely at Intel's markets. The gain hoisted AMD shares 38% above an early May low, and well up the right side of a three-month cup base.FedEx (FDX) dipped 1% after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday.Red Hat (RHT) spiked 9% as Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold, following strong first-quarter results reported late Tuesday. A 12% earnings gain and a 19% rise in revenue neatly cleared analysts' targets, and management's second-quarter revenue and earnings forecasts were also above expectations. The move sent the open-source software innovator to new highs in heavy trade, after clearing a long, sloppy consolidation in February.CA, the former Computer Associates, spiked 15% on news reports that privately held BMC Software was exploring financing options to acquire the provider of information technology management software. CA has market capitalization of roughly $13 billion. The gap up move sent shares above a 35.09 buy point in a six-month cup base.Adobe Systems jumped 3% in early trade, after reporting better-than-expected 44% gains in earnings and a 27% rise in revenue. The company also guided third-quarter sales and earnings to above consensus views. Adobe shares spiked to a new high, leaving them extended above a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average.Winnebago (WGO) rolled up a 4% gain at the open, as a 75% surge in revenue and a 134% leap in gross profit apparently outweighed a miss on its earnings per share line for its fiscal third quarter. The strong-volume gain was enough to pierce resistance at the stock's 10-week line, starting it up the right side of a six-month correction.CarMax (KMX) vaulted 5% higher on better-than-forecast first-quarter results. The company said delays in federal income tax refunds shifted some sales from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, helping results.  The stock has climbed 35% in the past 12 months, climbing from a February 2016 low.Overseas, in Asia, markets dropped hard in Tokyo and Hong Kong with benchmark indexes down 0.5% on each exchange. In Shanghai, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% after index provider MSCI voted to include 222 China-listed big cap A-share stocks in its emerging markets benchmark index.A shares are denominated in Chinese currency and were, until recently, restricted only to domestic investors.  Deutsche Banks X-Trackers Harvest CSI China A-Shares Fund (ASHR) rose 0.1% in premarket trade. Morgan Stanley's China A-Shares Fund (CAF) dipped 0.3%.Markets in Europe were under pressure, but off earlier lows in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 down 0.4%, Frankfurt's DAX off 0.3% and the CAC-40 in Paris sliding 0.5%.The U.S. dollar flattened into narrowly mixed trade. Gold gained 0.5% to near $1,245 an ounce. Bonds inched higher, trimming the 10-year yield by one basis point to 2.15%.In oil prices, U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude reversed early losses to rise 0.2% to just below $44 a barrel as investors waited on the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report, due out at 10 a.m. ET.Existing home sales numbers for May are due out from the National Association of Realtors at 10 a.m. ET.RELATED:This Tech Stock Nears A Breakout On Speculation Of Amazon BuyoutBiotech Breakouts: Biogen Spinoff Bioverativ In Buy Zone

294,ADBE,"Earnings for the second quarter kick off in earnest next week with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on the docket. Early indications point to another strong season.XS&P 500 companies are expected to report 8% earnings growth on a 4.6% gain in revenues, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S as of July 6. That's a big reversal from a 2.1% profit decline in Q2 2016 as the energy-led earnings slump extended to a fifth consecutive quarter. And it solidifies the comeback that has seen S&P 500 profit growth of 4.3%, 8% and 15.3% in the last three quarters.Apple (AAPL), which has returned to growth in the prior two quarters, should continue to show EPS and revenue gains when it reports on Aug. 1. That's despite many consumers awaiting the Apple iPhone 8 later this year. Due to its massive size, Apple has an outsized impact on overall S&P 500 earnings and especially the S&P 500 technology sector. Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) should see fat profit gains.That 8% overall earnings target for the second quarter is down 2 percentage points from the start of April, but that's half the usual four-point cut typically seen.That is fueling optimism on Wall Street that Q1's momentum — which saw earnings growth hit its highest level since 2011 — will continue into future quarters.""There is a lot more confidence in what is expected for Q3 than at this time last year,"" Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.One downside to the modest revisions: The markets may already be pricing in strong results. Investors have been taking profits in leading tech stocks over the past month.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings offers the opportunity for big gains or big losses. You may want to adopt this earnings options strategy to capture any upside while limiting your losses.Beyond Q2, S&P 500 companies should grow earnings 8.6% and 13.1% in Q3 and Q4, according to Thomson Reuters. They are estimated to grow earnings 11.3% in 2017 as a whole and 11.7% in 2018 vs. 1.4% in 2016.Profits and revenues have been robust from the roughly 5% of S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results so far, including Nike (NKE), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL). Of those 23 companies, 78% have beaten EPS estimates and 87% have topped revenue forecasts.In a typical quarter, 64% of companies overall beat earnings estimates and 59% beat revenue views.The energy, technology and financials sectors are expected to drive earnings growth in Q2 — a period over which the S&P 500 advanced 2.6% and set a new all-time closing of 2,453 on June 19.Oil and gas companies earnings should reverse higher after an outright loss a year earlier. But oil prices are down significantly from the start of 2017, which has hurt shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other energy stocks.Financials and technology, the two largest S&P 500 sectors, are expected to moderate earnings growth from the near-20% Q1 pace. But growth should still be solid, with financials up 7.6% and technology 11.2%, according to Thomson Reuters.Banks continue to see a deceleration in loan growth and unfavorable moves in bond yields, Mian said.Several Wall Street giants have warned of weak trading revenue in Q2, continuing the lackluster trend in 2017. That's a key reason why JPMorgan and Citigroup are expected to show little-to-no profit growth, while regional banks such Comerica (CMA) should see big EPS gains.Still, bank stocks large and small have been leading in recent weeks, helped by higher bond yields and massive buyback and dividend plans. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have moved past buy points to long-time highs, while Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and others are in buy zones.Technology is the only sector outside of energy that is expected to best the overall 8% S&P 500 gain. The sector also has gotten a boost from Adobe, Oracle and Micron Technology (MU), which smashed quarterly expectations in late June, Mian said. Expect strong growth for Alphabet and Facebook, he added.Health care, which has seen shares of health insurers and many biotechs soar in 2017, is estimated to grow earnings a tepid 2.3%. Other laggards are likely to include materials (4.3%), consumer staples (3.6%), industrials (2.4%), real estate (1.9%), telecom (1.1%) and consumer discretionary (0.9%).The utilities sector should post a 2.8% earnings decline. Of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, only industrials has seen an upward estimate revision for Q2 since the start of April.Zacks, which tracks sectors differently, expects aerospace, construction and industrial products to shine, with earnings growth of 49%, 15.6% and 11.9% respectively.Multinationals such as Apple, Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet and Facebook, are expected to see less drag from a strong dollar on their earnings.""The dollar was only 4% higher year over year in the second quarter on average, so we don't expect a major impact to earnings because of that,"" said Lindsey Bell, a CFRA investment strategist. The greenback's continued weakness since then should provide a tailwind to multinationals' Q3 earnings.Mian also expects multinationals to benefit from a notably improved overseas growth outlook.""A dividing line in the last earnings season was that more internationally oriented companies had a more positive view of business than those that are domestically oriented,"" he said. ""I expect that trend to continue.""Q2 earnings growth should top current analyst estimates, in keeping with historical trends. But matching Q1's blowout performance will be a tough order, Mian said.The first quarter saw double the growth pace that was expected at the start of the reporting cycle — and that is unlikely to be surpassed for the next few quarters, in Mian's view.RELATED:Q2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

295,ADBE,"Stocks showed small movement Monday, but small caps fell harder with the Russell 2000 retreating nearly 1.1%. In contrast, the S&P 500, up 3.1% last week, lost just 0.1%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell around 0.6% to 113.30. More importantly, the stock held above its key 50-day moving average. And Intel (INTC) helped prop up chipmakers with a 0.7% gain to 35.97. Intel has been working on a new saucerlike base since peaking at 38.36 in October.The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6% on Monday, following last week's 3.6% rally, but volume on fell about 6% vs. Friday's level, according to preliminary data. That's a sign that big funds weren't overly eager to sell positions and raise cash.The NYSE composite outperformed by losing just 0.1%. Big Board turnover grew. The S&P 500 was also off just 0.1% while mega-cap names were virtually flat. Due to the small declines, the 500 avoided getting tagged with a new distribution day, or bout of heavy professional selling. The distribution count on the 500 is now at 2, down from 8 on Nov. 1, according to the IBD Market Pulse table found in each daily Big Picture column.A low distribution day count implies that large funds, banks, pension plans and the like are accumulating shares on net. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating on the S&P 500 is positive at C+ as of Friday's close.The S&P 100 was up a fraction while the Dow Jones industrials edged 0.2% ahead.Oil and gas royalty trust, oil drilling, and international oil and gas exploration companies paced the upside with gains of 1% or more. IBD's Medical-Diversified group, which includes Dow 30 component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and the Internet-Network Solutions group also excelled with gains of 2% and 1%, respectively.J&J jumped nearly 3% to 115.36 in heavy turnover, stopping short of retaking its 50- and 200-day lines. The stock is just 8% below a 52-week peak, but it's still in the early stages of forming a potential new base.The worst declines in terms of industry groups belonged to department store chains (down more than 4%), airlines (-3%), leisure products (-3%) and steel production (off more than 2%). Southwest bank, cement and aggregate, security software and consumer loan companies also sold off hard.Back to the tech sector, Microsoft (MSFT) rose 0.3% to 62.17, extending its gains from a breakout past a 58.80 base-on-base buy point to 5.7%. The mega cap is now slightly extended past the 5% proper buying range.Qualcomm (QCOM), which makes the IBD Dividend Leaders screen, gave up little ground as it builds on gains since a July 21 breakaway gap past a bottoming base buy point of 56.37. Yet the stock may also be working on a new flat-base-like structure. Qualcomm was also showcased in today's The Income Investor column.Netflix (NFLX) continues to show tight action after a strong rally last week. Down just 5 cents on Monday to 122.83, the video streaming giant is still above an aggressive entry point near 120, according to IBD Leaderboard. The standard buy point is 129.39.In the energy sector, numerous oil and gas explorers struggled to hold big opening gains in the wake of another surprise agreement among non-OPEC oil-producing nations to join in the body's historic decision to cut overall production starting in January.Britain's integrated oil major BP (BP) rallied more than 1% to 36.51, at one point getting as high as 36.96, or just a few cents above a 36.93 cup buy point. The eight-week cup sits within a much longer and deeper bottoming base pattern. Halliburton (HAL) ran up to a session high of 56.08 before sinking back to 54.49, up just 0.5%. The oilfield services giant, however, has climbed more than 16% since clearing a 47 flat-base buy point in early October.At one point, Halliburton pulled back below the 47 entry to an intraday low of 45.08, but that 4% drop was not enough to trigger the 8% loss-cutting sell rule following a good breakout.Wall Street sees Halliburton reversing from a net loss of 5 cents a share in 2016 to a net profit of $1.03 a share in 2017.The week features only a sliver of companies reporting quarterly results, but they include two major big-cap software names, Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The latter is expected to grow fourth-quarter profit 39% to 86 cents a share. Over the prior six quarters, earnings have grown on average 53.2%.In August, Adobe pushed past a 100.66 flat-base entry point and rallied more than 10% before fading. Yet in its most recent correction, the stock found bullish support at the long-term 200-day moving average. Watch to see if the stock can hurdle its 50-day moving average, which would boost the odds of a fresh breakout.Besides the upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates on Wednesday, keep an eye out for the November report on producer level prices. The Econoday consensus forecast calls for a 0.2% month-to-month rise.RELATED:Why Did Apple Form A Bottoming Base, And How Can Investors Profit From It?Why Apple Is Forming A New Base And Flexing Strength AgainWhy Is Adobe A Top Tech Stock Pick For 2017?Will Apple Invest In A Massive Softbank Fund?

296,ADBE,"Online shopping through Friday afternoon, brought good cheer to Amazon.com (AMZN) and to the online sales of other retailers, including Target (T) and Wal-Mart (WMT), with Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales data still to come.Black Friday online sales hit $1.17 billion as of 3 p.m. ET, according to Adobe Systems (ADBE). Sales are on track to rise 11.3% vs. a year earlier to $3 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights, with mobile sales topping $1 billion.Online sales on Thanksgiving Day reached $1.93 billion, up 11.5%, Adobe said. That was slightly lower than the $2 billion expected, which Adobe said was likely due to heavy discounting in the early hours of the holiday and higher-than-expected online revenue the day before Thanksgiving. E-commerce sales on Wednesday totaled $1.57 billion, up 19%, the market tracker said.Adobe said there were record sales via mobile devices, with a record $771 million of the sales coming from mobile devices. Mobile accounted for 57% of visits and 40% of purchases (27% smartphones, 13% tablets). It said conversions in the final hours of shopping Thursday were strong.While consumer spending on tablets is up significantly this year, smartphones continued to increase their share in mobile purchases, driving more than twice as many sales on Thanksgiving Day (27% vs. 22% on Thanksgiving in 2015) than tablets (13% vs 15% in 2015). Adobe said it measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers. It said tablets, TVs, toys and pet care items are seeing much larger discounts than last year, with most promotions coming through search advertising and shopper-helper sites like RetailMeNot (SALE).IBD'S TAKE: Black Friday and Cyber Monday always provide a sales surge for Amazon, but shares are trading about 8% below their all-time high set on Oct. 6, and also below the key 50-day moving average. The stock has been a tech leader much of this year, but it of course is not alone. Check out IBD's Tech Leaders to keep up to date.Amazon said it's on pace to surpass last year's Black Friday in terms of the number of items ordered. Amazon mobile orders from U.S. customers onThanksgiving Day exceeded both Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday tallies last year.The company said its best-selling items include the Amazon Echo — a cylindrical speaker system that connects to the internet via Bluetooth and functions as a digital butler, infused with artificial intelligence and voiced by Alexa. Other hot sellers include the Echo Dot, a compact version of Alexa, and the Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.Amazon said other best-selling deals on Black Friday so far include the Instant Pot Multi-Functional Cooker, Hasbro's (HAS) ""Pie Face!"" game, Wemo Switch smart plug (works with Amazon Alexa) and Sennheiser HD 598 Headphones.In just the first few hours of Black Friday, Amazon customers have ordered more than 100,000 toys, it said. Amazon is also getting ready for the shopping week that starts with Cyber Monday, this Monday. Amazon said it will have more than 75,000 deals that week. Last year on Cyber Monday, Amazon customers ordered more than 54 million items worldwide — a record-breaking 629 items per second.Amazon stock rose 25 cents to 780.37 in the shortened session for the stock market today. The market closed at 1 p.m. ET. Amazon shares have been in consolidation since hitting a record high of 847.21 on Oct. 6.Multiple retailers are jumping on the online sales bonanza, with promotions by Wal-Mart, Target and others. Also getting in on the action is China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), though its Tmall.com website. Wal-Mart launched its online sales deals at midnight on Friday. Target said it's seeing strong demand for Apple (AAPL) iPads and Watches.Alibaba's Tmall Global website, a cross-border e-commerce platform, for the first time has partnered with several U.S. brands including Macy's (M), Costco Wholesale (COST) and Target to launch the ""Same Products, Same Time, Same Price, Same Black Friday"" campaign, Alibaba said. Chinese consumers have the opportunity to purchase select products for the same prices at which they're sold offline on Black Friday in the U.S.A research note by Drexel Hamilton said Apple remains one of the best-positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, a new Apple Watch and a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.Last year Apple sat out Black Friday. It returned this year, offering Apple gift cards for the purchase of items. For the purchase of an iPhone, for example, Apple is offering gift cards from $25 to $50. For the Mac, Apple is offering $150 gift cards.RELATED:Apple Joins Black Friday Sales FrenzyThanksgiving Online Sales Surge; Target CEO Bullish

297,ADBE,"Analysts at BTIG lowered their holiday outlook on Monday on higher ""promotionally-driven sales"" as spending and traffic fell over the big holiday shopping weekend.BTIG now sees 2016 holiday same-store sales rising 1.7% down from the 2% forecast in September. The analysts cited a report from ShopperTrak that found traffic at brick & mortar stores traffic fell 1% on Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales while RetailNext said sales at brick & mortar stores fell 5%.The analysts found full parking lots at Best Buy (BBY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) early on Black Friday but said shoppers were bargain hunters trying to score deep discounts.Average spending per person fell 3% to $289.19 vs. 2015, according to a Friday-Saturday NRF survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics. More people shopped online vs. in stores, NRF said.Best Buy shares slid 2.7% to 45.34 on the stock market today. Wal-Mart shares fell 4 cents to 71.19.BTIG said that the four-day holiday weekend will account for 18% to 21% of total holiday sales with Black Friday itself representing 8%-10% of total holiday sales.Some shoppers skipped long lines and crowded parking lots to shop online. E-commerce sales over the holiday rose 17.7% to $5.3 billion from 2015.Total online sales rose 16.4% to $9.36 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights. Amazon (AMZN) said Thursday-Friday sales would top a year earlier. Given that Amazon has outpaced online sales growth in recent years, that's a low bar.Amazon's best-selling items over the weekend were the Dot, a low-end version of its Amazon Echo smart speaker, and the Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.But Amazon products weren't the most sought after electronic items.According to Adobe (ADBE) report the five top-selling electronic products on Black Friday were Apple (AAPL) iPads, Samsung 4K TVs, Apple MacBook Air notebooks, LG TVs and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox game consoles.Amazon shares fell 1.7% to 766.77, pulling back from a test of its 50-day line. It has buy point of 847.31. Apple was off 0.2% to 111.57, above an old buy point of 110.33. It's also in a flat base with a potential buy point of 118.79.

298,ADBE,"Consumer electronics sold briskly over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend thanks to aggressive discounts and strong demand for 4K ultra-high definition televisions, tablets, video game consoles and other devices.Apple (AAPL), iRobot (IRBT), Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE) were among the companies cited by research firms as having top-selling gadgets during the opening weekend of holiday shopping. IRobot stock hit an all-time high Monday.Online marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) on Saturday said the five top-selling electronic products on Black Friday were Apple iPads, Samsung 4K TVs, Apple MacBook Air notebooks, LG TVs and Microsoft Xbox game consoles. It also listed DJI Phantom drones as one of the five best-selling toys on Black Friday.IBD'S TAKE: IRobot stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 4 out of 12 stocks in IBD's Household-Appliances/Wares industry group. To see which companies lead that group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The National Retail Federation cited a ""heavy promotional"" environment this year and said inventories were ""much leaner"" compared with last year.Tech products most likely to be out of stock this weekend included Nintendo's (NTDOY) NES Classic console and 3DS XL handheld, Sony's PlayStation VR bundle and PlayStation 4 ""Call of Duty Black Ops"" console bundle, Apple's Beats Solo headphones, and Microsoft's Xbox One S ""Madden NFL 17"" console bundle.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White on Monday said Apple is well positioned for the holiday shopping season because of strong demand for its iPhone 7 series smartphones, new Apple Watches, and new MacBook Pro laptops.The Consumer Technology Association on Sunday said televisions were the No. 1 tech item purchased during Black Friday sales, followed by tablets, smartphones, video game consoles, and tech accessories.""While perennial Black Friday tech strongholds such as televisions, video game consoles and laptops dominated shoppers' baskets, it was also a breakout year for emerging tech,"" CTA Chief Economist Shawn DuBravac said in a statement. ""These nascent devices, including digital assistant devices, virtual reality and drones, landed on the front page of retailer's Black Friday ads — and shopper's baskets — for the first time this year.""Digital assistant devices include Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo smart speakers and Alphabet's (GOOGL) rival Google Home product. Both devices respond to spoken commands and questions.In the category of virtual reality headsets, Sony's PlayStation VR is the newest entrant to the market, joining Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive.Also seeing robust demand this holiday season are home-cleaning robots from market leader iRobot.Dougherty analyst Jon Fisher said his Thanksgiving-weekend retail checks indicated that iRobot's Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners are ""roaring off the shelves.""Fisher reiterated his buy rating on iRobot with a price target of 65 in a note Sunday. IRobot stock rose 1.3% on the stock market today to 55.79. Intraday, shares hit an all-time high of 56.16.""Even with more shelf space allocated to Roombas than competitor products, the sell through for Roomba was so strong that there were actually very few remaining on store shelves,"" Fisher said in his research report. ""At two stores that we visited, store clerks actually commented that it was a challenge to keep the shelf space fully stocked. At another store that we visited, a sales clerk informed us that they had just sold four Roombas within 30 minutes of our arrival.""RELATED:Roomba Maker iRobot Hopes To Clean Up This ChristmasApple Poised For Prime Spot Under Christmas TreeWireless Headphones, 4K TVs, Drones Top Christmas Wish Lists

North Korea's latest moves revived geopolitical concerns.XNasdaq 100 futures fell 0.4% vs. fair value while Dow futures were 0.1% higher and S&P 500 futures were roughly flat. The dollar, which has been trending lower, retreated vs. the Japanese yen on news that North Korea successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time.North Korea's Kim Jong Un promised more ""gift packages"" for America. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed that North Korea launched an ICBM, calling it a ""new escalation"" that will brought before the United Nations Security Council. The U.S. and South Korea ordered a significant live-fire missile test as a response, just hours after China and Russia urged the two countries to halt big military exercises on the Korean Peninsula.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.25% after initially falling modestly while South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3%. China's Shanghai composite climbed 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.5%. In European trade intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE was flat, Germany's Dax was little changed and France's CAC-40 climbed 0.1%.The overnight action exacerbates the Jekyll-and-Hyde market split underway for the last few weeks.On Monday,  Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and many other leading big-cap titans pushed the Nasdaq composite lower again after another failed attempt at retaking the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average powered to a record high and S&P 500 index edged higher, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) leading the Dow while Bank of America (BAC) cleared a buy point.As the classic tale of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" shows, a split personality is unstable. While there are leaders and laggards, the major averages generally follow the same path. So will Bank of America and JPMorgan carry the day, or does the market succumb to Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google and a tech-led correction?Apple was the first and most notable tech titan to undercut its 50-day moving average on June 10, following the sudden tech stock reversal on June 9. In recent days, Apple has been relatively stable, holding in a consolidation beneath its 50-day, but not heading below that area. But it certainly isn't showing leadership either.Facebook fell 1.9% on Monday, finally closing below its 50-day line after several tests. Amazon, which finished last week just pennies below the 50-day, initially rallied Monday but then reversed for a 1.5% loss, clearly separating from its support line. Netflix, the smallest of the FANG internet giants, continued to descend, sliding 2.2% to its lowest level since late April. Google parent Alphabet lost 1.1%, back to late April prices.Among other big techs, Microsoft (MSFT) retreated 1.1%, continuing to find 50-day resistance.A slew of chip and chip-equipment stocks have tumbled through their key support lines in recent days and weeks. Even the holdouts are running into trouble.Nvidia (NVDA) is still above its 50-day line, but is rapidly approaching that level after climax-like action from May 9-June 9. Micron Technology (MU), which reversed lower Friday despite seemingly strong earnings and guidance, fell sharply on Monday, undercutting its 50-day line.Workday (WDAY), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Paycom (PAYC) are top software firms that dropped below the 50-day on Monday.BofA, JPMorgan and other bank stocks have surged after they announced huge stock buybacks and dividend hikes last week following the completion of the second round of annual stress tests. A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields, partly due to a stronger eurozone economy that's lifting German bund yields and the euro, should be good for banks.JPMorgan rose 1.5% on Monday to 92.75, closing in on a 94.08 cup base. BofA advanced 1.7% to 24.68, closing above a 24.35 aggressive buy point. It's approaching a conventional entry of 25.90.  Investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and superregionals Comerica (CMA) and Keycorp (KEY) are just below buy points themselves.The Dow industrials and S&P 500 have advanced even though the Dow includes Apple and Microsoft (and laggard techs Intel (INTC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO)), while the S&P 500 has all those plus a plethora of chip, internet and software plays.

This is the tech giant's second downgrade in a week.Analysts Abhey Lamba and Parthiv Varadarajan said excitement from the iPhone 8 has already been factored into the stock price.""The stock has meaningfully outperformed on a YTD (year-to-date) basis and we believe enthusiasm around the coming product cycle is fully captured at current levels, with limited upside to estimates from here on out,"" they wrote in a note.The analysts are expecting a strong holiday product cycle for Apple but most of the iPhone 8 sales will be upgrades, not new customers.Apple shares fell 2.5% to close at 145.32 on the stock market today, after tumbling 3.9% Friday. Apple had been forming a shallow base with a potential buy point at 156.75, but now it could come crashing below its 50-day line when markets open.Adobe was downgraded to sell from hold at Pivotal Research Group.

304,ADBE,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout. And Tencent (TCEHY) pulled back into its three-weeks-tight pattern.But Alibaba (BABA) remains strong, and YY (YY) found support above its 50-day and is still in buy range.IBD's semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor fabless groups have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, a few days after the chip equipment group undercut that level.Apple iPhone chipmakers in particular are struggling. Broadcom (AVGO) finally fell below its 50-day line on Thursday after several other Apple chip plays did the same, including Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI).A slew of top-rated chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), are below their 50-day lines.Nvidia (NVDA) remains a standout.Fiber-optic stocks have been volatile leaders over the past year, as internet giants ramp up data centers, China beefs up infrastructure and Verizon (VZ) expands its high-speed metro broadband networks.But the Telecom-Fiber Optic group has fallen through its 50-day line. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), one of the hottest stocks in the group, is finding resistance there this week. Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

305,ADBE,"Investors in Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) and countless other companies are due for a wake-up call in coming months, and this is one instance where hitting the snooze button isn't a good idea.A set of new accounting rules that govern revenue recognition — said to be the biggest change in standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 — will take effect next year, affecting either fiscal 2018 or 2019 for all U.S. companies.The accounting changes are under the radar of many investors, who may scramble to make sense of what's happening with the stocks, many of them blue chips like Microsoft, into which they've poured their money.Under the designation of FASB 606 — FASB is an acronym for the Financial Accounting Standards Board — the new rules will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. It's geared to help investors, but there could be near-term pain. Many companies will likely speed up revenue recognition and possibly make earnings more volatile from quarter to quarter.""We expect that (the new rules) will cause significant investor confusion over the next 12 months to the financial analysis of companies ranging from small companies up to the largest, including Microsoft,"" said a recent report from Citigroup.But the rules aim to address a big problem.While top-line growth is a critical metric for investors, revenue recognition has been a weak link in accounting standards. With the new rules, Wall Street analysts and investors should get a better feel for how a company is doing and whether business is deteriorating or booming.One goal is providing more transparency in sales backlogs, or revenue not yet recognized from contracts already signed. Some companies state backlogs, some don't. Now they'll have to put a number on it in many industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.In regulatory filings, companies also will be required to disclose more information on contracts. That should give investors and analysts more data on what risks or uncertainties companies face. Companies talk about things like pension costs in filings but don't provide the same transparency on revenue issues.Industries with the most ""deferred revenue"" — sales booked over time — will be most affected by FASB 606, says a Morgan Stanley report. Those include software, communications equipment, airlines, aerospace and defense.In industries that will be impacted most by the new rules, some analysts are talking about using more steady free cash flow as an alternative metric to earnings per share. The reason is free cash flow will be less impacted by the 606 rules.""I would expect to see more disclosures, certainly by the third quarter, on whether the standard is going to affect revenue recognition,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.Microsoft is expected to be one of the prominent early adopters of the new standard. It reports its 2017 fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on July 20, and a few weeks later the company plans to restate earnings for the prior two years.Also on the list with Microsoft are a number of other Dow components, including General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and Verizon Communications (VZ).A wide swath of other firms in many industries are expected to be impacted. They include Amazon.com (AMZN), American Airlines (AAL), AT&T (T), Electronic Arts (EA) and General Dynamics (GD). Others are First Solar (FLSR), Monsanto (MON) and T-Mobile US (TMUS)Companies that recognize more revenue upfront could have more earnings volatility. Surprises to the upside may be followed by sudden, equally surprising shortfalls. Companies prefer that a total contract value be recognized over time, which provides more flexibility in smoothing out earnings to meet consensus estimates.""New principle-based revenue rules will likely accelerate revenue recognition, while also introducing more volatility,"" said Snehaja Mogre, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report. ""As the new standard will not impact actual cash flows, we expect investors to increase their reliance on cash flow metrics.""Many companies are still studying the new FASB 606 rules, but crunch time is coming. Expectations run high that many companies will finally declare whether the 606 standard is ""material"" or not to financial results on June- or September-quarter earnings calls.In Microsoft's case, the new standard is expected to impact Windows 10 revenue in particular. Microsoft is expected to book Windows 10 revenue when it bills hardware makers rather than over the life of a PC or device using the software. Microsoft in May briefed financial analysts, telling them that in fiscal 2016 revenue would have been about 7% higher —$6 billion or so — had it used the new revenue standard back then.While Microsoft will forecast earnings in July for its first fiscal quarter of 2018, it plans to update guidance in August using the new revenue recognition standard. When briefing analysts in May, Microsoft made the point that the FASB 606 rules will not impact free cash flow.""Net-net, investors could start paying more attention to cash flows given increasing revenue variability,"" Brent Bracelin, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a recent note to clients.While some companies will opt to restate earnings for prior years, most are expected to take a ""modified"" compliance route, applying the new rules on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward, adjusting results for new contracts, says Betsy Meter, an audit partner at KPMG.""It's industry-driven mainly,"" she said. Companies that delay, though, will be less likely to take Microsoft's approach and restate prior-year earnings, which gives investors more information.""For industries where there is a significant impact, a full retrospective approach will give them some history and visibility,"" Meter added.Some of the biggest names in tech, though, see little impact. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among tech companies that expect little impact from the new standard. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) has not been heard from.In general, the rules are expected to affect companies with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue and contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks. And they will also affect companies that use third-party sales distribution channels.Revenue from Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers will be booked earlier, rather than when consumers actually buy the devices, says a Connor Group report. The new rules also will impact Amazon gift cards, says the report.Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over the term of contracts. AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of an installment payment plan.Salesforce.com (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) are among software companies still studying the impact of 606 rules. Workday (WDAY) has decided to  remove guidance for billings, a sales growth metric,  as it adopts the new accounting rules. It's unclear how many other companies may follow suit on billings.Companies with cloud-based, software-as-a-servicer (SaaS) business models that involve renewable subscriptions are expected to be less impacted than those that sell software installed on a customer's own in-house computers.Only about 7% of SaaS provider ServiceNow's (NOW) revenue comes from on-premise licenses, analysts say. Splunk (SPLK) and Ansys (ANSS), on the other hand, garner a large chunk of revenue from on-premise deals, says a William Blair report.While Microsoft will likely book Windows 10 revenue sooner, its online Office 365 sales will be less affected. Cloud-based software is rented via the internet.""SaaS models should see the least impact from the new standard, given that software is hosted and delivered over broadband connections vs. software installed on-premise,"" said Bracelin.Cisco Systems (CSCO), a big computer networking gear maker, could see its deferred revenue impacted, he says.Many software companies may be in the process of renegotiating contracts to ease the impact of rule 606, says KPMG's Meter.Some software makers, such as Autodesk (ADSK), have already transitioned business models to subscription licenses for cloud software. Under the 606 rules, only software that is continuously updated is eligible for revenue recognition over time, or ""ratably.""A lot of U.S. companies had hoped for further delays in carrying out the 606 rules, which have been in the works for more than a decade.""Companies know the time is upon them to get going,"" said Stallings at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""There's acceptance that this is going live on Jan. 1, 2018, for calendar-year companies.""RELATED:Workday Ends Billings Guidance In Accounting Shift, Stock Falls

308,ADBE,"Stocks stayed in the doghouse with light to moderate losses in afternoon trading Thursday. Commodities fell. Long U.S. government bonds slipped, sending the 10-year Treasury yield back above 1.80%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, backtracked 1.5% to 109.88 in light volume, putting the stock just below its original 110.33 buy point in a new bottoming base that formed from April to September this year.IBD's study of past big stock market winners has shown that up to as many as four out of every 10 of these stocks will drop back to or near the proper buy point, shaking out some weak holders, before resuming the rally.Should traders get back into Apple now? IBD's rule is to wait for strength to return in both the stock and the market, which currently has an outlook of ""Uptrend under pressure"" as noted by IBD's daily Big Picture column.The Nasdaq composite slumped 0.5% in volume running slightly higher than the same time Wednesday, while the S&P 500 eased 0.2% in slower turnover. But large-cap software firm Adobe (ADBE) showed strength, gaining more than 1.6% to 107.55 in a second test of the 50-day moving average.The publishing and digital graphics software giant has gained more than 9% past a 98.10 base on base pattern that it initially cleared on May 24.The Dow Jones industrials were flat. None of the 30 components fell 1 point or more.Dow 30 component Walt Disney (DIS) led the upside, rising more than 1.5% to 93.33 and climbing back above the 50-day moving average. But the entertainment giant still lies below the key long-term 200-day line and has yet to produce any IBD-type bases that could set up a solid breakout. In November 2015, a breakout from a 117.68 cup-with-handle base lost juice after three days of gains, and Disney backtracked all the way down to a 52-week low of 86.25, down 29% from its all-time peak of 122.08.Apple initially broke out Sept. 14, rising 3.5% in triple normal volume in what became its first CAN SLIM-style breakout in more than a year. Since then, reports have generally favored the tech giant, from Samsung's missteps with the Galaxy Note 7 to strong orders for the iPhone 7 reported by some telecom carriers to the company's own report that services revenue continues to rise at strong double-digit pace.However, Apple still faces an overall revenue growth crisis, with sales dipping 13%, 15% and 9% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters. Wall Street expects the sales drought to end in the current fiscal first quarter, however; Apple is seen growing revenue in the December-ending quarter by 1.6% to $77.1 billion, then follow that up with an 8.1% top-line gain to $54.7 billion in Q2 (ending in March 2017).Elsewhere in the stock market today, Microsemi (MSCC) blasted more than 15% higher to an all-time high of 48.43 on reports that fellow mixed signal chip expert Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is approaching the company for a potential acquisition. Microsemi recorded $1.25 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal year ended in September 2015, up 9%, while Skyworks posted $3.26 billion in FY 2015 revenue.Microsemi also sports solid earnings that belie its dull 69 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. In FY 2015, the Aliso Viejo, Calif., firm earned $2.73 a share, up 25% vs. a year ago and nearly four times the 75 cents it earned per share in FY 2009. Pretax margin was 22.9% in FY 2015, the highest in four years.Crude oil continued to tank, as WTI futures fell another 1.6% to $44.61 a barrel. On Wednesday, the EIA shocked investors by reporting a huge bulge in weekly U.S. crude oil inventories. WTI crude has now fallen 14% below its recent Oct. 19 peak of $51.60 and has also corrected 17% from its 52-week high of $53.66.The Dow utilities edged nearly 0.2% higher.RELATED:When Did Apple Break Out?Apple Losing Buy Point, Microsoft On EdgeIs Is Still Time To Be Cautious In Buying Breakouts?Do You Know How To Spot The Bottoming Base?Is Apple's iPhone Going The Way Of The Mac, OS-Wise?When Is The Best Time To Buy A High-Growth Stock?

317,ADBE,"X The Nasdaq composite on Wednesday deflected yet another pounding in crude oil futures and related companies in the stock market, moving moderately higher as the Dow Jones industrial average harbored light losses late in Wall Street's regular session.The Nasdaq composite, up 0.7% at around 3:45 p.m. New York time, is stretching its year-to-date lead over the S&P 500 (down fractionally Wednesday) and the Dow Jones industrials (down 0.2%) despite showing five distribution days over the past 25 sessions. Volume on Wednesday is running higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday and lower on the Nasdaq.IBD's Big Picture column tracks heavy institutional selling in the form of distribution days, as witnessed in the Nasdaq on Tuesday (down 0.8%, higher volume than on Monday); a sudden rash of big declines in heavier volume than the prior session is enough to kill a bull market.The Nasdaq is up nearly 16% since Jan. 1, towering over the S&P 500's 8.8% advance. The Dow Jones industrial average is also lagging after a 13.4% gain in 2016, up 8.3% so far this year.Buying in the biotech and software sectors continued unabated in the aftermath of solid quarterly results from the likes of Adobe Systems (ADBE) (extended after a breakout at 111.19 in January) and Red Hat (RHT) (also extended from an 81.24 early entry in a long, choppy first-stage base).In the biotech group, which jumped to No. 31 among IBD's 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance, Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) all pumped more than 5% higher in heavy turnover, showing the kind of action seen by iPhone giant Apple (AAPL) during its big runs in the mid-2000s and early part of the 2010s.Celgene has a market value of $103 billion, Regeneron is at $55 billion, and Vertex at $33 billion, vs. $760 billion for the iPhone, iPad and MacBook maker.When a stock breaks out, it tends to already be close to 52-week or all-time highs, already be trading above the 50- and 200-day moving averages, show a tremendous increase in share volume, and show strong finishes during its up sessions in prices.That's definitely the case with the three biomedical names mentioned above. All three are highly profitable developers of novel therapies to address difficult diseases and chronic conditions.Celgene ran 5% higher to 132.38 and powered past a 127.74 cup-base buy point in volume that is currently triple usual levels. The stock's 50-day average volume is 3.7 million shares. That cup could be seen as part of a long saucer base that goes all the way back to its July 2015 peak of 140.72.Notice on a weekly chart how Celgene had broken out of a three-month saucer pattern at 129.16 in July 2015, but did a hairpin curve lower and undercut the low of that base. Such action was a healthy shakeout of uncommitted investors and reset the base count back to zero. The Street sees first-quarter profit at the Summit, N.J., firm rising 24% to $1.78 a share. Celgene has posted EPS increases of 17%, 23%, 17%, 28%, 36% and 27% in the prior six quarters.Celgene sports an outstanding 98 Composite Rating and a 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if its 68 Relative Price Strength score improves in the near term.Regeneron (97 Composite Rating, 94 EPS Rating) is extended from a first-stage bottoming-base entry at 453.06 as shares have soared more than 13% so far this week to 521.71. However, notice on a weekly chart how the stock may run into some upside resistance in the 550 to 590 price level.Vertex (98 Composite, 79 EPS) surged 5% to 133.30 in fast turnover and is moving further past a recent handle on a long base, giving a solid entry at 122.06 (10 cents above the May 2 intraday high). In the handle, the stock sloped lower along the intraday lows and corrected no more than 7%.Back to Apple, the megacap tech is showing it still may have the wherewithal to recover from a sharp sell-off in the prior two weeks that triggered two key sell signals (read this Stock Market Today column to learn more about the exact sell rules).Apple gained around 0.6% to 145.59. Volume is light, but the stock is limiting its drop below the 50-day moving average to around 2%.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating remains strong for now at 85, much better than the lowly 59 seen at the start of the year. However, keep in mind that the RS Rating covers 12 months' worth of price action vs. the rest of the market. Extra weight is given to the most recent three months' worth of action.There are plenty of reasons for long-term holders with a thick profit cushion to keep holding: 1) Apple is still well above its long-term 200-day moving average; 2) earnings picture is improving, with FY 2017 profit seen up 8% and FY 2018 profit up 18%; revenue growth in Apple's services unit is currently at solid double-digit pace; and 4) the likelihood of a major iPhone replacement cycle beginning in the fourth quarter of the current calendar year is very high.IBD's TAKE: One way to track emerging industry sector rotation within the market is to watch changes in the IBD 50. Right now, it's still chock-full of electronic, internet, computer and networking-related stocks. But will medicals and biotechs stage a larger presence. Go here every day to watch new leaders unfold, presenting wonderful new opportunities for investing profits.In the IBD 50, tech leaders Nvidia (NVDA), Coherent (COHR) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) have all recovered nicely from price spills in the prior two weeks and remain in solid uptrends.RELATED:Investor's Corner: The Bottoming Base And How It Makes Money For Astute TradersInvestor's Corner II: Why Apple Formed A Bottoming Base In 2009Where Is The Market Headed?

318,ADBE,"XStocks trekked lower Tuesday but gave back only a piece of the ground gained on Monday.The Nasdaq took the hardest hit, falling 0.8%. The S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average drifted down 0.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on both exchanges coming in higher than Monday's levels.West Texas intermediate crude dropped to just above $43 a barrel as oil sloughed off another 2%, undercutting a May low to settle at its lowest point since November. But a move that would've sent oil-related stocks crowding the lowest slots on the Dow and S&P 500 barely even registered.   Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) dropped less than 1%.  Oil stocks posted only five of the day's 20 worst losses among S&P 500 stocks.General Electric (GE) was the Dow's worst performer, down 2% in weak trade.  Apple (AAPL) tumbled 0.8%, and all four of the FANG stocks ended lower, despite a price target increase for Netflix (NFLX).Medicals, drugmakers and biotechs posted a strong session. Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) easily topped the Dow industrials, up 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively.  IBD 50 stock Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) led both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. (Biotechs and drugmakers took the day's top seven gains among Nasdaq 100 stocks.)Regeneron surged 5% to reach a 17-month high, despite Novartis (NVS) reporting its RTH258 macular degeneration drug had outperformed Regeneron's Eylea in a head-to-head clinical trial. Regeneron is up 9% since clearing a six-month cup base in May. Novartis shares rose 0.2% Tuesday.Alexion jumped 3% after regulatory filings showed CEO Ludwig Hanson made a purchase of company shares worth $1.1 billion.IBD 50 and Leaderboard stock Floor & Decor (FND) ended 2% higher after backing down from its early highs. The gain left shares in a buy range above a 43.20 buy point, settling 109% above their April IPO price.Retail was Tuesday's worst-performing industry, as Dillard's (DDS) and J.C. Penney (JCP) each dropped 5%.  Ross Stores (ROST) shed almost 5%, the worst decline among Nasdaq 100 stocks.Several big names are scheduled to roll out earnings reports after the close, with Adobe Systems (ADBE), FedEx (FDX) and Red Hat (RHT) topping the list.RELATED:These Biotechs Are Leading The Industry To A 3-Month HighAmazon Gets Ratings Upgrade After Whole Foods Buy: Is Grubhub Next?

320,ADBE,"Apple (AAPL) on Thursday unveiled a redesigned MacBook Pro notebook that replaces the function keys with a touchscreen strip for application commands and shortcuts called the Touch Bar. Apple also debuted a cross-platform TV app that aims to simplify how people experience television.Investors appeared unimpressed with the product news. Apple stock fell 0.9% to 114.51 on the stock market today. It was the second straight down day for Apple shares since the company reported mixed fiscal fourth-quarter results on Tuesday.Apple announced its new MacBook Pro lineup and the TV app at a media event at its corporate headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.The new MacBook Pro computers come in two screen sizes. The 13-inch model starts at $1,799 and the 15-inch model starts at $2,399. Both are available for pre-order and will begin shipping in two to three weeks.The new notebooks also come with a Touch ID security feature built into the power button. The Touch ID fingerprint reader enables online purchases with the touch of a finger. It also can identify different users of the same PC to launch their personal settings and accounts.Apple's new MacBook Pro devices are thinner, smaller and lighter than their predecessors. They sport an all-aluminum body design, a jumbo-size Force Touch trackpad and improved display.The Touch Bar secondary display can be customized by the user and shows different functions depending on the application being used. Apple demonstrated professional creative apps like Final Cut Pro, Adobe (ADBE) Photoshop, and Djay Pro. Apple also showed how the Touch Bar would work with everyday apps like Mail, Messages and the Safari web browser.Microsoft (MSFT) is working on Touch Bar support for its Office applications, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Skype for Business.The 13-inch MacBook Pro features a dual-core Intel (INTC) Core i5 processor while the 15-inch model has a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor.""It is the new gold standard in notebook computers,"" said Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing.Apple also touted its new TV app, which works on the Apple TV set-top box, iPhone and iPad. It provides a unified experience for discovering and accessing TV shows and movies from multiple apps on Apple devices.Apple wants users to access live and on-demand video programming through its TV app. But not all video services are supported. Netflix (NFLX), for instance, is not available through the interface.The Apple TV app can respond to spoken requests using the Siri voice-activated personal assistant program.It will be available as a free software update for supported devices in December.RELATED:Microsoft Expands Surface PC Line Into Desktops, Unveils New Windows OS5 Takeaways From Apple's Mixed Q4 Earnings Report

321,ADBE,"Third-quarter earnings per share at ServiceNow (NOW) viewed by some as possible a takeover target of Salesforce.com (CRM), are expected to pop 38%, continuing its trend of rising earnings. The company posts Q3 earnings after the close Wednesday.The enterprise software provider — along with Pegasystems (PEGA) and Tableau Software (DATA) -- was among companies listed in a score card of possible Salesforce.com acquisitions that surfaced this month, after Salesforce said it would not bid for microblog Twitter (TWTR), amid much speculation. The list also included HubSpot (HUBS) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).ServiceNow's Q3 EPS minus items is expected to jump 38% from the year-earlier quarter, to 21 cents. That would be up from 15 cents in Q2 and 9 cents in Q1. The company, which went public in 2012, didn't notch its first positive EPS ex items number until Q3 2013, at a penny, and only last year recorded its first EPS ex items in the black.Revenue growth, though, is slowing. Analysts expect Q3 year-over-year revenue growth of 35% to $352 million, slowing from 38% in Q2 and 44% in Q1.In the December quarter, analysts estimate 32% revenue growth to $378 million and EPS ex items growth of 14% to 22 cents. Short interest, bets that the stock will fall, is relatively high in the software provider.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Computer-Software Enterprise group is ranked No. 13 out of 197 industry groups. Paycom Software has the highest Composite Rating, an important metric in CAN SLIM investing. Paycom is in the IBD 50, where the top-performing stocks also include Gigamon and NetEase.The cloud-based software provider's core business is software for information technology service management, or ITSM. ServiceNow aims to expand into providing software to help companies with human resources, customer service and security. By moving into customer-service software, ServiceNow would be competing more with Salesforce.com.At its analyst's day in May, ServiceNow — which surpassed $1 billion in revenue last year — touted its plan to reach $4 billion in revenue by 2020.ServiceNow stock fell 1.5% to 79.79 in the stock market today, after earlier rising a fraction to a nearly 11-month high. The stock is still in a buy zone from a 78.87 buy point out of a flat base, touched on Sept. 27, though investors are advised to be cautious with new buys in the current choppy market.RELATED:Salesforce.com M&A Scorecard Raises Questions On Growth, TargetsPaycom Finds Big Profits By Sticking To Smaller Firms, Simpler PlansServiceNow Q2 Beats But Guidance Barely Beats, Stock Falls

322,ADBE,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress.Trump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Apple was down a fraction to 110.88 and Alphabet slipped 0.8% 805.59. Microsoft shares dipped 0.5% to 60.17.RELATED:Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet Kings Of CashDrug Stocks Fly On Clinton Defeat

324,ADBE,"A Salesforce.com (CRM) score card for possible acquisition targets, as of May, included ServiceNow (NOW), Pegasystems (PEGA) and Tableau Software (DATA), but not Twitter (TWTR).The list of potential targets, part of an emailed presentations to Salesforce's board of directors, were among hacked emails belonging to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Salesforce.com director. The Wall Street Journal late Tuesday reported the email breach and  M&A targets, which it said was published in September in a ""hacktivists"" website called DCLeaks.While the leaked, 60-page presentation to Salesforce.com's board in May also included HubSpot (HUBS) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).In an email to IBD seeking comment, a Salesforce.com spokesperson shot down interest in Adobe, best known for Photoshop and other software for creative professionals such as graphics artists.""Salesforce has a disciplined and thoughtful M&A process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies, but acquire very few. The presentation is a broad survey of publicly traded companies in May 2016, and the appearance of company names on the list doesn't imply Salesforce ever intended to acquire them,"" the Salesforce.com email said.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Salesforce.com rebounded last week after the company CEO ruled out a bid for social media firm Twitter. Shares in Adobe have climbed 13% in 2016, as its cloud strategy jells, making it a member of the IBD Big Cap 20 list of top-performers among the biggest companies. See what other companies, including one other software maker, are on the list.One worry among analysts is that Salesforce.com's core growth could be slowing faster than expected, forcing management to look at acquisitions aggressively. But other analysts said many big companies often are active in such practices.""Given CRM has stated it looks at everything, we think this is a natural list, excluding Adobe,"" Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst, said in a research report.Salesforce.com has been on an acquisition spree, spending some $3.4 billion over the summer. One analyst speculated that out of the leaked potential targets, ServiceNow might be the best fit for Salesforce.com. Analysts said the price could range from $97 to $139 per share.ServiceNow stock rose 3.6% to 78.92 trading in the stock market today. Shares peaked in December, at 91.28. Pegasystems shot up 8.2% to 32.35, while Tableau leapt 3.6% to 48.91.Salesforce stock was flat Wednesday. ServiceNow has a market cap near $12.5 billion, compared with $50 billion for Salesforce.""We think a combination of Salesforce.com and ServiceNow makes sense on multiple levels and we would not be surprised if something materializes over the next couple of years. Its (ServiceNow's) scale, growth rates and attractive metrics will be preferred by Salesforce.com,"" Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said in a report.In the email to IBD, the Salesforce.com spokesperson said that ""Adobe appeared only as a benchmark to provide context.""Other companies on the Salesforce.com M&A score card included Workday (WDAY), Box (BOX) and Zendesk (ZEN).Salesforce.com had been interested in acquiring LinkedIn (LNKD), but the social network this year instead reached an agreement to be acquired by Microsoft (MSFT) for $26 billion.Salesforce.com in early October agreed to buy marketing data specialist Krux for a reported $700 million.Salesforce.com in August purchased business analytics platform BeyondCore. In July, Salesforce.com bought startup Quip for $582 million. And in June, Salesforce announced it was buying e-commerce platform Demandware for $3 billion.RELATED: Salesforce.com Officially Rules Out Twitter Bid

325,ADBE,"Tech stocks continued to lead the U.S. market higher Monday. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, showed potential of recouping some of the nearly 9% decline suffered over the prior two weeks and continuing its solid uptrend since its January breakout past an early-stage cup-with-handle base at 118.12.The stock rebounded 4.12, or 2.9%, to 146.39 in volume that edged 2% above normal levels. Apple is also up 26% since Jan. 1, more than double the 9.5% gain for the S&P 500. Both the 500 (up 0.8%) and the Dow Jones industrials (up 0.7%) hit all-time new highs in the stock market today.But at the market's close at 4 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite reaffirmed its market leadership, stretching its gain to 1.4% and holding practically at session highs, and extending its year-to-date gain to 15.9%.Small caps lagged, as the S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 0.5%.In the Dow 30 industrials, as many as nine members are up one point or more, including top-tier banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Reuters reported an estimate by a Morgan Stanley analyst that the main banks have as much as $150 billion in idle cash that could be funneled toward future dividend hikes and share buybacks.The Federal Reserve is set to release initial results on Thursday of a two-part annual stress test of major Wall Street banks. The stress test, created in the wake of the 2008-2009 subprime debt debacle, offers investors the central U.S. bank's view of how the nation's biggest lenders would handle a future economic or financial shock that could rattle the banking system.IBD analyzes the market action based on the movement of 197 industry groups and subgroups each day. Among the top 10 performers on Monday, six six hailed from the medical, computer and electronics sectors, including biotechs, generic drugs, integrated computer systems, computer networking and fabless semiconductors. You can check the individual stocks and ratings for all of these industry groups by going to MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock screening and charting service.Integrated oil, water utility, oil drilling and gas distribution companies led the market's downside, falling 0.9% or more. WTI crude oil futures slid 1.2% to $44.20 a barrel, while NYMEX natural gas futures collapsed more than 4% to $2.89 per 1 million BTUs, a new 3-month low. The Dow utility average slipped 0.4%. Long-term interest rates edged up, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury benchmark bond rising to 2.19%.Market breadth is positive, with winners beating losers by a nearly 9-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and an 18-11 ratio on the NYSE. Volume was down sharply on the main exchanges vs. the same time Friday. Stock and index options expired Friday, resulting in higher volume. This column last week noted that Apple posted a pair of sell signals for short-term investors: 1) dropping sharply below its 10-week moving average in accelerating volume; and 2) giving back all of its gains from a four-weeks-tight entry at 141.12. But the iPhone maker could also have been held by longtime holders who have a big enough profit cushion to give the stock a chance to rise back above the 10-week line or possibly test the longer-term 40-week moving average, roughly equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart.Apple is now less than three points away from retaking the 10-week line.Another fellow tech component in the Dow 30, Microsoft (MSFT) is holding up firmly since it broke out of a base-on-base setup at 58.80 in the week ended Oct. 21, 2016. The Xbox and business software firm, up 1% to 70.87, has gained nearly 24% since that October breakout. The S&P 500 has risen 14% over the same time frame. Both Apple and Microsoft pay dividends, and the annualized yields are 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively. The S&P 500 has a 1.91% yield. Microsoft's long-term cash payout growth is 15% each year, according to calculations by William O'Neil + Co.An ongoing rebound in fundamentals for both Apple and Microsoft, plus the outperformance of the tech sector in 2017 so far, are two reasons why the two megacap names have good prospects for beating the S&P 500's return this year.Among the top five sectors in IBD's daily ranking of 33 broad sectors, three of the top five are from tech land: Electronics (No. 1), Chips (No. 2), and Computer (No. 4). The other two in the top five are Leisure (No. 3) and Building (No. 5).IBD's TAKE: Apple, due to the majority of its revenue now coming from the iPhone, is part of the Telecom sector, which is now ranked No. 14 out of 33 broad industry sectors. A strong sector performance often helps a growth stock achieve above-average returns. See the entire list of sectors, ranked daily, via the Stock Lists section at Investors.com.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Microsoft ranks No. 3 within the desktop software industry group in terms of its 82 Composite Rating. It trails group leader Adobe Systems (ADBE) (96 Composite) and Red Hat (RHT) (92). However, Microsoft has successfully turned around its recent slump in revenue with gains of 1% and 8% vs. year-ago levels in the prior two quarters. Microsoft had suffered a six-quarter drought of flat or falling sales.Microsoft also sports a top-notch A rating for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity).Elsewhere in the stock market today, MasTec (MTZ) rallied more than 2% to 45.60 in quiet trade. Read more about the base this building and maintenance services firm is forming in IBD's Stocks Near A Buy Zone feature, available in the Stock Lists section at Investors.com.Broadcom (AVGO) rallied more than 2% to 241.15 in slightly above-average turnover; the top-quality semiconductor stock is once again extended a little more than 5% past a 227.85 flat-base entry. Lam Research (LRCX), a former Big Cap 20 member, hopped off its 50-day line, rising almost 2% to 150.97. Volume ran up 24% higher than the stock's 50-day average of 2.24 million shares.As noted in the latest IBD Weekly print edition, last week's negative reversal in heavy volume marked a sell signal following the chip equipment firm's outstanding run.Yet for now, the stock is getting vital buying support at the 50-day moving average, a key trait among leading growth stocks.Lam is No. 5 in the IBD 50. The Street expects earnings to rise 57% to $9.88 a share in fiscal 2017 ending in June; but growth is expected to slow to 10% in FY 2018. Keep in mind, however, that Lam has beaten the consensus profit estimate by nearly 6% on average over the past four quarters.Some consumer spending plays are also thriving; please check IBD Weekly in pages B1 to B4 and see the chart analysis for every minichart of the IBD 50. From April 11, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2016, the total return of the IBD 50 is 750%, vs. a 242% gain for the S&P 500 (excluding dividends).RELATED:Inside The IBD 50: So, How Much Further Can The Leaders FallHow Should I Track The Market: The Big Picture Can HelpWhat's The Simplest Way To Spot Major Market Tops?

327,ADBE,"Stocks opened lower Monday, with the Nasdaq falling 1.3% after Friday's tech plunge. Losses on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were light in comparison, down 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.Among the Dow industrials, General Electric (GE) paced the advancers, soaring about 3% after CEO Jeffrey Immelt decided to step down as chairman and CEO.

335,ADBE,"While the possibility of Salesforce.com (CRM) acquiring Twitter (TWTR) attracted most of the buzz at last week's Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual user conference, a number of analysts were just as intrigued by the cloud software pioneer's relationship with frenemy Microsoft (MSFT).Salesforce and Microsoft announced a broad-based strategic partnership in 2014, with Microsoft integrating its cloud-based Office 365 software with Salesforce.com's apps. But while Microsoft — which in early 2015 reportedly came close to seeking to acquire Salesforce — had a booth at last week's Dreamforce, there wasn't much Microsoft presence, analysts noted.This comes after Microsoft in June announced an agreement to acquire social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion. The following month, LinkedIn revealed in a regulatory filing that Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff had said he would have been willing to pay even more.The battle for LinkedIn is just one issue between the two companies. There also is Microsoft's ramped up efforts to beef up its Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Salesforce focuses on CRM and ERP software.In addition, Microsoft last month inked a strategic partnership with Adobe Systems (ADBE), in which Adobe will deliver its Adobe Marketing Cloud on Microsoft's Azure cloud services platform. Also, the Adobe product will be the preferred marketing service for Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Enterprise edition. Adobe Marketing Cloud is a Salesforce rival.In addition, Salesforce reached a cloud services pact in May with Microsoft Azure's top rival, Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft is among the big caps, and big companies can still make big moves, while also being less volatile than smaller stocks. While Microsoft is not a member of the current IBD Big Cap 20, Adobe is. Take a look at that and other big boys on the list.Like many tech companies, Microsoft and Salesforce have partnerships with companies that they also compete against, but the rising level of conflict between Microsoft and Salesforce has Wall Street's attention.""The combination of the drama around LinkedIn, a significantly stepped up investment in Dynamics and the just announced Microsoft/Adobe partnership has customers questioning if the relationship has soured and, if that even matters,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk wrote Monday in a research report reviewing Dreamforce.He points out, though, that Salesforce has managed to be an occasional partner of Oracle (ORCL), one of its main rivals.The conflict between Salesforce and Microsoft ""merits watching over the next year,"" Senk wrote, ""although we point to the company's success with Oracle 'coopetition' as evidence that the company can navigate these waters.""In the meantime, though, rumors of Salesforce buying Twitter have cooled, which had Salesforce stock rising 6% and Twitter stock falling 11.5% in the stock market today. Wall Street generally disliked the idea of such a merger.

343,ADBE,"The major indexes made piecemeal moves in afternoon trading Wednesday, but techs continued to lead the way higher with just three more trading sessions left in March.Cisco Systems (CSCO) is taking a breather, falling nearly 0.7% to 33.76 in light volume and hampering efforts of the Dow Jones industrial average to rally. The 30-member Dow is down roughly 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite and the tech-rich Nasdaq 100 are both up about 0.3%. The S&P 500 inched slightly higher and is just above 2360.Cisco shares, however, are still up more than 5% past a recent flat-base entry at 31.99. It's been featured frequently in IBD's Income Investor column, which highlights companies that have excellent earnings stability, a minimum 2% annualized yield, and decent relative strength.Cisco, the greatest stock market winner of the 1990s as it literally built the plumbing of the world wide web, no longer has the same growth characteristics as it did when it initially cleared a double-bottom base as a small-cap growth leader right after the stock market bottomed in October 1990. Now, with a $169 billion market cap and a 3.4% annualized dividend yield, the Silicon Valley stalwart in data networking routers, switches and other communications gear has been busy battling new upstarts including Arista Networks (ANET), currently ranked No. 1 in the IBD 50.Arista, embroiled in a technology patent court battle with Cisco, is down nearly 0.7% to 133.00, but volume is quiet and the stock's uptrend is firmly intact since its breakout past a 75.50 cup-shaped pattern in the week ended Aug. 12, 2016.That cup helped put the finishing touches on a long bottoming base pattern, seen among many current stock market leaders today. Arista went public in June 2014 at 43 and quickly ramped up to 94.84, then went into a deep freeze for nearly two years before finally building that first-stage cup pattern and eventually breaking out to 52-week highs.Arista has grown earnings per share 54%, 47%, 51%, 36%, 37%, 41% and 30% vs. year-ago levels over the past seven quarters. That amazing track record of profit growth is one reason why the Santa Clara, Calif., firm holds a 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Revenue rose 33% to 42% over that same time frame. Wall Street sees FY 2017 earnings growth slowing, up 14% to $3.77 a share.As noted in a recent Big Picture column, while policy at the federal government level can certainly spur entrepreneurship and risk-taking, it's the innovative companies themselves that are the true engines of economic growth and job creation. Look for those companies that have outstanding products and services, rock-solid management, and stocks that have the ability to power to new highs and rise above their 10-week moving averages.All of these factors go into IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investment paradigm, noted by AAII as the top investment strategy for stocks across multiple time periods going back to the late 1990s.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which has redefined the way people shop for cosmetics, hair and skin care products and services, has made a terrific move since clearing a three-month cup at 188.58 back on March 11, 2016.Ulta today gained 0.57 to 283.43 and is currently in the proper buy zone, up 3% past a 274.09 entry in a double-bottom-with-handle base. Shares broke out of the slightly warped-looking pattern in early February in light volume. Both the advance and volume picked up steam on March 10, a day after Ulta reported a 33% jump in fiscal Q4 earnings per share and a 25% rise in revenue to $1.58 billion.That matched the biggest year-over-year top-line increase in 16 quarters.The top-performing specialty retailer is expected to see strong double-digit EPS growth during the next two fiscal years (up 24% in FY 2018 to $8.07 a share, up 21% in FY 2019). In tech land, NetEase (NTES) also deserves continued watch. The Chinese giant in online video games is basing after rising past a 257.78 cup-with-narrow-handle entry. Watch for potential support at the 10-week line.Symantec (SYMC) is staging a stunning turnaround, not just in stock price but also in profits. The stock, up more than 1% to 30.84, has shot 19% past a 25.82 flat-base entry.Wall Street sees earnings rising 14% to $1.19 a share in FY 2017, which ends this month, then galloping 47% higher to $1.75 a share in FY 2018. Industry peer Fortinet (FTNT) rose 4% to 38.08 in above-average turnover.The stock joined IBD's new SwingTrader premium service as one with potential to make a strong move over a period of several days to potentially a few weeks.Finally, digital marketing and imaging software leader Adobe Systems (ADBE) continues to thrive, edging up for a sixth straight session to 129.21. The San Jose, Calif., firm cleared a 107.90 entry in a shallow double-bottom base with handle in early January and has climbed as much as 19%.Adobe gets a solid 95 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99. Wall Street sees profit rising 31% to $3.95 a share in FY 2017, ending in November, and another 26% to $4.99 a share in FY 2018.RELATED:Stock Market Today I: Can Snap Finish A First-Stage Base?Stock Market Today II: 5 Solid Big Cap Names For 2017How To Invest: The Elements Of A Bottoming Base PatternHow To Invest: How To Find An Outstanding Cup-With-Handle Base

344,ADBE,"Salesforce.com (CRM) has turned its marketing and sales ""cannons"" on smaller rivals before, but Zendesk (ZEN) has the right stuff to take on Salesforce.com in the enterprise market, says a Piper Jaffray report.Zendesk, a maker of customer support software, will likely expand into sales or marketing automation to reach its goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2020, analysts say. Zendesk aims to sell more to larger companies and enterprises, as well as to its longtime base of smaller and midsize businesses.""Zendesk is looking to move more into the enterprise (market), which puts it in direct competition with Salesforce.com,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin said in a report. ""Investors are concerned, as they have seen firms in other markets attempt to take on Salesforce.com directly in the past, only to see growth slow as deal cycles are elongated as CRM adjusts both its marketing and sales cannons on these companies.""IBD'S TAKE: The Computer Software-Enterprise group is ranked No. 6 out of 197 industry groups amid a pickup in acquisitions. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. San Francisco-based Zendesk last week reported second-quarter revenue and billings that topped estimates and posted a narrower per-share loss ex items.

""This is a very important distinction in our minds, as B2C customers tend to be more agile and customer-focused, which plays well into Zendesk's primary point of competitive differentiation, the customer experience.""Zendesk stock rose 2%, to 30.74 at the close on the stock market today.

345,ADBE,"SunPower (SPWR) and solar stocks faced the wrath of Wall Street Wednesday, while others -- Walt Disney (DIS), Yelp (YELP) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) -- were looked upon more fondly.Despite topping Q2 estimates, the solar stock received no fewer than five downgrades, courtesy of its very weak guidance.Deutsche Bank downgraded SunPower to a hold with 11 price target, JPMorgan cut the stock to neutral from overweight with a 17 price target, and Credit Suisse lowered its rating to neutral from outperform with a price target of 12.

SolarEdge plummeted by nearly 10% to 16.82 at the close.The popular restaurant and business review site came out ahead of Q2 expectations Tuesday and issued better-than-projected Q3 guidance, leading several banks to give it a good review.Bank of America upgraded Yelp to neutral from underperform with a 37 price target, while Needham upped its price target to 42 with a buy rating. Yelp jumped nearly 13% to 36.83.IBD'S TAKE: Yelp shares are soaring, trading at a one-year high. But the rally over the last few months follows an 86% crash from March 2014 to February 2016.

349,ADBE,"Do you find yourself doing more and more of the mundane tasks of life online -- buying groceries, filing a tax return, depositing a check, refilling a prescription? Here's something you need to know as ETF investors: So are businesses.That could mean exciting opportunities for those looking for successful investing ideas.Technology ETFs come in all stripes. The biggest and most popular tech exchange traded funds offer broad exposure to a sector that's been a winner for portfolios over the long term. A crop of smaller ETFs is worthy of attention too. They target specific tech industry niches that are gaining momentum after a sluggish year.As American companies make the great migration to the cloud, the computer software group is sizzling. Paycom Software (PAYC), which provides human-resources services via the cloud, has grown earnings an average 117% over the last three quarters. Veeva Systems (VEEV), which helps pharma and biotech companies sell and market their products over the cloud, has done a stellar job keeping down debt as it grew sales and profits over the last three years.Other highly rated IBD stocks in this group include Atlassian (TEAM), Ellie Mae (ELLI), CyberArk Software (CYBR), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and NetEase (NTES).IShares North American Tech-Software (IGV) is the largest of at least three ETFs that are thematic plays on the computer software industry. It hit an all-time closing high of 112.12 on the stock market Monday.This cap-weighted ETF has $775 million in assets and a 0.48% expense ratio. It holds 59 stocks, with the biggest stakes in tech giants Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE). It also has smaller positions in the likes of gaming company Activision and e-mortgager Ellie Mae.IGV has gained 6.1% in the third quarter through Aug. 12. Year to date, it is up 8.4%.Peers include PowerShares Dynamic Software Portfolio (PSJ), which skews toward smaller growth companies. This ETF aims to outperform by screening stocks based on risk factors, style classification and stock valuation, according to ETF.com.Paycom, Veeva and RealPage (RP), which caters to the rental housing market, are to be found in this portfolio. PSJ is outperforming its larger software-focused rival with a 7.8% gain this quarter and 12.6% gain so far in 2016. But it's thinly traded.The enterprise-computer software group ranks No. 6 among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD; it was No. 13 four weeks ago. The specialty enterprise computer software group has climbed from No. 120 to No. 13 over the same period.Shifting tech trends are also benefiting companies directly involved in the flow of electronic information. At least three stocks from the internet networking group make the elite IBD 50 list for their top-notch technical and fundamental metrics -- Gigamon (GIMO), LogMeIn (LOGM) and Rackspace Holdings (RAX).PowerShares Dynamic Networking Portfolio (PXQ) invests in 30 U.S. networking companies. These are typically internet-focused companies that support the ever-expanding flow of electronic communications, including voice, data, images and commerce.PXQ hit a 52-week high Monday. Its holdings include Gigamon, whose products help to optimize the reliability, performance and security of network infrastructure. With 72% average EPS growth over the last three quarters, Gigamon is top ranked in IBD's network-solutions group.The ETF also holds LogMeIn, which gives users remote access to their computers and mobile devices.PXQ  invests in companies that hold the potential to outperform based on their perceived quality and price and earnings momentum, but its trading volume and bid-ask spreads beg closer attention. It has $20.54 million in assets and a 0.63% expense ratio.A nearly 14% jump this quarter puts it ahead of most of its tech ETF peers and marks a sharp rebound after two down quarters. Year to date, the fund is up 8.1%.The internet/network-solutions group ranks No. 39 among the IBD industry groups vs. No. 69 four weeks ago.

352,ADBE,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday after its two-day policy meeting, as expected, and longer-term rate projections show an even slower pace of increases.Still, policymakers painted a mostly upbeat picture about the job market and overall growth and signaled that the Fed's key rate will rise before year-end.Markets have increasingly been pricing in a December hike -- currently 59% --  but have seen just a 33% chance of another hike before September 2017. Fed projection materials point to two hikes in 2017, consistent with recent comments that they would hold rates low for longer.The Fed said in its statement that policymakers decided that ""the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress.""However, three policymakers dissented from the decision, all favoring a hike now, leaving a 7-3 vote in favor of staying put.But the Fed's forecasts show policymakers expect three rate hikes through the end of 2017, down from five at their June meeting. The estimate for the fed funds rate in 2017 has slipped to 1.1% in 2017 from a 1.6% view in June, 2018's views dropped to 1.9% from 2.4%, and the longer-run forecast is now 2.9% vs. 3%.Investors seemed pleased with the Fed's intentions, sending stocks significantly higher and the Nasdaq to an all-time best. The 10-year Treasury yield fell slightly.The Fed assessment that ""the labor market has continued to strengthen"" seems to be a little too upbeat, given some surprisingly bleak details in the August jobs report, notably that the length of the workweek had shrunk to a five-year low. The latest data from Treasury also point to a weakening in federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks.The read on household spending — ""growing strongly"" — also seems to ignore the back-to-back declines in retail sales as auto sales went into reverse. The statement does note that business investment continued to be soft.Despite the Fed's positive read on economic data and a backdrop of core inflation approaching the 2% target, policymakers clearly think that they can be very patient in hiking rates over the next couple of years with little chance of an outburst of inflation.At her post-meeting press conference, Fed chief Janet Yellen characterized current policy as only ""modestly accommodative.""Earlier, the Bank of Japan vowed to keep the 10-year Japanese government bond yield near zero. The yen initially sold off hard against the dollar, but then reversed all of its losses and more as markets signaled doubts that the latest moves would be any more successful in reviving inflation than prior ones.Japan's plight is clearly in the thinking of Yellen and other Fed doves who stress that it will be easier to tamp down inflation should it surprise to the upside than it would be to shake off a bout of deflation.""We're not seeing evidence that the economy is overheating,"" Yellen said. Meanwhile, more people are being drawn into the workforce than she had expected, giving the economy some extra running room, she said.Yellen noted that she sees the recent 180,000-per-month employment gain as unsustainably high.She also discussed commercial real estate, highlighted as an area of potential overheating by Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve. ""While valuations are high,"" Yellen said, she noted that lending standards have tightened and that debt growth was not raising red flags.So why didn't the Fed hike Wednesday? ""Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy,"" Yellen said.But she added that labor market slack is being taken up at a slower pace. And the Fed's ""cautious"" approach on rates reflects her belief that with rates near zero it would be easier to tighten quickly if necessary than to cut rates rapidly.Even though economists see a November rate hike as almost unthinkable given the presidential election just days later, Yellen stressed that the meeting would be a live one, meaning a rate move is possible.U.S. stocks opened higher on the BOJ moves as well as on strong earnings from Adobe Systems (ADBE) and FedEx (FDX), but had erased most of those gains heading into the Fed announcement at 2 p.m. ET.Among Fed-sensitive stocks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and LGI Homes (LGIH) have found support near their 50-day lines recently.JPMorgan is still up after the Fed meeting, but has pared gains.

357,ADBE,"Buy ratings were placed on Apple (AAPL), Under Armour (UAA), Adobe (ADBE) and Micron Technology (MU) on Friday, while Macy's (M) was downgraded.A buy rating was reiterated on Apple at Nomura/Instinet, which raised its price target to 165 from 135.  The firm believes the expected introduction of the iPhone 8 later this year will outperform consensus expectations.

"
359,ADBE,"To beat the stock market and mutual fund peers, having the right stocks isn't enough. It's having them at the right time that counts. And Alger Spectra Fund (SPECX) has done that in spades in the past 10 years and is doing so again this year.The fund, managed by Patrick Kelly since 2004 and Ankur Crawford since 2015, has cranked out an average annual gain of 10.55% in the 10 years since April 1, 2007, vs. 7.71% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 7.51% for the S&P 500. This year the $5.3 billion fund has raced ahead 11.04% vs. peers' 8.62% and the broad stock market's 6.07% gains.It's doing that thanks in large part to the double-digit gains notched by nearly 40% of its publicly traded stocks so far in 2017.Blue chip stocks, including a bevy of tech beauties, are a big part of Spectra's story right now. Top-10 holdings Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Visa (V) and Broadcom (AVGO) were all double-digit climbers, with returns ranging from Visa's 14% to Apple's nearly 25%.Other big gainers for the fund included Adobe Systems (ADBE), up 26%; Alibaba Group (BABA), whose ADRs were up 24%; and S&P Global (SPGI), up 21%.Through Monday afternoon, Amazon, Facebook, Broadcom and Alibaba were advancing yet again. The $4.78-billion market cap Cavium (CAVM), punching way above its weight class, was also rising — again. So was United Rentals (URI). Each was pushing back up near all-time high levels.Most of those stock market winners can also be found in Spectra's peers and the major stock indexes like the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500. But it's the managers' handling of the fund's investment process that has made the performance difference.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group. It has a solid 95 Composite Rating and four years in a row of earnings per share growth. See how its additional easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' — including No. 4-rated Amazon.com — at IBD's Stock Checkup.Lead manager Kelly and Crawford, who advanced to her manager role after joining Alger as a research assistant in 2004, have notched their gains mainly by sticking to their investment approach, even when that means sidestepping sectors that have benefited from the ""Trump bump"" stock market rally.The crux of their approach is to seek growth stocks that are undergoing what they call ""positive dynamic change"" — high-unit-volume growth and positive life-cycle change.Kelly, 42 years old, and 41-year-old Crawford talked about their strategy and holdings with IBD from their offices in New York City.IBD: What does the positive-life-cycle-change part of your strategy mean?Kelly: In a positive life-cycle change, we're looking for earnings acceleration and multiple expansion driven by the positive change.IBD: How much of your portfolio consists of life-cycle change, how much consists of high-unit-volume growth?Crawford: About 10% of the portfolio is both, and the remainder is split half and half.IBD: Since the election, a lot of money managers have focused on playing sectors that they believe will benefit from Trump initiatives and a Republican Congress. However, with the failure to repeal or reform ObamaCare, many investors are concerned about the outlook for those policy moves. How are you playing this?Kelly: You highlighted one of the big market risks. Can the administration deliver on its promises? We're still optimistic that administration policies will be more supportive of U.S. business and GDP growth. With a lot of companies we've invested in, we're staying the course.IBD: Across the board?Crawford: The procyclical bias favoring materials is outside how we invest. With materials, we don't see a positive life-cycle change per se vs. a cycle to be played. In banks, however, there is much change. We expect they will benefit from lower regulation.We didn't take our industrials positions up dramatically because we worried about the very thing you're talking about, and industrials have given up some gains on those fears. However, in technology there are secular growth drivers that, regardless of policy, we expect will play out.IBD: The tech sector is your largest weighting. Why?Kelly: We continue to be big on trends in the internet, software and semiconductors. We believe tech will be a big beneficiary of trends in the mobile internet, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Big Data.IBD: What are some examples?Kelly: Amazon's Alexa (a voice-capable interactive personal assistant) is an AI device. It will prove disruptive to the retail sector.Apple is a life-cycle change company with a growing services business and an upcoming product-cycle services that should be an anchor that mutes the cyclicality of any product cycle.IBD: Is there also a potential Trump Trade boost for, say, Apple?Kelly: If tax repatriation takes place, Apple has $100 billion sitting (outside the U.S.) that would make them a beneficiary. It would either allow them to do a pretty significant buyback or, for companies that are legacy companies, it would give them the ability to positively life-cycle change. They can buy assets that let them turn their big ship around.IBD: Let me ask about some individual companies as of your latest disclosure. Do you like Alibaba because of any one part or do you like it because of its many parts together?Kelly: Our thesis is that Alibaba is one of the most dominant companies in the world. It's the dominant e-commerce platform in China. They also have leading positions in video, payments, logistics and cloud computing in China. We continue to believe platforms such as Alibaba and Amazon are extremely disruptive and underappreciated by the market.IBD: What has enabled earnings per share for Cavium (CAVM) to grow again after four quarters of declines?Crawford: For us, this is a classic unit-volume-growth story. They're a semiconductor company that will benefit from the upcoming 5G infrastructure upgrade. There will be a need to build faster data centers and to move to ARM-based servers (which are a category of reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, architectures for computer chips, which cut costs, heat and power use). Cavium has a complete portfolio of infrastructure IT to address the next generation of networks. These product cycles will drive content growth and market-share gains, which we expect will drive significant revenue and earnings accretion over the next three years.IBD: Any concern about Facebook's EPS growth slowing for two quarters in a row?Kelly: Internet advertising will experience rapid growth. And we expect Facebook to continue to take market share. It's also in the early stages of monetizing Instagram and its rapidly growing 600-million user base. Facebook has other medium- to long-term monetization levers, including Messenger, WhatsApp and their Oculus Rift platform.IBD: Netflix's (NFLX) quarterly EPS growth has accelerated. Any clouds on the horizon?Crawford: It's a transformative company that single-handedly changes the way we consume content. We are concerned that their free-cash-flow and earnings potential resides in the out years (in the future). They're able to get leverage only as they've seeded the global market.We see additional international penetration; the ability to increase pricing from the current offering of $10 a month in the U.S., which we believe is greatly underpriced for the value; and their ability to monetize their user base using creative advertising methods. We believe they can double their user base and revenues in the next five years.IBD: Broadcom has accelerated EPS growth for four quarters in a row. Are you comfortable they can keep this up?Crawford: They're one of the best examples of life-cycle change. They have a visionary CEO (Hock Tan), who via acquisitions and organic growth has driven earnings up ninefold over the last seven years. And we believe he's not done.Broadcom should continue to see further earnings accretion and now capital return to shareholders because it's generating $6.5 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow, which is about 30% of its revenue in free cash flow.IBD: Morgan Stanley has pulled back from its March high on investors' fears that corporate tax reform and lowering banks' regulatory burden is not the slam dunk many thought they would be. What's your thesis?Kelly: They've undergone significant change. Wealth management was only 5% of their business in 2006. Now it's roughly 50%. We believe that shift to a higher margin, less-capital-intensive business can drive return-on-equity expansion and multiple expansion. And financials in general should still benefit from regulatory relief and higher interest rates.IBD: Which of your strategic drivers does Adobe represent?Crawford: It's both a lifecycle-change and a high-unit-volume-growth company. And it is dominant in its market, and should have sustainable midteens revenue growth for the next three to five years, with over 20% earnings growth in that period.Digital advertising is the high-unit-volume-growth part of their business. They provide a platform that enables customers to deploy digital advertising.The life-cycle change is in the creative products part of the company, which has undergone a fast transition and is continuing to grow their total available market, as their products are adopted more broadly.And Adobe is adding more solutions, such as Fotolio, which is competitive with Shutterstock. It's a site where photographers can display their images and content-creator customers can use their images. It's a subscription type business, which allows for increased average selling price per customer.IBD: United Rentals (URI) has traded sideways near its all-time high since its January earnings report. Do you still like it?Kelly: It's one of the leading equipment rental companies in the U.S. Postelection, investors expected it to benefit from construction, from corporate tax reform and improving GDP growth. It (stalled) because there is uncertainty about the prospects for an infrastructure bill. If one passes, United would be a big beneficiary. Trump is also pro-energy, so a buildout of pipelines should benefit United.IBD: S&P Global (SPGI) has mostly gone sideways since Congress failed to repeal or reform ObamaCare. Is that a problem for S&P?Crawford: It's not a problem yet. S&P is another market dominant company. It is one of effectively two players in the ratings business, where they enjoy secular growth in debt issuance due to global economic growth and regulator constraints on banks. Combined with their information services business and their index business, 70% of their business is recurring.Adding to that, they are pruning their portfolio and using the proceeds to buy back shares.IBD: The fund's outperformance in the past 10 years got a boost from the fund's 56.52% gain in 2009. What worked so well for the fund that year?Kelly: We follow our philosophy and process in all markets to deliver strong long-term results for our clients. Looking at one year is not the lens we use to view the performance of the fund... (On the other hand, we) have had consistently strong performance over any three-year rolling period over the past 10 years. I think that is the better metric to focus on than any one year.IBD: What's your process for building positions in a stock?Kelly: Building positions depends on the stock and a variety of other factors. We continually assess risk-reward and look to rotate money into the names that we think have the most favorable risk-reward.IBD: You are active managers. Some people say active management at least in mutual funds is doomed. What do you think?Kelly: We're in a highly competitive market. You need to be able to drive good performance over a multiple-year period. We've been able to do that. That will continue to be our challenge going forward. We remain confident in our team and philosophy and process.RELATED:IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards: New Crop Of WinnersFidelity's Will Danoff Talks About The Super Bowl And Super StocksAdobe, Facebook, Other Stocks Drive One Of The Best Mutual Funds

362,ADBE,"XIt's been years since cloud computing became a technology buzzword, and the buzz hasn't really let up. Now, an ETF that tracks that industry is in IBD's ETF Leaders screen.First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY) holds 30 stocks in the cloud business, either providers or heavy users of cloud computing — the data and software shared over the internet rather than on PC hard drives.Some companies in the fund are cloud-computing pure plays, while others are big users or merely provide support for the cloud-computing space, according to First Trust. About 10% of the portfolio is in what the fund calls technology conglomerates, which are large companies ""with business models that indirectly utilize or support the use of cloud-computing technology,"" the prospectus explains.Amazon.com (AMZN), for instance, got about 15% of sales last year from Web Services, its cloud business that has emerged as a major provider of cloud infrastructure services.Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon are the three biggest holdings. With Alphabet (GOOGL) as another large holding, First Trust Cloud Computing is somewhat of a ""FANG"" ETF, the term used to describe the four internet giants Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google's parent company, Alphabet. The FANG stocks are trading near highs and have contributed to the ETF's success. So have other components. SAP (SAP), the German business software company, has made a strong advance since a July bottom.

Apple (AAPL) has rallied more than 20% from a Jan. 6 breakout and has been a big contributor to the ETF's gains this year. Adobe Systems (ADBE) has climbed about 18% from a 111.19 entry.The ETF is trading near record highs. Although it's extended from its most recent breakout in July, shares are just above the 38.45 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern. Such formations can be used to buy shares, though they are not as prime opportunities as breakouts from bases. Shares have found support at the 50-day moving average since their run started in July, a positive sign.First Trust Cloud Computing is up about 12% so far this year. Last year, it climbed 15.4% and had its best year in 2013, when it roared more than 33%. The ETF started trading in 2011.

To easily find lists of stocks with outstanding fundamentals that are near buy points, check out our research tools Leaderboard and MarketSmith.IBD 50 member Broadcom ended trading Thursday 3.4% below a 166.10 buy point from a cup base after climbing back above the 50-day line, down 1.4% for the day.

366,ADBE,"The biggest change in accounting standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will shake up how public companies book revenue, in many cases resulting in earlier recognition of sales.And the ripple effects could touch everything from earnings and taxes to bonuses, commissions and buyout decisions.The new FASB ""606"" rule developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board takes effect in 2018 or fiscal 2019. It will affect many companies but likely will have the most impact on businesses with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue, contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks, or third-party sales distribution channels.In the short term, stock market investors will sometimes have a tougher task in discerning corporate trends because current financial results might not be comparable to previous quarters. Sales and earnings also might be more volatile, potentially affecting stock prices.""The new revenue recognition standard is one of the biggest accounting events we've ever seen,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""It's going to be a tough exercise for most companies.""IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks to buy usually are powered by a strong revenue stream. But smart investors look at revenue within the context of a company's overall financial performance. IBD calculates a unique rating for every stock that does just that. For an explanation and a list of stocks that rate highly now, read Paul Whitfield's new article ""Don't Judge Sales In A Vacuum.""Some of the businesses that could be most impacted are telecom stocks AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) and computer software stocks such as Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT), analysts say.

Often, the companies won't know exactly what revenue to disclose, so they'll be asked to make more estimates and judgment calls rather than rely on the old rules.Computer makers and other companies that sell products through distributors likely will book more revenue upfront. They'll need to estimate, based on historical data, how much product will eventually be sold to end users through the distributors, and then book that amount.""Certain industries will recognize revenue sooner than they have in the past, and software is one example,"" Stallings said. ""But the change in guidance from the very strict rules today to the (new) requirement to make estimations is going to go across a lot of industries.""Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over time. AT&T and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of a lease contract or payment plan.If software companies fast-forward revenue recognition, there could be an uptick in acquisitions, says Todson Page, another partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. That's because smaller companies may be more attractive takeover targets if deals are earnings-positive immediately, or at least within a few quarters.""From a deal justification point of view, it may help some buyers because it would allow them to reach GAAP accretion numbers quicker,"" said Page, PWC's U.S. technology deals leader.Changes on the top line, of course, can affect a stock's earnings.""The new revenue standard has the potential to change not only the top line, but also the bottom line,"" Wesley Bricker, deputy chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a May speech.Earlier recognition of sales would help the bottom line at first, but it would lead to lumpier earnings overall, as more revenue is booked upfront and less over the duration of a contract or long-term license.Companies might have less deferred revenue that they book over time. Thus, the FASB 606 standard means they might have less leeway to manage earnings and meet consensus estimates by accelerating or deferring revenue.One broad aim of FASB 606 is to bring U.S. revenue recognition in line with international financial reporting standards, which are also being overhauled. A goal is to make it easier for investors to compare stocks across industries and countries, says KPMG's Kalavacherla, also a former member of the International Accounting Standards Board.Companies will have to chose just how to comply with the new standard. Some companies will opt to restate sales for some prior years, while others will take a modified compliance route, applying the new rules only to existing and future contracts as of the effective date.Telecom, media and entertainment companies are among those most likely to restate revenue, analysts say.And that likely would be the cleaner tack, says Kalavacherla. With the modified route, he says, less trend information will be available to investors and analysts. ""That comparative data will be lost,"" he said.In 2015, FASB delayed the effective date of the new revenue standard for one year to 2018 after companies asked for clarifications. Some companies are still griping.FASB has said it is not considering another delay. Some analysts, however, say the rules are still in flux.""The rules simply don't make sense right now,"" said John DiFucci, a software industry analyst at Jefferies.At a JPMorgan conference in May, some software companies hedged when asked how soon they'll be affected by the standard.The accounting changes come amid a huge change in the computer industry that finds software companies shifting from one-time licensing fees to subscription-based, software-as-a-service business models. Under the FASB 606 standard, only software that is ""continuously updated"" can be recognized over time — and that applies for most SaaS.Companies that have had SaaS business models from the start, such as Salesforce.com, might be less impacted by this change than others, analysts say. Adobe, Microsoft and Splunk (SPLK) are among software stocks that are transitioning to SaaS but still have considerable licensing revenue. The timing of revenue recognition for software licenses could be accelerated, says Citigroup.A KPMG survey found many companies are taking a wait-and-see approach. They haven't upgraded IT systems, recalculated contracts or taken other steps to comply with the new standard. Such companies are more likely to take the modified approach in complying with the standard, rather than restating financial statements.Since companies will need to make more estimates in revenue recognition, they'll need to disclose more historical and other data in footnotes, says KPMG, which will improve transparency, a plus for investors.The new standard also is a business opportunity for startups that offer financial software designed to help in revenue recognition. Among such companies are Leeyo Software, Zuora and Revstream.As Leeyo CEO Jagan Reddy told IBD: ""This is going to be a real challenge for auditors.""

378,ADBE,"Major indexes edged higher at midday Monday, the start of a holiday-shortened week that currently see the market in a confirmed uptrend.Apple (AAPL) backtracked in light volume, and another light-volume drop could put shares back in buy range. Last month, Apple cleared a brand-new cup with handle, moving past a 160.97 entry. The 5% chase zone extends up to 169.02.XOther key megacap and big-cap techs to keep watching with less than two months to go in 2017 include Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA). All five of these names rank in the latest IBD Big Cap 20.All five of these names are currently extended from a proper buy point. However, given their excellent fundamentals, superior position within their respective markets, and outstanding relative price strength, they certainly deserve a spot on a long-term watch list. New follow-on entry points or new bases will eventually emerge.At 1 pm ET, the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 rose close to 0.2%. Most Chinese ADRs flexed strength, following a third straight advance for the Hang Seng equities benchmark in Hong Kong. Volume is running sharply lower vs. the same time on Friday, which saw turnover boosted by expiring monthly and weekly stock and index options.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied nearly 0.4%, buoyed by 1-point gains or more by at least five of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and IBM (IBM).Investors received additional confirmation that the U.S. economy is rising. The leading indicators index showed a 1.2% gain in October, blasting the Econoday consensus view of up 0.6% and a big improvement from a 0.2% drop in September.Home Depot barreled more than 1.5% higher to 170.49, good for a new all-time high. The stock marked a follow-on entry point as it bounced off the rising 10-week moving average near 165 last week in hefty volume.Those who bought shares when the stock cleared earlier buy points may add a small amount of shares to the winning position. Adding shares to your best stocks is a great way to compound your overall return, but it should only be done when the market is in a solid uptrend, as noted in the Market Pulse table of IBD's The Big Picture.The Street sees the home improvement chain's earnings rising 12% to $1.62 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January. That would extend Home Depot's streak of double-digit profit growth to 16 quarters in a row.No wonder Home Depot's EPS Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is a very respectable 92 on scale of 1 (atrocious earnings) to 99 (exceptional profit growth, both near and long term).Back to Apple, the stock provides multiple reasons why the outlook for a continued fundamentals turnaround remains very strong.Earnings per share jumped 24% to $2.07 in the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, and Apple crushed the consensus view by nearly 11%. But perhaps more importantly, the iPhone marketer is poised to continue growing profit at double-digit pace into the next fiscal year.The Street sees fiscal Q1 earnings (for the quarter ending in December, a big-time shopping month) rising 12% to $3.77 a share; that would also be a quarterly best.A second reason to have confidence in Apple's turnaround? Revenue growth is accelerating. In the latest quarter, revenue jumped 12% to $52.58 billion, the biggest year-over-year gain in nearly three years. Analysts on consensus see sales picking up 10%, 30%, 25% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the next four quarters.Three, Apple's ratings in IBD Stock Checkup continue to stay solid and show dramatic improvement vs. the start of the year. While the Composite Rating dipped just a bit to 89, it's still up strong from a lowly 51 on Jan. 1. The RS Rating continues to reflect leadership among big caps at 83.Four, the daily and weekly chart action for Apple has not shed any sell signals, other than to take profits at 20% to 25% for those who wish to raise some cash and look for perhaps a better growth name. Apple has jumped nearly 50% since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. Meanwhile, the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, on a scale of A to E, indicates mutual funds, banks, hedge funds and insurers are overall net accumulators of Apple shares.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

More tech giants -- Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) -- report earnings, as do the biggest names in oil, such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), along with fast-food leader McDonald's (MCD) and aerospace giant Boeing (BA).

382,ADBE,"Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to remove the legacy audio jack from the upcoming iPhone 7, a move that could upset many customers who have wired headsets they like to use.Apple is believed to be ditching the 3.5-millimeter analog port in order to make the next iPhone slightly thinner. People who want to use headphones with the iPhone 7 would have to switch to Bluetooth wireless headphones or headphones that plug into Apple's proprietary, multifunction Lightning connector. Apple might include a Lightning port adapter for 3.5-mm audio-jack headphones with the iPhone 7.More than 300,000 people have signed an online petition urging Apple not to eliminate the headphone socket from the next iPhone, expected to be released in September.""Not only will this force iPhone users to dole out additional cash to replace their hi-fi headphones, it will single-handedly create mountains of electronic waste that likely won't get recycled,"" the Sum of Us petition says.Apple has a history of being the first tech company to eliminate older standards in favor of new technology. For instance, it famously abandoned floppy disk and CD drives from its Mac computers before others eventually followed suit. It also refused to support Adobe (ADBE) Flash in its iOS mobile devices.But with this transition, Apple won't have its iconic co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs to sell the change to the Apple faithful.Jobs would make Apple customers feel noble and empowered about leaving old technologies behind, said Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates.""'Get rid of that old stuff' would be his answer,"" Kay said.Canaccord Genuity analyst Mike Walkley concurred.""He'd give a speech and everybody would walk out saying, 'I've got to get this new headset,'"" he said.Without Jobs to convince customers, you can expect a lot of grumbling about the lack of an audio jack, Walkley said.""They'll probably upset everybody for a few months and by the time the iPhone 8 comes out (expected in the fall of 2017) people will have accepted it,"" he said.But Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor said eliminating the headphone jack doesn't make sense.""Getting rid of it would create more problems that it would solve,"" he said in a research report Thursday.The iPhone is thin enough, he said. If it gets any thinner, it could have less structural rigidity and be more susceptible to being bent.

383,ADBE,"The U.K.'s surprising and historic decision to leave the European Union overshadowed all other news this week, roiling global markets and raising doubts about the European economy and post-war order.But it was a busy week for business news. In a well-timed release, the Federal Reserve said JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other giant banks passed their ""stress test"" scenarios. Elon Musk's bid to merge Tesla Motors (TSLA) and SolarCity (SCTY) raised doubts, even among long-time devotees. Wal-Mart (WMT) and JD.com (JD) teamed up. Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT) and FedEx (FDX) gave weak guidance, and the Federal Aviation Administration finalized drone regulations.Gloom overtook world markets after Britons voted to leave the EU amid a wave of nationalist sentiment. The vote will begin a long process of negotiations to determine what parts of the existing business landscape will stay or go for a range of industries that operate in the region. JPMorgan Chase, American Airlines (AAL) and their global peers were hit hard. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said he would step down, while right-wing populists elsewhere on the Continent called for similar referendums in their nations, potentially expanding financial and cultural fissures within the bloc. The Federal Reserve said it is ""prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary,"" but questions remained about how much left was in its arsenal to ward off any coming market turmoil.U.S. stocks had rallied through Thursday, in large part because polls got it wrong and predicted that the U.K. would stay in the EU. Stocks suffered huge losses Friday after the Brexit results pushing the major averages into the red. The Nasdaq lost 1.9% for the week while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials closed off 1.6%. European markets suffered deeper losses. Big losers included carriers such American Air, while Tesla Motors tumbled on its ill-received SolarCity bid. Treasury yields hit four-year lows. The dollar skyrocketed vs. the pound but tumbled vs. the yen.Tesla made a surprise offer to buy solar energy company SolarCity in a stock swap valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman of SolarCity, which is run by Musk's cousins.Analyst reviews of the deal hit a negative tone, calling it a fundamental change to Tesla's business model that could thwart its aggressive efforts to expand production of its all-electric vehicles and add to cash flow and financing concerns. Tesla shares tumbled 10.45% on Wednesday, its worst one-day loss since May 2014. Tesla  fell 10.4% for the week. SolarCity initially spiked on the deal, but closed up just 4.1% as investors doubt a deal will happen. Musk, the top shareholder of both companies, said he won't vote on any merger agreement.The Federal Reserve passed all 33 banks -- including majors JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) -- in the first round of its annual stress tests, as expected. Investors will now focus on the second round of results, set for release Wednesday, that will determine whether banks can carry out their submitted plans to return capital to shareholders. But just because banks can weather a storm doesn't mean it will be fun: Bank stocks were among the biggest losers Friday on the Brexit fallout, erasing gains from earlier in the week.Adobe reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share on in-line sales for its fiscal second quarter ended June 3, but investors focused on its disappointing sales guidance for Q3.The maker of digital media and marketing software earned 71 cents a share excluding items, 3 cents above views, on sales of $1.4 billion. It was Adobe's fourth straight quarter of 20% or greater sales growth and its seventh straight quarter of double-digit gains in adjusted EPS.For the current quarter, Adobe is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 72 cents on sales of $1.445 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. Analysts had been modeling 71 cents, up 31%, on sales of $1.47 billion, up 21%.Adobe shares were down 3.55% for the week, undercutting a buy area.Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) announced a deal to buy an 84% stake in mobile video game company Supercell for $8.6 billion.

It makes money by selling virtual goods that help players advance in its games. Supercell's games are played by more than 100 million people each day.Tencent is a leader in online games. It owns ""League of Legends"" maker Riot Games and distributes games in China for Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and others.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced an alliance with China's JD.com (JD), with JD taking ownership of Wal-Mart's Yihaodian marketplace, its China e-commerce business, in return for an approximate 5% stake in JD.com in the form of newly issued shares. The move may help both Wal-Mart and JD compete against Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA).JD.com is the second-largest online retailer in China after Alibaba. Wal-Mart has struggled to build its China business.Wal-Mart rose 1.4%, hitting a 10-month high. JD closed up 2.5% for the week.Twitter (TWTR) expanded its push into machine learning with the acquisition of Magic Pony Technology, a London-based startup that specializes in visual processing.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the price tag was reported to be $150 million.Magic Pony's technology ranges across computer vision, machine learning, high-performance computing and computational neuroscience.Also, Twitter gave its users more room to unleash their creativity, expanding the length of its video play to 140 seconds from 30, as it battles for viewers with the likes of Facebook (FB) photo and video sharing site Instagram, which has now grown to 500 million subscribers.The Twitter change is designed to help video creators boost their audiences and make money in the process.Existing-home sales rose 1.8% in May to an annual rate of 5.53 million, the highest in nine years, the National Association of Realtors said. But new-home sales fell 6% to 551,000, the Commerce Department said. April new-home sales were revised down sharply to 586,000 from the initial reading of 619,000. Tight supply has limited purchases of new dwellings. But homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Meanwhile, new jobless claims fell 18,000 in the week ended June 18 to 259,000, the Labor Department said. That was a bigger drop than expected, and put the total back near a 43-year low set in March. It's a good sign for the June employment report after May's surprisingly weak payrolls gain.The Transportation Department and FAA finalized regulations for the commercial use of drones, which officials say could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. The rules are seen as less restrictive than expected. Under the new regulations, the unmanned aircraft must be kept within the pilot's line of sight and cannot be operated at night, but those restrictions could be lifted under a waiver. Among the publicly traded companies impacted by the new rules are Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart, GoPro (GPRO) and AeroVironment (AVAV).Red Hat reported fiscal Q1 revenue and billings slightly above views, as well as in-line earnings. But it forecast full-year profit that was a bit light, citing a new planned acquisition. Some analysts said larger enterprise deals were a bright spot. The open-source Linux software company increased a stock buyback program to $1 billion from its earlier $500 million authorization. Red Hat is expected to update its public cloud strategy at an investor day slated for June 30.Red Hat stock tumbled 4.8% for the week, falling below a recent buy point.FedEx reported strong fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue growth, both topping analyst estimates. But the company forecast adjusted EPS of $11.75-$12.25 for the current fiscal year. The midpoint of $12 was below consensus of $12.05. FedEx also didn't say how its recently acquired European shipper TNT Express would affect results. Shares fell 4.5% on Wednesday, a day after it issued Q4 results. Shares are off 7.2% this week, undercutting the 200-day line.The No. 2 U.S. package shipper plans to spend about $5.1 billion this year for ongoing expansion of the FedEx Ground network, as well as for planned aircraft purchases to support the FedEx Express fleet modernization program. Rival and No. 1 shipper UPS (UPS) crept out to a 17-month high on Thursday before tumbling Friday to fall less 1% for the week amid the Brexit turmoil on the market.

406,ADBE,"The major indexes were near break-even levels in mid-afternoon trading Tuesday, showing a light reaction to Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's mostly no-surprises testimony on the economy to Congress. However, some leadership-quality names -- namely Planet Fitness (PLNT) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) -- showed big moves in heavy trading.Planet Fitness, an August 2015 IPO that had been on a tear since the February market bottom, collapsed more than 7% on news of a share offering. Yet the base work has not yet been decimated.Meanwhile, Adobe, part of IBD Leaderboard, will be the focus of news after the 4 p.m. ET market close as it steps up to the earnings plate. The Street sees the graphics and PDF software giant posting a 42% rise in May-ended fiscal Q2 earnings to 68 cents a share on a 21% revenue increase to $1.4 billion.The Nasdaq composite was slightly lower, but the Nasdaq 100 eked out a 0.1% gain. The S&P 500 climbed 0.1% despite a sell-off in crude oil futures, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose by a hair. The Dow utility average rallied nearly 0.5%.Planet Fitness, which came public at 16 a share, plunged back to a prior buy point for aggressive traders. On June 7, the no-nonsense gym operator for budget-minded customers blasted past an 18.15 handle entry on its 10-month cup-like pattern. After stumbling back to that entry point a week later, Planet Fitness jumped as high as 8% before Tuesday's gap down.The company announced late Monday plans for the sale of 10 million Class A shares by certain holders, or 38% of the current float of 26 million shares. Over time, the expansion of the float can be positive for a stock as it generates more liquidity for institutional trading desks who desire to enter or exit the stock.Keep in mind that it appears that the lion's share of stock in Planet Fitness is held by insiders, as shares outstanding actually 98 million. Planet Fitness is a small cap with a current market value of $1.8 billion. It's steadily grown earnings (25 cents a share in 2012, then 26 cents, 42 cents and 53 cents the next three years), and Wall Street sees FY 2016 earnings rising 23% to 65 cents a share. Revenue climbed 26%, 8%, 10% and 8% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, No. 23-ranked VCA Antech (WOOF) rose more than 1% to 67.26 in volume running double normal pace. The vet clinic operator recently bounced off its 10-week moving average near 63.76 for the first time since a mid-April breakout past a 58.76 handle buy point, giving a follow-on buy opportunity.PayPal (PYPL) dropped more than 2% to 36.10 and undercut its newly formed 200-day moving average in fast trading. The stock is trying to form a base-on-base pattern after breakout attempts in March and April bore little fruit. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster reportedly gave a cautionary note on the online payments giant, saying Apple Pay may provide a formidable rival in the upcoming Christmas shopping holiday season.As seen in Monday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market's current outlook was downgraded from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure."" This means an investor can still buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower given the increased intensity of professional selling. The Nasdaq composite saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy selling) rise back to 4 while the count is at 5 for the S&P 500.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

412,ADBE,"If you've ever searched the thousands of stocks that trade and wondered if it was just you who had trouble finding good stocks to buy, have no fear. You are not alone.The money managers at Janus Forty (JDCAX), which has chalked up some of the best performance gains over multiple time periods among U.S. mutual funds, limit their holdings to 40 stocks for a reason.""We don't think there are that many great ideas at any point in time,"" said lead manager Douglas Rao.Compared with mutual funds that own 100 or more stocks, Janus Forty also can get to know the companies it owns better, he says.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersTalking about the reasons he likes gaming company Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Rao said: ""We like to invest with owner-operators or managers who act that way. They think long-term. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick is one of those guys. He and his management team bought close to 25% of the company.""Janus Forty is an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceTop-performing holdings this year include Boston Scientific (BSX), up 32%,  Facebook (FB) up 24%, Time Warner (WTX) up 23% and Amazon (AMZN) up 17%. The fund has lightened its positions in Boston and Facebook in its latest reporting period, held steady in Time Warner and increased Amazon. General Electric (GE), the top holding at about 5.25% of assets, is about flat for the year and yielding 3%.This hasn't been Janus Forty's best year. The $2.2 billion fund was up 3.02% for the year through Aug. 31 vs. 7.82% for the S&P 500. But it has an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning that its share-price performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Rao, 42, has been on board since 2013. Nick Schommer, 38, became co-manager this year. The helmsmen talked with IBD about their approach and the current investing climate from their offices in Denver.IBD: The fund is concentrated. Why do you focus on just your 40 best ideas?Rao: We don't think there are that many great ideas at any point in time. I take my cue from Warren Buffett, who called diversification ""di-worsification."" He said you should know your ideas one to 10 better than ideas 70 through 80. And ideas one through 10 should have more conviction.For us, 40 is a naturally comfortable level in terms of having the ability to know the companies we invest in.IBD: Does concentration entail a greater risk of volatility?Schommer: I wouldn't say it that strongly. We help to manage volatility by holding different buckets of growth stocks.IBD: How do stocks in each bucket differ?Schommer: Seventy percent to 80% of our portfolio is in compound growth companies. Those are companies with well-defined competitive moats, which have years of growth ahead of them, high earnings visibility and lower risk. They trade at a slight premium to the market but have much better growth.Ten percent to 15% is in blue-sky companies. Those are growth companies that have less well-defined competitive moats than compound-growth stocks. But we expect blue-sky companies to solidify their moats and graduate into compound-growth companies. They have big opportunities. But we make their positions small to manage risk.The third bucket holds special situation stocks. These are future compound growth stocks. Meanwhile, there is a business issue or a financial leverage issue that the company has to execute against. For example, GE over the past year has been divesting its GE Capital business. It hasn't been very attractive, but GE has been reinvesting in its (remaining industrial, nonfinancial) business and returning capital to shareholders. One of the keys to the success of blue-sky and special-situation companies is that they have to graduate into being compound growth companies. That's what we want with GE.IBD: What other key traits do stocks in each bucket share?Rao: We start with the same filter: Does the company have a competitive advantage? Do we believe it is sustainable? Whichever bucket a stock is in, we look at that the same way.IBD: What percent of blue-sky and special-situation companies do graduate?Rao: I'd guess about 65%. Maybe 75%.IBD: The fund was in the top 2% of its Morningstar large-cap growth category in 2015. This year it's more middle of the pack. Why has this year been more challenging?Schommer: In general, the market this year rewarded lower volatility sectors, areas without a lot of growth, sectors where naturally we tend to (take a pass on investing). The sectors that were rewarded this year were consumer staples, utilities and energy. Those tend to be sectors that are not large positions in the portfolio.Those companies may meet our business-model hurdle, but not a lot of them meet our growth hurdle. And now, particularly, they are not attractive from a valuation perspective.The market has treated them as income substitutes and given them premium valuations due to low yields in fixed income. We have instead focused on investments like Zoetis (ZTS), an animal health care company that has characteristics similar to a consumer staples company but with better growth prospects and a more reasonable starting valuation.Energy is another area that has been a good performer this year after a difficult 2015. There are a limited number of energy companies that meet our business model criteria. Most are price-takers tied to the commodity price.IBD: You've slightly trimmed your stake in Facebook. What are your concerns?Rao: It's hard to talk about it without talking about Google (GOOGL) (Alphabet). Both have become dominant platforms for advertising dollars shifting from traditional channels to digital.The reason Facebook has been so effective in monetizing these digital advertising dollars is that they have high consumer usage of their properties. (Chief Operating Officer Sheryl) Sandberg and her team, under the leadership of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have done a good job of pivoting the company away from being desktop-computer-based to being one of the dominant app providers on a global basis outside China.With WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook itself, the consumer is engaged with it to such an extent that advertising dollars move there.IBD: Which bucket is Boston Scientific in?Rao: It's in compound-growth. We bought it maybe two years ago. It started as a special situation. It had a fairly significant legal overhang with Johnson & Johnson suing them for $5 billion or $6 billion.We thought the case was questionable. They brought in a new CEO named Mike Mahoney, who had been at Johnson & Johnson. He came in to reinvigorate their cardiology franchise, which had missed a product cycle. He felt there was a pipeline there that needed to be pushed toward commercialization. The market was concerned with the litigation and factoring little growth for their cardiology products.Soon, they settled the Johnson & Johnson suit for about $1 billion. They've accelerated revenue growth and their margin growth, which had been half their competitors'. They've closed the gap. Execution has been fantastic. We expect more.IBD: Why is Activision Blizzard another position you've increased?Rao: This was another special situation. They bought King Digital, which had the popular Candy Crush game. But the market soured on King after it went public.CEO Bobby Kotick has made a number of strategic pivots. The King acquisition got them into mobile. They've gone from being a company serving 60 million to 70 million consumers through desktops and consoles to serving 500 million consumers... Another 1 billion-plus people watch those games played.Also, they've transitioned more to digital downloads than (dependence on customers) buying a console. That removes the middle man, so Activision's margins become higher.But it's still a special situation because mobile users from the King acquisition have been shrinking. We would like top see them re-engage those consumers.IBD: Amazon (AMZN) has gone up and down in size in the portfolio. Why is that?Rao: We had reduced exposure at the end of last year. They had a disappointing Q4 announcement in January, and the stock got punished. We added back after it sank dramatically.Amazon is the dominant player in e-commerce, and e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales continues to increase. And as Amazon continues to deliver faster fulfillment times, it will gain market share.Another leg of the stool is Amazon Web Services. This gets us to the idea of investing with owner-operators. In 2014, many people saw AWS as a money pit. Fast forward to today, most analysts see its worth as over $100 billion. Microsoft is doing a nice job in web services, but AWS is the dominant provider. Everyone from the CIA to GE is moving more of their business onto AWS. You don't have to have an electricity plant at your house. So why do you need your own data center?IBD: Celgene (CELG) is yet another company in which you've built your stake. What's your thesis?Rao: We reduced our position in the middle of last year. Then this year it went down about 35% from its high in mid-2015. Our analysts felt confident that it was trading at a big discount to our view of its intrinsic value.IBD: Did you trim your Priceline (PCLN) stake because slow global growth means less travel?Rao: This is another business that benefits from network effects. Their core business is Booking.com, which is hotel booking for Europe. They have a similar business in Asia called Agoda. We reduced it given its exposure to Europe and terrorist attacks and higher levels of management turnover than we were comfortable with.IBD: You've also trimmed NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). What are your concerns?Schommer: It's in special situations because it was the merger of two leading semiconductor companies, Freescale and NXP. They are the No. 1 or 2 in their end markets, which gives them a disproportionate share of profits in those lines. And they can invest more in R&D than competitors.But after the merger, the financial leverage of the business increased to a level that was above normalized operating levels. So part of why it is a special situation is that we're watching for reducing the balance sheet to a more comfortable level.IBD: Adobe (ADBE) is another trim. What's your thesis?Rao: They were one of the first to transition from selling software in shrink-wrap to a subscription model. The transition was to a much larger market. But in the transition, revenues and margins declined.We trimmed because the company has largely made the transition to a subscription business and the market is now rewarding them for this higher quality revenue.RELATED:This Top Fund Manager Likes Three Types Of Growth StocksWhat To Do When Your Fund Gets A New ManagerMutual Fund Awards 2016: Top U.S. Equities Funds

429,ADBE,"Goldman Sachs slashed its price target on Alphabet (GOOGL) stock and reduced its targets on a slew of other tech companies, including Facebook (FB), citing U.K. revenue exposure and volatile currencies in the wake of the U.K. vote for Brexit.Goldman Sachs late Tuesday cut its price target on Google parent Alphabet to 810 from 850. Google stock closed at 691 on Tuesday, down 11% so far in 2016, though shares rose 0.6% to 695.19 in the stock market today.According to Goldman Sachs, tech companies with the most sales exposure to the U.K. include Mimecast (MIME) (39% of its total sales), Rackspace Hosting (RAX) (22%-25%), Zendesk (ZEN) (15%), Accenture (ACN) (13%), BlackBerry (BBBY) (12%), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) (12%), Facebook (10%) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) (10%).Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on Facebook to 142 from 146. Facebook rallied 1.3% to 114.16 on Wednesday.The investment bank also reduced targets slightly on Adobe Systems (ADBE), Akamai Technologies (AKAM), Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday (WDAY) and Microsoft (MSFT).""We expect an active pre-announcements season potentially beginning next week, with the largest negative impact on companies with back-end loaded license revenue models with June-quarter ends, and companies with high U.K. revenue exposure,"" said the Goldman research report. ""For subscription-based companies, we anticipate a potential impact to deal signings, though note the impact will first be seen on deferred revenue and then flow to revenue.""We anticipate a more modest impact for companies with notable financial hedging, although we still see an impact on deal closures.""Goldman Sachs economists said on Monday that the U.K. could enter a mild recession by early 2017. On Thursday, Britain voted to exit the European Union within two years, though the exact timing is still unclear.Analyst estimates of U.K. revenue exposure vary. MoffettNathanson on Tuesday estimated Facebook's U.K. sales in the ""mid-single-digit range."" Google's U.K. revenue accounts for 9% of total sales, estimated MoffettNathanson, while it's 12% at Priceline (PCLN) and 10% at Twitter (TWTR).

430,ADBE,"Investors should realize that cash-rich technology companies will target privately held business software companies, as well as their public counterparts, a Canaccord Genuity analyst said in a new research report.“The good news for public company money managers is that the profitable platform firms are about to get a bunch of 'booster shots' of new technology via acquisition,” wrote Canaccord analyst Richard Davis. “That means companies such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), IBM (IBM), Google (parent Alphabet (GOOGL)), and perhaps Workday (WDAY) if that firm gets more expansive in M&A.”Microsoft on Monday turned its attention elsewhere, agreeing to buy professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD).Salesforce.com recently acquired Demandware (DWRE), while Oracle (ORCL) bought Textura in April. Also, private equity firm Thoma Bravo this month bought Qlik Technologies.While Davis explores the possibility of small software firms such as Benefitfocus (BNFT) or SPS Commerce (SPSC) being acquired, he notes that privately held companies might consider selling themselves if the outlook for initial public offerings remains tepid.“While we are nearly certain to improve on the 2016 pace, there is essentially zero chance that the 1990s’ IPO pace will return,” Davis said.Privately held companies that bear watching, says Davis, include: Adaptive Insights, Apttus, Avalara, Cloudera, DocuSign, FinancialForce, Hootsuite, InsideSales, Medallia, MuleSoft, Nintex, Okta, ServiceMax, Slack, Spredfast, Sprinklr, Tanium, Telogis, and Zuora.“Areas ripe for the consolidation we foresee include the most over-funded segments, such as analytics, point solution security tools and marketing tech. Inasmuch as more than 90% of software companies in operation are private, most of the action should occur there,” Davis added.
"
431,ADBE,"After a so-so 2016, MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) has rediscovered its giddy-up. Some of that performance moxie can be credited to tech-sector top holdings like Facebook (FB) and financials that are top new buys, such as Morgan Stanley (MS).The $14.7 billion fund's 2.21% gain last year lagged 57% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 11.96% advance. That pales in comparison to this year's performance. Going into Friday, the fund is up 9.74%, ranking in the top 34% of its direct rivals and beating the big-cap bogey's 6.86%. That's pumped up balances in retirement accounts and other portfolios owned by this fund's shareholders.Several stocks driving the surge have high IBD ratings on fundamental and technical levels. Seven of its top-10 holdings as of Dec. 31 had Composite Ratings in the 80s or 90s from IBD. All four of the fund's top new buys as of that date also sported Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.With more than 25% of shareholder money at work in technology, that was the fund's largest sector as of Feb. 28. Top-10 holdings in the tech sector with Comp Ratings of 90 or higher were Facebook, which is up 22% so far this year, and Adobe Systems (ADBE), which is up 26%, including its 6% gap up Friday morning, the day after reporting first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Adobe Systems is ranked No. 1 in the Computer Software-Desktop industry group. See how it stacks up against the Nos. 2 and 3 stocks on easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.Financials, with a weighting of about 11%, were Growth Fund's fourth-largest sector. Visa (V) was a top-10 holding in that space with a Comp in the 90s. It's up 15% this year.Top new buys in that high-Comps club were financials Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley. Goldman is up 4% this year. Morgan is up 10%.Commodity and specialty chemicals distributor Univar (UNVR), with a Comp of 90, was another top new buy. Shares are up 10%, even after pulling back 5% since March 1.Those top holdings and top new buys illustrate the appetite of managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel for stocks that can grow earnings no matter what's going on in the broader market and economy. ""We are long-term focused,"" Sabel explained in an earlier interview with IBD. ""We've held many of our names a long time. ... We may make some cyclical bets, but we really focus on secular growth stories.""The fund increased its share count in Facebook in November, December and January. Facebook is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Facebook earnings per share grew 94%, 91% and 78% the past three quarters. The social media giant's sales grew by more than 50% for each of the past five stanzas.The managers also boosted their share count in Adobe Systems in each of the three most recent months for which it has made disclosures. The digital media and marketing software firm's annual EPS has grown two years in a row. Ownership by mutual funds industrywide has increased for eight straight quarters. On Thursday, Adobe reported Q1 EPS growth of 42%. Q1 earnings of 94 cents beat analysts' expectations by 7 cents. Quarterly sales and cash flow also topped estimates.Portfolio newcomer Morgan Stanley posted EPS gains of 135% and 88% the past two quarters. Those followed two quarters of EPS declines. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters, after falling four frames in a row.Morgan Stanley is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center group, which in turn is ranked No. 16 out of 197. The stock has a sterling 98 Comp Rating. Morgan Stanley's wealth management wing plans to roll out a digital-only robo-advisor service later this year, aimed at the offspring of current clients. The news service also reports that Morgan Stanley is hiring hundreds of tech-savvy instructors to train its financial advisors on how to use new digital tools.The fund started its current stake in Univar in December. It boosted its modest initial share in January. The chemicals distributor has posted EPS growth of 422%, 89% and 1450% the past three quarters. EPS fell in four of the previous six quarters.In another move, MFS notified the Securities and Exchange Commission this week that it plans to add Paul Gordon to Growth's management team as of July 1. Gordon will remain the third manager of $2.2 billion MFS Mid Cap Growth (OTCAX), along with Fischman and Sabel. Both funds will then have the same trio of managers.""Given the similar approach across both funds, we feel it is appropriate to have the same team managing both, especially as we continue to see strong interest and flows in to both funds,"" said MFS spokesman Dan Flaherty. ""(There will be) no change to how (Growth) fund will invest.""RELATED:MFS Growth Fund Outperforms By Seeking Reliable PerformersMFS Fund Shows Its All-Weather Traits

438,ADBE,"Heavy weightings in the semiconductor, internet and software sectors have helped lift First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology Sector Index Fund (QTEC), whose holdings include such tech titans as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Nvidia (NVDA).XIBD's semiconductor sector is up 36% so far this year, the internet sector is up nearly 29% and software is up 27%. Other indexes reflect the same trend. For example, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is at a record high, extending an advance from its February 2016 low from which the index has more than doubled.Broken down by sector, First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology has 43% in semiconductor stocks, about 27% in software and 15% in internet companies. Computer hardware, telecom services and computer services make up smaller portions.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.All holdings are equally weighted, which means none of the 34 components has more than a 3.5% weighting. Because the fund draws on the Nasdaq 100 (the largest nonfinancial stocks in the composite), it is a big-cap ETF. The median market capitalization is $35.4 billion. It is rebalanced four times a year, in March, June, September and December.A few components are looking overheated. Micron Technology (MU) has surged more than 50% from its Aug. 11 low. Nvidia is near highs after a monster two-year run. Adobe Systems (ADBE) is up about 38% from its breakout Jan. 23.But many others are still are near their most recent breakouts, while others are still forming bases.The ETF broke out past a 67.27 buy point on Sept. 15 and remains in buy range. Shares pulled back shortly after the breakout but were never in a difficult situation, holding above the 50-day moving average. It was the second base that the ETF formed since it spent much of 2015 and the first half of 2016 in a long bottoming process.Like other tech ETFs, First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology Sector reflects a rally that the sector has enjoyed since July 2016, when many climbed to new highs after a long consolidation. Can it prolong the run?In terms of earnings, the sector is about the only one expected to show strong growth for the third quarter.""The expected year-over-year increase in S&P 500 earnings is essentially being driven by energy and technology,"" LPL Research said in a report Tuesday. The tech sector's Q3 earnings increase is estimated at 12.2%, and energy's is projected at 135% as it recovers from depressed levels.Technology has benefited from high margins, a continued U.S. economic recovery as well as improving international economic growth, Wells Fargo Investment Institute commented. ""We do not look for those trends to change for (at least) the next few quarters.""The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

442,ADBE,"ETF investors have profited most this year from the S&P 500 sector whose leaders looked most askance at President Donald Trump before his Jan. 24 inauguration. A rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday is set to mark the president's 100th day in office.The bellwether Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) has rallied 12.6% through April 27, outpacing Sector SPDRs tracking the materials, industrials and financial sectors — which were among the ""Trump Trades"" that rallied most in the massive sector rotation that marked his shock election victory.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the largest stock holdings in the cap-weighted index tracked by XLK, are all trading at or near 52-week highs.Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet are surging to record levels after the companies' latest earnings showed web-based, on-demand computing is driving and transforming their businesses.Those moves helped XLK make a fresh 52-week high of 54.49 on the stock market today. While XLK leads the Sector SPDRs so far this year, this broadly diversified tech exchange traded fund has been outpaced by peers investing in tech industry niches with bullish earnings momentum.Here is a look at two winning ETFs from a list screened for trading volume:Lam Research (LRCX), Micron Technology (MU) and Applied Materials (AMAT) have the biggest weights in the portfolio, at more than 5% each.Year to date through April 27, PSI is up 20% vs. a 13% gain for XLK and 7% for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average.The semiconductor ETF has far outstripped XLK over the past three and five years as well.

It has outperformed both PSI and XLK over the past 10 years, with an 11% annual average gain.The technology sector of the S&P 500 was expected to report earnings growth of 16.2% in the first quarter, trailing only the energy sector and ahead of the S&P 500's overall 9.7% growth, according to S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates at the start of earnings season.Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research, pointed out that while energy is expected to bounce back from a loss, technology is likely to be a growth leader for the third quarter in a row.The semiconductor industry will likely drive Q1 tech earnings with a projected 39.4% growth rate, she added. Other tech industries expected to grow earnings by double digits for the quarter include internet software and services, at 28.3%, and electronic equipment at 18.8%, according to CFRA.Investors who bet on niche tech ETFs may miss out on the diversification benefits of broad-based technology ETFs such as XLK ""in case analysts are incorrect about the industry leading the sector's earnings this season,"" cautioned Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA.IBD'S TAKE: Find out why the No. 1 company in many technology funds earns a spot on IBD Leaderboard, an actionable list of market-leading stocks with the potential for explosive gains.RELATED:QQQ ETF: Best Large-Cap Growth Fund Or Tech Sector Star?

Wall Street had been modeling 91 cents and $1.72 billion.Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The biggest is Creative Cloud, which includes software for creative professionals such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Adobe finished the quarter with more than $4.25 billion of digital media annualized recurring revenue (ARR). The net increase in ARR for the quarter was $265 million and driven by continued strength in Adobe's Creative Cloud business.""In Q1, Creative Cloud ARR growth was driven by strong performance in the SMB (small and medium business) segment with our Creative Cloud teams offering and international growth, as well as strong retention of existing subscribers,"" Adobe Chief Executive Shantanu Narayen said on a conference call with analysts.In the second quarter, Adobe expects to add about $290 million in net new digital media ARR.IBD'S TAKE: Adobe stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, meaning it has outperformed 93% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

""On top of that, (Adobe had) good revenue growth for a company our size and above what we had projected.""He added: ""And lastly I'd say ARR and earnings per share are the key metrics in terms of how we explain the health of the business to the Street. And we did well across the board.""BMO analyst Keith Bachman reiterated his outperform rating on Adobe and upped his price target to 140 from 125.""Our central thesis remains that we think Adobe can deliver modest revenue upside, and more ongoing EPS upside, generated by operating leverage,"" Bachman said in a report.Cowen analyst Derrick Wood kept his outperform rating and raised his price target on Adobe to 145 from 140.""Adobe continues to demonstrate consistent execution, margin leverage and earnings power, which should provide investors with confidence in the sustainability of the model,"" Wood said in a report.RELATED:Adobe Beats On Earnings, Sales; Shares Hit New High After Close

446,ADBE,"Futures for the Dow industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 as of Wednesday night indicated modest gains at Thursday's market open. Large-cap techs Oracle (ORCL) and Tesla (TSLA) are likely to start the morning off with solid gains.The Dow industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all rallied for solid gains Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, but signaled it still plans only two more hikes this year, allaying some fears. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all within 1% of all-time highs. The Nasdaq 100, buoyed by Dow component Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and other big-tech techs, did hit record levels.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and internet giants (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) have been market leaders in 2017. Here's why you need to look at FANG stocks now.Oracle late Wednesday reported a surprise profit gain, an 8% yearly rise to 69 cents a share excluding various items. Analysts had expected 62 cents. Revenue rose 3% to $9.27 billion, slightly above views. Cloud-based on-demand revenue is booming, offsetting declines in its traditional software licensing business as the long transition turns a corner.Oracle stock jumped 6% in late trading. Shares closed Wednesday's stock market trading at 43.05, up 0.6% and still in buy range from a 42.10 entry point.Adobe Systems (ADBE), a business software maker that transitioned to the cloud faster than Oracle, reports earnings late Thursday. Adobe Systems is well extended from a January breakout, hitting a fresh high on Wednesday.Tesla late Wednesday announced plans to raise $1 billion in capital: $750 million in convertible debt and $250 million in stock. With underwriter options, Tesla could boost cash by $1.15 billion as it gears up to start producing the Model 3.Normally, capital raises will pressure a stock. But CEO Elon Musk had warned during Tesla's Q4 earnings conference call that cash levels would be ""close to the edge."" That hint of a capital raise, along with a wider-than-expected loss, pushed shares sharply lower late last month, undercutting a buy point and last week falling below its 50-day line.Tesla shares rose about 2% in late trading Wednesday. Overnight moves don't always stick when regular trading starts, so keep that in mind.Tesla already has had a strong week so far. On Tuesday, Tesla shares rose 4.8%, its best gain in month, retaking its 50-day line in heavy volume on a report that the company would introduce a compact SUV next year. Tesla shares dipped 0.9% on Wednesday.In Asian afternoon trading, stocks rose in China, Hong Kong and South Korea, with Japan's Nikkei flat.The Bank of Japan left its monetary policy unchanged, while China's central bank raised short-term rates hours after the Fed's move.RELATED:Oracle Turns A Corner As Cloud Revenues Boom, Earnings TopThe Big Picture: The 'Goldilocks' Rally PrevailsTesla Will Raise $1 Billion In Stock, Debt; Investors No Longer On 'Edge'

448,ADBE,"The Brexit market plunge cooled off software stocks on Friday, with Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW) falling as worries over the U.K. and European economies outweighed M&A speculation that had been helping stocks.In a referendum, British voters Thursday opted to exit the European Union within two years, roiling global markets. Volatile currency rates will likely impact the earnings of software companies, said Brean Capital in a research report.Brean said that only 5% of Salesforce.com's revenue comes from the U.K., but about 17% comes from Europe overall. Salesforce.com stock was down 4.6% on the stock market today.Tableau Software (DATA) garners 14% of revenue from the U.K. and 28% from Europe, says the report. Tableau stock was down 9.2% in the stock market today.Workday stock tumbled 7.8% Friday.

450,ADBE,"Adobe Systems (ADBE), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec (SYMC) are among smaller sharks that could get involved in the ongoing acquisition spree of software companies, says Pacific Crest Securities.Salesforce.com (CRM) last week acquired Demandware (DWRE), sparking speculation over what other companies could be acquired. Playing matchmaker, Pacific Crest says in a research report that Adobe could target Shopify (SHOP). One analyst last week said Adobe could have been in the hunt for Demandware.Adobe Systems stock closed up 0.4% in the stock market today. Shopify rose 1.4%. Symantec ended essentially flat, but Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock climbed 3.3%.Other possible targets, speculates Pacific Crest, include such ""minnows"" as  Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Apigee (APIC) and Imperva (IMPV).While Microsoft (MSFT) was not active in the 2011 round of software-related M&As, Pacific Crest says it looms as a buyer in the current cycle. Microsoft in early 2015 tried to buy Salesforce.com, said reports. Some rumors of late, though, have Amazon.com as a possible Salesforce.com buyer.Hewlett Packard Enterprise on May 25 said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a move that could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say. HPE holds its Discover 2016 conference this week in Las Vegas, where new partnerships may be announced.Pacific Crest speculates that IBM could be a suitor for a security software firm or Apigee.“The 2016 M&A cycle includes a larger pool of minnows, but also more sharks,” said the Pacific Crest report. “Not only do we see the size of the software M&A pool expanding into analytics and security this cycle, we also believe the vertical software market is ripe for consolidation, particularly within health care.”Pacific Crest also includes Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) in its pool of potential sharks. It says SAP, Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), too, could be on the prowl, as is usually the case for those sharks.

451,ADBE,"Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google could step up the pace of acquisitions now that valuations are falling in Silicon Valley for hot, pre-IPO startups, says a Bloomberg report.Google, Facebook and Amazon.com (AMZN) have been called digital conglomerates, as they gobble up startups in artificial intelligence, virtual reality and other tech areas. Apple has been more reserved, although it's slowing growth may spur more acquisitions.The cash-rich internet giants are not the only ones that may go shopping. Analysts also expect Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE), Alibaba (BABA), Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and IBM (IBM) to be among the buyers. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) last week acquired LinkedIn (LNKD) for a hefty $26.2 billion.It's an era of ""unicorns"" -- startups valued at $1 billion or more, based on venture capital and private investments. The biggest names among unicorns include resource-sharing businesses such as Uber, Airbnb and Lyft, as well as social online companies Snapchat, Spotify and Pinterest.While unicorn valuations have been tempered recently, that's also a trend among smaller startups, says the Bloomberg report.Mutual funds including Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price (TROW) recently have marked down the value of their holdings in startups such as Hootsuite Media, Dropbox, CloudFlare, Cloudera, DocuSign and Zenefits.Annual U.S. VC funding more than doubled to $63 billion from 2013 through 2015, but now capital has begun to flow more slowly to startups, and valuations are falling, says the report.Facebook and Amazon remain IBD Leaderboard stocks. Facebook stock ended trading up 0.9% to 114.38 on the stock market today. Amazon stock was up 0.3% to 715.82. Facebook could be forming a flat base, with a 121.18 buy point.

452,ADBE,"Jump-starting its push into e-commerce, Salesforce.com (CRM) on Wednesday said it has agreed to buy Demandware (DWRE), a partner, in a deal valued at $2.8 billion.Cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com said it would pay $75 per share for Demandware, a 56% premium to its closing price on Tuesday. Demandware shares shot up 56% to 74.75 in morning trade on the stock market today, near 75.The company provides software to design e-commerce websites, and at least one analyst says Adobe Systems (ADBE) also might have had its eye on Demandware.Now, “It’s possible Adobe looks at other assets in e-commerce, although others with large customer scale are scant,” Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research note.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com is the leading provider of customer relationship software. It competes with such enterprise software leaders as Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL) and ServiceNow (NOW).“The deal will also offer Salesforce.com an opportunity to expand its presence in the B2C (business-to-consumer) space where it has had limited success so far,” Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said in a research report. “Given Salesforce’s financial strength, we do not expect another bidder to emerge.”Salesforce.com stock was down a fraction in morning trade Wednesday, near 83.50. Salesforce.com stock hit an all-time high of 84.48 on Thursday and is up 6.5% in 2016 after having touched a 19-month low of 52.60 on Feb. 8.The Demandware acquisition is expected to close by the end of July. Salesforce.com said the acquisition ""is expected to increase fiscal 2017 total revenue by approximately $100 million to $120 million. This estimate reflects an approximately $50 million reduction relating to fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue.""Demandware’s Q1 revenue rose 33% to $67 million. It swung to a 6-cent profit minus items from a penny loss in the year-earlier period.Burlington, Mass.-based Demandware’s customers include Lands' End, L'Oreal and Marks and Spencer Group.Salesforce.com's  Q1 profit jumped 50% to 24 cents per share minus items. Revenue in the three months ended April 30 rose 27% to $1.92 billion.Salesforce.com had partnered with Demandware, Pritchard pointed out. Salesforce rival SAP in 2013 acquired e-com software maker Hybris.“The strategic fit is sound, although we expected partner strategy to persist for longer,” Pritchard wrote. “There is no question in our minds that e-commerce makes sense as part of a Salesforce.com suite.""Salesforce has had a “blank” square in its market coverage map for a number of years in e-commerce.  We believe it is likely that SAP’s success with Hybris put some pressure on Salesforce to bring e-commerce in-house.”

453,ADBE,"Microsoft's (MSFT) deal to buy online professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion took many on Wall Street by surprise. Most analysts thought it was more likely that Microsoft would acquire a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company like Salesforce.com (CRM) or Workday (WDAY). Many say the deal could spark more mergers and acquisitions in enterprise software.Microsoft announced its agreement to purchase LinkedIn early Monday. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the deal ""brings together the world’s leading professional cloud with the world’s leading professional network.""Microsoft stock, which fell 2.6% Monday, closed 0.6% lower at 49.83 on the stock market today. Workday rose 2.5% Tuesday, while Salesforce.com stock dipped 0.5%.Microsoft reportedly tried to acquire Salesforce.com in early 2015 with a bid that topped $50 billion, but it was rebuffed. With LinkedIn, Microsoft will get tools to compete with Salesforce. Microsoft will be able to use LinkedIn's Sales Navigator as a social selling tool integrated with its Dynamics customer relationship management software.“Microsoft’s agreement to purchase LinkedIn came as a surprise -- we thought a SaaS application M&A strategy was more likely,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research report.He said he sees the logic of the deal -- combining LinkedIn user data with Microsoft’s Office 365 and Dynamics CRM -- but he is not clear on how it materially expands Microsoft’s total addressable market.“The good news is this takes the risk of an even bigger deal off the table and (we think) implies Microsoft’s core business remains healthy,” MacMillan said. He rates Microsoft stock as outperform, with a price target of 61.The LinkedIn deal could spur more mergers and acquisitions in the cloud computing sector, Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in a report.“This acquisition increases the likelihood of more M&A in enterprise and systems software,” he said.The question is which companies will step up. Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) are among the potential acquirers, he said.Microsoft eventually will consider buying a firm with exceptional sales talent, such as Salesforce, Workday, Adobe Systems (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW) or Splunk (SPLK), he said. Davis rates Microsoft stock as hold, with a price target of 55.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle also sees more M&A ahead in internet cloud applications.“As Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft and Google compete more aggressively in the cloud, applications provide a means of differentiation,” Barnicle said in a report. “Microsoft leads in applications because of Office. LinkedIn would provide additional differentiation.""It is likely Amazon and Google will also look to acquire large application companies, like Salesforce.com, Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK) or Workday. They are less likely to buy the smaller or more vertical SaaS vendors because those companies are too small to make a big difference for Amazon or Google, in our view.""Barnicle rates Microsoft stock as overweight, with a price target of 65.While some analysts on Wall Street were cautiously upbeat about the Microsoft-LinkedIn tie-up, others said Microsoft paid too much.“While we believe there is some strategic rationale supporting the deal, we question at what cost,” Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in a report. “We view this acquisition as similar to other major acquisitions that Microsoft has made over the years, including aQuantive, Skype, and Nokia.”The purchases of aQuantive and Nokia were costly failures, and Skype’s performance is an unknown quantity, he said.“Microsoft has historically gotten a free pass from investors, since these deals typically only represented about a quarter of free cash flow, vs. more than a year’s worth for LinkedIn, which may force accountability,” DiFucci said. He rates Microsoft stock underperform with a price target of 40.RELATED:Public, Private Software Firms May Compete In M&A, Says CanaccordSalesforce-Microsoft Office 365 Deal ‘Delivering Real Dividends’Is Salesforce Big Enough To Avoid Amazon, Oracle Overtures?

457,ADBE,"The crown jewel of e-commerce platform provider Shopify (SHOP) could be merchandise data from small and medium-size businesses that use its software, an analyst said Tuesday.Monika Garg at Pacific Crest Securities also hiked her price target on the company to 78 from 66. Shopify stock lost 2.4% to 67.20 on the stock market today. Shares in Shopify are up 60% in 2017.""Data could be a crown jewel,"" Garg wrote in a note to clients. ""Shopify hosts online stores for its merchants, hence Shopify knows about inventories, receivables, which products are getting sold and which are getting stalled. We believe this is a unique data set that Shopify is gathering on its merchants.""And this data could be useful for any commercial bank or consumer finance company,"" Garg went on to say. ""Shopify had also indicated on its recent earnings call that the company is investing heavily in its machine learning and data capabilities.""Shopify's 2016 revenue jumped 90% to $389.3 million.""Given its growth opportunities, we estimate that Shopify could do around $1.7 billion in revenue by 2021,"" said Garg.IBD'S TAKE: Shopify is part of IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise Group, a sector that ranks 54th out of 197 groups. Shopify itself is rated 13th in the group, which has 76 companies. Tops on the list is Paycom Software (PAYC).

463,ADBE,"This year's teeter-totter market has posed special challenges for all investors. The managers of $1.3 billion USAA Aggressive Growth (USAUX) are no exceptions.Over the past year going into Wednesday, the fund has outperformed 72% of its rival large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. by losing less than most of them. The fund has gained 4.99% in the volatile past three months, but that only tops 28% of its peers.The fund could be primed for strong performance when the stock market strengthens if the quality of its top holdings are an indication. Aggressive Growth's top 10 holdings as of March 31 included six stocks with IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.In addition, holdings include Adobe Systems (ADBE), which sports a 92 Comp Rating.Trading around 95, Adobe is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 98.10 buy point. Volume has dried up as the handle forms, which is positive. But as IBD's Leaderboard analysis of the stock points out, Adobe's earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view the stock is extended. Still, you could make a case that the right side of the base needed more work.Adobe has succeeded in morphing into a company that lets customers receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Is Adobe a buy or a sell? Take a free trial of IBD Leaderboard today to find outRevenue growth has sped over the past three quarters, from 9% to 21%, 22% and 25%. The fiscal second quarter ends this month. Wall Street currently expects earnings to rise 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains of 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters. It's still vigorous profit growth.Facebook (FB), another Leaderboard stock, is one of those top holdings. It has a 99 Composite Rating.EPS gains are accelerating, rising 16%, 33% 46% and 83% the past four quarters. The 83% earnings jump to 77 cents a share easily beat Wall Street estimates as did the 52% jump in revenue to $5.4 billion. The stock responded to the upbeat results by gapping up 7% April 28 and clearing a 117.09 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It got as high as 121 before easing to just below the buy point.Facebook has gifted investors with a big 300%-plus return since it broke out past a 29.17 buy point of a double-bottom base in the week ended July 26, 2013, as IBD pointed out recently.Electronic Arts (EA) is a top new buy, which has a 95 Comp Rating.The video game publisher delivered better-than-expected earnings and sales growth last week.Q4 EPS rose 28%. That profit got a boost from EA's growing digital sales, which made up over 70% of all fourth-quarter revenue, as IBD reported on Tuesday.Also, EA had no debt last year and a solid 32% return on equity. That, plus a 46% average annual EPS growth rate over the past five years, has attracted a rising number of funds as investors. Two typically better-performing funds own shares in Electronic Arts: $12 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX) and $12 billion MFS Growth (MFEGX).Among other holdings, Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) has a 99 Comp Rating and is up 16% so far this year.The maker of orthopedic and dental reconstruction implants, trauma products and related surgical products has seen EPS rise in each of the past four quarters, climbing from -2% to 30% in that span. Revenue grew 59%, 58% and 68% in the past three stanzas. The company beat consensus estimates for both EPS and revenue in Q1.The company was born from last year's $14 billion merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet. That created a global leader in musculoskeletal health care, which does business in more than 100 countries, IBD recently reported.Last month, Zimmer said it would take over Cayenne Medical to strengthen its sports medicine offerings.Trading near 117, the stock is within 1% of the 117.87 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.The portfolio is run by two separate subadvisors. Winslow Capital and Wellington Management each manage about 50% of the fund. When one side's outperformance skews the split by too much, USAA rebalances by funneling inflow into the lagging portion. It also takes any shareholder redemptions from the larger portion.Winslow's Clark Winslow, Patrick Burton and Justin Kelly are somewhat more aggressive in their style, says USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the subadvisors. Wellington's manager is Paul Marrkand. ""Wellington is more conscious of valuation,"" Latif said.The subadvisors' sleeves share many names. ""But Winslow has more FANG stocks,"" said USAA analyst Julius Barnes, referring to 2015 high-flyers Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, now Alphabet (GOOGL).As of Jan. 31, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Starbucks (SBUX) were in the Winslow sleeve only.Going into Thursday, UnitedHealth was up about 11% for the year. It had an 86 Comp Rating but a weak D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks. Starbucks was down about 9% for the year. It has a so-so 70 Comp Rating and worst-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Oracle (ORCL) and PepsiCo (PEP) were two names in Wellington's sleeve only.Oracle was up 8%, but has a weak 55 Composite Rating and a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating. EPS fell the past four quarters and were flat in the two frames before that.Pepsi was up less than 1%, with a 59 Composite Rating and E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.""When we have a high-growth, bullish market, Winslow does better,"" Latif said. ""The opposite happens when the market is not led by growth and is challenged."" Wellington's sleeve has outperformed Winslow's so far this year, Latif says.

464,ADBE,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is fortifying its kingdom on a cloud, but now the question is whether that automatically comes with an acquisition-proof moat.Salesforce's $2.8 billion buyout last week of e-commerce platform Demandware (DWRE) beefs up its arsenal as Silicon Valley continues to engage in turf battles atop virtual thunderheads. The rumored bidding war over Demandware is said to have included Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both compete -- to varying degrees -- with Salesforce’s cloud-based customer-relationship-management software.But few players now seem to have the full suite of enterprise tools that Salesforce offers. By adding an enterprise cloud e-commerce platform to its product lineup, it allows Salesforce to ""own the entire customer journey,"" as Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin put it. Salesforce's products involve the first contacts with customers to sales and transactions and on to service issues.""That’s the holy grail,"" Zukin told Investor's Business Daily.Is it enough to put Salesforce out of reach? With Salesforce's market cap at well over $56 billion, and with an increasing number of acquisitions under its belt, it might be getting too formidable to be a takeover target.The Demandware buy comes on the heels of Salesforce’s announcement that it has chosen the web services unit of Amazon (AMZN) as its ""preferred public cloud infrastructure provider,"" expanding its existing partnership and using Amazon’s cloud provider in certain markets abroad to ""help bring new infrastructure online more quickly and efficiently.""Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead called the agreement a ""big deal.""""It is a major endorsement of (Amazon Web Services), and Salesforce becomes the first of the larger 'incumbent' (software-as-a-service) vendors to give up on the idea that they need to own/control their own data center infrastructure footprint,"" he wrote. Keirstead added, though, that the deal materially shrinks the chances of Microsoft (MSFT) acquiring Salesforce, a rumored partnership in years past.Piper Jaffray's Zukin isn't so sure. He recalled chatter of years past that has included not only Microsoft but Oracle as a potential Salesforce buyer.""I think Salesforce is a unique strategic asset and I wouldn’t put it past someone else from buying them over the next couple of years,"" Zukin said.Zukin speculated in early May that a separate deal, in which Salesforce would build its new Internet of Things service on Amazon’s cloud, could lead to a ""cozier"" relationship between the two, perhaps in the form of a strategic sales partnership. Amazon also could spin out its web services unit and merge it with Salesforce, or even acquire the company outright, with the latter being the least likely, he speculated.""Fundamentally we view (Salesforce) as a clear beneficiary of a larger 'Cloud Game of Thrones' being waged among (Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL)'s Google) for the Cloud Platform 'Iron Throne,'"" Zukin wrote on May 12. (Coincidentally, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is a distant cousin of ""Game of Thrones"" co-showrunner David Benioff.)Zukin still thinks Amazon could annex Salesforce in some capacity, though. When asked if the Demandware acquisition put Salesforce at odds with Amazon -- given that Demandware builds e-commerce solutions for individual businesses, ostensibly guiding them away from selling their wares on Amazon -- he demurred.""You could almost argue the opposite case,"" he said. ""It almost makes Salesforce an interesting acquisition to Amazon.""While Amazon is the rumored Salesforce acquirer du jour, Zukin’s money is on Google’s name being added to the mix next year.""Depending on who bought them, it would make tremendous sense,"" said Zukin. ""A combination of (Amazon Web Services) and Salesforce.com is a killer combination that would put (others) on the defensive.""""That would make Amazon the new IBM (IBM),"" he said.Salesforce’s deal with Amazon Web Services is believed to clock in at $400 million through 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing someone familiar with the matter, plus a recent SEC filing that refers to a purchase commitment with an unnamed third-party provider for ""certain infrastructure services for a period of four years.""""As Salesforce looks to leverage their services internationally, I think they’re going to do so utilizing that Amazon infrastructure rather than going out and leasing data centers in international markets,"" said Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson. ""It’s a lot easier to just rent capacity from Amazon, where they already have a presence overseas.""He called the deal the ""right move,"" but said it’s hard to predict how that relationship could expand down the road.At the very least, Salesforce's moves are well-timed. More businesses are feeling comfortable moving their data to the public cloud as well as looking to save on technology costs, Nelson says. That has resulted in an accelerated migration to cloud services.Salesforce, which is seen hitting the $8 billion mark in revenue this year, is largely expected to benefit as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others stake out their space in cloud computing.And for its part, Salesforce right now sees itself as more the hunter than the hunted.""The M&A season right now is the most intense, most exciting I have ever seen,"" Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff said last week on CNBC. ""I have never seen more deals and more things happening. We’re not winning every deal; this is just a deal that we were actually able to get done. We’re excited that we could actually get Demandware, and it’s tough to get deals done in this environment because everybody’s positioning for growth for next year.""Still, it wouldn’t be a true game of thrones unless more land grabs were on the horizon.""I think we’re already seeing the M&A market heat up,"" said Nelson, noting Oracle’s acquisitions in recent weeks of Opower, which provides cloud services to utilities, and Textura, a construction software firm.""We’ve also already seen the privatization market intensify,"" said Nelson, highlighting Marketo and Qlik’s recent moves to go private, ""So I think we’re going to see activity remain high for a while.""The service and app clouds are Salesforce’s fastest-growing products, say analysts, and Zukin says its new Demandware-based ""commerce cloud"" could become its fastest grower. The company says it expects to create ""yet another billion-dollar cloud"" with the purchase.Salesforce’s clients span across industries and include the likes of GE (GE), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal.Shares now trade in the lower end of buy territory after breaking out of a period of consolidation with an 83 entry point and recovering from an early February dive that sent the stock tumbling 20% over the course of two trading sessions to a 16-month low.The plunge was prompted by Tableau’s (DATA) disappointing full-year earnings guidance that sliced Tableau’s shares nearly in half on Feb. 5, which weighed heavily on software stocks, including ServiceNow (NOW) and Splunk (SPLK).Tableau’s shares have only recovered slightly, while Salesforce shares came back to hit a new high of 84.48 on May 26.

465,ADBE,"Ever since Apple (AAPL) stock peaked last summer, few on Wall Street have talked about the iPhone maker potentially reaching a market capitalization of $1 trillion, as they once did.But on Wednesday, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi resurrected the possibility.In a research report, Sacconaghi said the company’s “recipe for a $1 trillion market cap” could be a shift from being a hardware company to a service provider.Today, Apple is valued as a computer hardware company, making it vulnerable to replacement cycles and falling average selling prices and margins, Sacconaghi said. Apple would be valued more highly if it offered its devices on a service plan, he said.Apple stock rose 1.1% to 94.56 on the stock market today, giving it a market cap of $518 billion. Sacconaghi rates Apple stock as outperform, with a price target of 135.“Consumers have become accustomed to paying monthly bills for various services, such as internet, cable, Netflix (NFLX), and Spotify, to name a few,” Sacconaghi said. “Even among the quantitatively-minded investment community, many find it easier to justify a $30 monthly charge (for an iPhone) than a $720 purchase every 2 years … even though they’re essentially the same.”By offering Apple products as a service, the company could switch to a recurring business model, which would likely get customers to spend more over time. In return, Apple customers could avoid hefty upfront payments for hardware and get the latest devices sooner, he said.Apple's main business problem today is getting users to upgrade to newer devices when their current iPhones, iPads and Macs are working just fine.Apple isn’t like other makers of PCs and smartphones because it has a much stronger brand attachment. People love their iPhones, he said.“The challenge and opportunity for Apple is whether it can migrate from a transactional monetization model to a subscription model,” Sacconaghi said. Companies that have successfully shifted their business models to subscriptions include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN), he said.“We see the monthly cost of a family plan of Apple products amounting to similar or less than what U.S. consumers spend for cable television and wireless service,” Sacconaghi said. “We estimate that an Apple package needed for our family (3 iPad Minis, 1 iPad Air – each with a three-year replacement cycle; and 3 iPhones, each with a 2-year replacement cycle) would cost ‘only’ about $140 per month -- well below the price of our current monthly cable bill and wireless bill.“Even if we included additional Apple services (Apple Music for $15 per month; iCloud storage for $10 per month; and a speculated but yet to be released over-the-top television offering for $40 per month), our hypothetical Apple monthly would be an estimated $207 per month.”If Apple were to pursue such a strategy, it would face resistance from its wireless carrier partners and would have to educate consumers of its benefits, Sacconaghi said.Apple already offers a smartphone subscription plan called the iPhone Upgrade Program. That program charges a monthly fee for iPhone hardware and handset upgrades every year.RELATED:Apple To Double iPhone Memory With Next Handset: ReportApple Has Reportedly Started Production On iPhone 7Apple Should Be Valued Like Internet, Not Hardware, Company

467,ADBE,"Large-cap mutual funds outperformed small-cap and midcap funds over the past three years.Why? Amid slow global economic growth, investors sought the relative safety of stocks in bigger companies with deeper pockets. Those firms are better positioned to withstand whatever unpleasant shocks the markets unveil. Also, those bigger companies can gobble up smaller rivals that fall on hard times. And U.S. large caps have looked attractive amid doubts about GDP growth in other developed markets.As a group, large-cap mutual funds notched an 8.41% average annual gain over the past three years. That easily outran their midcap rivals' 6.97% average annual return. And it walloped the 5.51% average annual advance posted by small-cap funds.If you have bet solely or more heavily on large-cap funds than the other categories in recent years, it would have been a boon to your overall portfolio and retirement planning.Amid broad market volatility -- stemming from woes in the oil patch, worries about weakened energy companies' impact on their lenders and doubts about China's growth -- this year alone has been tough. Only midcap funds as a group are in positive territory, up a meager 0.45% vs. a 0.13% setback for large-cap funds and 0.79% slide by small caps.Over the entire three years, if you had invested $10,000 in a cross section of large-cap funds on March 31, 2013, by now it would be worth $13,296.The same amount would have grown to $12,683 in the average midcap fund and $12,100 in the average small-cap funds.The $3.17 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) -- run by the firm that used to be known as AllianceBernstein -- was one of the top-performing large-cap funds over the past three years. It racked up a 14.38% average annual gain.In that same span, the S&P 500 averaged a 10.41% annual gain.Talk about sizzle, AB Large Cap Growth is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for outperforming the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Fund manager Frank Caruso discussed his investment approach in detail recently in an IBD fund manager question-and-answer feature report.One of his recent holdings is lighting products maker Acuity Brands (AYI), which has helped the fund turn up the wattage on its performance. Its LED products are seeing strong demand.Share price is up 42% over the past 52 weeks.Around midday Friday, Acuity Brands was in a buy range from a 242 alternate entry, but it remained extended from a prior 225.28 buy point. The stock has held above a key test of the 240 price level.The stock has a 99 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.On Dec. 10, Acuity completed its acquisition of Juno Lighting Group, a maker of LED-based down- and track-lighting fixtures.On April 6, Acuity reported profit in the February-ended fiscal second quarter of $1.80 a share. That was up 53% and nicely above the consensus estimate of $1.51. Sales rose 26% to $777.8 million. Analysts were modeling $752.3 million.Earnings per share rose 29% and 24% in the prior two quarters. The stock's dividend yield is 0.2%.Adobe Systems (ADBE) is another holding with a strong Comp Rating, in this case 91. Shares are up 25% in the past 52 weeks.Early afternoon on Friday, Adobe Systems was closing in on a 98.10 cup-with-handle buy point, IBD's markets team noted. Volume had dried up as the handle formed, which is positive. An earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view, the stock was extended.However, you could argue that the right side of the stock's base needed more work.  The image-editing and PDF-software giant has made a successful transition in allowing customers to receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Adobe's fiscal second quarter ends in May. Wall Street sees earnings rising 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains, which grew 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters, but still represents robust profit growth Dental products firm Align Technology (ALGN) is up 29% over the past 52 weeks.EPS grew 25% and 32% the past two quarters.

Adobe created the PDF, or portable document format.The partnership's goal is to help transform document workflows, Bryan Lamkin, Adobe executive vice president and general manager of digital media, told IBD. Too many document workflows today still involve paper for signatures when they could be kept entirely electronic, he said.Adobe teamed up with Box because it's a popular service among businesses for storing and sharing documents securely, Lamkin said.

Red Hat, based in Raleigh, N.C., is the fast-growing developer of software, built on the open-source Linux operating system, that manages vast enterprise data, be they in the cloud or in traditional on-premise operations.Microsoft (MSFT) announced in November that it would run Red Hat hybrid software on Azure, Microsoft's cloud service.How fast is Red Hat moving? Earnings grew 14% and revenue 15% in the third quarter ended Nov. 30, although analysts polled by Thomson Reuters think that for the current quarter, Q4, profit will moderate to 9% growth from a year earlier of 47 cents per share minus items, on sales up 15.7% to $537 million.""While we have been positive on the stock for a long time, our recent market perform rating was largely valuation-based,"" Moskowitz said. ""However, the stock has significantly underperformed this year (down 18%, vs. the Nasdaq down 10%), which has presented investors with a favorable risk/reward once again.""Moskowitz said that his crew's recent checks with midsize and big IT customers suggest that Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) -- its core software, first issued 13 years ago -- is likely to grow faster than the 2% annual pace that research firm Gartner gives the overall Linux market.""Meanwhile, though not yet inflecting, demand for OpenStack continues to rise, and we expect another year of high growth (off a still relatively low base),"" Moskowitz wrote. OpenStack is a free, open-source software platform for cloud computing.""We also believe RHT’s recent partnership with Microsoft Azure (not in our numbers) should create significant revenue synergies for RHEL (and Azure) over time,"" Moskowitz added. ""Further, one of our public cloud contacts we recently spoke with sees material upside from the partnership and believes the power of Microsoft’s distribution could also drive an inflection in sales for RHT’s CloudForms hybrid cloud management software.""Longer term, we believe containers will become increasingly prevalent and that RHT is very well placed to benefit from this unfolding trend, with native support built into RHEL and OpenShift, and with RHEL Atomic Host specifically targeting the opportunity.""Containers allow software to run reliably in a variety of computing environments. OpenShift is a Red Hat platform-as-a-service product; RHEL Atomic Host is an operating system.With a market cap of $12.5 billion, Red Hat is the third largest member of IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group -- led, of course, by Microsoft with about a $409 billion market value.

481,ADBE,"Just as the stock market goes through a correction, earnings for the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to record their first year-over-year decline in the past 10 quarters.A slowing China, weak global economy, strong dollar, poor PC sales and the shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector, and the top tech companies' Q4 EPS are seen falling for the first time since Q2 2013.""Tech remains stuck in a low-growth environment, and the interaction of rising interest rates, a strong dollar, weak oil and commodities are increasing risk,"" said Bill Whyman, head of technology strategy research at Evercore ISI.Tech spending growth generally is slow, says Whyman, but he adds that underneath the surface, there is an aggressive shift in spending that favors companies connected to cloud computing, including providers of software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and young, disruptive Internet companies.Apple, Facebook, Amazon Earnings On TapThus far, 13 of the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings, including Intel (INTC) and IBM (IBM), which both provided tepid guidance that sent their shares falling.The tech earnings season gets into full swing starting Tuesday, with the biggest company of them all — Apple (AAPL) — set to report that day after the market close amid fast falling expectations for sales of its top product, the iPhone. On Wednesday comes Facebook (FB) and Qualcomm (QCOM), both after the close. On Thursday it's Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), also after the close. Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) reports on Monday, Feb. 1, after the close.The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings per share minus items to fall 3.4% from the year-earlier quarter, the fourth quarter in a row of deceleration. Subtracting Apple, which has the largest impact of any company in S&P 500, tech earnings would fall 6.7%, according to estimates collected by Thomson Reuters.For the S&P 500 as a whole, analysts call for EPS ex items, such as stock options and one-time expenses, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see its EPS tumble 73%. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to rise 1.6% overall.Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings that usually put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. Not now. In terms of earnings performance, tech is in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500.""The tech sector is now more of a mirror of the S&P index as whole,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The tech industry has been stuck in slow-growth mode at the same time it's going through a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing — which has shattered old ways of using technology, says Evercore ISI's Whyman. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by turning to Internet-based cloud computing services provided by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Cloud Computing Drives TechnologyCloud computing is the dominant force in technology and will continue to accelerate, says Whyman. Among other things, cloud computing has spurred the emergence of SaaS, provided on demand as needed. SaaS leaders include Salesforce.com (CRM).Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and mainland China, opting for stripped-down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products. That is rattling some of the largest information technology companies, such as IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), all of which are undergoing major transitions.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs and now-slowing growth for smartphones and tablets.Global PC shipments fell 8.3% in the fourth quarter vs. Q4 2014, to just under 76 million units, according to preliminary results by market tracker Gartner. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment declines. For the year, PC shipments fell 8% to 288.7 million units. Gartner expects PC shipments to fall this year as well, but only by 1%, and it anticipates a soft recovery later in 2016.Global semiconductor sales fell 2% in 2015 to $334 billion, Gartner says, attributed not just to PCs, but also in part to weakened demand for electronic equipment amid the cloud shift and the continuing impact of the strong dollar.Strong Dollar Hurts Tech ResultsThe strong dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, is more difficult for tech companies than other sectors.""A big variable remains the U.S. dollar, as it has a huge impact on tech,"" said Whyman. ""Tech derives more revenue from outside the U.S. than any other S&P sector.""Apple, despite the popularity of its products and huge size, is not immune to the fallout. When Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, its performance in China will be closely watched. China accounted for an estimated 25% of all iPhone sales in 2015. Slower economic growth in China and slower sales of smartphones globally are expected to pressure its earnings growth. The consensus on Apple is EPS growth of 6% year over year, which would be its slowest growth in eight quarters.As always, analysts will focus on corporate guidance, and the outlook might be especially important in this earnings cycle amid a rough start to 2016 for global stock markets.""The range of uncertainty is widening, so there is a greater interest in clues as to what 2016 might hold,"" Whyman said.Among the 12 subsectors in the S&P 500 tech group, application software leads with an expected average EPS increase of 44%. The group includes Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com.The Internet software and services group is expected to have the second-best performance among the tech subsectors. This includes Facebook and Alphabet, which continue to ride the rising tide of mobile and online ad growth. Facebook is expected to show EPS growth of 26%, while Alphabet is expected to post growth of 18%.Friday, some of the biggest tech companies reporting earnings in the coming week rose ahead of the major stock market indexes.Apple stock lifted 5.3% to 101.42, Facebook gained 4% to 97.94, Amazon rose 3.7% to 596.38 and Microsoft logged a 3.6% boost to 52.29.

486,ADBE,"Well, which canary is it?After Big Data analytics software maker Tableau Software (DATA) disappointed investors with Q1 and 2016 guidance well below Wall Street expectations -- sending its stock crashing 49.5% Friday to an all-time low -- Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury questioned whether Tableau ""will prove to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.”Nandury was referring to Tableau and prospects for its growth. But later Friday, in a research report, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley posed the identical question: “We wonder if Tableau will prove to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.” Ashley's canary was much bigger.“With among the smallest deal sizes and shortest sales cycles in enterprise software, Tableau theoretically would be the first to see any downturn in new pipeline business due to a macro weakness,” Ashley wrote, questioning whether other enterprise software vendors might follow.Investors got the point. Tableau rivals Splunk (SPLK) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) fell 23% and 15%, respectively, and little Hortonworks (HDP) -- which may have been Big Data’s first canary with a 37% gap down Jan. 19 after a poor earnings report -- fell 17%, also hitting an all-time low.Closing Friday at 8.48, Hortonworks is not only below its December 2014 initial public offering price of 16, but is also below the 9.50-a-share price Goldman Sachs set Tuesday for an 8.425 million-share secondary offering. Hortonworks' Jan. 19 dive came after it filed with the SEC to raise $100 million in the secondary offering, coming after the worst opening two weeks of any year in the market's history. On Tuesday, Hortonworks said in its new SEC filing that it had raised only $77.19 million, before expenses.Evercore ISI analyst Bill Whyman told IBD on Friday, however, that he stands by his research issued Jan. 26, in which he acknowledged tech companies face continuing “weak” demand, but not so weak that stocks should be “falling off a cliff” like they have so far this year.“The harder question is: Are stocks anticipating that demand will fall off a cliff six months from now?"" Whyman said. ""The evidence to date does not make this our base case.”He expects 6% global tech revenue growth for 2016 vs. 2% in 2015, and offered a mixed bag when looking at sectors. He advises overweighting portfolios with software and Internet stocks, underweighting communications equipment and computing, and market-weighting (neither buying nor selling) semiconductor stocks.“We forecast ‘not-pretty-but-we’ll-take-it' overall,"" he said.Late Friday, however, his Evercore ISI colleague Kirk Materne, sang a tougher mine-canary tune, “as software officially enters the pain cave.""“If you wanted a cathartic event to wipe out any remaining optimism in the software space, (Tableau’s) earnings report was it,” Materne wrote in a research note. “Ironically, the idea that a license-based, visualization tool vendor (Tableau) that is facing growing pains would cause a 10% pullback in Adobe (ADBE) or 14% pullback in CRM (Salesforce.com (CRM)) would seem like a stretch, but welcome to the new reality.“While most of the major ‘blow-ups’ year-to-date in software have been more company specific (at least in my view) vs. a dramatic change in the fundamental backdrop, the reality is no one cares, and the broader de-risking in the sector is unlikely to end until we see a strong quarter from one of the higher-quality growth names like CRM or Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (and the stock actually goes up) and/or until some of the smaller names throw in the towel and M&A picks up.”Palo Alto Networks stock fell 12% Friday, part of the general downturn.Database leader Oracle (ORCL), which is still trying to accelerate its cloud business, fell 1.9% Friday, in line with Friday’s broader market decline. IBD's entire Computer Software-Database industry group fell 15%.Other big names in the enterprise software market tumbling Friday included SAP (SAP) (down 3.6%), Salesforce.com (13%), Workday (WDAY) (16%) and Manhattan Associates (MANH) (9%). IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group fell 8% Friday to a 2-1/2-year low.Qlik, CyberArk Software (CYBR), FireEye (FEYE) and Hortonworks are all scheduled to report earnings in the coming week, with the pressure on.

487,ADBE,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

488,ADBE,"When you book air travel, you usually plan a round trip. When your stock has apparently made similar plans, what should you do? The question requires a multilayered answer, especially when the market goes topsy-turvy.First, avoid round trips (when a stock erases all gains from a buy point) as much as possible.When you've bought a stock correctly at the breakout, and the stock has stretched 20% to 25%, sell at least some shares. You've booked a great gain and you're selling on the way up.TAL Education (XRS), the Chinese cram school operator, sprinted past a 38.75 cup-with-handle entry in mid-November. In less than six weeks, TAL hit a high of 48.84.""A handsome 26% gain,"" you might think. Indeed. But given the market's choppy ways, it was a good time to sell.MaxLinear (MXL) reaffirms this rule.After a second-try breakout past 13.06 on Oct. 15, the specialty integrated circuits designer shot 36% higher in nearly seven weeks. Any sell once the gain surpassed 20% was a good decision. As the market began to roll over in December, so did MaxLinear. Now it's struggling to rebound back above its 50-day moving average. The breakout gain has been steamed down to about 15%.Second, what if the stock didn't reach the silver-lined zone of a 20%-25% profit?You could still sell on the way up if the gain is 10% to 19%. That's a respectable profit, especially when the market is not being so generous as it was in, say, 2003, 2009 or 2013.Third, never let a double-digit gain slip away.If a 16% gain turns into 6%, and the market goes into a correction, the wise decision in most cases is to take the gains and move on. Letting a stock's double-digit gain vanish means wasted effort. It could dent your trading psychology.Adobe Systems (ADBE) cleared an 86.41 entry and rallied 11.6%.

490,ADBE,"The end of last year brought a host of predictions about how Apple (AAPL) might spend its more than $200 billion in cash and investments. Currently the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is using its cash on hand for stock buybacks and dividends.But some on Wall Street are itching for Apple to pull off a big acquisition with its pile of dough. The latest speculation has Apple among those interested in buying TV and movie giant Time Warner (), which has a current market cap of about $57 billion.The biggest deal Apple has ever made was purchasing Beats Music and Beats Electronics for $3 billion in August 2014.A New York Post article on Tuesday suggested that Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes is open to the possibility of a sale of the company. Since then, Apple, AT&T (T) and 21st Century Fox ()have been rumored as potential buyers of the entertainment conglomerate.The Post report said Apple would be interested in Time Warner's assets to support the launch of a stand-alone streaming TV service. Time Warner owns CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT and other cable channels.Fortune writer Philip Elmer-DeWitt outlined the reasons for a deal in a column titled ""Why Apple Should Buy Time Warner.""Apple has been trying for years to assemble a ""skinny bundle"" of popular cable channels for an Internet TV service but without success. Buying Time Warner would give that to Apple in an instant, he said.But just because Apple has the cash doesn't mean they will spend it on a big acquisition. Apple has been loath to make large acquisitions for fear of harming its corporate culture. Apple likes to make small tuck-in acquisitions of companies with interesting technologies or talented engineers. It also has a reputation for wanting to build new products and services in house rather than acquire what someone else has developed.In a Dec. 10 [PAGE[research]] report, FBR analyst Daniel Ives put together a ""Christmas M&A list"" of deals that Apple might consider in 2016. He listed Adobe Systems (ADBE), Box (BOX), GoPro (GPRO) and Tesla Motors (TSLA).""Although we clearly can see Cupertino focusing on a number of skunkworks initiatives (e.g., Project Titan, virtual reality Faceshift, etc.) in 2016 and not pursuing major M&A prospects, with $200 billion of cash in the coffer (and growing), we can finally envision Apple making a larger acquisition, as the conditions are ripe for (CEO Tim) Cook to make a move,"" Ives said.Research firm CCS Insight predicted Nov. 20 that Apple might buy either Box or Dropbox in 2016 to extend its iCloud package of services into the enterprise market.On Dec. 31, Investors.com published a list of ""The wildest tech M&A predictions for 2016."" Among those predictions, the writers and editors of entertainment magazine Variety predicted that Apple will buy a movie studio in 2016 to support its goals for a subscription Internet video service.Variety listed Viacom (VIAB), Sony (SNE) and Time Warner's HBO as possible targets.

511,ADBE,"Perhaps best known for its crystal-clear photography software, Adobe Systems' future looks mighty cloudy — and the company is perfectly fine with it.

513,ADBE,"The crystal ball for Apple in 2016 shows a second-generation Apple Watch, a 10th-generation iPhone, possibly new accessories like wireless earbuds, and just maybe a major acquisition.But don't expect the Cupertino, Calif.-based consumer electronics giant to enter any new product categories in 2016. Apple (AAPL) is very selective about the markets it chooses to enter and takes its sweet time debuting new products.So rumored products like an Apple television set, augmented reality glasses and an electric car are likely to stay on the drawing board in 2016. Even the company's hopes for a streaming video service have stalled.Instead, Apple will focus on improving its existing lineup of computers, tablets, smartphones and smartwatches in the year ahead.Will iPhone Sales Fall In 2016?The big concern for Apple is whether it can continue to increase smartphone sales with its new iPhone 6S series against difficult comparisons with last year's wildly successful iPhone 6 series. The consensus in recent weeks has shifted to iPhone unit sales dipping in 2016, which would be a first for the product, which debuted in 2007.Morgan Stanley predicts that iPhone unit sales will fall 5.7% in Apple's fiscal 2016, ending in September, and 2.9% for the calendar year.Wall Street's attention is turning to the fall 2016 launch of the iPhone 7, Apple's 10th-generation handset, and whether it can revive the company's growth story.Observers speculate that the iPhone 7 will be waterproof and have no physical home button, which will allow for a bigger display. It also is expected to be thinner and have more memory and a better camera.But will that be enough to inspire iPhone users to upgrade? Or has the iPhone reached a point where consumers think their current handsets are good enough and don't need to be replaced so often?That's a problem that has faced the personal computer industry, as well as Apple's iPad tablet business.Pushing UpgradesThe biggest move that Apple made in 2015 was introducing its iPhone Upgrade Program, which turns its iPhone hardware business into a subscription service, Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, told IBD. That program is expected to increase the frequency at which people upgrade their iPhones.""The danger for Apple is people saying, 'My 2-year-old iPhone is just fine,' which is what has happened with tablets and PCs,"" Gottheil said.Apple needs the iPhone 7 to be a compelling product in order to spur iPhone 6 users to upgrade to handset subscription plans, FBR analyst Daniel Ives told IBD.Also, with the smartphone market showing signs of maturity, look for Apple to start selling more of its own iPhone accessories to grab more of the iPhone ecosystem money for itself, Gottheil said.""I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with a couple of niche peripherals,"" he said. ""They just brought out a battery pack sleeve.""Research firm IHS predicts that Apple will come out with wireless earbuds for the iPhone in 2016. The earbuds will have enough battery capacity to operate for more than a week between charges, it said. The Bluetooth-enabled earbuds would be used for music streaming and hands-free calling.Jury Still Out On Apple WatchIn March, Apple is expected to unveil its second-generation Apple Watch. The first-generation model launched in late April, and consumer reception has been modest to date.The Apple Watch 2 is expected to operate more independently from the iPhone, have better battery life and sport a front-facing camera for FaceTime video chats.Surveys have shown that a good portion of potential buyers want to see the second-generation Apple Watch before deciding whether to get a smartwatch.Also expected in March is a new 4-inch iPhone to replace the iPhone 5S as the entry-level model. Apple says a portion of the market still prefers a smaller-screen handset instead of its 4.7- and 5.5-inch standard models.Like the Apple Watch, Apple's subscription streaming music service, Apple Music, is a category that has yet to be labeled a winner or loser. Analysts will be watching it closely in the new year to see whether trial subscribers will pony up $9.99 a month for the service.Apple also might add Siri voice command functionality to its Apple TV set-top box in 2016, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said at Business Insider's Ignition conference on Dec. 9.Apple TV currently has Siri in its remote control for finding TV shows, using spoken questions and commands. But by adding Siri to the set-top box, Apple could imitate Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo device. Echo operates as an always-on personal assistant and home control device that lets users ask questions or speak commands aloud in a room.Growth WorriesApple stock has been trending lower the past few months over growth concerns, particularly for the iPhone. Shares are down 19% since touching a record high above 134 in April.Jim Cramer, co-founder of TheStreet and host of CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" recently summed up investor worries about Apple in six words: ""Apple has no catalysts right now.""Apple's ""back is against the wall"" in terms of what it's going to do next to continue to be a growth story, FBR's Ives said.Ives said he'll be ""shocked"" if Apple doesn't make a big acquisition in 2016. It has to do something with its cash hoard other than stock buybacks and dividends, he said. As of Sept. 26, Apple had $205 billion in cash and securities.""That's why the stock is treading water,"" he said.Apple Acquisition SpeculationSome speculate that Apple could make a big acquisition in 2016 to make use of its growing cash stockpile. Historically, Apple has been reluctant to make large acquisitions, preferring smaller deals to acquire interesting technologies or engineering talent.Apple's largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Music and Beats Electronics in August 2014.Ives says Apple could buy online data storage firm BOX (BOX)or digital media software firm  Adobe Systems (ADBE) to buck up its enterprise offerings. Other possible acquisition targets include action camera makerGoPro (GPRO)and even electric car maker Telsa Motors (TSLA), though the latter is a ""long shot,"" Ives said.Research firm CCS Insight said Apple might buy either Box or Dropbox to extend its iCloud package of services into the enterprise market.""Offering a cloud storage service optimized for businesses is a logical extension of Apple's service portfolio,"" CCS Insight said in a report.

514,ADBE,"With its stock trading within shouting distance of its all-time high, Adobe Systems (ADBE) earned a price-target hike on Tuesday from investment bank FBR Capital Markets.Adobe stock was up a fraction to above 93 in midday trading on the stock market today. The provider of cloud-based media and marketing software hit a record high of 98 on March 18. It sports a good IBD Relative Strength Rating of 85, putting it among the top 15% of all stocks in performance the past 12 months.FBR analyst Samad Samana raised his price target on Adobe stock to 115 from 110 and reiterated his market perform rating.He predicts Adobe will see 20%-plus revenue growth and 30%-plus EPS growth for the next two years. Adobe has shifted its business from perpetual license software to software-as-a-service delivered over the Internet.“We believe the transition to a subscription model has yielded a more attractive business model,” Samana said. “We expect this to be reflected in fiscal 2016 and beyond.”Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The biggest is Creative Cloud, which includes software for creative professionals such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Marketing Cloud provides online marketing and advertising services. Document Cloud leverages Adobe’s popular online document-sharing product Acrobat and its ubiquitous PDF format.The company’s Creative Cloud business earns most of the attention, but its Marketing Cloud is maturing at the right time, Samana said.“Digital marketing is at or near the top of the priority list for enterprises, and Adobe appears well positioned to help companies transform their businesses to be more engaging with end customers,” he said in a research report.Adobe should be able to continue posting healthy growth in the digital marketing business despite competition from Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and others, he said.RELATED:Adobe Driving Third Wave Of Enterprise Software Disruption

516,ADBE,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) stock jumped to an all-time high on Friday, a day after the company beat first-quarter views and raised its sales and earnings guidance for the year.Adobe shares leaped as much as 8.9% to a new high of 98 in early morning trading on the stock market today. By the closing bell, Adobe had trimmed the advance to 3.9%, ending at 93.42. Adobe made IBD's Stocks On The Move screen Friday, rising in high volume -- 212% above average trading volume. Adobe gets a high IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99.The digital media and marketing software firm late Thursday reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share of 66 cents, excluding items, on sales of $1.38 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Adobe to report profit of 61 cents, ex items, on sales of $1.34 billion. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP EPS was up 50%, and revenue was up 25%.For its fiscal second quarter, Adobe is targeting EPS minus items of 67 cents on sales of $1.39 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. Analysts were modeling 65 cents EPS minus items on sales of $1.39 billion.For the full year, Adobe now forecasts earnings of about $2.80 a share on a non-GAAP basis and sales of $5.8 billion.Investors are enthused about Adobe’s transition from desktop software to Internet cloud computing services.Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The biggest is Creative Cloud, which includes software for creative professionals such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Marketing Cloud provides online marketing and advertising services. Document Cloud leverages Adobe’s popular online document-sharing product Acrobat and its ubiquitous PDF format.UBS analyst Brent Thill reiterated his buy rating on Adobe stock but upped his price target to 114 from 105.Adobe is “reaping the fruit of a well-orchestrated playbook,” Thill said in a report. The company “is exiting the business model transition phase and entering the normalization phase.”Baird analyst Steven Ashley maintained his outperform rating on Adobe stock but raised his price target to 105 from 100.“Adobe continues to successfully broaden its market,” Ashley said in a report. “Over 30% of Creative Cloud customers are new to Adobe.”Adobe reported much-stronger-than-expected Creative Cloud subscriber growth of 798,000 new customers vs. the consensus forecast of 608,000 in fiscal Q1, which ended March 4.Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser maintained his buy rating on Adobe stock but bumped up his price target to 109 from 105.Adobe’s Q1 results “demonstrated ongoing growth from existing customers and market expansion from new ones,” Wieser said in a report.RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan kept his outperform rating on Adobe stock, but he raised his price target to 104 from 101.“Valuation (is) the only question here, but with estimates moving up and higher recurring visibility, we remain (at) outperform,” he said in a report.Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated his perform rating on Adobe stock.“We view Adobe as a well-established franchise,” Schwartz said in a report. “Our perform rating on ADBE is based solely on valuation, as we think it fairly prices in sustained strong growth and earnings power for the business” over the next 12 months.Credit Suisse analyst Philip Winslow maintained his neutral rating on Adobe but increased his price target to 85 from 70.“Although Creative Cloud has effectively increased annual revenue per user versus the prior perpetual licensing model, we believe much of this enthusiasm is captured in Adobe’s current valuation,” Winslow said in a report. “Therefore, we will monitor Adobe’s ability to (1) attract new users, (2) increase Creative Cloud pricing, (3) expand operating margins ahead of expectations, and (4) continue to expand into the digital marketing market before turning positive on Adobe’s stock.”Annualized recurring revenue in Adobe’s core Digital Media segment grew to $3.13 billion last quarter, an increase of $246 million.Adobe now expects to exit fiscal 2016 with Digital Media annualized recurring revenue of about $4 billion. That’s up from its prior target of $3.875 billion.

517,ADBE,"Fast growth hasn’t vanished.Despite this uptrend’s defensive tilt, a handful of stocks in the Big Cap 20 show strong fundamentals.Cloud player and software provider Adobe Systems (ADBE) is on a roll. In the past five quarters, earnings jumped 47%, 30%, 93%, 59% and 50%. Revenue grew 11%, 9%, 21%, 22% and 25% in the same quarters.How many big-cap stocks can claim that kind of earnings and revenue growth? Not many. Toss in a factor to weed out thin stocks, and only one other big cap pops up: Salesforce.com (CRM), which last appeared in the Big Cap 20 on Dec. 29.The Street expects Adobe to stay in the fast lane in fiscal 2016, which ends in November. Earnings are expected to grow 37% this year and 33% in fiscal 2017.Pretax margin was 27.8% last year, but return on equity was only 15%. Research shows that history’s greatest stocks carried an ROE of at least 17%.Adobe sketched a cup-with-handle base and broke out March 17. Volume was 73% above average. The buy point was 88.65. The stock is about 7% extended from the entry.However, the left-side high could provide another buy point -- this one at 96.52, unless a handle forms.The weekly base shows plenty of accumulation. Funds adding to their position in Q4 include Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), which increased its stake by almost 19% in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, business software provider Intuit (INTU) is in the midst of a turnaround and shakeup.Earnings in fiscal Q1, which ended in October, rose to nine cents a share vs. a loss of 11 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Then in fiscal Q2, which ended in January, Intuit booked a profit of 25 cents a share vs. a year-earlier loss of six cents a share.Revenue stepped up from 7% to 17% to 23% in recent quarters.The Street expects earnings to advance 34% in fiscal 2016, which ends in July. Revenue is seen rising 9%.The company’s products include TurboTax. In recent weeks, Intuit reached agreements to sell its online application software QuickBase, personal finance software Quicken and marketing software Demandforce.Intuit bought back $455 million’s worth of shares in fiscal Q2.Shares dived sharply in August when the plan to divest non-core segments was first announced. Since then, the stock has rebounded and built a base within the larger consolidation. Intuit is climbing the right side and is 3% off the 108 high of the pattern.Tyson Foods (TSN) might sound defensive, but the meat provider grew earnings 49% in fiscal Q1, which ended in December. For fiscal 2016, earnings are expected to advance 25%. The stock is in a profit-taking zone from a February breakout.In most cases, a stock should be sold after it reaches a 20% to 25% profit. Most stocks will begin to consolidate after such a gain.Image provided by Shutterstock.

535,ADBE,"Growth-oriented stock mutual funds lagged value funds for much of the past decade -- even if just slightly -- until taking the decade's lead in 2015 with four straight quarters of outperformance.Understanding how growth mutual funds reclaimed the lead can help you with future buy and sell decisions in the diversified portion of your portfolio, which includes mutual funds and ETFs.And that can inject higher octane fuel into your retirement accounts.Overall, growth funds averaged a yearly gain of 6.38% over the past 10 years. Value funds averaged a 5.71% annual advance in the same period, which ended going into Monday.Value funds started the decade strong and got a tailwind from the financial crisis market meltdown from late 2007 through early 2009. A large number of investors sought safety in defensive stocks and sectors, many of which are value-oriented.Financials, a heavily value-oriented sector, rallied in 2012 and 2013.Value and growth funds split 2014, but 2015 was dominated by growth stocks and funds.Value funds' outperformance in the first quarter of 2016 was not enough to cost growth funds' the decade's lead.If you had invested $10,000 in the average growth fund on March 31, 2006, by 10 years later it would have grown into $18,833. That is less than $1,000 more than it would have ballooned into in the average value fund.Over that decade, $1.8 billion Alger Spectra Fund (SPECX) was one of the top-performing growth portfolios among those with $100 million or more in assets.The fund notched an 11.05% average annual gain.

Another 5% was in foreign stocks.Seventy-seven percent of assets were in mega- and large-cap stocks, with 19% in midcaps. The remainder was in small caps.Technology was the fund's biggest sector, with a 31% weighting.

536,ADBE,"Digital media software giant Adobe Systems (ADBE) is well-positioned to drive the third wave of disruption in enterprise software, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kirk Adams said in a report Monday.The first software wave was enterprise resource planning (ERP), which transformed back-office operations. Then came customer relationship management (CRM), which changed front-office operations. Adobe is calling the third wave ""experience business,"" which aims to reinvent how companies create, deliver and market products and services.“Adobe believes that this third wave could be bigger than both ERP and CRM,” Adams said. He reiterated his buy rating on Adobe stock and price target of 112.Adobe was down a fraction to above 92 in midday trading on the stock market today. Its stock hit an all-time high of 98 on March 18, a day after it reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and raised its guidance.Adobe outlined how it is pursuing experience business last week at its Adobe Summit 2016 conference in Las Vegas. This year's conference drew 10,000 attendees, up from about 7,000 at last year's show.“Adobe is focused on helping enterprises deliver consistent, high-quality experiences for their customers,” Adams said. “There are many point products and solutions from other companies, but only Adobe provides end-to-end solutions from content creation to marketing execution to measurement.”Adobe is the leader in digital content creation with its Creative Cloud offerings. Now it is moving aggressively into the marketing world with its Marketing Cloud, Adams said. Marketing Cloud includes tools for tracking the popularity of online content and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.At its Summit conference, Adobe announced an audience measurement partnership with ComScore (SCOR) as well as new services and enhancements to its cloud platforms.“The Summit reinforced our view that Adobe continues to distance itself from competing digital marketing platforms,” Baird analyst Steven Ashley said in a report Wednesday. He rates Adobe stock as outperform with a price target of 105.Image provided by Shutterstock.

537,ADBE,"Technology companies such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google and Facebook (FB) were among 20 of the top 25 highest-paying U.S. companies in 2016, employment-related website Glassdoor said Wednesday.Competition for talent is especially fierce in the tech sector, adding pressure to pay. In recent years, tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Google have settled claims that they conspired to avoid poaching each others' workers.Apple reportedly hired Tesla’s (TSLA) former vice president of vehicle engineering, according to a report in Electrek Tuesday. Last week, Facebook said it hired Regina Dugan, who worked on ""moonshot"" projects for Google. And GoPro (GPRO) hired Danny Coster, a 20-year Apple design veteran, to be the action-camera maker's vice president of design.Despite the arms race in tech hiring, privately held consulting firm A.T. Kearney topped Glassdoor's list, with median total compensation at $167,534 and median base salary of $143,620. PwC subsidiary Strategy&, also a private consulting firm, came in second, with median compensation at $160,000 and media base salary at $147,000.From there on, tech dominated. Juniper Networks (JNPR) tops the list for techies with $157,000 in compensation and $135,000 in salary. Google came in fifth, with $153,750 in compensation and $123,331 in salary.Facebook (median base salary $127,406), Twitter (TWTR) ($133,000), LinkedIn (LNKD) ($120,000), Microsoft (MSFT) ($125,000), Adobe Systems (ADBE) ($125,000) and Salesforce.com (CRM) ($120,000) were other tech companies on the list.Among financial companies, Visa (V) made the lone appearance, though the credit card giant is listed under the information technology sector on the S&P 500. Visa's median compensation is $150,000, and its median salary is $130,000, according to Glassdoor.The admittedly unscientific report is based on company-specific salary reports that have been anonymously shared by company employees. Apple wasn't on the list.In addition to traditional forms of compensation, many tech companies have offered other perks to woo employees.Free gourmet food and ping pong tables are now passe. Newer perks include on-site doctors, free plane tickets anywhere, free Uber rides to and from work, carts that bring beer to employees' desks, and free overnight shipping of breast milk back home while new moms are on business trips.Facebook and Apple also offer to pay for egg-freezing procedures for females employees who want to delay motherhood.

In the coming week, Tesla Motors (TSLA) unveils the Model 3, Facebook (FB) ships its virtual reality headset, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen makes a big speech and the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report. Meanwhile, several top-rated stocks start the week in or near buying range.Vantiv (VNTV), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO) are among highly rated stocks that are close to entry points or in a buy area right now.Check out IBD's Leaderboard for chart analysis of leading stocks near entry points.The social networking giant will begin Oculus Rift headset shipments on Monday, turning virtual reality into a reality. Facebook has been taking orders for the $599 headset since January. Samsung has already launched Gear VR, while Sony will ship its Playstation VR system later this year. While video games and entertainment will lead VR, Facebook and others see a wide range of uses.Facebook stock has been consolidating since hitting a record high on Feb. 2. Shares rose 51 cents to 113.05 on Friday, with a buy point at 117.69.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to address the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday. Investors will be listening closely for any hints of when the central bank might raise interest rates again. Earlier this month the Fed signaled that it would raise rates just twice this year, and its dovish tone spurred markets to get ready for a move in September. That weakened the dollar, which boosted oil and commodities, which in turn lifted stocks.But several Fed officials last week argued that policymakers could act sooner, perhaps as early as the next meeting in April -- reversing the dollar-oil-stock direction.So Yellen could offer some clarity about the Fed, and set the tone for financial markets for the coming days and weeks.Drive-in fast food chain Sonic (SONC) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q2 earnings on Tuesday. Sonic is expected to have earned 16 cents a share during the three months ended Feb. 29, up 23% from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue likely inched up 1.2% to $127.7 million.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) reports its fiscal Q4 and 2015 earnings on Wednesday. The Vancouver, Canada-based athletic apparel chain is expected to earn 80 cents a share for the quarter, up 2.6% from fiscal Q4 2014. Quarterly revenue is expected to grow 15% to $691.9 million. For the full year, Lululemon is expected to earn $1.82 a share, matching 2014's total. Full-year revenue is seen growing 14% to $2.05 billion.On Thursday the luxury electric automaker will unveil its mass-market all-electric Model 3 at its plant in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne. The Model 3 debut will be streamed on the company's website and Tesla will take orders after the unveiling.But that will leave some big questions. Can Tesla meet its late 2017 deadline for starting Model 3 shipments, followed by true mass production?A change to a more affordable model is a big one for Tesla Motors, whose Model S sedan is priced at $70,000 and its Model X SUV has a retail price of $80,000. A price has not yet been released for the Model 3, but it's expected to retail at $35,000, with various tax subsidies potentially lowering that to $25,000.After slumping 41% to start the year, Tesla shares have come roaring back, gaining 62% since hitting an intraday low of 141.05 on Feb. 9.President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on Thursday while world leaders gather in Washington, D.C., for a nuclear nonproliferation summit. In a statement, the White House said the ""bilateral meeting will present an opportunity to advance U.S.-China cooperation on a range of issues of mutual interest,"" while enabling the two political leaders ""to address areas of disagreement constructively.""The areas of disagreement could include China's currency, North Korea's nuclear ambitions, China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and Chinese cybertheft.China's economic slowdown has caused concern in markets worldwide as it transitions from a manufacturing-dominant economy to a services-based one.Last but not least, the Labor Department releases its March employment report on Friday. In February, 242,000 nonfarm payrolls were added and the jobless rate held at 4.9%. But average weekly earnings tumbled 0.5%, the sharpest drop since 2009. A strong March report could further quiet the recession chatter, but also revive talk of a near-term Federal Reserve rate hike. Also Friday: The ISM manufacturing index and U.S. auto sales for March.

540,ADBE,"A bird in the hand may be worth two in the bush, but turning to a subscription model means that you think a lot more than two birds are in the bush.Adobe Systems (ADBE) has been transitioning to a subscriber-based revenue model to increase overall revenue and stay relevant in a multiplatform world. In contrast to perpetual license software, where upgrades would often be postponed for price-sensitive customers, the subscription model relies on smaller monthly fees that give customers the latest in Adobe technology.Adobe's Digital Media segment focuses on the opportunity presented as more businesses require an online engagement of customers. The increase in mobile computing in particular is an area of growth requiring ever-increasing amounts of content. Through their Creative Cloud service, Adobe offers subscription-based access to their suite of creative products at different price points. The segment accounted for 65% of revenue in fiscal 2015 and saw annual revenue growth of 19%.The company is also focusing heavily on its Digital Marketing segment, which accounted for 31% of revenue in fiscal 2015 and saw annual revenue growth of 11%. In this side of the business, Adobe focuses on tools that allow customization of marketing messages and the accompanying analytic tools to allow marketers to make better decisions.Adobe's annual earnings showed a turnaround in fiscal 2015 for the company, with 56% growth in earnings per share. From 2012 through 2014, earnings were either flat or declining. Earnings-per-share growth estimates for the next two years exceed 30%.The stock is currently forming a first-stage base, having undercut the 71.33 low of its previous base. The depth of the new base was mild at just 26% but is currently exhibiting a ""V"" shape. ""V"" shapes can still work, but historically they have had shorter runs and a higher failure rate than the more gradual decline and recovery of a ""U"" shape. The potential buy point is currently at 96.52.

541,ADBE,"Digital media software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) late Thursday beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal 2016 first-quarter earnings and sales, as revenue growth accelerated for the third straight quarter.Adobe stock jumped as much 8.6% in after-hours trading Thursday, putting it in record high territory.

It expects to report non-GAAP earnings per share of 64 to 70 cents. At the midpoint of guidance, Adobe is targeting EPS minus items of 67 cents on sales of $1.39 billion.For fiscal Q2, analysts were modeling earnings of 65 cents a share minus items, up 35%, on sales of $1.39 billion, up 20%.The San Jose, Calif.-based company also guided sales and earnings higher for the full year.Adobe expects to earn about $2.80 a share on a non-GAAP basis, up from its prior target of $2.70. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were modeling for $2.76 EPS excluding items for the full fiscal year.Adobe is forecasting full-year revenue of $5.8 billion, up from its prior target of $5.7 billion.“Every day, more brands, government agencies and educational institutions globally are choosing to base their digital strategies on Adobe’s content and data platforms,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in a statement. “Our exceptional performance in Q1 is an indicator of the strong momentum we are seeing across our cloud businesses as we drive the experience economy.”Like Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe has earned the favor of investors through its transition from desktop software to Internet cloud computing services.Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The biggest is Creative Cloud, which includes well-known products for creative professionals such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Marketing Cloud provides online marketing and advertising services. Document Cloud leverages Adobe’s popular online document-sharing product Acrobat and its ubiquitous PDF format.“Adobe’s year is off to a strong start,” Narayen said on a conference call with analysts. “Adobe’s opportunity has never been greater … Our market leadership, product differentiation and continued momentum give us confidence to raise our FY16 revenue and earnings targets.”Adobe is through the rough part of its transition from a seller of licensed software to a provider of software-as-a-service.Over the last four quarters, year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated. Sales rose 9% in Q2 2015, 21% in Q3, 22% in Q4 and 25% last quarter.Earnings per share have grown in the double digits for six straight quarters, with average growth of 50%.Annualized recurring revenue in Adobe’s core Digital Media segment grew to $3.13 billion last quarter, an increase of $246 million.Adobe now expects to exit fiscal 2016 with Digital Media annualized recurring revenue of about $4 billion. That’s up from its prior target of $3.875 billion.Digital Media segment sales rose 33% year over year to $932 million in Q1. Digital Marketing segment sales rose 14% to $406 million.“Strong Cloud adoption drove record Creative and Marketing Cloud revenue in Q1, and better-than-expected Digital Media (annualized recurring revenue),” Adobe Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said in a statement. “Based on our strong Q1 results and business momentum, we are increasing our annual revenue and earnings targets for the year.”Under generally accepted accounting principles, Adobe’s earnings per share were 50 cents in fiscal Q1. Analysts were expecting 39 cents GAAP EPS. GAAP earnings include the impact of stock-based compensation.For its current fiscal Q2, Adobe is targeting GAAP EPS of 42 to 48 cents, or 45 cents at the midpoint. Wall Street had been modeling for 43 cents.

555,ADBE," No. 1 online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) drew more than a third of Americans' Black Friday and Cyber Monday e-commerce spending by one estimate, while a Wednesday tally called Cyber Monday the heaviest U.S. online spending day in history.Amazon, however, actually appears to have lost a little Cyber Monday market share.Official numbers aren't in from Amazon yet on holiday sales, but by analytics firm Slice Intelligence's tally, Amazon accounted for 35.7% of e-commerce spending on Black Friday, Nov. 27, followed by Best Buy (BBY) with 8.2%, Macy's (M) with 3.4%, and Wal-Mart (WMT) at 3.3%.Amazon's Black Friday share was way up from 31.5% last year in the tally, and Slice estimated that Amazon Black Friday sales rose 23.2% from a year ago.Slice spokeswoman Jaimee Minney told IBD that Cyber Monday ""was bigger than Black Friday and bigger than Cyber Monday last year.""The Black Friday estimate comes primarily from an analysis of about 876,000 email receipts provided by Slice's panel of 3 million shoppers.Amazon garnered a 36.1% share of U.S. e-commerce sales on Cyber Monday by Slice's estimate, down 2.7 percentage points from a year earlier.Also by its estimate, ""the retailer's sales were down 1.3% vs. the same day last year,"" Minney said in an email.Wal-Mart was the only store in the top five to gain share on Cyber Monday by that tally — up half a percentage point, to 3.8%.Cyber Monday SoarsWednesday, online tracker comScore said Cyber Monday reached $3.12 billion in online spending, up 21% from last year's Cyber Monday.ComScore's mobile figures aren't final, but it said desktop online spending set a record, at $2.28 billion.ComScore said that for the first 30 days of the holiday season, $27.9 billion has been spent online by desktops, up 6% from a year ago.""The weekend after Thanksgiving also reached a major milestone as it saw its first ever billion-dollar online shopping day on Sunday,"" it said in a report Wednesday, ""while Saturday sales reached the $1 billion mark for a second year in a row.""Overall, Cyber Monday online sales set a record with $3.07 billion in spending across the U.S., up 16% from last year, according to Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Index, as Amazon leveraged its e-commerce dominance. But Thanksgiving weekend sales looked weak at brick-and-mortar retailers.Apple (AAPL) iPad and iPhone doorbusters were hits for Target (TGT) and others, while Wal-Mart announced booming mobile sales.Retail analytics provider ShopperTrak, however, estimates that U.S. physical stores took in 10.4% less than a year earlier over Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the weekend — an estimated $20.4 billion that does not include Cyber Monday.Amazon's Black Friday showing wouldn't be out of line with the IBD Leaderboard company's heft in online shopping — the company ""makes up about 69% of total U.S. retail traffic,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said in a research report this week. Minney said Amazon's Black Friday crowd ""doesn't surprise us.""Amazon said that it had a record Thanksgiving weekend for selling Amazon devices, triple last year's result.

556,ADBE,"Criteo (CRTO) reports Q3 earnings on Wednesday and how the ad tech firm fares will shed a light on whether Apple's (AAPL) new ad blocking has taken a toll on the company, and whether a rumored but not confirmed alliance with China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) ever materialized.Paris-based Criteo embeds browser cookies — tiny text files that let websites recognize users and their preferences when they return to a site — on behalf of nearly half of the 100 largest retail and travel websites in the U.S.Criteo gets paid for serving ads only if a user clicks on them, and collects a bigger cut if the user goes on to buy a product from that advertiser.Others on Wall Street have predicted that the release of new iOS 9 ad-blocking features could nick Criteo, although they're unsure by how much.""Criteo's business is founded on selling ads on the Web, and a lower supply of ads could limit the liquidity of the Criteo marketplace and (its) ability to grow and support clients,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Thomas Champion wrote in an industry report in August.However, Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz wrote in an industry note on Oct. 2 that he doubted ""the enabling of ad blockers for Apple iOS 9 will meaningfully impact"" Criteo, which ""has stated that a majority of their mobile revenue is driven through Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Android products rather than Apple.""In the worst case, Pitz wrote, ad-blockers could impact Criteo's revenue to the tune of about 1.9% of revenue.In Q2, Paris-based Criteo likely added Alibaba's non-China sites as a client, said Pacific Crest Securities in a research note on Sept. 29, though neither company has confirmed such a deal. Pacific Crest Securities, however, said it found Criteo cookies in the U.S., France and Germany with Alibaba.com and AliExpress.""We believe Criteo has increased its adjusted share to 53% of the top 100 retail and travel sites, up from 51% in Q2,"" said Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson in a Sept. 29 research note.""We think this adds even more credence to our call that Alibaba is most likely a client and isn't just testing the product. This could be a huge win, not only because of the non-China Alibaba revenue, but because it increases the likelihood that Criteo could win some of Alibaba's China business.""Adding that business would help the French firm compete with ad networks run by some of the largest Internet companies, including Google, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Google's Chrome browser is the top facilitator of ad-blocking software, according to a study released in August by PageFair and Adobe Systems (ADBE). Google also runs the largest online ad network, so it's a delicate situation for Internet companies that have prospered from ad sales.Criteo gets a strong IBD EPS Rating of 97 out of a possible 99, but only gets a fair IBD Composite Rating of 70, which takes earnings, sales growth, stock-price changes and other financial factors into account.Criteo stock cratered on Aug. 4 after the provider of digital ad services reported Q2 earnings that fell short of consensus views, following reports that Apple would allow browser ad blocking on iPhones for the first time.For Q3, Criteo is guiding revenue ex traffic acquisition costs of between 116 million euros ($128 million) and 118 million euros ($130 million), up 49% to 52%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have modeled 117.92 million euros. The company is guiding adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 21 million euros to 23 million euros, up 6% to 16%, year over year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting Q3 EPS ex items of 0.18 euros (20 cents), down 33% from a year earlier.Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook .

580,ADBE,"Digital media software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) is expected to keep the good times rolling when it reports fiscal first-quarter earnings after the market close Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters predict that Adobe will post earnings per share of 61 cents excluding items on sales of $1.34 billion. It would translate to year-over-year growth of 39% in EPS and 21% in sales.For fiscal Q2, analysts are modeling earnings of 65 cents a share minus items, up 35%, on sales of $1.39 billion, up 20%.Like Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe has earned the favor of investors through its transition from desktop software to Internet cloud computing services.Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The biggest is Creative Cloud, which includes well-known products for creative professionals such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Marketing Cloud provides online marketing and advertising services. Document Cloud leverages Adobe’s popular online document-sharing product Acrobat and its ubiquitous PDF format.Adobe stock was down a fraction, near 86.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Adobe hit an all-time high of 96.42 on Dec. 17, just days after it reported better-than-expected fiscal Q4 earnings.UBS analyst Brent Thill on Monday reiterated his buy rating on Adobe stock with a 12-month price target of 105. In a research report, Thill said that he expects Adobe’s Q1 report to be a “solid kickoff to the year.”Investors will be focused on Creative Cloud subscribers, Digital Media annual recurring revenue and operating expenditures, Thill said.“We expect few surprises, as we think the creative/marketing spend environment was generally stable and we did not detect any significant promotions,” he said. “Macro remains a potential risk for the year, but for ADBE to get hit, we would have to see a prolonged recession, including sharp cuts to advertising & marketing budgets leading to layoffs in related staff, which we do not see as a high probability at this time.""Adobe will be better shielded from recessions than some other companies, since most of its revenue now is on a subscription basis, he said. Adobe exited fiscal Q4 with 74% recurring revenue.“ADBE remains a top large-cap growth story, with double-digit revenue growth, expanding 30%+ margins and clear leadership in its core markets,” Thill said.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kirk Adams on Friday maintained his buy rating on Adobe stock, with a price target of 112.“We believe that their core businesses of Creative and Marketing Cloud will show strong growth in both revenues and earnings,” Adams said. “More importantly, we believe their outlook will remain strong.”

582,ADBE,"Hit anti-superhero flick ""Deadpool"" got made with what's been called an all-Adobe workflow. No wonder Adobe Systems (ADBE) CEO Shantanu Narayen sounds a fan.In a keynote address kicking off the Adobe Summit 2016 digital marketing conference Tuesday, he used the cheeky comic book movie to illustrate how the content world's gone digital.Adobe, of course, makes the Creative Cloud digital tools, such as Photoshop and Premiere Pro video editing software, and the Adobe Marketing Cloud tools used to track online content popularity and to power advertising decisions. The company gets a near-top IBD Composite Rating of 97, and the stock hit a new high in high volume Friday, after Adobe beat analyst views in its first-quarter earnings report and lifted its annual sales and earnings guidance. After February's market dip, Adobe stock is back where it was in early January.""Last year one of the biggest media companies in the world decided to make an unknown superhero as big as Captain America without the usual big media and TV spots,"" Narayen said in a livecast keynote from the event in Las Vegas that he said drew more than 10,000 attendees. ""Deadpool, a brash antihero most people had never heard of, wove his way into their lives through using one of the most innovative digital and social media campaigns ever.""""Deadpool,"" by film folks at Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX), ""shattered all box office records and is on the way to becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie in film history,"" Narayen said. He went on to talk about how MasterCard (MA), too, had moved to ""pivot"" a bit from traditional ad strategy toward online and social forms, exemplified by its #Priceless Surprises campaign that included things like winning a trip to the Grammy Awards.""Businesses must re-imagine how they interact with customers in a digital-first and digital-enabled world,"" Narayen said, adding that ""getting content to the right person at the right place at the right time takes data"" -- that is, the ability to analyze and target.Adobe made several announcements in conjunction with its annual Summit show, including these three Adobe Marketing Cloud enhancements, among others:After viewing started migrating away from the television itself toward online viewing via devices such as mobile phone screens and tablets, some online video viewing is now ""going back to the living room,"" Jeremy Helfand, Adobe's vice president of video solutions, told IBD. ""Over 20% of 'TV Everywhere' viewing is happening on (television-) connected devices -- Apple (AAPL) TV, Roku or (Sony (SNE)) PlayStation or (Microsoft (MSFT)) Xbox, which is quite remarkable.""Historically, ""there was one currency -- it was Nielsen -- that's what was used in order to purchase advertising,"" Helfand said, ""largely through upfronts and some residuals -- that's how advertising was bought and sold.""But tracking how many people are watching what these days, across a bunch of devices and websites, hasn't been easy and that has hampered online video monetization efforts. Adobe Certified Metrics, which involves a developing partnership with ComScore following last year's link-up with Nielsen, is one way that Adobe aims to make audience measurement easier and more standardized.""You've seen ComScore merge with Rentrak trying to bring digital and linear together just as Nielsen is,"" Helfand said. ""And you're also seeing some media companies build their own definitions of who their audiences are, and go out to (ad) buyers and say 'here's my audience'.""The partnerships and platform development further Narayen's goal of Adobe products and services being able to ""make, monetize and measure"" the digital experiences that people have in today's world of content. The hope is that in turn will make Adobe software more crucial across a breadth of industries.In its Q1 report last week, digital marketing segment revenue at Adobe reached $406.2 million, which Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle said, in a research note, was ""better than the expectation of $402.7 million."" He added that the Summit event this week was ""likely  to  provide  additional  positive  announcements  on  the marketing business.""Adobe added 798,000 new subscribers for its Creative Cloud businesses last quarter, and Barnicle noted that 30% of them were new to Adobe. He sees more CEOs driving adoption of Adobe products.""Like Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), Adobe is seeing more CEOs make purchasing decisions,"" he wrote. ""In the 2016 Pacific Crest CFO Survey, both CIOs and CMOs saw a decline in the portion of the IT budget that they control. We believe that CEOs are making more IT decisions than ever before. They are looking to move their businesses to digital and to the cloud, and Adobe is one of several beneficiaries.""The Adobe Summit runs through Thursday, with actor George Clooney among speakers listed for the event -- albeit most come more from the tech side than from Tinseltown.San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe has offices around the globe, including in Diegem, Belgium. It's just outside Brussels, where terrorist attacks hit the airport and a subway station early Tuesday. Narayen started his talk with condolences, and despite its Summit event @Adobe said it was keeping its Twitter account silent for the day, in light of the Brussels situation.

607,ADBE,"Accounting benefits for phone companies have made some telecom investors scratch their heads, and upcoming revenue-recognition changes for software companies could be the next conundrum.The good news for technology stock investors is that the accounting changes for software companies have been ""effectively delayed until 2018,"" says a Citigroup report. The bad news is that there's a long list of companies that would be impacted.They include: Adobe Systems (ADBE), security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Splunk (SPLK).Industry ""deliberations"" over the new software revenue accounting standards will heat up in Fall, 2015, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a report. ""Proposed changes are significant and make revenue treatment less conservative,"" he said.Accounting standards bodies FASB and IASB proposed the changes in international revenue accounting in 2014.Pritchard notes that the accounting changes come just as the industry is shifting toward cloud computing's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model and subscription-based revenue, rather than one-time licensing fees.""We see the non-SaaS subscription contracts such as those employed by Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK), CA, Guidewire Software (GWRE), Jive Software (JIVE), Microsoft and Splunk to be most at risk to change, with revenue timing accelerated.""The new accounting rules ""could provide more of an incentive for companies to change contract terms in order to accelerate revenue and achieve quarterly targets, something that current rules make more difficult. Beyond subscription revenue treatment, we also see other proposed changes that could drive more inconsistent allocation of revenue between product (license-appliances) and ratable sources (maintenance support) as well as separation of hosting arrangements from software in certain SaaS arrangements,"" Pritchard said.The accounting changes, Pritchard speculates, could ""make it difficult to compare reported revenue between native SaaS companies (like Salesforce) and flexible SaaS companies (like Oracle and SAP).""In a separate report, Morgan Stanley on Thursday said more than 50 ""pension heavy"" companies have recently changed their GAAP accounting, thereby redefining pension costs, and sometimes eliminating pension costs from adjusted earnings. They include Boeing (BA), FedEx (FDX), Honeywell (HON) and AT&T (T).Telecom companies have roiled earnings by introducing wireless financing plans for mobile phones. The EIP (equipment installment plans) pull forward earnings by booking equipment revenue on the date of sale. T-Mobile's (TMUS) aggressive Uncarrier promotions started the EIP trend, and AT&T followed.

693,ADBE,"The use of ad-blocking software is exploding and is projected to cost websites nearly $22 billion in lost advertising revenue worldwide this year, according to a new study.The biggest facilitator of ad-blocking software is Google 's (GOOGL) Chrome browser, according to a study released Monday by PageFair and Adobe Systems (ADBE).About 198 million Internet users worldwide in the second quarter used ad-blocking software, PageFair reported. That's up 40% from 141 million users in June 2014. Most of that ad-blocking software is installed on PC Web browsers.About 64% of ad-blocking software on PCs runs on Google Chrome. About 126 million people use ad-blocking extensions with Chrome. That compares with 48 million for Firefox and 9 million with Apple's (AAPL) Safari.Ad-blocking software isn't very common on mobile devices, but that might be about to change, PageFair said.

Apple's mobile Safari browser represents 52% of the mobile browsing market and 14% of total browsing, the firm said.Gaming, social networking and tech-related websites are most affected by ad-blocking software, the report added.The growth in ad-blocking software ""has the potential to challenge the viability of the Web as a platform for the distribution of free ad-supported content,"" PageFair said.The estimated loss of revenue due to blocked advertising during 2015 is expected to be $10.7 billion in the U.S. and $21.8 billion worldwide, PageFair said. That's expected to climb next year to $20.3 billion in the U.S. and $41.4 billion worldwide.""Usage of ad blocking extensions wiped out approximately $11 billion of publisher revenue in 2014,"" PageFair CEO Sean Blanchfield said in a statement.

720,ADBE,"Twitter (TWTR) said people using Apple's (AAPL) iOS or Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android can now add descriptions to images in tweets, a benefit to the visually impaired.The update allowing descriptions -- also known as alternative text -- empowers ""everyone to ensure content shared on Twitter is accessible to the widest possible audience,"" said Twitter engineer Todd Kloots in a blog post Tuesday. .""Photos have been at the center of some of the biggest moments on Twitter,” said Kloots. ""As a core part of the Twitter experience, it's important that images shared on our platform are accessible to everyone, including those who are visually impaired.”People can use the feature via the ""compose image descriptions"" option in the Twitter app's accessibility setting. When an image is added to a tweet, the user can tap the ""add description"" button and insert a description of up to 420 characters to the image. Visually impaired people will have access to the description by using assistive technology, such as screen readers and braille displays, Twitter said.Smartphones have other accessibility features, including VoiceOver, the iPhone's built-in gesture-based app that reads text on a touchscreen aloud, and Google Android's TalkBack, through which visually impaired users can access anything on their phones.Voice-activated services, including Apple's Siri, Amazon.com's (AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet's Google Now, Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana and others, can assist all consumers, including the visually disabled, as people increasingly rely on mobile phones for shopping, communicating and information.But surveys have found those voice-activated services aren't getting much use. Just 13% of U.S. mobile phone owners use a voice-controlled personal assistant on their device each day, according to a survey last June from 451 Research.The Americans with Disabilities Act requires websites and mobile applications to be accessible.

Twitter has launched programs to reel in ""logged out"" users who visit Twitter's site but don't have accounts of their own, making them less coveted by advertisers.Twitter stock was up 2% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 16.Image provided by Shutterstock.

722,ADBE,"Six months after Apple (AAPL) made ad-blocking possible on iOS mobile phones, eMarketer says that the trend is gaining steam. It could mean that companies including Alphabet (GOOGL) search unit Google, French ad firm Criteo (CRTO) and others relying on advertising to make money aren't totally in the clear yet, though they've said that ad-blocking isn't having any effect on their business.Worldwide, 38% of Internet users reported using an ad-blocking tool in Q4 2015, eMarketer notes, citing data from research group GlobalWebIndex. The rise comes after the percentage of people using ad-blocking tools had generally held steady earlier in the year -- 28% in Q3 and Q2 and 27% in Q1, according to the survey.The U.S. showed the lowest ad-blocking adoption rate -- 9% -- of six large nations in North America and Europe, according a June survey by comScore and Sourcepoint. At 27%, France posted the highest ad-blocking rate, the survey said.Ad blockers serve to reduce the amount of bandwidth a user needs by cutting down the amount of content -- seen and unseen -- that a page has to load. They can also help with privacy by blocking programs that track users’ browsing habits -- good for users, bad for advertisers who want to show their ads to people who are the most likely to buy their products.""It's apparent that significant amounts of time are spent viewing ad-blocked video, and that's the crux of the problem as far as publishers and advertisers are concerned,"" the eMarketer report said.About 16% of the U.S. online population blocked Web ads during Q2 2015, according to a report from Adobe Systems (ADBE) and PageFair, an Ireland-based startup that measures ad-blocking costs for publishers.Ad blocking could could cost publishers $41.4 billion globally this year, up from $21.8 billion in 2015, according to that study.Last month, news site Wired became the latest publication to charge users who have installed ad-blocking tools.""We know that you come to our site primarily to read our content, but it's important to be clear that advertising is how we keep WIRED going: paying the writers, editors, designers, engineers and all the other staff that works so hard to create the stories you read and watch here,"" Wired told its readers in a post. On any given day, Wired added, ""more than 20% of the traffic to WIRED.com comes from a reader who is blocking our ads.""To snuff out any momentum, Wired said that people using ad blockers will not have full access to articles on its site and gave ad-block users two options -- either agree to see ads while visiting Wired, or pay about $1 a week for an ad-free subscription.Media firms including NBC will not allow people using ad blockers to watch videos on their sites, while the Guardian and Washington Post newspapers are prodding people who use ad blockers to pay for subscriptions instead.Support for ad blocking built into Apple iOS 9 means that iPhone and iPad users can install ad-blocking services from Apple's App Store. Those products give people the power to pull the plug on Web advertising that they deem annoying -- everything from banner and pop-up ads to auto-play videos.Apple stock was up more than 1% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 103.

742,ADBE,"A couple of couch companions watching TV on tablets might not see the same thing any more, even when watching the same shows. Ad personalization — routine for most of the Web — has come to streaming television. Now, couch surfer A might see a car commercial while couch surfer B gets an ad for insurance.On Tuesday, Adobe Systems (ADBE) launched a personalized video ad-insertion technology as part of its Primetime tech platform. Primetime sells television providers a new way to monetize their media, at a time when the industry is hard up for ad dollars.By serving ads most relevant to a viewer — and being able to fine-tune frequency — they could capture more attention from advertisers who have moved away from traditional television to the Web.TV Ad Sales DownA digital drain is hitting U.S. TV ad revenue, which fell 1.5% year over year in Q4 and 0.9% in Q3, and could deteriorate further this quarter, according to Cowen & Co. analyst Doug Creutz.""The outflow of advertising dollars to digital is real and significant,"" Creutz said in a research note this month. ""We have seen viewership leaving traditional linear TV, but note that some portion of that is shifting to other methods of watching the same shows and thus is not necessarily leaving the Big Media ecosystem.""Most Big Media companies are in the process of aggressively rolling out OTT (""over the top"" or Internet-streamed) products, which we expect will help keep viewership 'in-house.'""As TV networks, and service providers such as cable, telecom and satellite-TV companies, move toward delivering more content online to devices, they're also still trying to figure out how to make money from this trend and how to get the best technology in place.The new, personalized ad-insertion capability in Adobe's Primetime platform ""gives media companies the ability to deliver the most relevant advertising to the viewer, reflected in the (ad cost) rates and amount of revenue they're able to generate from ads,"" said Jeremy Helfand, vice president of video solutions at Adobe.Saves Time For Complex TaskPrimetime, used by NBC Sports, Comcast (CMCSA), Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner Cable (TWC) and others, consists of a suite of tools that TV providers use to format and deliver their content in streams to different kinds of devices — such as tablets and smartphones — as well as ""over-the-top"" (via the Internet) to smart TVs or to regular TVs via Roku boxes, Apple (AAPL) TV and such products.Primetime has helped save time and standardize workflows at longtime Adobe partner NBC Sports Group, says Eric Black, vice president of technology at the group.He says NBC Sports is evaluating the personalized ad-insertion delivery capability, already uses several other parts and ""we're looking at, frankly, the whole suite end-to-end to see where there's synergy.""One issue in moving from traditional TV to streaming online is having to encode video just the right way for a slew of different devices with different technical requirements.""We're using Adobe Primetime for multiplatform ad insertion on a variety of products, desktop, iOS and Android,"" Black said. ""One of the biggest challenges, when we look at video playback — and very high-quality video playback — is supporting fragmented device platforms ... how do you effectively scale your video pipeline to deliver high-quality video ad insertion? What Primetime helps us do, looking at video playback and ad insertion, is normalize (the process) and help reduce some complexity.""Adobe announced the new ad capabilities at the Adobe Summit 2015 conference in Salt Lake City. It also took a product-positioning step: putting its TV-focused Adobe Primetime products — and the related Audience Manager software — under the umbrella of Adobe Marketing Cloud.The Marketing Cloud platform is a digital marketing pillar of Adobe's business alongside its digital media pillar Creative Cloud, home to graphics tech tools such as Photoshop and InDesign.Adobe posted total revenue of $4.1 billion for its fiscal year ended Nov. 28.Long-Term ProjectThe company's been working on its television tools for years, developing an ecosystem through which TV providers can, in the company's words, ""stream, protect, analyze, and monetize video across desktops and devices.""On pricing for the ad-insertion platform it now markets to TV providers, Helfand said Adobe tries to ""align the cost of the technology with the content or revenue being generated by the companies"" and charges on a per-stream or per-household basis, depending on the customer.""On the broadcast or network side they make their money streaming content that has ads in it,"" he said. ""On the operator or distributor side — a Comcast, Time Warner Cable or DirecTV (DTV) — typically they like to see things on a per-device or per-household basis.""Delving as deep as it has into television with its Adobe Primetime platform and other products, Adobe is tackling that industry much as it has others — by aiming to be indispensable.Durable Cash Flow""Adobe has long held a critical position in creative industries with software including Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Many of its users would be unable to participate in their trades without it, as there are essentially no comparably high quality alternatives as widely known by skilled technical users,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said in a recent research note initiating coverage on Adobe. ""These products are a key source of durable and sizeable cash flow growth.""Still, Wieser says, a more important source of long-term growth is Adobe's ""foray into marketing technology and ad tech.""The company groups much of its work there into the Adobe Marketing Cloud platform, where metrics such as Web page and video views can be tracked, and from which companies can manage advertising and marketing campaigns.In 2009, Adobe has spent $3 billion acquiring businesses to establish one of the strongest positions in this market, Wieser writes, where ultimately trillions of dollars of activity ""will be subject to the application of technology given the scale of a global marketing industry ripe for long-term change.""He says Adobe is among a handful of companies leading this evolution.Competitors to different parts of Adobe's Primetime platform, he says, include Comcast, Google (GOOGL), Apple, Microsoft (MSFT) and others.Adobe is in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group, and is the second-largest company there, after Microsoft.Adobe stock fell 2.5% Tuesday, but is up 4.5% this year.

743,ADBE,"Splunk is going small to get bigger.
"
744,ADBE,"The enterprise software company was set Tuesday to launch a new, cheaper version of its analytics software aimed squarely at smaller businesses.
"
745,ADBE,"Splunk's (SPLK) new service, dubbed Splunk Light, lets companies download a version of the firm's machine-to-machine data analytics specifically tailored for small IT operations.
"
746,ADBE,"With its revenue rising at a 50% pace, Splunk has grown fast by selling mostly to companies of 5,000-plus employees. Its software helps enterprises locate bottlenecks in their software applications and data networks. Its customers include Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Yahoo (YHOO). Customers also increasingly use the software to detect security breaches in their networks.
"
747,ADBE,"Now, Splunk aims to gain the same kind of traction in the global small-business analytics software market. That market could amount to $5 billion to $7 billion in cumulative revenue over the next three years, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets.
"
748,ADBE,"""It's a land grab opportunity and Splunk is a clear leader (in M2M analytics software), but now it's about them stepping it up and continuing to innovate and come out with the right solutions for the sub-2,000-employee enterprise,"" Ives told IBD.

749,ADBE,"So far, Splunk has enjoyed a unique opportunity, in that it doesn't have much direct competition for its brand of machine-to-machine data analytics software, analysts say.

750,ADBE,"Protecting Its Turf
"
751,ADBE,"Extending to the small-business market should further expand its business and help protect its turf, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.
"
752,ADBE,"""You don't want to leave an opening for a low-end competitor to gain traction in the small-business market, and then leverage that to work their way up to the enterprise,"" Koenig told IBD.
"
753,ADBE,"With prices starting at $75 per month for up to five users, the cost of the software is far cheaper than the thousands of dollars a year that many companies pay Splunk for more advanced versions of the software. That product is designed to help information technology departments manage the rising volume of data coming in via mobile phones, PCs, global positioning systems and other electronic devices.
"
754,ADBE,"Selling to small businesses should reduce Splunk's average selling price, which has been $40,000 to $50,000 a year, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.
"
755,ADBE,"""This (small-business product) is $900 a year, so they would need to see a lot of scale to match the revenue they get from the core business,"" Wood told IBD. ""They would have to start signing thousands of customers for it to be material.""
"
756,ADBE,"Splunk is following other enterprise software companies — including SolarWinds (SWI) and New Relic (NEWR) — that have had success offering versions of their software that customers can download from the vendors' websites without the need to contact any salespeople, Wood says.
"
757,ADBE,"""It expands the (total addressable market) and does it in a low risk way,"" he said. ""Because this is a different channel, I wouldn't suspect it would be disruptive to the midmarket enterprise focus they have with more of a direct-sales approach.""

761,ADBE,"Splunk is taking the longer-term view as the Big Data market continues to escalate, Ives says.

808,ADBE,"Tech stocks got hurt amid the market volatility of the past few months as investors flocked to defensive sectors such as food and utilities.But now, with the market back in a confirmed uptrend since Feb. 17, some beaten-down techs have shifted to recovery mode. And while their charts may not look pretty, their declines weren't too severe. All were within proper pullback range of less than around 33% from the base's intraday high to intraday low.Adobe Systems (ADBE) corrected as much as 26% from its Dec. 17 high to its Feb. 8 low. The stock reset its base count, as the bottom of its current pattern undercut that of the previous base. It's since regained its 40-week moving average but is finding resistance at its 10-week line. The design software maker is 10% off its high and needs more work on its base's right side.Adobe's base features four down weeks in above-average volume. Yet two of them have shown support as shares closed near the top of their weekly range. That indicates institutional investors stepping in to buy the stock. Counting those two weeks, Adobe saw four accumulation weeks vs. two distribution weeks along the left side of the base, a positive sign.Intuit (INTU) is working on a first-stage pattern after also resetting its base count. The stock has come back from a 13% drop on Aug. 21 that followed disappointing fiscal Q4 earnings and announcing that it would sell home-accounting software Quicken and two other units. The correction in the base was 27%. Shares have regained the 10-week moving average, which is rising.The TurboTax maker on Friday reported fiscal Q2 results that topped views. Intuit's 98 Composite Rating puts it among the top-rated stocks in IBD's financial software group.MaxLinear (MXL) is still in buy range from a 16.29 double-bottom buy point. The correction within the base was less than 29%, in normal range. The stock found support at its 40-week line along the bottom of the base. A B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 up-down volume ratio imply healthy demand for shares.

809,ADBE,"As Silicon Valley remains firmly rooted as the global center of technology and innovation, rarely mentioned is one huge fact that could blunt a ton of good vibes: The area is due for a  major earthquake.“There are going to be infrastructure problems,” David Walters, Cisco Systems (CSCO) director of global safety and security told IBD. “If it’s 6.5 or greater, the bottom line is that a lot of people are going to be walking.”The U.S. Geological Survey says there’s a 72% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on one of the region’s many faults in the next 30 years. The percentage shoots up to 89% for a magnitude 6 or greater quake, USGS scientist Morgan Page told IBD. Either could be catastrophic.""The Bay Area has the highest density of active faults per square mile of any urban center in the country, and on a long-term basis it has the highest amount of earthquake energy released per square mile of any urban center in the country,"" David Schwartz, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told the East Bay Express in 2005. ""So we're really kind of living at ground zero.""A magnitude 7 or greater quake would ""likely"" spur damage to buildings and infrastructure in the range of $95 billion to $190 billion, says Renee Lee, an analyst with Risk Management Solutions, a firm that models risk for insurance companies. “Despite the area being really well educated about earthquakes, and the substantial investments in infrastructure, we will expect to see some pretty significant damage if there’s a quake along the Hayward fault.”Scientists have long considered the Hayward fault one of the most likely candidates for a major quake within a few decades. The fault runs through Oakland and other heavily populated East Bay cities.What’s all but certain is that Silicon Valley will experience widespread utilities losses -- water, power -- as well as damage to buildings and infrastructure such as roads and bridges.A phenomenon called liquefaction -- in which normally solid soil acts like a liquid -- could wreak havoc on any firms with offices near the San Francisco Bay’s shore. Oracle’s main campus, for example, sits atop what’s called bay fill, a material that is highly susceptible to liquefaction. (Oracle (ORCL) spokeswoman Jessica Moore refused to comment on the company's business-continuity plans in the event of an earthquake, or any other natural disaster.)Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also have large campuses located on land susceptible to liquefaction -- though less so than Oracle's (neither of these companies responded to requests for comment). The liquefaction risk to Apple's (APPL) office in Cupertino is low.The good news is that the Internet will almost certainly continue to function, for the most part. Service disruptions are likely, but the core backbones that tie the Bay Area to the Internet will remain intact. That might not have been the case 15 years ago, though ""even then there were major fiber cuts that the Internet weathered fine,” Mike Leber, CEO of Hurricane Electric, an Internet backbone provider, told IBD via email.And many Silicon Valley companies have been sure to locate data centers in other parts of the country, so service disruptions are less likely.""Our data centers are located at sites which have limited potential for severe weather and seismic events,"" Yahoo spokeswoman Carolyn Clark told IBD in an emailed statement.Yet, though the experts can make educated guesses, no one knows how a big one might affect Silicon Valley, or any area, says Anne Wein, a USGS operations research analyst.""The hard work is going to be to get a description about what will happen,"" she told IBD. ""We're just not there yet.""The USGS is studying the issue, what it calls ""Project Haywired,"" and is aiming to complete its research in the fall, according to spokesman Justin Pressfield.In the meantime, uncertainty will persist. ""We haven't had a major earthquake in the U.S. since we have become so connected with wired and wireless technology,"" Wein said. ""Do we have new vulnerabilities? How much redundancy is there? How will this new technology help us recover?""Of 15 large Silicon Valley tech companies -- and several startups valued by investors at more than $1 billion -- that IBD contacted for this report, Adobe Systems (ADBE), eBay (EBAY), Oracle and PayPal (PYPL) declined to comment and nine did not return the request. Cisco provided access to executives for a wide-ranging interview, and Yahoo issued a brief statement.When asked why tech firms are reluctant to discuss business-continuity plans, Sam Singer, a public relations executive who specializes in crisis situations,  said tech companies are “better at talking about services and products. They’re not prepared to talk about public policy issues, safety issues, even though they ought to be.”He says that there’s no reason why companies shouldn’t be able to describe how they would deal with a natural disaster in the Bay Area without giving away proprietary information.“It’s important that companies discuss earthquakes,"" Singer said. ""They need to be leaders, and offer reminders to their employees, the public and the news media that we live in earthquake country.”Dick Evans, president of the Business Recovery Managers Association, a networking and information group for disaster recovery planners, told IBD that his group used to have more membership among major Silicon Valley firms. At the moment, he said, ""we don't have as many as we would like.""Cisco has been active in preparing for quakes. It might take the issue more seriously than others, in part, because it's among the tech giants that were around during the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, Walters says. That quake, centered near San Jose and San Francisco, killed 63 people, displaced 12,000, destroyed an estimated $6 billion worth of property and caused an unknown amount of productivity losses.At Cisco's main offices in San Jose, Walters says the company maintains what it calls ""Arks,"" which store water, food, tents and emergency supplies for all employees on site -- enough supplies to last up to three days.And executives all carry three-day survival backpacks in their vehicles, he says.The company also has a mobile operations center that can staff 13 -- and can turn it into a kind of mobile office for execs. The company has five command-and-control centers around the world -- with satellite communications abilities and backup generators for incident response vehicles. And the company conducts earthquake drills at its main offices.""We have the right processes, right supplies,"" Walters said. ""We know as much as we can about the fault lines and we want to be as knowledgeable as possible."" He adds that USGS scientists come in from time to time to talk about the fault lines with Cisco's safety and security team.The company also monitors incidents around the globe, and has a Tactical Operations team that it deploys on humanitarian missions to restore communications connectivity.Yahoo was willing to share a few details of its plans, though declined to provide access to business continuity executives.Spokeswoman Clark, in a statement, said ""Yahoo has prepared our technology, as well as our physical spaces, to allow us to continue to run and operate our business either in California or other parts of the world in the event of catastrophe. We have invested at our mission-critical facilities to provide for alternative power supplies that will allow those facilities to run in the event of a loss of power or other utilities.""

849,ADBE,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) is putting Flash out to pasture. But no one is complaining. That's because the pioneering Web video and animation software lately has become known as the application that always crashes your browser.Adobe announced Monday that it is replacing its Flash Professional product with Adobe Animate CC in early 2016.""For nearly two decades, Flash Professional has been the standard for producing rich animations on the Web,"" Rich Lee, a senior product marketing manager for Adobe's Creative Cloud, said in a blog post. ""Because of the emergence of HTML5 and demand for animations that leverage Web standards, we completely rewrote the tool over the past few years to incorporate native HTML5 Canvas and WebGL support.""Adobe has been de-emphasizing Flash in favor of HTML5 for years as support for the latter has grown. Animate CC will continue to support Flash, which is still used for Web gaming and premium video, the company said.The turning point for Flash occurred in April 2010 when Apple (AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs harshly criticized the software in an open letter. He said that Flash was the No. 1 cause of Mac computer crashes and was not suitable for mobile devices because it was a battery hog. Apple refused to support Flash on its iOS devices such as the iPhone and iPad.Flash also has been knocked for security vulnerabilities.Adobe said that it changed the name of its Web animation software to reflect the importance of open Web standards and HTML5. Today, over a third of all content produced in Flash Professional CC is HTML5-based, the San Jose, Calif.-based company said.Adobe stock rose 1.2% to 92.55 on the stock market today.

939,ADBE,"One key in both is the rise of bigger-screen smartphones, says Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst at Adobe Digital Index.
"
940,ADBE,"IBD spoke with Gaffney about the findings in the report, which parsed billions of consumer visits to brand advertiser sites between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014.
"
941,ADBE,"IBD: Does the day of the week impact advertising?
"
942,ADBE,"Gaffney: It turns out Sunday is the day that people are doing (a lot of) mobile clicks. And that makes a lot of sense. The weekend is when you're really on your mobile phone and searching for things.
"
943,ADBE,"And we found that Monday was the day that most folks were on their desktop computers.
"
944,ADBE,"So if you're a marketer and you have limited dollars, it may be something that we see in the future, where you ... spend the majority of your money depending on what kinds of behavioral patterns you see in the marketplace.
"
945,ADBE,"If you're a retailer, it might be better to buy mobile (ads). That might drive the cost-per-click rates (how much advertisers pay each time a person clicks on their ad) up, but people are out shopping on the weekends and that's when you want to advertise to them.
"
946,ADBE,"This is a very common approach in television (advertising), but is not so common in digital advertising today.
"
947,ADBE,"IBD: Talk about how Google (GOOGL) benefits from smartphone clicks.
"
948,ADBE,"Gaffney: In the past, Google has reported that their cost-per-click rates had declined. The data we're seeing starting in September shows an uptick in cost-per-clicks for both (the search partnership of) Yahoo (YHOO) (and Microsoft (MSFT)-owned) Bing and for Google. We saw an 8% year-over-year rise. We believe the impact of the cost of those visual ads and shopping ads, and the mix, is causing the overall cost-per-click to rise.
"
949,ADBE,"Smartphone cost-per-click has gone up 6% year-over-year. This is very important for Google because they previously were just not getting as much money out of smartphone clicks (as desktop clicks). (The higher CPC rate) was probably related to Apple (AAPL)'s release of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which are bigger-screen devices. So the cost-per-click became more valuable to advertisers and they started to look toward doing more smartphone-specific advertising, which bids up the rates.
"
950,ADBE,"IBD: Why do bigger cellphone screens translate to higher ad rates?
"
951,ADBE,"Gaffney: In the past, when we did an analysis on the smaller screens, we discovered that when people clicked, they didn't actually go more than one page into a website. They would click and then they would back out. The return on investment for a visit that only lasts one page is quite low. People aren't going to buy, they're not going to book and they're not going to read a lot of articles, so it's just not the best visit.
"
952,ADBE,"Part of the reason for (the short visits), we believe, is because on the smaller screens, people were clicking on ads accidentally. They didn't really mean to be there and so would immediately back out.
"
953,ADBE,"That made a cost-per-click less valuable on a smartphone. As the screen size gets bigger, it's more valuable, because when people click they are meaning to click, and that means that they're going to go in and actually have a real visit on that website, which is much more likely to result in a conversion (someone making a purchase or signing up for a service).
"
954,ADBE,"We see that the bigger screens improve conversion rates on mobile devices as well, if you're a retailer, for example. It (a mobile ad) is becoming more valuable now that more people have a big-screen phone. We are starting to see a pickup, and I think it's related to this screen size phenomena. That's my interpretation.
"
955,ADBE,"IBD: What does the click-through rate, the number of clicks on an ad, tell you?
"
956,ADBE,"Gaffney: This tells me something about what's going on with efficiency. Advertisers have maximized their Google click-through rate, up 15% year-over-year, which is a tremendous amount for a product that everyone already seems to have maximized. The difference (between Google and) Bing-Yahoo, I think, is stark in that they really haven't optimized Bing-Yahoo across any device. Its use is flat year-over-year. We didn't see a better click-through rate (for Bing-Yahoo) in December 2014 than we saw in December 2013.
"
957,ADBE,"IBD: Your report mentions ""Friday Facebook."" What's that?
"
958,ADBE,"Gaffney: Friday's the day that people interact with brand postings on Facebook. What's fantastic about that is that one of the biggest advertisers in the world is the movie business and they love getting a lot of interaction with their advertising on Friday afternoon because that's when people are deciding what they want to do for the weekend, which movies they want to go see. That's part of the reason why on television Thursday night is such a big night for highly rated shows, because the movie business wants to advertise on Thursday night to drive weekend traffic to the theater.
"
959,ADBE,"So this Friday Facebook thing is of course obvious, but it's fascinating from the standpoint of how advertising in the future is going to look. Will marketers really shift money off of their text advertising and onto Facebook on these types of days just to capitalize on the opportunity?
"
960,ADBE,"Facebook Post (ad) impressions are way up. This is important because it tells us that the next level of retail spending is in Facebook.
"
961,ADBE,"Will Google start to decline as a result of Facebook starting to pick up? It depends on how Google responds with their own offerings and whether or not they're going to let advertisers do better targeting of their Google text and pictorial shopping-type advertising. If they do, then they'll probably grow again. If they don't, then they might start to lose some money over to Facebook.
"
962,ADBE,"Facebook's paid impressions from retail advertisers are up 13% year-over-year and Facebook Posts are up 24% from retail brands. Facebook looks like it's on the rise.When you're talking about the digital ad game, you're increasingly talking about ""Facebook Fridays,"" ""Mobile Sundays"" and ""Desktop Mondays.""That's among the findings in the Q4 2014 Global Digital Advertising Report slated to be released Tuesday by Adobe Digital Index, a research unit software maker and digital ad services provider Adobe Systems (ADBE).Key findings with this latest report are that Google's (GOOGL) mobile ads are fetching higher prices from advertisers, and that movie studios and other advertisers are increasingly looking to Facebook (FB), and often on Fridays.One key in both is the rise of bigger-screen smartphones, says Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst at Adobe Digital Index.IBD spoke with Gaffney about the findings in the report, which parsed billions of consumer visits to brand advertiser sites between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014.IBD: Does the day of the week impact advertising?Gaffney: It turns out Sunday is the day that people are doing (a lot of) mobile clicks.

That's way up from IBM's tally of an 8.5% sales gain for full-day Cyber Monday last year.Mobile users accounted for 46% of all online traffic, up 16% over 2014, IBM said.""Mobile continues to be the story,"" Anuj Nayar, senior director of global initiatives at online transaction company PayPal (PYPL), told IBD.Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Digital Index, which says that it measures 80% of transactions for the top 100 U.S. retailers, projected U.S. Cyber Monday sales to hit $3 billion and be the largest online sales day of the year.Adobe said that mobile traffic accounted for 53% of shopping visits and 32% of sales.ITG analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD he sees three trends:• Heavy shopping has started earlier in the season.• Mobile buying has changed shopping behaviors.• And retailers, especially Amazon.com (AMZN), that have heavily invested in fulfillment infrastructure, will do well and lengthen their selling season.From Thanksgiving Day through Sunday, U.S. shoppers spent $8.03 billion online, up 17%, says Adobe. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a research note that initial shopping data appears ""positive"" for Amazon, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), ChannelAdvisor (ECOM) and PayPal.""We're all pretty excited here,"" Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, told IBD. ChannelAdvisor tracks third-party sales on e-commerce sites such as Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Big-screen and ultrahigh-def (4K) TV sets are among this year's top sellers, says IBM's Justin Norwood.""In particular, Samsung seems to have hit a chord across the 4K picture and sound price point, and has taken a leadership position,"" Norwood told IBD.The Apple (AAPL) Watch is another big seller, ""but that trend goes back three months now, from our data,"" Norwood said.Hoverboards — single-axle, self-balancing scooters — also are hot. EBay says that it sold two hoverboards a minute on Thanksgiving. ""If there were a breakout item, that's it,"" Hal Lawton, senior vice president of eBay North America, told IBD.ChannelAdvisor reported that as of 3 p.m. EST, Cyber Monday sales were up 16.8% over the year-earlier period, but a small percentage from last year's growth.EBay ""is offering very unusual promotions,"" said Wingo. ""They seem to be saying that we're going to opt-out of competing with the big guys on the latest GoPro (GPRO) camera, for example.""ChannelAdvisor said third-party sales were up 22% at Amazon but less than 2% at eBay, though it represents just a small percentage of eBay sellers.Lawton, in a statement, said eBay is making ""an aggressive push"" for daily deals on Apple products.No. 4 U.S. retailer Target (TGT) suffered a website outage at 10 a.m. EST Monday on heavy traffic. The company ran an aggressive promotion, offering 15% off any item on its website.

1098,ADBE,"As the official start to the holiday shopping season arrives, Americans are using their mobile devices more than ever to capitalize on Thanksgiving and Black Friday deals online.On Thursday and early Friday, mobile traffic accounted for nearly 60% of all online shopping traffic, and 40% of all online sales, said Justin Norwood, product strategist for IBM (IBM) Watson Trend, which analyzes online shopping data.Shopping via Apple (AAPL) iPhone and other smartphones was about triple tablet shopping, IBM says.""Both on the hits side and on the sales size, the smartphone is outpacing tablets, and smartphone shoppers dominate,"" Norwood told IBD. ""It seems like this is the breakout year for mobile optimization, and retailers have invested a considerable amount in their mobile sites.""It takes a considerable investment (to optimize for mobile sales), but prior to doing so the shopper experience on a phone (was) very difficult.""The strong sales are a generally good sign for e-commerce stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN) and PayPal (PYPL). According to ChannelAdvisor, which tracks third-party selling on e-com sites, third-party Amazon.com sales were up 20% year over year for the start of the season, but eBay (EBAY) sales were down 10%.Shares of Amazon and PayPal, however, both fell a fraction in Friday's shortened session, while eBay stock rose a fraction.Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Digital Index, which measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers, found that 37% of online sales for the early part of Black Friday came via mobile, mostly smartphones.Hal Lawton, senior vice president of eBay North America, told IBD that mobile sales were strong on that site. ""We sold a limited edition Mercedes on an Android phone, a Lamborghini on an iPhone, and a Ferrari (RACE) Testarossa on an iPhone,"" he said.EBay says mobile growth is the trend. ""For us, mobile is not a new story,"" Lawton said. ""For Q3, we saw 43% of traffic on mobile. And we're seeing shoppers start on one platform, like a phone, and then finish shopping on another, like an iPad.""But Adobe said online sales were lagging its estimate. Sales between midnight and 11 a.m. ET Friday rose 15% from the year-earlier period to $822 million, it said, but Adobe had expected 19% growth. Adobe is anticipating $2.6 billion in online sales for Black Friday.On Thanksgiving, email promotions accounted for 14% of online sales, says Adobe, rising 25% from last Thanksgiving.Adobe's report also found that eBay surpassed Amazon.com in social media buzz.""We're very pleased by the results we saw on Thanksgiving, and we're pleased with the early momentum today,"" Lawton said.

1135,ADBE,"Among the more curious items seized from the Pakistani compound of Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden was a strategy guide to the first-person shooter video game ""Delta Force Xtreme 2.""The guide to the 2009 military combat game for Microsoft (MSFT) Windows PCs was among the trove of documents recovered during the raid in which U.S. Special Forces killed bin Laden on May 2, 2011. The video game guide was disclosed in the latest tranche of declassified documents that the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence released Wednesday.The ""Delta Force Xtreme 2"" guide, as well as a ""GameSpot Video Game Guide,"" were listed under a category suggesting that compound residents other than bin Laden used them.The discovery of the guide raises some interesting questions. Did bin Laden and his cohorts use the game and the guide for training purposes or to study U.S. combat strategy? Or was it simply entertainment at the isolated compound?The idea of al-Qaida terrorists playing a video game in which the elite U.S. Army squad Delta Force are the heroes is odd. U.S. Navy SEALs in an operation carried out by the CIA killed Bin Laden and his crew.Privately held NovaLogic, which counts Electronic Arts (EA) as an investor, made ""Delta Force Xtreme 2."" The game scored poorly with game critics, getting a Metacritic rating of 40 out of 100. The plot of the game has Delta Force soldiers sent to Asia to bring a drug cartel and former Soviet mercenaries to justice.The Navy Seal raid also scooped up a library of software and technical manuals, most notably Adobe Systems (ADBE) media creation software. Bin Laden's bookshelf included manuals on Adobe Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Encore, Photoshop and Premiere Pro.

Its shares hit an all-time high of 87.25 on Aug. 18.The San Jose, Calif.-based company said it expects its digital-media and marketing-cloud business segments each to post 20% year-over-year revenue growth next year.In its three-year forecast, Adobe expects total revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 20%. It sees adjusted earnings per share growing at a compound annual rate of 30% over that time period, from fiscal 2015 through 2018.""Adobe is the only company that brings great content and powerful data together, enabling millions of customers globally to build high-impact digital experiences,"" Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in a statement.

The higher user estimate includes more lower-end users, international subscribers and even conversions of people using pirated Adobe software, he said.Amladi reiterated his buy rating on Adobe stock and raised his price target to 90 from 85.Credit Suisse analyst Philip Winslow came away unimpressed with Adobe's forecast. He maintained his neutral rating on Adobe stock and cut his price target to 65 from 75.

1201,ADBE,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) reported better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter late Tuesday, but investors focused on one number that disappointed: new subscribers to Adobe's Creative Cloud.The media software company added 517,000 net new subscribers to its Creative Cloud, up 28% year over year and bringing the total to 3.97 million subscribers. But Wall Street analysts were looking for 573,000 additions for the quarter ended Feb. 27.Adobe stock was down 3.5%, below 77, in midday trading on the stock market today.""We think it was a good number, but people would have liked to have seen more,"" Adobe Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett told IBD. ""It was a really good quarter and if you're going to focus just on the 517 (thousand new subscribers), you're missing the bigger story anyway.""Creative Cloud subscriber additions in Q1 were reduced by a reporting change, he said. With the launch of the company's new Document Cloud, Adobe is no longer lumping Acrobat subscribers in with Creative Cloud subscribers, he told IBD.""That change had a significant impact on the subscriber number for Creative Cloud in the quarter,"" Garrett said.A better figure for investors to focus on is Adobe's annualized recurring revenue, he said. That number has been increasing since Adobe began its transition to an Internet cloud business model. Annualized recurring revenue reached $2.09 billion in Adobe's digital media businesses last quarter.Adobe's Q1 also showed that the company is becoming more profitable now that it is emerging from its transition from pay-upfront software to pay-as-you-go software.""If you look at the revenue and earnings we generated this quarter, it really shows that the P&L is coming back in a very big way, which is terrific,"" Garrett said. ""We're through the financial part of this transition.""Adobe earned 44 cents a share, excluding stock-based compensation and other items, for its fiscal first quarter, up 46% from the year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 11% to $1.109 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Adobe to earn 39 cents a share on sales of $1.085 billion.For fiscal Q2, Adobe expects adjusted EPS of 44 cents on sales of $1.15 billion, at the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling 48 cents and $1.18 billion, but Adobe is known to be conservative with guidance.Adobe has three pillars to its cloud strategy: Creative Cloud, which includes creative professional software like Photoshop and Illustrator; Marketing Cloud, which provides online marketing tools; and Document Cloud, which extends Adobe's Acrobat and PDF standard.""Adobe is an arms dealer to the creative and marketing worlds,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kirk Adams said in a research note Wednesday. ""The growth of the Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud should provide investors with good returns over the next few years. We are excited to see revenues rebound this year as the transition to a mostly subscription and recurring revenue model is nearing completion.""Adobe also is managing operating expenses tightly, which helps with earnings, he said. Adams rates Adobe stock as a buy.

1270,ADBE,"Google's Q1 missed views as costs escalate for an Internet company tackling everything from wireless services to driverless cars, but currency issues played a role in the miss, and sales growth stayed solidly in the double digits.Google (GOOGL) stock, which has stagnated the past 18 months, was up 4% in after-hours trading Thursday, after the company released its results. Shares rose 1.5% in the regular session to 557.46. The stock is up 5% this year but down 8.5% since touching a 13-month high near 609 last July.""Excluding the net impact of foreign currency headwinds, revenue grew a healthy 17% year on year,"" Patrick Pichette, Google's outgoing CFO, said in the company's earnings release. ""We continue to see great momentum in our mobile advertising business and opportunities with brand advertisers.""Google doesn't break out mobile revenue. Ads account for roughly 90% of total revenue.The company reported earnings per share minus items of $6.57, up 4.8% from the year-earlier quarter. Revenue minus TAC, the traffic acquisition costs that the company pays other sites to carry its ads, rose 14% to $13.9 billion. Total revenue rose 12% to $17.26 billion.FactSet Research had modeled revenue ex-TAC of $14 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS ex items of $6.60 on total sales of $17.69 billion.As per its custom, Google doesn't give guidance. FactSet expects Q2 revenue ex TAC of $14.5 billion, up 14%. TR expects Q2 EPS ex items of $6.77, up 11%.The U.S. dollar resulted in a negative currency impact of $795 million in Q1, Pichette said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts. He said the gross impact was $1.1 billion, but Google's currency hedging helped.The Internet search leader is up against rivals such as Facebook (FB), China search leader Baidu (BIDU) and China e-commerce king Alibaba Holdings (BABA), among others. Facebook Q1 revenue, posted late Wednesday, also missed, hurt by currency issues.Q1 R&D; costs jumped 29.5% year over year, and sales and marketing costs rose 19%. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue rose to 37% from 35% in Q1 2014.Google saw its U.S. search share slip in March to 64.4% from 64.5% in February after being replaced by Yahoo (YHOO) as the default search provider for the Firefox Web browser.That 64.4% was ""the lowest since we began tracking this metric in January 2012,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in a pre-earnings research note. While the drop ""does not give a sense of the performance of either its international or mobile segments,"" he pointed out that the contract for default search engine for Apple (AAPL) iOS is up for bid soon.For Q1, Google reported a 13% increase in the number of paid clicks, the times a user opens a Google ad, and a 7% decline in cost-per-click, or what advertisers pay on average per click. Late Tuesday, Yahoo reported a 21% rise in its search ad clicks and a 3% decline in CPC.Cost per click in general has fallen as the percentage of mobile ads rises, analysts say, with advertisers willing to pay less for mobile ads than desktop ads. But Pichette, on a conference call with analysts, said the clicks and CPC metrics do not reflect difficulty monetizing search on mobile.A rise in automated ad buying also hurts Google, says Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst with Adobe Systems' (ADBE) digital index report. ""Before, you'd just spend on Google because they had the most traffic. Now, the quality of that traffic is becoming more critical,"" Gaffney said, and Yahoo and Microsoft's (MSFT) Bing search ""has always delivered higher conversion rates and more affluent customers to websites.""Meanwhile, on April 15, the European Commission charged the company with violating antitrust laws and also said it was looking into Google's Android mobile operating system.On Wednesday, Google launched its first wireless service, Project Fi, which will first automatically connect to a free public Wi-Fi service.

"
1329,ADBE,"Even though cutting-edge technology has driven recent stock gains at Harman International Industries, CEO Dinesh Paliwal knows what many people think of when they hear the company's name: audio systems, car speakers and the like.He understands why. Harman (HAR) and its predecessor companies have been making and selling audio gear since the Eisenhower Administration, when people spun 78s (look it up) on record players (look it up). Its brands now include JBL, AKG, Harman/Kardon and Infinity.It's not easy changing a brand image that has been decades in the making.But Paliwal sounds determined to do that with Harman.The company's robust financial growth — including a blowout second quarter that sent its stock price soaring to new highs last week — owes more to cutting-edge technology than to traditional audio gear.Paliwal wants people to know it.""We want to be separated out from the pack,"" he told IBD. ""The same analysts who cover us cover a lot of hardware and metal companies, but we don't belong there. We are a pure technology play.""Crossover Points To GrowthTechnology used in everything from car infotainment systems and security products to smartphones — and working with tech by high-profile partners such as Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) — is the driving force behind Harman's financial growth and recent stock surge, Paliwal says.Harman stock popped 24% to a 10-year closing high of 125.01 on Jan. 29, the day it breezed past fiscal Q2 2015 earnings and sales estimates. Shares have continued to rise since then and set a new high of 135.07 on Tuesday.Harman's payroll of around 25,000 people includes about 10,000 software engineers. Much of their work focuses on improving and expanding Harman's digitally integrated car infotainment systems, which offer audio and video, route navigation, connectivity, cloud computing services and driver assistance systems.""Cars have to become smart — totally integrated and automated,"" Paliwal said. ""Our approach is to connect from the car to the cloud, then back into the car.""To that end, the company continues to introduce new technologies and solutions.At last month's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Harman unveiled Individual Sound Zones technology, which creates distinct listening zones inside a car's cabin and lets different people listen to different things.It does this by placing small speakers in headrests and other parts of the car, and by preventing sounds from crossing from one zone to the next. If a passenger gets a phone call, for instance, the driver can use the technology to switch the sound off in his own area and tune out the phone conversation.These kinds of technologies open up ""an entirely adjacent addressable market while increasing awareness of infotainment systems overall,"" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman noted in a recent research report.Harman is determined to market these new technologies ahead of the competition, Paliwal says. ""Someone will disrupt us if we don't find a solution fast and do not have the speed to market.""To get that speed to market, the company is constantly on the lookout for buyouts that give it instant access to new technologies.Internet Of Many ThingsIn June, Harman spent $365 million to acquire AMX, a maker of hardware and software to improve the audio and visual elements used in conference rooms, hotels, classrooms and entertainment centers.More recently, on Jan. 22, Harman upped the ante when it announced plans to spend nearly $1 billion on a pair of companies that will help it make a bigger move into the Internet of Things.One of those companies is Symphony Teleca. It's a Mountain View, Calif.-based provider of software engineering and integration services for cloud-based and wireless businesses in numerous markets, including telecom, health care, consumer electronics, automotive and retail.Symphony Teleca, which came at a price of about $780 million, has 8,000 employees and logged $370 million in 2014 sales. Its solutions help clients rapidly design and develop products and technologies at the convergence of device, sensors, cloud and data. Active customers include Google, Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Tata Motors' (TTM) Jaguar Land Rover and Verizon Communications (VZ) .""Symphony is very strong in Linux and has invested heavily in the cloud,"" Paliwal said. ""They've worked with large companies like Microsoft to help scale their cloud systems.""Harman also announced the $170 million acquisition of Israel's Red Bend Software, a provider of software management technology for connected devices as well as over-the-air software and firmware upgrading services. Red Bend's tech will be used to enhance Harman's connected car systems.A week after those deals were announced, Harman and Chinese Internet search engine Baidu (BIDU) said that they will form a strategic collaboration, called CarLife, that will combine Baidu's maps and Harman's navigation infotainment system to help drivers plan routes, estimate distances, avoid traffic congestion and find parking location information, among other things.On a fiscal second-quarter conference call, Paliwal said that Harman is ""the first Tier 1 company to work with Baidu to create a tailored in-vehicle user experience with their CarLife solution,"" which he said is ""very similar to Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto.""Car Technology AcceleratesAdvanced infotainment and communications systems have become a big deal in cars, with research firm Gartner estimating that by 2020 one in five vehicles, or about 250 million, will have a wireless network connection. Harman is one of several currently high-performing connected-car stocks.""We are convinced that demand for a rich connected-car experience is sustainable and will continue to drive take rates,"" Paliwal said on the earnings conference call in January.He also praised Harman's Q2 financial performance, and with good reason.The company reported earnings of $1.79 a share for the quarter, which ended in December. That was up 64% from a year earlier and well above the consensus Wall Street expectations for $1.28 a share. Harman's revenue rose 19% to $1.58 billion, topping views for $1.48 billion.Analyst Brinkman noted that Harman's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins in the quarter tracked ""at a very strong 14.1%.""While those margins are likely to fall during the second half of the fiscal year due to annual price markdowns, ""the sooner-than-anticipated inflection in profitability gives us increased confidence in the company's ability to reach and exceed its margin targets,"" Brinkman said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Harman to report full-year EPS of $5.89, up from $4.41 the prior year.

1341,ADBE,"The pressures that have slowed tech growth this year will show up again when Q3 earnings season begins in earnest on Tuesday, when chip leader Intel (INTC) reports.
"
1342,ADBE,"The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings-per-share growth to average just 2.4% from the year-earlier quarter. That's despite an expected huge quarter of 32% EPS growth from the biggest company of all, Apple (AAPL).
"
1343,ADBE,"Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. At least, that's how it had been. But the 2.4% average EPS growth outlook for Q3 would mark the sector's worst performance since Q2 2013, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.
"
1344,ADBE,"And if Apple is taken out of the equation, then average tech EPS would be expected to fall by 3.4%.
"
1345,ADBE,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, analyst consensus estimates call for earnings per share, typically minus items such as stock options, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see EPS tumble 26%. Excluding the energy section, EPS is expected to rise 2% overall for the S&P 500.
"
1346,ADBE,"As has been the case all year, a weak global economy, strong dollar, slow PC sales and the seismic shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector.
"
1347,ADBE,"""The tech industry is no longer one of the consistent leaders each quarter, but it's expected to improve going into next year,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.
"
1348,ADBE,"But first, the outlook is expected to get worse before it gets better. For Q4, the consensus tech EPS estimate is for a slight decline of 0.3%. That's expected to improve to growth of 6.7% in Q1 2016 and 8.8% in Q2.
"
1349,ADBE,"Optimism Vs. Reality
"
1350,ADBE,"Analysts, it should be noted, tend to be more optimistic the further out they look. At the start of this year, for example, the consensus Q3 tech EPS estimate was for growth of 12%. That Q3 consensus forecast fell to 9.4% in April and 6% in July, before hitting the current 2.4%.
"
1351,ADBE,"""Optimism goes away when reality begins coming into view,"" said Harrison.
"
1352,ADBE,"Bill Whyman, an analyst at Evercore ISI, does expect things to improve in 2016, but he says improvements will be weighted more toward the second half. Whyman gave his tech outlook in a conference call with investors on Oct. 5.
"
1353,ADBE,"What's missing now, Whyman says, is a powerful tech product cycle or a better economy, neither of which have come into view.
"
1354,ADBE,"""We're still stuck in a low-growth world,"" Whyman said on the call.
"
1355,ADBE,"Part of what's ailing many big tech companies is what Whyman says is a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing, which has shattered old ways of using technology. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by instead turning to cloud-computing services from such companies as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the new parent company of Google.
"
1356,ADBE,"Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from China and Taiwan in order to cut their costs. That trends has hurt hardware vendors such as IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and EMC (EMC).
"
1357,ADBE,"IBM is slated to report Q3 earnings after the market close Oct. 19. Big Blue, which has sold several businesses as it restructures, has posted 13 straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The 14th straight quarter is likely ahead, as IBM is expected to report a 12% drop in sales, to $19.65 billion. EPS is expected to fall 9% to $3.34.
"
1358,ADBE,"Cloud computing has spurred the growth of software-as-a-service business models, pioneered by companies like Salesforce.com (CRM). The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of handing over hefty fees for some services they don't need. The SaaS model has been disruptive to old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.

"
1361,ADBE,"That's a challenge for No. 1 PC-processor maker Intel. After the close Tuesday, Intel is expected to post an EPS drop of 11%. Revenue is expected to rise a slim 2% to $14.2 billion, after a 5% decline in Q2.
"
1362,ADBE,"Among the sub-sectors in the S&P 500 tech group, the application software group leads the field, with an expected average EPS increase of 40%. Adobe Systems (ADBE) last week showed a 93% EPS increase when it reported earnings for its fiscal Q3 ended Aug. 28. But the software company forecast fiscal 2016 sales and profit below Wall Street estimates, and the stock sank more than 5%.

1363,ADBE,"The Internet software and services group, a strong performer all year, is expected to post a relatively modest EPS growth of 6%. This group includes Facebook (FB), Google, Yahoo (YHOO) and eBay (EBAY). Yahoo, which reports earnings on Oct. 20 after the close, hurt the sector. Yahoo's Q3 EPS is expected to fall 67% to 17 cents, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Without Yahoo, EPS growth for the group is 13%.

About 50% to 55% of its revenue comes from telecom and automotive, Paliwal said.Symphony Teleca has more than 8,000 employees, predominantly software engineers and designers, and generated 2014 sales of about $370 million, with adjusted earnings of about $60 million.Harman has 17,000 employees in 30 countries.Red Bend Software is a leading provider of over-the-air software and firmware upgrading services. It serves top handset manufacturers and mobile carriers with more than 2 billion Red Bend-enabled devices in the market globally, Harman said in a news release.Red Bend is at $50 million in annual sales and is starting to scale, Paliwal said. It employs 270 engineers.Harman would like to expand Red Bend's capabilities to update automotive electronic systems wirelessly so people won't have to bring their cars to a service station to get updated, Paliwal said.""The biggest thing here is finding a solution to keep automotive systems connected, and that is the missing piece so far in the quest of connected cars,"" Paliwal said. ""You cannot have autonomous driving without connectivity. And you cannot have connectivity unless you can keep your firmware, software and apps updated.""Harman is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings on Jan. 29. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Harman to earn $1.29 a share, up 18% from a year earlier, on sales of $1.49 billion, up 12%.If Harman meets those targets, the company will have achieved its seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth in EPS and its sixth in sales.

1470,ADBE,"Maybe the race wasn't to the swift during biblical times, but in the 21st century you'll get left behind in a hurry if you're slow out of the gate with new technologies.Rivals of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) are finding that out.Ultimate makes workforce management software designed to help clients better manage employee-related services such as payroll, benefits, recruiting, performance management and time management.The core product is UltiPro, software that manages the employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. Ultimate delivers it via the Internet cloud.That last part — the cloud — is what separates Ultimate from others in its industry, analysts say. Ultimate was an early mover in designing an integrated, cloud-based human resources/payroll system, giving it a leg up on rivals who have taken longer to leverage the cloud.""As the move to the cloud has accelerated, Ultimate has been one of the biggest beneficiaries,"" said Samad Samana, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""They are taking a lot of customers away from ADP (ADP), Ceridian and Paychex (PAYX).""Clout Of The CloudCloud-based systems have several advantages over hardware-based systems, Samana told IBD.""There is a lower overall cost of ownership because you don't have to purchase hardware,"" he said. ""There's less staff cost in terms of management. And there are more frequent updates to the software, which helps you keep up with the pace of innovation.""Ultimate's ability to trot out new products and innovations has been one of the keys to its consistent financial growth through the years. The company posts double-digit sales and earnings gains with regularity and is expected to keep doing so well into the future.""The market for Ultimate's solutions is large and growing rapidly. The company has strong, highly regarded products, increasing scale, and a business model that better balances revenue growth and profitability than many SaaS (software as a service) peers,"" MKM Partners analyst Kevin Buttigieg noted in a report last month initiating coverage on Ultimate with a ""buy"" rating.Ultimate boasts 2,700 customers with employees in 150 countries. Its client list features a diverse range of firms, including software maker Adobe Systems (ADBE), restaurant operators Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), auto parts retailer Pep Boys (PBY) and Major League Baseball.Ultimate mainly focuses on two types of customers: enterprise companies, defined as those with more than 1,500 employees, and mid-market companies, or those with around 500 to 1,500 employees.Ultimate's enterprise sales team, which consists of 75 sales reps, has ""an unusually low turnover"" rate with an average tenure of 10 years, Barrington Research analyst Jeff Houston noted following Ultimate's third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 28.He cites several reasons for the low turnover, including ""not penalizing successful salespeople by narrowing their territories as well as world-class benefits.""Winning BusinessDuring a conference call with analysts, Ultimate CEO Scott Scherr noted a number of enterprise wins during the company's third quarter, though he didn't divulge the names of the customers. These included a ""high-profile"" restaurant chain with 18,000 employees, a security company with 6,500 employees and an education services company with 3,600 employees.While most of Ultimate's business comes from large and mid-sized clients, the company has lately increased its efforts to land more smaller companies of 500 or fewer employees, analyst Houston says.""Management was clear that it has been selling to companies with fewer than 500 employees for a long time, and that it is just adding more salespeople to target the low end of the market,"" he noted.FBR's Samana reckons it will be some time before the move to land more smaller clients begins to have much impact on Ultimate's financial results.""The move downstream is a newer initiative for them, so it's something where we will see a bigger contribution a couple of years from now,"" he said. ""It's not as big a driver in the near term.""What About Job Gains?Although analyst Houston says Ultimate stands to benefit as the economy adds jobs, CEO Scherr mentioned on the third-quarter conference call that with new customers being Ultimate Software's biggest growth driver, changes in employment ""are not that material"" to the overall growth goal.During the third quarter the company logged revenue of $127.4 million, up 24% from the prior year and just ahead of consensus analyst views. Earnings gained 25% to 50 cents a share, topping estimates by a penny.Recurring revenue, or revenue that is likely to continue in the future, increased 26% during the quarter.""The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our cloud offering,"" Scherr said in a statement.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Ultimate to post full-year 2014 earnings of $2.02 a share, up 26% from a year earlier. EPS is seen rising another 22% to $2.46 in 2015.The company's stock price touched a nearly eight-month high of 156.20 on Tuesday. Shares are up 20% since Oct. 10.Ultimate is part of IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 7 out of 197 industries tracked. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, which ranks fifth in the group. Three stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 99: Manhattan Associates (MANH), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR).

The stock closed at 30.10, up 20%.The company is riding a new wave in sales and marketing techniques. Older methods — including cold calls, spam email, popup ads and other forms of disruptive advertising — have been increasingly rendered ineffective by consumers with call blocking and Internet filters. Consumers are recording TV shows and speeding past commercials. Traditional methods of advertising are having less influence on consumer buying decisions, according to HubSpot.""People no longer live, work, shop and buy as they did a decade ago,"" HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan told IBD. ""People now live in a social media world, a world of Google search and the blogosphere. About 70-80% of the consumer decision process happens online, which is a radical shift in the way people used to shop and buy.""Customers are increasingly selecting their own communication channels, relying heavily on the Internet and social media.HubSpot provides a cloud-based sales and marketing software-as-a-service (Saas) platform designed to help businesses generate customer leads and turn them into sales. Applications provided by HubSpot let businesses monitor, publish and track social media across Facebook (FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), Twitter (TWTR) and Google (GOOGL). It can schedule messages and post on multiple Twitter accounts and to groups on LinkedIn, Google+ and Facebook.""HubSpot is the iPhone of marketing, an all-in-one system that brings everything together,"" Halligan said.HubSpot also helps users develop their own blogs and improve their search-engine results. Its platform includes marketing automation, customer relationship management and data analytics tools.300 Companies In FieldKirk Adams, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, says that HubSpot fits into an evolving and fast-growing category known as marketing automation software. He estimates that about 300 companies are in this competitive market.""This space is seeing a new wave of marketing techniques, and HubSpot does a good job at it,"" Adams said. ""It's a large market, and there will be more than one winner. HubSpot does a good job of standing out in the crowd.""Rivals include Marketo (MKTO), which went public last year. Other companies offering products and services in this field include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce.com (CRM).HubSpot says that it has more than 11,620 customers in 70 countries. It uses a subscription model, with customers paying an average of $8,823 per year, HubSpot said.It targets businesses with 10 to 2,000 employees. Halligan says HubSpot's platform has increased sales leads of its customers by five times their average per month.Despite the fast growth, the company is not yet profitable. For the six months ended June 30, HubSpot revenue rose 46% from the year-earlier period to $51.3 million. But it reported a net loss of $17.7 million. It spent $33 million on sales and marketing, and $9.6 million on research and development.It's common for young companies, especially those in the SaaS field, to spend heavily, looking for a big payoff down the road.""It's a land grab,"" Halligan said, ""and we want to get as many customers as we can.""Adams said HubSpot estimates it will turn a profit by the end of 2016.""Software subscriptions typically take several years to become profitable on any given deal,"" wrote research firm IPO Boutique in a report, adding that it's the same with Marketo.

"
1566,ADBE,"Now, Helfand says, it will automatically recognize users from their IP (Internet protocol) address once they've initially logged in at home. He calls it a ""major advancement,"" noting that Adobe is ""putting the authentication on the device so it happens at device level, not IP level.""

1569,ADBE,"Apple's (AAPL) mobile iOS operating system is still the main viewing platform beyond the television for TV Everywhere, according to Adobe stats, with a 50% share, followed by PCs at 21% and Apple's Mac operating system at 7%, though viewing on Google (GOOG) Android-powered devices is rising rapidly.

1570,ADBE,"""We're really seeing an increase in mobile as a channel for content, and sports is the No. 1 content type for TV Everywhere,"" Helfand said.

1572,ADBE,"Helfand says that Adobe stats show a quarter of all sports video content is viewed on mobile devices.The 2014 Winter Olympics start with the opening ceremony Friday night and what's apt to be a lot of TV viewing throughout the Games on tablets and smartphones, now that it's possible.TV Everywhere is an industry effort to make viewing options relatively seamless across PCs, tablets and other devices, which takes a lot of work behind the scenes, and Adobe Systems (ADBE) is one big player in the push.With sports really fueling growth in viewing beyond the TV set, the company is working with Comcast (CMCSA) -owned NBC Sports Group to bring along several firsts for the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.""There's a big countdown in our San Francisco office,"" Jeremy Helfand, vice president for Adobe's Primetime division, told IBD. ""With Sochi for the first time, all sporting events and sports are being covered by the broadcast online across devices, and not only is all the live broadcasting available online, but also replay.""Time-delayed viewing could be substantial, given that the middle of the day in Russia is the middle of the previous night on the U.S. West Coast. In all, Adobe says, device viewing will be possible for NBC subscribers, with 1,000 hours of live streams, all 15 sports and all 98 events covered.The Adobe Primetime initiative involves several products for the TV industry to ""incorporate digital into their content solutions,"" Helfand said. It got its public start with the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.""During the London Olympics we had the Live Extra app, the live streaming content and companion app,"" he said. But the streaming was for ""select events.""Adobe Pass is Adobe's authentication product that proves someone watching a live stream of video is a registered customer of a pay-TV (cable, telco or satellite) provider. During the London Olympics in 2012 it verified more than 88 million streams to U.S. viewers, which Adobe at the time called the highest number recorded for a single event in TV Everywhere history.Now, Helfand says, it will automatically recognize users from their IP (Internet protocol) address once they've initially logged in at home. He calls it a ""major advancement,"" noting that Adobe is ""putting the authentication on the device so it happens at device level, not IP level.""Adobe also is doing some work with the Microsoft (MSFT) Windows Azure cloud platform service ""to provide scale and reliability for an event of this size,"" Helfand said.Since the London Olympics, he says, gaming consoles have become the fastest-growing video consumption device, and smaller screens are gaining momentum — that is, after a lot of tablet and smartphone viewing has ramped up.Apple's (AAPL) mobile iOS operating system is still the main viewing platform beyond the television for TV Everywhere, according to Adobe stats, with a 50% share, followed by PCs at 21% and Apple's Mac operating system at 7%, though viewing on Google (GOOG) Android-powered devices is rising rapidly.""We're really seeing an increase in mobile as a channel for content, and sports is the No. 1 content type for TV Everywhere,"" Helfand said.Viewing on devices of all types of content grew 440% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2013, he notes.

1654,ADBE,"Microsoft on Tuesday unveiled its third-generation Surface tablet, a device it hopes will sell as a replacement for notebook computers.While tablets have been billed for a few years as laptop PC replacements, the truth is that most tablet owners still use notebooks as well, Panos Panay, corporate vice president of Microsoft (MSFT) Surface, said at a press event in New York City.Usability trade-offs have kept tablets from replacing notebooks, he said. Panay noted how 96% of Apple (AAPL) iPad owners also own notebook computers.The new Surface Pro 3 tablet features a bigger screen, an improved attachable keyboard and a digital pen for making handwritten notes and drawings on screen.The new tablet will be available for pre-order on Wednesday starting at $799. The optional Surface Pro Type cover costs $129.99. The Surface Pro 3 will be in stores on June 20 in the U.S. and Canada, the company said.Microsoft needed to try something different to compete against tablet leaders Apple and Samsung, FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.Positioning the Surface Pro 3 as a laptop replacement ""gives Microsoft a more unique selling feature than being another 'me too' tablet product,"" Ives said. ""Strategically they are definitely taking a different direction.""Because the third-generation Surface Pro, with keyboard cover, costs $830 at a minimum, Microsoft has to position the device against high-end laptops like Apple's MacBook Air, Gartner analyst Mike Silver said.He points out that Microsoft's two earlier Pro tablets also were pitched as laptop replacements. But the tech giant is now ""being bolder about how they communicate that,"" Silver said.Microsoft appears to be targeting enterprise and business users with the Surface Pro 3. At the press event, the company showed usage scenarios for architects and creative professionals.Buyers Include BMW, CokeCompanies such as BMW Group and Coca-Cola (KO) have already committed to purchasing and deploying the device inside their organizations, Microsoft said.Microsoft also is selling a desktop docking station and keyboard that costs $199.99 and targets office workers.The Surface Pro 3 runs on fourth-generation Intel (INTC) Core processors. The tablet is 0.36-inch thin and weighs 1.76 pounds. It boasts up to nine hours of Web-browsing battery life.The basic model comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM, 64 GB of flash storage and Intel's Core i3 processor. Microsoft is selling five configurations of the Surface Pro 3. The top-of-the-line model costs $1,949 and comes with 8 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage and Intel's i7 chip.Like its predecessors, the Surface Pro 3 can double as a tablet and notebook. It features a more rigid dockable keyboard and adjustable screen kickstand that will allow for laptop typing, something that was difficult with earlier models.The keyboard's trackpad was enlarged and improved as well.Plus, the device features a special pen for writing digital ink on documents, editing photos and other tasks where pen input is preferable.The Surface Pro 3 has a 12-inch screen; the previous model had a 10.6-inch display. The new screen is 38% bigger than Surface Pro 2, with 50% more pixels.""Ladies and gentlemen, this is the tablet that can replace your laptop — the Surface Pro 3,"" Panay said as he held up the ultrathin, lightweight device.A key application of the new tablet is to replace an analog pen and notepad. Clicking the top of the special pen commands the Surface tablet to turn on with a OneNote writing surface displayed.Click the Surface Pen again, and the note is synced to the Internet cloud via Microsoft's OneDrive.The software leader's executives also demonstrated using the pen to do a New York Times crossword puzzle app and to edit images in Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Photoshop.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke at the press event about how Surface hardware is part of the company's ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy.Microsoft released its first-generation Surface tablets in October 2012. The first Pro configuration came out in February 2013.Microsoft came out with its second generation Surface tablets in October 2013.""They're hoping the third time will be the charm,"" Ives said.The first two waves of Surface tablets barely put a dent in the tablet market, which is dominated by Apple's iPad and Google (GOOGL) Android-based devices.Not discussed at Tuesday's press event were any new consumer Surface RT tablets or a rumored mini tablet.

1729,ADBE,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the graphic design software maker to earn 57 cents a share excluding items, on sales of $1.1 billion, in the November quarter. That would represent year-over-year declines of 15% and 4%, respectively.

1738,ADBE,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) late Tuesday missed Wall Street targets for fiscal Q3, but results were hurt by the company's faster-than-expected transition to an Internet cloud-based business.
"
1739,ADBE,"Adobe ended the August quarter with 1.03 million paid subscribers to its Creative Cloud business, an increase of 331,000 subscribers and up 47% over the fiscal Q2 total.

1741,ADBE,"Adobe shares were up 5.5% in after-hours trading Tuesday, after it released the results.
"
1742,ADBE,"The move to software accessed via the Internet ""cloud"" holds the promise of higher lifetime revenue per customer, as users switch to a monthly subscription fee rather than buying software products outright and using them indefinitely. But the company's top and bottom lines will take a short-term hit as customers stop buying perpetual license software, executives say.
"
1743,ADBE,"""Our customers are overwhelmingly choosing subscriptions instead of perpetual model licenses, which is accelerating our business model transition,"" Adobe Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said. ""During Q3, 41% of our revenue was recurring and we exited the quarter with record deferred revenue on our balance sheet. These results are building a stronger, more predictable revenue model for Adobe, which will drive higher long-term growth.""

1744,ADBE,"The San Jose, Calif.-based maker of design and marketing software earned 32 cents a share minus items in the quarter ended Aug. 30.

"
1745,ADBE,"The Q3 results marked the fourth quarter in a row that Adobe's earnings per share have fallen on a year-to-year basis and third straight quarter of declining sales.
"
1746,ADBE,"The declines are expected to continue in the current quarter.

1754,ADBE,"The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.3%. The Nasdaq added less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 split the difference, up 0.2%.
"
1755,ADBE,"Volume was mixed on the stock market today, up 5% on the Nasdaq and 8% lower on the NYSE, compared to trade at the same time Monday.
"
1756,ADBE,"The top-line number in the Commerce Department's May durable goods report showed a 1.8% decline and a downward revision to April's number to minus 1.5%. Economists had forecast a more mild 0.6% slip. The bulk of the miss was apparently due to a sharp decline in aircraft orders during the month. Minus transportation, durable goods orders rose 0.5% — in line with expectations. So far this year, durable goods orders are running 2.2% below last year's January to May period.
"
1757,ADBE,"Housing prices improved steadily in May, lifting the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index 0.3%. That increase was equal to March's increase but just below consensus forecasts for a 0.4% gain. Year over year, the index is up 5.3%.
"
1758,ADBE,"New home sales popped in May to an annualized rate of 546,000, according to the Commerce Department. That was up from April's (upwardly revised) 534,000 pace, well above consensus expectations of 525,000 and the strongest number since Feb. 2008.
"
1759,ADBE,"A bit less rosy was the preliminary June manufacturing estimate from researcher Markit. Its Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index was at 53.4, down from May's 53.8 number and below forecasts for an increase to 54.2. The number points to a third month of slowing activity and is the gauge's weakest gain in 18 months.

1761,ADBE,"Darden Restaurants (DRI) rose 3% to lead the S&P 500 by a wide margin.

The stock popped to a new high, paring some gains but holding just above a cup-base buy point of 70.48.
"
1762,ADBE,"Citrix Systems (CTXS) pecked out a 2% gain, the best increase among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The Fort Lauderdale-headquartered software developer is still in buying range, 4% above a 69.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.
"
1763,ADBE,"Among leaders, most of the IBD 50 list posted modest gains and losses — with a couple of dramatic exceptions.
"
1764,ADBE,"Ambarella (AMBA) led the list with a 9% rebound. The stock tumbled 21% Monday, following a short-seller's report on Friday that questioned the stock's valuation. The stock remains extended after a mid-May rebound from 10-week support and is well above its 10-week moving average.
"
1765,ADBE,"At the bottom of the group, burger joint Sonic (SONC) dived 11% in massive trade. Fiscal third quarter sales and profits met consensus expectations, but full-year earnings guidance didn't.

Minus transportation, durable goods orders rose 0.5% — in line with expectations. So far this year, durable goods orders are running 2.2% below last year's January to May period.Housing prices improved steadily in May, lifting the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index 0.3%. That increase was equal to March's increase but just below consensus forecasts for a 0.4% gain. Year over year, the index is up 5.3%.New home sales popped in May to an annualized rate of 546,000, according to the Commerce Department. That was up from April's (upwardly revised) 534,000 pace, well above consensus expectations of 525,000 and the strongest number since Feb. 2008.A bit less rosy was the preliminary June manufacturing estimate from researcher Markit. Its Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index was at 53.4, down from May's 53.8 number and below forecasts for an increase to 54.2. The number points to a third month of slowing activity and is the gauge's weakest gain in 18 months.In stocks, it was a good morning for Florida-based companies.Darden Restaurants (DRI) rose 3% to lead the S&P 500 by a wide margin.

The stock popped to a new high, paring some gains but holding just above a cup-base buy point of 70.48.Citrix Systems (CTXS) pecked out a 2% gain, the best increase among Nasdaq 100 stocks.

The stock tumbled 21% Monday, following a short-seller's report on Friday that questioned the stock's valuation. The stock remains extended after a mid-May rebound from 10-week support and is well above its 10-week moving average.At the bottom of the group, burger joint Sonic (SONC) dived 11% in massive trade. Fiscal third quarter sales and profits met consensus expectations, but full-year earnings guidance didn't. The sell-off stopped at a test of the stock's 10-week moving average, seriously damaging efforts to shape a three-month cup base.

1812,ADBE,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move, with the stock up 8.8% over the past month. INTU hit a new 52-week-high of $213.76 in the previous session. Intuit has gained 35.3% since the start of the year compared to the 9.3% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 17.4% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 22, 2018, Intuit reported EPS of $4.82 vs.the Zacks Consensus of $4.67 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.91%.For the current fiscal year, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $5.53 per share on $5.93 billion in revenues. This represents a 25.4% change in EPS on a 14.51% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.52 per share on $6.51 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 17.96% and 9.88%, respectively.Valuation MetricsIntuit may be at a 52-week-high right now, but what might the future hold for INTU? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Intuit has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 38.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 44.9X versus its peer group's average of 25.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.38. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Intuit currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Intuit passes the test. Thus, it seems as though INTU shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Intuit Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Intuit have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Verint Systems (VRNT  -  Free Report), SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report), and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Computer-Software industry is in the top 29% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for INTU, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

1813,ADBE,"Growth stocks can be some of the most exciting picks in the market, as these high-flyers can captivate investors’ attention, and produce big gains as well. However, they can also lead on the downside when the growth story is over, so it is important to find companies which are still seeing strong growth prospects in their businesses.One such company that might be well-positioned for future earnings growth is Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report). This firm, which is in the Computer - Software industry, saw EPS growth of 43.2% last year, and is looking great for this year too.In fact, the current growth estimate for this year calls for earnings-per-share growth of 53.6%. Furthermore, the long-term growth rate is currently an impressive 16.2%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul.Adobe Systems Incorporated Price and Consensus Adobe Systems Incorporated Price and Consensus | Adobe Systems Incorporated QuoteAnd if this wasn’t enough, the stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 3.6%. Thanks to this rise in earnings estimates, ADBE has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which further underscores the potential for outperformance in this company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.So, if you are looking for a fast-growing stock that is still seeing plenty of opportunities on the horizon, make sure to consider ADBE.

1814,ADBE,"The Computer Software industry is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation demand environment.Software has become the focal point of technological innovation. The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT), consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.Moreover, continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) presents significant growth opportunity for industry players.Notably, the cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems.Additionally, the increasing need to secure cloud platforms, amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking, continues to drive demand for cyber security software.Further, as enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments (emergence of hybrid cloud), application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance. This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud-based environments.Industry Returns PositiveRobust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth. These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry’s growth prospects.The Zacks Computer Software Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.One-Year Price PerformanceWhile the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.7% and 19.2%, respectively.We believe the near-term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement.Stretched Valuation a ConcernHowever, the Computer Software industry’s valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.65, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.14 and the median level is 18.28.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M) Moreover, a comparison of the group’s P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector’s forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.71 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M) Improving Earnings Outlook to Drive OutperformanceNevertheless, strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top-line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of $3.13 per share reflects solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late.Price and Consensus: Zacks Computer Software IndustryLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2.6% upward since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it at the top 25% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks.Long-Term Growth Prospects StrongThe long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11.89%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate Computer Software’s long-term growth prospects are alluring. Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models, rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools, the proliferation of wearables & self-driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry.Moreover, the growing usage of Internet of Things (IoT) at home, in office, for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver. These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016.  Moreover, another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group’s gross margin. Bottom LineThe role of software is evolving. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure. Moreover, the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition.SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate. Moreover, strong spending by enterprises is a positive.Moreover, software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions.Despite stretched valuations, investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above-mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook.Here, we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)ANSYS, Inc. (ANSS  -  Free Report): The stock of this Pittsburgh, PA-based engineering simulation software and services provider has jumped 45.1% over the past year.

(CTXS  -  Free Report): The consensus EPS estimate for this Fort Lauderdale-based virtualization, networking and cloud computing solutions provider has moved 8.2% higher for the current year, over the last 60 days. The stock has rallied 32.4% over the past year.Price and Consensus: CTXS Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report): The stock of this San Jose-based electronic product designing solutions provider has jumped 31.8% over the past year.

1815,ADBE,"Shares of Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late, and even crafted a 52-week high of $210.85 yesterday. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s outstanding third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, encouraging fourth-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 10.5% since it reported fiscal third-quarter results on May 22. The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Intuit has rallied 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17%.The company’s results in the last reported quarter benefited from a number of reasons. Management was particularly positive about a successful tax season backed by performance of the DIY category and higher average revenue per return. The company also managed to gain some additional share in the DIY market. Additionally, the shift in its product mix toward the higher end of the company’s product line was also a positive.Intuit has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.8%. Backed by the impressive results, the company issued upbeat outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal.Factors Driving Intuit’s Robust Quarterly PerformancesThe company has two main products — QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income-tax preparation products and services. Notably, Intuit has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the past several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base, which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its rich product portfolio, Intuit has capitalized well on this opportunity which is well reflected in its previous quarterly results.For fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal fourth quarter with a subscriber base of 3.223 million, marking 45.2% year-over-year improvement.The year-over-year increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues, going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.The company’s Consumer Tax segment revenue has been benefiting from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.Intuit’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The company, during the last earnings conference call, stated that its TurboTax Live offering witnessed success in the first season and is likely to be accretive to the company’s Consumer business, moving ahead.The recently-launched Turbo offering that provides a snapshot of a user’s financial health also witnessed healthy adoption, which is yet another catalyst for expansion of the company’s business beyond tax.Furthermore, its TurboTax products derive high margins which are likely to cushion Intuit’s bottom-line results.A Buy Rated StockIntuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and flaunts a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price.Consequently, we believe the stock has huge potential to surge higher and therefore, investors should consider it for near-term opportunities.Some Other Stocks Worth ConsideringSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term expected EPS growth rates for Adobe, Cadence Design and Citrix Systems are 16.2%, 12% and 9.1%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

1819,ADBE,"Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.Today I want to tell you about a special video I made for my subscribers at Zacks.com. I titled it The 3 Rules of a Bull Market because, at the risk of over-simplifying, I wanted to crystallize my favorite principles, earned over 25 years of experience in good markets and bad, into lessons for all future bull markets.My hope is that this video becomes a teaching tool for investors age 8 to 88 because its lessons will certainly stand the test of time in the next bull market, and the one after that too.I also took half of this podcast to do a quasi review of a new book titled How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain by neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett. More on that coming up.When I talk to investors about the stock market this year, I still hear all the reasons that it's time to be cautious and the end is near.But all my experience tells me differently. And while I have often thought this year that the market must be in its 6th or 7th inning, I have few fundamental reasons to believe that it couldn't keep making new highs for another two to three years.So as I look back at the portfolios and the body of content I've created over the years to help investors profit, I wondered if I could simplify the message even further.I often prefer not to over-simplify, leaning instead toward parsing out the complexities and nuances of economic matters.But my work does have the same persistent themes. And so I realized, I could very easily crystallize them into 3 rules, and just ten words total.In the video that accompanies this article, I go back over some of those messages from the past nine years of this bull market.Then I summarize them all with my ""3 Rules.""In the video, I also promise some useful links...For a review of my latest fundamental update on BABA in case you missed it, here was my May ZU Strategy Session presentation. It's the last clip at minute 44:20...May ZUSS: Top Stock Pick BABA at 44:20Even then after awesome earnings and growth guidance, I reminded investors ""If you can get in under $200, do it!""The Moral of the Bull's StoryGot a minute?I can think of no better way to quickly sum up the moral of this story than with a 1-minute video I recorded last year over at the CBOE. TV host Angela Miles asked me for my favorite ""trader's tip"" and I knew instantly that if I only had a minute to share with thousands of investors, I would choose this one core idea...Follow the Smart MoneyFinally, here was the message I offered on Tracey Ryniec's MarketEdge podcast back in January...Cooker’s Melt-Up RecipeThree ingredients for a ""melt-up recipe"" that investors can profit from.1. Multiple Expansion Is Under Control: We may be in the 6th inning of this bull market, but multiple expansion isn’t yet as high as it was at the peak of other bull rallies like 1999-2000. There could still be plenty more upside to go.2. Competition: There’s less stock and more investors. Additionally, Wall Street, unlike most retail investors, has to buy, but doesn’t have to sell.3. No global macro worries: Whatever happened to the Eurozone crisis or China having a hard landing? For the first time in a decade, the global economy is in sync and growing at the same time with virtually no economic crises looming.(end of excerpt from MarketEdge podcast)Granted, the market headed into a 10% correction right after that on new global-macro worries about a trade war. But I also warned Zacks Ultimate members about the temporary ""exuberance"" in stocks 2 weeks prior.So trade-war anxiety was a good, albeit surprising, antidote to wring out some excess bullishness. It's all part of the short-term swings of extreme optimism and pessimism in markets and very healthy overall.And despite my long-term bullishness, I'm always ready with ""dry powder"" for a pullback to buy more of my favorite stocks.The Chemistry and Culture of EmotionSince I began the Mind Over Money podcast in November of 2016, I have frequently read from books by two different groups of scientists that form the foundation of my knowledge about human psychology in markets and beyond.The first group is, of course, the behavioral theorists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely who have helped create the field of behavioral economics, and its smaller niches in finance and trading.The second group is composed of the neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio, John Ratey, and Candace Pert (discoverer of the opiate receptor) who have taught me much about the latest discoveries in the structure and function of our incredibly complex brains.I just started reading the new book by Lisa Feldman Barrett, PhD, this week and I offer some initial reactions on the podcast. Dr. Barrett is a University Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University, with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.In addition to the book How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain, Dr. Barrett has published over 200 peer-reviewed, scientific papers appearing in Science, Nature Neuroscience, and other top journals in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, as well as six academic volumes published by Guilford Press. She has also given a popular TED talk.Dr. Barrett received a National Institutes of Health Director’s Pioneer Award for her revolutionary research on emotion in the brain. These highly competitive, multimillion dollar awards are given to scientists of exceptional creativity who are expected to transform biomedical and behavioral research.Despite my natural attraction and openness to any book about the brain, I actually had some initial reactions of resistance and confusion when I first started reading the introduction. Dr. Barrett's ""point of attack"" seemed to be on the cultural and even scientific misconceptions about how emotions are created.After reading nearly two dozen books by other neuroscientists, I guess I assumed that much of the confusion had already been cleared up. But at 320 pages, with a 45-page bibliography and 40+ pages of notes, the book appears to offer several months of instruction and insight.And so I am more than willing to give the expert the benefit of the doubt as I dive in this summer.Be sure to check out the full podcast to hear me read a few paragraphs from the book and offer my amateur observations, whatever those are worth.And don't forget to watch my video The 3 Rules of a Bull Market and to share it with friends and fellow investors you know, be they anywhere from 8 to 88!Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA, LRCX, and BABA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.

There could still be more upside to go.2. Competition: There’s less stock and more investors. Additionally, Wall Street, unlike most retail investors, has to buy, but doesn’t have to sell.3. No global macro worries: Whatever happened to the Eurozone crisis or China having a hard landing? For the first time in a decade, the global economy is in sync and growing at the same time with virtually no economic crises looming.(end of excerpt from MarketEdge podcast)Granted, the market headed into a 10% correction right after that.

1821,ADBE,"Amid the trade tensions between the United States and its key allies, investors continued to pour money into fast-growing companies, pushing the Nasdaq Composite Index to new highs for the second consecutive day since Mar 13. In fact, it has been outperforming the other major large cap indices by a wide margin on a year-to-date basis.   The strength in the technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, helped Nasdaq surge on a gain of 10.6% this year compared with gains of 0.3% for the Dow Jones and 2.8% for the S&P 500. Most of the rally was driven by the resurgence of the FAAMNG stocks and the strength in chipmakers, thanks to robust earnings, a rising interest rate scenario and solid demand for cutting-edge technology.Notably, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) are setting new milestones in recent trading sessions.

1822,ADBE,"This year, the Nasdaq Composite has been the best-performing among the top three U.S. indices with year-to-date returns of 8.6%, which trumped the Dow Jones’ flat return and the S&P 500’s 1.9% gains. Maintaining the winning trend, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index hit another record high of 7,606.46 on Jun 4, 2018.FANGs Rebound to All-Time High on Compelling ValuationFANGs suffered in Marchthanks to Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) data breach reports and the consequent apprehensions over stricter regulations in the social media space.Nvidia NVDA’s announcement that it will suspend self-driving car tests on public roads, short-selling pressure on Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and insane valuation of Netflix also hit the tech space hard in March.

1824,ADBE,"Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) is set to acquire cloud-based e-commerce content management system (CMS) software provider Magento for $1.68 billion. The company offers software for developing and operating web stores, handling online purchases, shipping and returns.Magento generated revenues of almost $150 million in 2017. However, due to purchase accounting rules, Adobe will not be able to recognize most of the company’s revenues over the next 12-months. This is expected to hurt the bottom line in fiscal 2018.Magento Improves Adobe’s Competitive ProwessNevertheless, we believe Magento takeover will improve Adobe’s competitive position in the e-commerce marketing market, which is currently dominated by salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Notably, salesforce has become a dominant player primarily due to its 2016 acquisition of Demandware, a cloud-based provider of e-commerce services to big as well as small businesses.Moreover, the buyout strengthens Adobe’s presence in the CMS segment of the e-commerce market and intensifies competition for Shopify (SHOP  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. No doubt, shares of the Canadian company declined more than 3% in pre-market trading.Notably, Adobe shares have returned 70.6% in the past year, while Shopify gained 60.5%. Further, the acquisition will boost Adobe’s competitive position against Wix.com (WIX  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #3 stock. The company offers ready templates, and drag-and-drop editor to make web stores look professional without any design experience.Wix declined almost 4% to close at $85.50 on May 21.

Moreover, Magento supports $155 billion in gross merchandise volume and has a strong clientele that adds to Adobe’s customer base, per Bloomberg data.Moreover, the acquisition increases Adobe’s total addressable market (TAM) by an estimated $13 billion.Currently, Adobe carries a Zacks Rank #3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1825,ADBE,"After nearly a decade of underperformance, big investors like Bill Ackman, George Soros, Carl Icahn, David Tepper, Larry Robbins, Leon Cooperman, Daniel Loeb, David Einhorn and Stanley Druckenmiller have managed to beat the broad market index this year. The group, often known as hedge funds and one that shifts composition from time to time, gained 0.39% through April as measured by the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index against the loss of 0.38% for the S&P 500.As the top holdings from the latest 13-F filing are out, we take a glimpse at the ideas and holdings of the hedge funds that led them to outperform in the first quarter. Investors mulling over investing like billionaires could consider the ETFs that resemble their ideas.Technology Remains a Hot SpotHedge Fund “Hot Dogs,"" which are defined as stocks that capture the maximum hedge-fund dollars, centers around the technology, media and Internet sectors. Topping the list is FANG stocks, acronym for Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), which lost their charm in March, slipping into deep correction territory (down more than 10% from its latest peak) (read: Should You Buy Beaten Down FANG ETFs Ahead of Q1 Earnings?).The beaten down prices have encouraged big investors to buy more shares of these stocks given their compelling valuation and encouraging fundamentals. In particular, hedge funds owned $19.4 billion in FB, $12.2 billion in AMZN, $8.5 billion in NFLX and $18.9 billion in GOOGL. FANG-based ETFs, namely PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio (PNQI  -  Free Report) and First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN  -  Free Report) could be a compelling choice for investors. PNQI with a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) has the largest 32.8% share in this group, followed by 28.2% in FDN, which has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) remains the beloved stock of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway as it purchased an additional 75 million shares in the iPhone maker in the first quarter, raising its stake to $44 billion or 5%. However, Bloomberg noted that institutional investors abandoned Apple at a rate not seen since 2008. As such, Apple dropped from the eighth position to the 18th on the list. In order to avoid single-stock risk, investors could look at iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW  -  Free Report), which has top 17.2% exposure in Apple and a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (read: Let Your Portfolio Mirror Buffett's With These ETF Strategies).  Software companies like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts EA also gained hedge funds’ love with investments of $16.4 billion, $6.6 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. Visa V and MasterCard MA are also among the top 20 holdings with investments of $8.2 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively.Combining the top 20 hedge fund holdings in the tech sector, iShares North American Tech ETF (IGM  -  Free Report) looks like a perfect choice. The fund offers exposure to electronics, computer software and hardware, and informational technology companies and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2.Risk aggressive investors’ could focus on BMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN FNGU that could generate outsized gains in a short span. The note seeks to offer three times leveraged exposure to the NYSE FANG Index, which is an equal-dollar weighted index targeting the highly-traded growth stocks of the next-generation technology and tech-enabled companies in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. The ETN is up 12.7% over the past one month (read: 5 Leveraged ETFs That Soared More Than 20% in April).Healthcare Gains LoveBesides technology, healthcare is the second top choice of the hedge funds with bets on insurers like UnitedHealth Group UNH and Anthem ANTM. The move came due to the steep decline in their share prices after Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon announced a joint venture to curb medical costs. The pharmacy benefits managers Express Scripts ESRX and CVS Health Corp CVS also became friends of hedge fund managers as their stock price tumbled on speculation that Amazon could enter that business.As such, waves of mergers and acquisitions have been heating up in the healthcare space that could change the landscape of healthcare business. This is especially true given that health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF XHS could well mimic this hedge funds strategy. IHF provides exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment, while XHS targets health care distributors, health care facilities, health care services and managed health care. IHF has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and XHS has a Zacks ETF Rank #2.Small Caps Regain FervorWith small-cap stocks on a tear lately, as evident by the Russell 2000 Index’s new records, many might want to invest like billionaires in this space too. Although the hedge fund’s small-cap space is dominated by the health care sector, the top two stocks, Green Brick Partners Inc. GRBK and Mammoth Energy Services Inc. TUSK, based on ownership value as a percentage of market cap does not belong to healthcare.The next are the three health-care companies, namely Genomic Health GHDX, Zogenix ZGNX and Retrophin RTRX, which showed that hedge funds had a 48% or greater ownership of the stock as a percentage of market cap. In particular, hedge funds added exposure to small-cap biotech companies like PTC Therapeutics PTCT, Pacira Pharmaceuticals PCRX, Strongbridge Biopharma SBBP, and Corium International CORI in the first quarter (read: 5 Market-Beating Small-Cap ETFs Trading at New Highs).Given this, small-cap ETFs focused on the healthcare sector look intriguing. PowerShares S&P SmallCap Healthcare Fund PSCH and ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF SBIO are the biggest gainers in the healthcare as well as small-cap space, rising about 27% and 14%, respectively.

1829,ADBE,"Voxeljet AG (VJET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 17.The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, having missed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a negative earnings surprise of 33.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayVoxeljet’s first-quarter 2018 results are likely to benefit from its cost-saving initiatives. Also, the company’s large scale service centers globally, including the opened subsidiaries in China and India, are expected to bolster growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Voxeljet experienced improvement in revenues from its American and Chinese service centers. This upside was driven by increased market penetration in the respective regions and growing customer base.Revenues from the company’s Services segment also showed signs of improvement in fourth-quarter 2017. Evidently, the metric increased 26.5% to €2.9 million from €2.3 million in the year-ago period. Voxeljet’s gross profit and gross profit margin too increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We believe that improved operational execution is likely to drive the company’s bottom-line performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.This apart, Voxeljet’s solid investment in core R&D to maintain its position as a technology leader in 3D printing bodes well for upcoming quarters.However, over the past couple of years, the 3D printing industry has been suffering from a prolonged decline in demand for 3D printers. Revenues from the company’s System segment (including sales of 3D printers) declined 20% to €3.1 million in fourth-quarter 2017 from €3.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The waning demand for printers has added to the company’s concerns, which might reflect poorly on the coming quarterly results.Furthermore, Voxeljet has been suffering from a decline in total backlog of 3D printer orders over the past few quarters. For instance, the company’s total backlogs dropped 26.8% in fourth-quarter 2017 compared with its level at the end of 2016. Other headwinds, including inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity prices vagaries have also marred the performance of several companies in the industry. We expect Voxeljet’s first-quarter 2018 results to be adversely affected by these factors.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Voxeljet this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Voxeljet has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 12 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.voxeljet AG Price and EPS Surprise voxeljet AG Price and EPS Surprise | voxeljet AG QuoteZacks Rank: The company has a Zacks Rank #3. This, combined with the company’s ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Adobe Systems Inc.

1838,ADBE,"Shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) jumped nearly 4% through early afternoon trading Tuesday to hit yet another new all-time high as investors continue to ride the software firm’s post-Q1 earnings wave.Latest ResultsAdobe, which makes editing programs such as Photoshop and Premiere, posted record first quarter revenues of $2.08 billion last week. This figure also marked 24% growth from the year-ago period. Furthermore, Adobe’s adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company did not provide updated guidance for the rest of the year, but it previously announced that it expects to post full-year revenues of $8.73 billion. Adobe also noted that it expects the new Republican tax law will have a positive impact on its business.“The new Tax Act is lowering Adobe’s effective tax rates, driving a significant increase in our earnings per share targets,"" CFO Mark Garrett said in a statement. “With ready access to our offshore cash, we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities to grow our business and we are actively expanding our campuses in the Bay Area and Utah to accommodate the growth of our employee base.”Looking Ahead It seems clear that Adobe’s most-recent quarter pleased investors, but this positivity won’t last forever unless there are growth metrics that support the company’s new price tag. Based on a quick look at the latest top and bottom line projections, Adobe does indeed look ready to continue its expansion.Adobe’s Q2 revenues are projected to surge 21.3% to reach $2.15 billion, while the firm’s full-year sales are expected to climb at a similar rate to hit $8.78 billion. It also looks like Adobe’s new lower effective tax rate is in fact set to boost earnings right away.The company is projected to see its quarterly earnings skyrocket 50%, while its fiscal 2018 EPS figure is expected soar by 45.9% to reach 6.29 per share.Adobe has also recently earned a large number of estimate revisions for its current quarter, next quarter, and the current year, with 100% agreement to the upside. Investors should note that Adobe has matched or topped earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters, including a 9% average surprise in the trailing four periods.This stretch of beats mostly likely means that Adobe does everything in its power to post the best earnings to please its shareholders. Looking ahead, the company might have an even easier time doing so if its effective tax rate stays down.Bottom Line Adobe made it clear that it plans to spend money to expand, and the firm recently highlighted the growth of one of its newer segments, Document Cloud. But Adobe’s bread and butter creative suite is a high margin business that allows it to return money to investors. Adobe is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports a “B” grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Just last year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1847,ADBE,"Shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) climbed over 2.2% to hit a new all-time high on Wednesday, roughly one week before the company is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results.With no big news to speak of, it seems that investors are simply showing their confidence ahead of the company’s upcoming Q1 report—and with good reason. Before today’s jump, shares of Adobe had skyrocketed nearly 77% over the last year and almost 23% in the last 12 weeks.The recent confidence stems in part from the company’s record-setting Q4. Adobe’s revenues surged 25% year over year to hit $2.01 billion, while its full-year sales of $7.30 billion also marked a new high. Adobe also raised its fiscal 2018 guidance at the time.Then, in late January, Adobe announced that the new Republican tax law would have a positive impact on the company and its investors. Adobe set a new 2018 revenue projection of $8.725 billion.“The new Tax Act is lowering Adobe’s effective tax rates, driving a significant increase in our earnings per share targets,"" CFO Mark Garrett said in statement. “With ready access to our offshore cash, we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities to grow our business and we are actively expanding our campuses in the Bay Area and Utah to accommodate the growth of our employee base.”These growth projections seem to be reflected in Adobe’s current Q1 estimates. The San Jose, California-headquartered company is expected to see its earnings skyrocket 52% year over year, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of that, the company’s first-quarter sales are projected to reach $2.04 billion, which would mark a 21.4% surge. For the current full year, Adobe’s bottom line is expected to climb nearly 43% to hit $6.16 per share.Adobe has also recently earned a large number of estimate revisions for its current quarter, next quarter, current year, and following year earnings, with 100% agreement to the upside. Investors should note that Adobe has matched or topped earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters, including a 9% average surprise in each of the trailing four periods.On top of all of this, Adobe’s EPS figure is expected to expand at an annualized rate of 16% over the next three to five years, which is solid for a company of its size and age.

1848,ADBE,"Infosys Limited (INFY  -  Free Report) recently announced that Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) has selected the company to provide information technology (IT) infrastructure management services. The world’s biggest manufacturing company of fully automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Allison Transmission, will leverage Infosys’ proprietary artificial intelligence platform, Nia, which would enable the former to meet increasing global technology requirements.Notably, Nia will assist the company to install a new software command center for Allison Transmission. This will lead to superior management of technology processes and physical assets, thus enabling Allison Transmission to achieve agility and efficiency.Existing Business ScenarioOver the past few quarters, Infosys had collaborated with many biggies for fortifying its portfolio and market share. In fact, Nia, the company’s integrated AI platform, is helping to accelerate the pace of technology adoption. Currently, Nia has over more than 200 engagements across 100 clients.Also, as of now, cyber security is proving to be one of the company’s prominent profit churners. Further, robust performance by the data analytics, testing and enterprise system segments signals at the bright prospects ahead.Meanwhile, the company has been witnessing robust momentum in software and services business under the “New” initiative. Also, the company continues to renew traditional services and rolled out others in areas such as Cloud Ecosystem, Big Data and Analytics, which in turn is boosting its top-line performance.This apart, the company has been strengthening core competencies by pursuing strategic collaborations and acquisitions. Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 14.9% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 8.4%. Despite these positives, rapid proliferation of customizable internet-based software has been hampering Infosys’ traditional outsourcing business. Most clients now prefer to seek service delivery through digital technology, thus adding to the company’s woes. Moreover, management believes that economic conditions in many of its markets remain quite challenging that might weigh on the company’s profitability, going ahead.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Badger Meter, Inc.

1849,ADBE,"Shares of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) have gained 31.8% in a year’s time, outperforming the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry’s rally of 13.5%.Let’s take a look into the factors responsible for the impressive price performance and see if the company can add new feathers to its cap.Last month, Motorola reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. The metrics also increased on a year-over-year basis. Results were driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.In fact, the company's growth-by-acquisition strategy, which has broadened its product portfolio is encouraging. In sync with this objective, Motorola entered into an agreement with Avigilon to acquire the latter in an all-cash transaction. Per the agreement, Motorola will purchase all of Avigilon’s outstanding shares for CAD $27 per share.Motorola’s efforts to reward its investors through dividend payments and buybacks are also impressive. Evidently, the company bought back shares worth $125 million and paid $76 million in dividends in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moving ahead, we expect the company to perform well backed by its robust product portfolio and growth-oriented strategies. For example, the Avigilon buyout is expected to widen Motorola’s mission-critical communications technologies portfolio.Furthermore, Motorola’s robust projections for first-quarter and full-year 2018 reflects a healthy picture. While revenues are anticipated to grow approximately 7%, adjusted earnings per share are projected between 83 cents and 88 cents in the first quarter of 2018. For 2018, the company expects the top line to improve roughly 5% while the bottom line is envisioned in the $6.50-$6.65 range.The new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is also a positive for the company. For 2018, effective tax rate is expected to come down to around 25% from 32.8% and 31% in fourth-quarter and full-year 2017, respectively.Estimate Revisions & Style Score Upward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. Motorola scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 14.7% and 15.2% upward, respectively, in the last 60 days.Additionally, the stock has a  VGM Score of A.

1851,ADBE,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has reportedly made some progress in solving its component supply woes related to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.Per Bloomberg, the iPhone-maker is set to receive its first batch of OLED screens for new iPhone model from South Korea’s LG Display Co.Apple, in order to expand its supply chain, reportedly invested more than $2 billion in LG, last year. The company is the sole supplier of OLED screen of Apple Watch.However, owing to some manufacturing problems, LG had difficulties to move into mass production of OLED screen. The company is now expected to ship 2-4 million units, initially. Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote Apple was also in talks with China’s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply OLED displays for iPhones.Notably, Apple has also been rumored to develop next-generation MicroLED screens for its own use. We believe bringing display manufacturing in house makes sense for Apple as it will no longer have to depend on others for supply of display screens.Supplier Base Expansion Good for AppleApple is expected to launch three iPhone models this year, two out of which — a 5.8-inch second-generation iPhone X and a larger 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus — are expected to come with OLED displays. The low-cost third one is likely to be a 6.1-inch LCD (liquid crystal display) variant.Moreover, Apple is reportedly planning to use OLED display panels in all three new iPhone models planned for next year.In such a scenario, the expanding supplier base not only reduces Apple’s dependence on Samsung, its sole supplier of OLED screens, but also improves bargaining power in terms of pricing.Higher OLED procurement cost has been primarily blamed for iPhone X’s exorbitant starting price of $1,000. Per KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s estimates, Apple pays Samsung in the range of $120-$130 per unit. This is significantly higher than iPhone 7 Plus’5.5-inch LCD, which costs $45 to $55 per unit.The highly anticipated device failed to generate significant demand, due to premium pricing. Apple also had to cut production, due to lack of demand.Moreover, Apple had to delay the launch of iPhone X, due to the lack of adequate number of OLED screens, which also hurt its holiday season sales. Hence, the increased volume of OLED screens will help Apple reduce the time to market for its new iPhones.However, Apple’s transition to OLED is a serious concern for its LCD screen suppliers like Japan Display and Sharp that lag in OLED production.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) and Verint Systems (VRNT  -  Free Report) are stocks worth considering in the broader Computer and Technology sector.

1852,ADBE,"The technology sector, which has showed its immense strength against the trade and tariff threats recently on the FANG surge, has lost its ground following news of a potential curb in Chinese investment. In fact, the sector pushed Wall Street even lower on Jun 27 with the S&P 500 Technology Sector dropping 1.5% and Philadelphia semiconductor index sliding 2.5%.What Happened?The Trump administration is seeking to limit many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to that country. The Treasury Department is working on the rules to block companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in ""industrially significant technology.” The measures are expected to be announced by the end of this week and are intended to counter Beijing's Made in China 2025 strategic plan. Under this plan, China wants to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology, including robotics, aircraft and aircraft components, advanced rail equipment, electrical-generation and transmission equipment and pharmaceuticals and advanced medical devices.As such, the potential move would hurt the tech sector more broadly than just the semiconductors and hit revenues, earnings and stock prices of the tech titans having significant exposure to China.Solid OutlookHowever, the outlook for the technology sector has been encouraging. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts.Additionally, the twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher. Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.How to Buy the DipGiven encouraging long-term trends, investors could definitely tap the current dip in the stocks. While there are many stocks in the space having a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), we have highlighted six big technology names (market cap of more than $10 billion) that have seen their Rank surging to the top rank.All these are backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others and have a potential to beat the ongoing trade turmoil.

1855,ADBE,"Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings! Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul.This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PriceWe have often seen a decline in stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

Further, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.39% in the quarter.Revenues came in $2.08 billion, up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter, which was driven by increasing subscription for its cloud applications and robust demand for its innovative solutions.The stock has gained 78.0% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 36.1%.We believe that Adobe’s strong focus on customer retention by delivering innovative solutions and entry in emerging markets, which are experiencing rising demand for cloud applications, will continue to drive the top line in 2018.Currently, Adobe carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a market capital of $86.27 billion.  Growing Subscription for Cloud ProductsAdobe’s strong efforts to bolster its presence in the cloud-related software areas remain positive.

Adobe entered the subscription model with the launch of Creative Cloud (“CC”).During the first quarter, the company acquired several new creative agreements and most of them included service offering which led to the solid growth of CC. Moreover, increasing net new subscriptions for CC will continue to benefit Adobe.Additionally, the company is experiencing growing adoption of Acrobat and Adobe Sign, which is continuously contributing to the strong performance of Document Cloud (“DC”).Robust Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Advertising Cloud offerings along with emerging solutions such as Audience Manager, Campaign, Target and Media Optimizer solutions led to strong bookings across these cloud platforms.Needless to say, Adobe is benefiting from the diversification of its product portfolio which earlier consisted of only graphic design and productivity offerings.Robust Product PortfolioThe company is experiencing robust demand for its product offerings. New and innovative products like Adobe Character Animator, Spark, Lightroom CC, Dimension and XD are bringing in more customers.Also, Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects will continue to gain momentum with the rising demand for video and editing from film makers and production houses.

1862,ADBE,"Mirroring a banner 2017, this year is likely to be a great one for mega tech stocks. Big tech companies are hitting record-highs of late, with shares outpacing the S&P 500 since its nadir on Feb 8.President Trump has delivered historic relief to tech majors by lowering tax rates. This in turn is boosting profit margins. At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT), which connects various devices to the cloud, is expected to be a huge growth driver for tech majors. Given the bullishness, sound large-cap tech stocks continue to be popular among sell-side analysts.  How Did Tech Bigwigs Fare?Tech heavyweights continue to influence the U.S. stock market,  for good reason. Investing in large-cap tech stocks turned out to be a winning strategy, especially during the recent bout of gyration that sent the stock market into correction.In fact, the much-loved tech sector rallied 9% year to date, while the broader S&P 500 went up just 3.4%. Mega-sized tech names like the FAANG stocks — Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — contributed the lion’s share and recently hit intraday record highs.Amazon, in particular, jumped more than 30% since the start of the year and contributed almost fifth of the gains in the S&P 500, per Silverblatt.Sell-Side Analysts Back Big TechsSolid performance by tech bigwigs compelled sell-side analysts to root for them. These stocks are recording rapid earnings and revenue growth that forced brokerage firms to take note.Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote to investors “net buy ratings of major tech players remain extremely high relative to history.”Giant Tech Stocks to Make Billions Under Tax PlanThe Republican tax overhaul policy is providing the much-needed windfall to large tech companies. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while any income brought back from overseas is taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. This extra cash is helping the companies pursue a combination of share buybacks, dividend payouts and M&A activities.Let us not forget, tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying hefty corporate taxes on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under the latest tax reduction plan.The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force for big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest. Tech Companies to Get BiggerNotable Internet companies like Amazon and Facebook are expected to grow at a fast pace on a significant rise in revenues in the near term. They are expected to take advantage of the large number of advertisements and e-commerce that will still move online.Substantial growth in cloud computing and the IoT, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launch of complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggest that the good times for tech will keep rolling.5 Tech Behemoths to BuyBanking on the aforesaid positives, tech majors are poised to see higher earnings.

1863,ADBE,"Twilio Inc. (TWLO  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8. Notably, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in four straight quarters with an average beat of 61.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayTwilio offers multiple products which are broadly classified in three categories — Programmable Messaging, Programmable Voice and Programmable Video. The company has been witnessing tremendous demand for its programmable voice and messaging products, which is driving top-line performance. Furthermore, Twilio’s consistent efforts toward developing innovative use case products will continue to boost its revenues.Furthermore, Twilio’s strategies for expanding global footprint are commendable. The company has been continuously making investments to meet the requirements of a broader range of global developers and enterprises. Also, it is making strategic alliances and has employed more employees outside the U.S. office to enhance international operations.These efforts have paid off well for the company as evident from the rise in revenue contribution from outside the U.S. market to 16% in 2016 from 13% in 2013. The global expansion initiative is likely to drive the company’s top-line performance in the quarter.However, Uber’s strategy of managing communication services in-house will have a negative impact on Twilio’s overall prospects throughout this year. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the communications market and growing prevalence of in-app push notifications are major concerns.Twilio Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Twilio Inc.

1874,ADBE,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

1875,ADBE,"Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions. Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.A company with a favorable liquidity position always has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using cash.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always reflect the condition of a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets.

1876,ADBE,"The stock market’s tech benchmark set a new record for all-time highs in a calendar year. While Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) helped Nasdaq reach a record close, other Silicon Valley tech stocks continue to hover near the mark. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker reported blowout earnings results, while such an encouraging trend is noticeable for the entire tech sector.Some market pundits believe that tech stocks are riding the years-long economic expansion, while most of them attribute a part of this uptick to Trump administration’s pro-business policies including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.Needless to say, tech stocks are preferred by astute investors due to their proprietary technological expertise and heavy cash balances. These companies also relish high barriers to entry, which position them for faster growth in the market. Given such bullish trends, investing in some rock-solid Silicon Valley stocks for better gains seems judicious.Nasdaq Scales Record High on Apple’s SuccessThe tech-laden Nasdaq Composite trumped all records on Nov 3. The index registered its 63rd record-closing high of this year that beat the previous record of 62 highs in a calendar year. The index has also outpaced the other major indices so far this year.While the Nasdaq has rallied almost 26% on a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones gained nearly 16% and 19%, respectively, over the same period. In fact, the tech-stacked indexes’ year-to-date gains are the best since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.Stellar quarterly results from tech-bigwig Apple helped the Nasdaq scale a record high. The iPhone maker gained 2.6% and flirted with a valuation at $900 billion. The world’s most valuable company has soared 48.9% so far this year.Apple’s fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $52 billion topped analysts’ expectations. Almost half of the sales came from iPhone. Chief Executive Tim Cook declared that iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus sales were the best ever in the company’s history. Its service units that comprise iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay and Apple Care, to name a few, also raked in record-high revenues.Profits also rose to $10.71 billion, while the executives showed more optimism over the current quarter. They raised the fiscal first-quarter sales guidance from $84 billion to $87 billion. This has ward off fears related to the company’s flagship iPhone X production, priced at $1000. This is, incidentally, the most exorbitant iPhone model in the company’s history (read more: Apple Stock Pops on Q4 Earnings Beat, Strong Guidance).Blowout Tech EarningsApple isn’t the only Silicon Valley tech stock moving north this season. Better-than-expected quarterly results from other tech giants like Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) also helped drive the Nasdaq to a record high.Alphabet’s third-quarter earnings of $9.57 increased 91% sequentially and 32% year over year. Net revenues of $22.27 billion increased 6.5% sequentially and 21.9% year over year. While Google Cloud generated substantial revenue growth, it continues to enjoy strength in the mobile platform (read more: Alphabet Beats Earnings, Revenue Estimates in Q3).Microsoft reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 84 cents per share, up 16.7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $24.54 billion increased almost 12% from the year-ago quarter. The company was also successful in achieving its goal of attaining $20 billion in annualized revenues from its commercial cloud business (read more: Microsoft Q1 Earnings Beat on Strong Azure Growth).Shares of Alphabet and Microsoft climbed more than 30% so far this year. To top it, Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), eBay Inc (EBAY  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) continue to hover near record highs as the tech sector displays strength in the third-quarter earnings season.Total earnings for the tech companies’ third-quarter earnings so far are up 22.4% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 86.4% surpassing revenue estimates (read more: The Tech Sector’s Impressive Earnings Power on Display).Tax Cuts – A Major Boost to Software & Semiconductor StocksHopes of pro-business legislation promised by Trump have, mostly, supported the gains among both the manufacturers of the internal technologies — the semiconductor makers and the software industry.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States is among the worlds’ highest. This explains why most of the tech majors stash cash overseas. The proposed tax plan will lower taxes from 35% to 20%. As a result, tech companies’ after-tax earnings will improve and will lead to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for R&D and M&As.Tech players including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) have billions of dollars in cash reserves parked abroad. In fact, a Nikkei Asian Review showed that combined overseas cash reserves for such companies exceeded the Japanese government’s overall tax revenues in fiscal 2016.5 Top Silicon Valley Stocks to Buy NowInvestors, thus, should double down on the hottest Silicon Valley tech stocks after they cross one record after another on earnings strength, primarily, backed by favorable government policy.

1878,ADBE,"Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks    Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio — also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Sunnyvale, CA-based Mellanox Technologies Ltd.

1881,ADBE,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Earnings growth in the last earnings season (20018 Q1) reached its highest level in more than 7 years at +24.3% on +7.2% revenue gains.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, but the aggregate positive revision was primarily because of the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector, estimates for the quarter would be modestly down in the last 10 weeks.•    Estimates went up for the Energy, Technology and Retail sectors and went down for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, and Finance sectors.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +22.7% on +10.5% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1.•    Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues.  •    Earnings growth is expected to be in double-digit territory for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Autos and Conglomerates as the only sectors expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +30.5% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +20.5% earnings growth on +7.6% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.9% on +6.1% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.6% in 2019, and +4.4% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of June 19th, is $156.86. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $172.26 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.82 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season ExpectationsWe still have a few weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season takes center stage; that will happen with the JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) earnings releases on July 13th. Taking nothing away from the big bank results, but the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with the recent Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reports part of the 5 S&P 500 members that have reported results already.All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +134.3%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15%.  Estimates for the quarter have modestly moved up since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 7 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Autos, Construction, Consumer Staples, Finance, Aerospace, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming two periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Earnings growth in the last earnings season (20018 Q1) reached its highest level in more than 7 years at +24.3% on +7.2% revenue gains.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, but the aggregate positive revision was primarily because of the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector, estimates for the quarter would be modestly down in the last 10 weeks.•    Estimates went up for the Energy, Technology and Retail sectors and went down for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, and Finance sectors.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +22.7% on +10.5% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1.•    Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues.  •    Earnings growth is expected to be in double-digit territory for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Autos and Conglomerates as the only sectors expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +30.5% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +20.5% earnings growth on +7.6% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.9% on +6.1% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.6% in 2019, and +4.4% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of June 19th, is $156.86. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $172.26 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.82 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season ExpectationsWe still have a few weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season takes center stage; that will happen with the JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) earnings releases on July 13th. Taking nothing away from the big bank results, but the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with the recent Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reports part of the 5 S&P 500 members that have reported results already.All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +134.3%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15%.  Estimates for the quarter have modestly moved up since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 7 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Autos, Construction, Consumer Staples, Finance, Aerospace, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming two periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

1883,ADBE,"Shares of Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report) touched a 52-week high of $187.27, eventually closing a bit lower at $187.11 on Jan 10.The stock has gained 71.7% in last year, substantially outperforming the 36.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s strong fundamentals and solid quarterly results.Compelling Product LinesAcrobat is one of the company’s most successful product lines with a huge installed base of satisfied customers. A portion of the business has historically been dependent on GDP growth and it’s doing well, owing to improving economic conditions and stronger IT spending in the United States and Europe. Cloud-based EchoSign solution is also a significant contributor to Acrobat revenues.Furthermore, Adobe continues to be the market leader in the Digital Media space. Notably, the company has been witnessing robust growth across its Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud segments as evident from the record number of new subscriptions registered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Notably, the advertising, entertainment and other content-creation markets are becoming increasingly digitalized and in our opinion the company is well capitalizing on this trend.We believe that Adobe’s Creative Cloud offering, marketed as a subscription model with attractive monthly pricing, will continue to drive revenues in the coming years. Moreover, its strong guidance for the upcoming quarter due to higher demand for its Creative and Marketing Cloud products keeps us optimistic.Increased adoption of cloud computing, social media and mobile devices, as well as the emergence of big data analytics is benefiting Adobe’s Digital Marketing segment.To tap the growing opportunity in this space, Adobe has resorted to acquisitions of companies such as Neolane, Omniture, Day Software, Demdose, Auditude and Efficient Frontier. Acquisitions have helped it to provide analytics, experience management, targeting, social relevance and spend optimization.Continued InnovationAdobe is committed to adding new products to its portfolio. At Max Creativity Conference in October 2017, Adobe introduced several applications for design, video and photography segments including Adobe XD, Character Animator abd Lightroom CC.The company is also working on artificial intelligence and machine learning front. The company has invested heavily in Sensei, its artificial intelligence and machine learning framework and expects to leverage its existing offerings with it.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company’s better-than-expected quarterly results for the last several quarters have kept investors optimistic about its growth prospects. Notably, in the trailing four quarters, Adobe has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 9%.The stock has witnessed upward earnings estimate revision for the first quarter and fiscal 2018 in the last 30 days. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.26 per share, up 2 cents from $1.24 projected 30 days ago. Similarly, for fiscal 2018, the consensus estimate has moved up by 2 cents to $5.49 over the same time frame.Our TakeGiven Adobe’s dominance in the creative cloud space, its leading position in the Marketing Cloud and strong margin growth, we expect the company to continue to report strong results in the near future. Its creative cloud offering, marketed as a subscription model with attractive monthly pricing, will continue to be a catalyst for revenue growth in the coming years.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAdobe Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) are some of the top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector.

1885,ADBE,"The Nasdaq Composite index has performed exceptionally well in the year so far by setting record highs for more than 60 times. The index first hit the 6,000 milestone on Apr 25, crossing the 5,000 mark after 17 years. The index has been up 27.4% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, outperforming Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 gains of 24% and 18.5%, respectively.This can be attributed to the outstanding rally of tech stocks which constitute over 50% of weightage in the index. The technology sector has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Needless to say, tech stocks are preferred by astute investors due to their proprietary technological expertise and heavy cash balances. These companies also relish high barriers to entry, which position the firms for faster growth in the market.Some market pundits believe tech stocks are riding high on the years-long economic expansion, while most of them attribute part of this upsurge to the Trump administration’s pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.5 Tech Stocks Outpacing NasdaqHere are the five Nasdaq-listed tech stocks which have performed phenomenally this year and have potential to retain the momentum in the next year as well. All these stocks have appreciated more than 50% in the year, so far, in turn helping Nasdaq outperform the market.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) remains one of the best performers in the tech space. The company has grabbed attention with striking performances on the back of impressive earnings results and strong growth projections. The stock has surged 74.7% in the year so far.Given the accelerated momentum in AI, gaming, datacenter and automotive technology, we believe this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, with long-term EPS growth estimate of 10.3%, will continue to rally in the near term. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Lam Research Corp. (LRCX  -  Free Report) has soared a whopping 72.2% in 2017 so far. The company’s back-to-back quarters of overwhelming results have boosted investors’ confidence. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a long-term EPS growth estimate of 14.9%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The improving WFE market, strong demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology are key catalysts. We believe the strong demand for bit growth in server DRAM and NAND will continue, driven by cloud computing and IoT. This will open up more opportunities for Lam Research in the near future.Another tech stock, Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report), has also had a remarkable run this year, rallying 70%. Adobe has been putting in commendable efforts toward establishing its presence in cloud-related software areas such as documents and marketing. Adobe Experience Manager, which enables brands to offer a personalized experience, has also been witnessing robust growth.We remain optimistic about Adobe’s market position, compelling product lines, continued innovation, strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheet. Also, the company’s expansion in growing markets such as artificial intelligence and machine-learning framework is a big positive. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term EPS growth estimate of 17%.Sunnyvale, CA-based NetApp Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) has been up 62.7% in the YTD period. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a long-term EPS growth estimate of 11.3%. The company’s expertise in the flash array market is strengthening its prominence in the storage area network (SAN) and converged infrastructure markets. NetApp is positive about catering to the exponential rate of data growth with its cloud-integrated all-flash solutions that fit well with hybrid cloud infrastructure.We believe NetApp is well positioned to enjoy steady growth with its diversified portfolio and strong distribution channels that will drive demand for the products in the near term.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) is also among the top performers which has gained 56.1% in the year so far. It is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market and has been benefiting from the rising demand for SSD products. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a long-term EPS growth estimate of 11.3%.The storage market is witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume and especially exponential growth in unstructured data. We believe the company is well positioned to grab this opportunity.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1888,ADBE,"Premium ecommerce solutions provider, Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 1.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 33 cents, exhibiting a miss of 8.3%. Overall, Pitney Bowes has a dismal earnings surprise history, having missed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 4.9%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayPitney Bowes’ concerted efforts to transform its business have started to show results as evident from growth across most business lines. For instance, the new channels that the company has been developing over the last four years namely, the tele and digital channels, proved conducive to growth of in its Mail business.The transformation initiatives and constant introduction of new products have provided a boost to its performance. This apart, the company’s prolonged effort to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform is also likely to prove conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth for the quarter under review.Moreover, the company’s Global e-commerce business is proving to be one of the strongest profit churners, and is anticipated to boost top-line growth in the third quarter. In less than five years, Global e-commerce has grown from $20 million business to a worth of over $400 million. The company also expects segment’s growth rate to accelerate going forward, in light of growth in overall retail volumes and customer wins.Further, the company remains optimistic about Commerce Cloud platform, which is expected to enhance digital capabilities and web-based solutions, along with acting as a decisive growth enabler going forward.However, the fact remains that the company’s major earnings driver — the Small and Medium Business Solutions (“SMB”) business — has witnessed a decline in revenues. The tepid performance was primarily due to prolonged softness in the North American Mailing business as well as International Mailing Business. This is expected to put pressure on the overall top-line performance of the company in the upcoming quarter as well.Moreover, continued softness in the mailing business is likely to affect Pitney Bowes’ growth momentum for the quarter under review. Lower recurring supplies revenues are expected to adversely affect the mailing business in the upcoming quarter. Additionally, currency fluctuations has remained one of the headwinds over the past few quarters, and is expected to impact earnings and revenues in the upcoming release as well.This apart, the company has been experiencing a surge in operating expenses due to ERP implementation in the United States and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising and marketing strategies. Moreover, it expects incremental marketing expense in the ERP program, related to digital capabilities enhancement, which might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Pitney Bowes in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 45 cents.

Revenues per worksite employee per month were up 2.5% to $1,421.The increase in worksite employee can be attributed to new client sales that were driven by a 12% jump in the average number of trained business performance advisors. Client retention averaged 99% in the third quarter. Insperity, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Insperity, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Insperity, Inc. QuoteMoreover, corporate leads, social media followers and unique visitors to insperity.com increased more than 30% in the reported quarter.Insperity’s stock has returned 38.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 18.2% rally of the industry.Operating DetailsGross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 17.6%. Gross profit per worksite employee per month increased 7.8% to $250.Adjusted EBITDA increased 37.5% year over year to $43.1 million, which surpassed management’s guidance of $37.5-$39.5 million. EBITDA per worksite employee per month increased 16.7% in the quarter to $63.Operating expenses rose 15.9% year over year to $110.2 million due to increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors. Continued investments in the company’s technology infrastructure, security and development also led to the upside.Share Buyback ContinuesInsperity exited the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $285.9 million compared with $243.8 million as on Jun 30, 2016.To-date, the company has repurchased 349,000 shares at a cost of $27 million and paid $18 million in cash dividends.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2017, Insperity projects adjusted earnings in the range of 91-95 cents per share. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the range of $36-$38 million. Average worksite employees (WSEEs) are expected in the range of 189,800-191,600, representing growth of 10-11%.For full-year 2017, Insperity now projects adjusted earnings of $4.71-$4.75 per share, up from previous guidance of $4.47-$4.60.Adjusted EBITDA is projected in a range of $175-$177 million. Average WSEEs are anticipated in the 182,800–183,200 bracket, representing growth of 10-10.5%, but down from previous expectation of 11-12%.Our TakeWe believe Insperity is well poised to benefit from the booming professional employer organization (PEO) industry. Management claims that its flagship co-employment solution, Insperity Workforce Optimization, has been the most comprehensive business service in the marketplace for many years. Additionally, the launch of Insperity Premier in the third quarter is anticipated to be a key catalyst.Moreover, improved client retention, diversified product portfolio, growth in worksite employees and strength in ancillary products are the other positives. Further, management stated that competitive positioning, gross-profit contribution, and operational excellence will drive future growth.However, an increase in health-care costs does not bode well for the company as it is one of the major components of operating expenses. Furthermore, intensifying competition remains a major concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Insperity carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) are some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the sector.

1891,ADBE,"Shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) dipped nearly 9% during yesterday’s after-hour trade after the company reported lower-than-expected results for second-quarter fiscal 2018. Furthermore, revenues matched the mid-point of the company’s guidance range, while non-GAAP earnings came in at the lower end.The company noted that its booking mix is shifting faster than expected toward more “ratable revenue recognition”, which resulted in lower-than-expected revenue growth.Per the company, “Adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform is leading to an increase in the number of larger and multi-product deals, which is a strong validation that customers are designing Symantec into their future security architectures. These trends are however also affecting our in-period revenue recognition. The mix of our bookings is shifting towards more ratable revenue recognition as customers are increasingly adopting our cloud, subscription and virtual appliance products in multi-product deals.”Notably, over the past year, Symantec has returned 26.4%, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 39.3%, to which it belongs to.Quarter in DetailSymantec’s revenues of $1.240 billion jumped 26.7% year over year and came in line with the mid-point of its guidance range of $1.225-$1.255 billion (mid-point $1.240 billion). The robust top-line result was mainly driven by acquisitions. On a constant currency adjusted for acquisitions basis, revenues were flat year over year.On a non-GAAP basis, the company generated revenues of $1.276 billion, up 26% from $1.015 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also came in at the mid-point of management’s projection of $1.260-$1.290 billion (mid-point $1.275 billion).However, quarterly revenues, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis both, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.278 billion.Segment wise, the Consumer Digital Safety and Enterprise Security divisions witnessed a 42% and 14% year-over-year increase, respectively. However, on constant currency adjusted for acquisition basis, Consumer Digital Safety registered 1% growth, while the Enterprise Security division’s revenues were flat year over year.Symantec’s non-GAAP gross profit of $1.075 billion was up 26.3%, primarily attributable to a higher revenue base. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 86.7%, as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by elevated cost of goods sold.Furthermore, non-GAAP operating income surged 47% year over year to $435 million, while margin expanded 490 bps to 35.1%. Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin was approximately at the mid-point of the company’s guidance range of 34-36%. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by strong revenue growth, and benefited from better execution of the company’s cost-saving initiatives and synergies from acquisitions.Per Symantec, it has realized over $580 million of cost through its cost-restructuring initiatives and cost synergies from the acquisitions of Blue Coat and LifeLock, which is way ahead of its planned time of the end of fiscal 2018. Till fiscal 2017, the company has achieved more than $300 million in net cost efficiencies.Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at $268 million compared with $192 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share climbed 33.3% year over year to 40 cents and came at the lower-end of the company’s projected range of 40-44 cents.Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSymantec exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.026 billion compared with $2.306 billion recorded in the prior quarter. It should be noted that the company had repaid $2 billion of its debt during the fiscal first quarter, as a result of which its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments had declined to $2.306 billion in the previous quarter from $4.247 billion reported at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $6.079 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter.During the first half of fiscal 2018, Symantec generated operating cash flow of $390 million. It paid $114 million as dividend during the period.GuidanceConsidering the effect of faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition”, the company lowered its revenues and non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal 2018.For the fiscal, Symantec now expects GAAP revenues in the range of $4.877-$4.977 billion (mid-point $4.927 billion) and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $5-$5.1 billion (mid-point $5.05 billion), down from the previous guidance ranges of $5.037-$5.137 billion (mid-point $5.087 billion) and $5.160-$5.260 billion (mid-point $5.210 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged at $5.19 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between $1.66 and $1.76, down from the earlier forecast of $1.79-$1.89. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.81.The company provided guidance for the third quarter as well. For the quarter, Symantec anticipates GAAP and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $1.227-$1.257 billion (mid-point $1.242 billion) and $1.250-$1.280 billion (mid-point $1.265 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.34 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin is projected in the range of 36-37%. However, on a GAAP basis, it expects to report negative operating margin in the range of 2-3%. Further, management predicts reporting earnings between 42 cents and 46 cents on a non-GAAP basis for the fiscal third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents.Website Security Business Divestment CompletedSymantec announced that it has completed the sale of its Website Security and related PKI business to privately owned DigiCert Inc. The company received $950 million in cash and approximately a 30% stake in DigiCert’s business. Symantec’s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites.We believe the recent move is an effort by Symantec to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google which has accused it for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications.Our TakeWe predict that the faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition” will continue to drag down the company’s near-term results. However, over the long run, this initiative will result in higher number of large and multi product deal wins, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Furthermore, we consider that although the sale of its certified authority business will avoid conflicts with Alphabet, the high margin of the sold business may depress Symantec’s near-term profitability.Additionally, smaller companies like Kaspersky are constantly launching comparable products. These, along with competition from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), remain headwinds.Currently, Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17%.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1892,ADBE,"Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents in third-quarter 2017. Further, adjusted earnings fell 25% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings per share of 31 cents, down 11.4% compared with the year-ago figure. A rise in total costs, along with cost of investment in new business areas proved to be a drag on the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues in the quarter was $842,820 million, up 0.5% year over year on a reported basis. However, revenues were flat, when adjusted for currency impact.As for the segments, on a reported basis, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) Solutions revenues dipped 7.4% year over year to $ 414 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 8.6%) and International Mailing Business (down 3%). Lower recurring revenue streams and lower sales in the top of the line products led to the lackluster performance of the North American Mailing business. Additionally, decline in recurring revenues proved to be a drag on the International Mailing Business.Enterprise Business Solutions (“EBS”) revenues increased 1.4% year over year to $223.5 million. Decent performance form Presort Services (up 4%), partially offset by the production mail business (down 1.9%) drove the top-line growth of this segment. Higher print equipment sales bolstered performance of the production mail business. Higher support services revenues also proved conducive to the growth of this segment.Digital Commerce Solutions reported 19% year-over-year growth in sales to $205.6 million, on the back of strong Global e-commerce (up 28%) as well as Software Solutions businesses (up 12%). Impressive performance in all cross-border geographies and growth in domestic shipping acted as tailwinds for the Global e-commerce business. Growth in the Software Solutions business was primarily driven by higher license revenue, mainly in Location Intelligence and Customer Information Management.Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pitney Bowes Inc. QuoteLiquidity and Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, free cash flow was $108.9 million compared with $119.9 million as of Sep 30, 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,697 million compared with $764.5 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2017, was $3,562.7 million, down from $2,750.4 million as of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceThe company tweaked guidance for full-year 2017. It expects earnings per share to lie in the range of $1.38-$1.46, compared with the earlier guided range of $1.70-$1.78. Revenues, on a reported basis, are expected to grow in the range of 3-5% year over year compared with the previous guidance of flat to 1% growth.Pitney Bowes believes that new products and digital capabilities of SMB, expansion of the Presort Services network and robust e-commerce volume growth will act as major catalysts, stoking top-line growth for full-year 2017. Moreover, the company’s focus on operational excellence will help it trim costs and expenses, consequently supplementing growth.Our TakePitney Bowes’ concerted efforts to transform business have started to show results as evident from growth across most business lines. The transformation initiatives and constant introduction of new products have also provided a boost to performance. This apart, the company’s prolonged effort to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform also bode well for the company.Moreover, the company’s Global e-commerce business is proving to be one of the strongest profit churners, and is anticipated to boost top-line growth in the upcoming quarters as well. In less than five years, Global e-commerce has grown from $20 million business to a worth of over $400 million. The company also anticipates segment’s growth rate to accelerate going forward, in light of growth in overall retail volumes and customer wins.However, continued softness in the mailing business is likely to affect Pitney Bowes’ growth momentum for the quarter under review. Lower recurring supplies revenues are expected to adversely affect the mailing business in the upcoming quarter. Additionally, currency fluctuation remains a headwind.Pitney Bowes currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report).

1894,ADBE,"Connectivity and sensor solutions manufacturer, TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 1.TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.5% in the trailing four quarters. The company scored its seventh consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, beating estimates by 6%. However, the company anticipates weak revenues in Transportation Solutions in the upcoming quarter, which constitutes the major portion of its total revenues.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPrimarily depended on end market dynamics, TE Connectivity’s business remains susceptible to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer. Though the company witnessed some extent of stability in direct business with OEMs, poor sales through distribution channels took longer-than-expected recovery time, consequently hurting the segmental performance. These factors could be a drag on segment margin and affect its profitability in the upcoming quarter.The company’s commercial transportation market is yet to witness signs of stabilization due to weak global construction and agriculture markets, along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets. This apart, the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review. These factors can severely undermine TE Connectivity’s growth prospects.Moreover, sluggishness in oil and gas markets along with its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as major headwinds for TE Connectivity. Further, helicopter demand has also been impacted negatively, which can prove to be a drag on the company’s aerospace business.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains low at $1,670 million compared with fiscal third-quarter revenues of $1,765 million. Revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are also anticipated to be low sequentially, with an estimate of $880 million compared with reported revenues of $905 million in the prior quarter.However, being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, TE Connectivity is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. In the past five years, the company’s harsh business applications have had experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth. Going forward, we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion in the upcoming quarter.Moreover, the company’s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China. Growth in electronic content as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for the company’s transportation business, going forward.Furthermore, during the previous quarter, the company enhanced its harsh environment portfolio with bolt-on acquisitions in the Automotive and Medical business by entering into an agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication and purchasing MicroGroup. These acquisitions will unlock expansion opportunities, and advance content growth in key applications for the automotive and medical markets. This bodes well for the to-be-reported quarter’s top-line.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for TE Connectivity this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.16. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | TE Connectivity Ltd. QuoteZacks Rank: TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1895,ADBE,"Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) is trying to pacify employees about its relationship with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) even as it embarks on a new journey with blockchain and completes strategic acquisitions and deals. Here’s the low-down:ICE Contract And The Child Separation PolicyThe technology sector, by virtue of the talent it has attracted from all over the world, has helped the U.S. lead the world. But that also means it has the largest number of immigrant workers. That’s probably why it has been the one most attacked on immigration issues and the one that has had to take the most defensive stand.   So it isn’t surprising that the government’s zero tolerance policy and the lack of a policy on reunification elicited unsupportive comments from all technology leaders. Microsoft’s case was no different.The policy itself isn’t anything new: it entails temporary separation of the family while the parents are either prosecuted and/or the identity of the children as belonging to the family is confirmed. But more stringent enforcement is likely what the government was attempting to do when it reportedly separated as many as 2,000 children from those claiming to be their parents. In any case, the President has since signed an executive order forbidding the separation.  Microsoft was charged by its employees on the basis of a blog post from January where it praised the U.S. ICE for “implementing transformative technologies for homeland security and public safety, and adding that “we’re proud to support this work with our mission-critical cloud.”That blog also said that the ICE would be able to “process data on edge devices or utilize deep learning capabilities to accelerate facial recognition and identification” that “help employees make more informed decisions faster.” This is actually an ideal situation that could minimize the plight of immigrants, but the company has now stepped on the back foot.Nadella’s letter to employees says, “Our current cloud engagement with ICE is supporting legacy mail, calendar, messaging and document management workloads.” It also says, “I want to be clear: Microsoft is not working with the U.S. government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border.”Deploying BlockchainMicrosoft has collaborated with consulting firm EY to build a blockchain tool based on the Quorum permissioned distributed ledger (a system that uses a smaller network of nodes to validate transactions thereby saving system resources).The company claims that the technology can be used by authors, software developers and other creators to collect royalties. If true, it would eliminate a host of middlemen and be greatly beneficial for creators, IP holders and other licensors.Microsoft intends to start using the technology in its online gaming system and is already working with Ubisoft for implementation. The companies believe that this will enable them to process millions of transactions a day, so payments can be made daily instead of the current 45 days.“The scale, complexity and volume of digital rights and royalties transactions makes this a perfect application for blockchains. A blockchain can handle the unique nature of each contract between digital rights owners and licensors can be handled in a scalable, efficient manner with an audit trail for the participants,” according to Paul Brody, EY’s Global Innovation Leader for Blockchain.AI Deal with M&SBritain’s Marks & Spencer Group has partnered with Microsoft to jump-start the digitization of its operations. The company is particularly interested in Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that it intends to incorporate in its stores, as well as across its other operations.Microsoft’s retail prowess came into focus last week with the company announcing its own self-checkout system. Since this too will improve customer experience, M&S may the one of the first to adopt the technology. However, neither company offered details of their collaboration plans.Marks & Spencer CEO Steve Rowe did however put out a statement that said, “We want to be at the forefront of driving value into the customer experience using the power of technology,” and, “Working together with Microsoft to understand the full potential of how technology and artificial intelligence can improve the in-store experience for our customers and the efficiencies of our wider operations could be a game-changer for M&S — and for retail.”Acquiring Social Learning Platform FlipgridMicrosoft has acquired a startup that makes a rather popular app for educators. Called Flipgrid, the app allows people to make videos on any topic for easy sharing with others. The Minneapolis-based startup has less than 30 employees that currently serve 20 million users. Last year, it reported an 800% increase in teacher accounts.While losing a leadership position to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) chromebooks and other classroom tools, Microsoft has always put out products to ensure that it remained in contention. As far as Flipgrid is concerned, the company promises to maintain the brand and allow it to operate across platforms. It is offering the product free for now to anyone who’s willing to use it and schools that already have subscriptions will be refunded on a pro rata basis.The attraction for Flipgrid is of course Microsoft’s resources that will enable it to scale and better reach students and teachers across the world.Acquiring AI Startup BonsaiMicrosoft has finally bought the reinforcement learning startup called Bonsai for an undisclosed sum. Last year, it invested in the company through its Microsoft Ventures unit, now called M12. At the time, ABB, Samsung and Siemens also invested in the company to raise $7.6 million, taking its total funding to $13.6 million.The Berkeley-based startup has 42 employees, all of whom will be moving to Microsoft. The company has previously done some work in the energy, HVAC, robotics and autonomous vehicle sectors. Last year, it developed a new technique for programming industrial control systems that was 45X faster than the competing solution from Google.Reinforcement learning allows a developer to teach a system through a trial and error process by creating a simulated environment. It therefore allows both AI engineers and those less experienced to get involved in the training process.Microsoft is betting that AI adoption will be so fast that there will be a skills gap. So the ability to get more people on the job will be a valuable asset.One-Month Price Performance RecommendationsMicrosoft shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better tech plays include buy-ranked stocks like Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report), NetApp Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), Akamai (AKAM  -  Free Report) and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report).

No wonder it conjures frightening images of werewolves or Dracula in the general populace, who are steeped in myths and legends. But don’t you worry, this article isn’t meant to spook you with such stories.FANG here represents the most well-liked and high performing tech stocks in the market that have generated impressive returns for the investors. The term was popularized by CNBC's Mad Money host Jim Cramer.The word is an acronym where ""F"" stands for Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), ""A"" stands for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), then there is the ""N,"" which stands for Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), finally the ""G"" which is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), commonly referred to as Google.These four technology powerhouses have performed phenomenally this year. Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have all posted gains of at least 50%, while Alphabet gained more than 30% on a year-to-date basis. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 posted rallies of 28.8% and 17.4%, respectively so far this year.FANG – The RulersFacebook and Alphabet dominate the U.S digital ad market. Per the latest report from eMarketer, both these companies are expected to hold 63.1% share of the total domestic digital ad market, up from the earlier expected number of 60.4% in 2017.Their target advertising capabilities draw advertisers to these platforms, adds eMarketer. A giant user base is another major draw. Facebook has over 2 billion users while its subsidiary, Instagram has over 800 million users.Alphabet's strong advertising revenues and improving paid click growth remain the primary catalysts. Its focus on innovation, AI, cloud, home automation space, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. Alphabet has shown good execution to date, more or less maintaining dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market.Amazon rules e-commerce and cloud services with its Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) business. The company is benefiting from strong growth across all its businesses and especially the retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. On a global basis, AWS is now accessible across 46 Availability Zones (AZs) through 17 technology infrastructure regions worldwide. These AZs enable businesses to save costs, accelerate innovation, expedite the time to market as well as expand geographic presence within minutes.Netflix is one of the leading video streaming platforms driven by expanding content portfolio and subscriber base. Its growing subscriber base is the primary factor that helps it generate significant revenues. The company remains confident of adding more subscribers as the trend of binge viewing is catching up fast. Netflix now has over 109 million subscribers globally. We believe continuing subscriber addition and expanding content portfolio are the key catalysts that will help Netflix to sustain growth going forward.Despite remarkable growth of the FANG stocks, these aren't the largest standout in the tech sector this year. A small number of companies have posted gains that have crushed the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google this year. Notably, all four of these tech companies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Our ChoicesHere are some notable tech companies that have outperformed the FANG bigwigs, in order of performance.Moreover, these stocks either have a  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).NVIDIA Corp.

1897,ADBE,"Market participants are looking for a fourth-straight “up” week today, as the final trading day sees futures up across all major American indexes. It does not appear equities trading is factoring in anything like a tax bill failure to passage, regardless of headlines concerning Florida Senator Marco Rubio to the contrary.21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) looks to have a good start to the weekend, with not only a $52.4 billion buyout deal on the table from Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) but a new Star Wars movie, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” hitting theatres today around the world. Some calculate this — reportedly the most favorably-reviewed Star Wars epic since “The Empire Strikes Back” — to be one of the strongest grossing films of all time, right out of the gate.The film, budgeted at an ungodly $200 million, also looks to foster a gigantic merchandising industry, which may bring a cool $3 billion in Star Wars-related products alone. And because the Disney deal is unlikely to take place soon — the companies themselves self-imposed a 12-18 month span — Fox shareholders should reap the rewards in the meantime.Escape to Earnings IslandEach quarter, there is a strange bit of business where a few key names in the S&P 500 report quarterly earnings — outside the heavy traffic of “official” earnings season — and yesterday after the closing bell was one of those days:Although Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) beat earnings in its fiscal Q2 2018, weaker-than-expected results from its cloud business has helped sell off Oracle shares in the pre-market roughly 5% at this hour. For more info on ORCL’s earnings release, click here.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) beat estimates and raised guidance, on strength in its Digital Media Solutions business, which rose 29% year over year. For more info on ADBE’s earnings release, click here.Costco’s (COST  -  Free Report) fiscal Q1 2018 kicked off the new term on the right foot, topping earnings estimates by a penny on better-than-expected sales in the quarter.

Further, the company expects an increasingly challenging investment environment in Europe and Latin America.

While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash.So, a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.) Growth Style Score less than or equal to B(Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, Applied Materials Inc.

1908,ADBE,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 IFRS earnings per share of €0.82 (95 cents), reflecting a surge of 35% on a year-over-year basis. This improvement was primarily attributable to growth in the cloud subscriptions as well as software license order entry. The bottom line, however, misses the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share.Total IFRS revenues for the third quarter were €5,590 million ($6,497.3 million), up 4% year over year. Also, the figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,470 million. A flourishing cloud business along with strong growth of support revenues, aided the top-line growth during the third quarter.Also, new cloud bookings — a key indicator of sales success in cloud business — were significantly up 14% to €302 million ($351 million) in the reported quarter.Inside/Behind the HeadlinesCloud and Software business, which includes Cloud Subscriptions & Support and Software licenses & support, reported third-quarter revenues of €4,657 million ($5,412.8 million), up 4.5% year over year. IFRS Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €937 million ($1,089.1 million) in the quarter, up 21.8% year over year; while non-IFRS Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €938 million ($1,090.2 million) in the quarter.Software licenses & support reported revenues of €3,720 million ($4,323.8 million), up 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Also, for third-quarter 2017, Services revenues inched up 1.3% year over year to €932 million ($1,083.3 million). Overall, IFRS Cloud and software revenues witnessed growth, mainly driven by strong IFRS Cloud Subscriptions and support revenue.The EMEA region observed double-digit software license revenues rise in majority of the end markets, including Germany, Russia and the Middle East & North Africa region. For the APJ region, SAP witnessed a strong performance in both cloud and software revenue plus cloud subscriptions, along with robust performances in Australia and China, acting as key catalysts.The company reported IFRS operating margin of 23.5%, up 300 basis points from the figure recorded in third-quarter 2016. Also, the company recorded a 19.1% rally in operating profit amounting to €1,314 million ($1,527.3 million).SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SAP SE QuoteQuarter in DetailSAP’s human capital management (‘‘HCM’’) applications continue to act as a key growth-driver with SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassing the 2,000-customer base at the end of the third quarter. In addition, SAP’s Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions once again achieved double-digit growth in new cloud bookings as well as software revenue.Additionally, consistent strong market traction of the SAP S/4HANA platform is proving to be a strong profit-churner. During the reported quarter, the company gained 600 additional customers with more than 40% being entirely new. This uptrend hugely drove the company’s revenues. With little competition in its core market, the software and service provider experienced strong results in the third quarter in the aforesaid segment.This apart, SAP’s business networks (which it manages through three main players namely, Ariba, Fieldglass and Concur) burgeoned 19% during the reported quarter. Currently, the Ariba network handles trading worth around $1 trillion of 3 million connected companies. This upside hugely drove the company’s revenues. While Concur manages travel and expenses of more than 50 million end users, Fieldglass helps managing 3.9 million flexible workers.Other Financial DetailsFor the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the company’s operating cash flow came in at €4.1 billion ($4.8 billion), up 14% on a year-over-year basis. While free cash flow was €3.2 billion ($3.8 billion), up 7% compared with the year-ago tally.Guidance ImprovedFueled by continued strong momentum of the cloud business, SAP raised its view for full-year 2017 non-IFRS total revenue projection from €23.3-€23.7 billion to €23.4-€23.8 billion at constant currency (cc).The company believes the non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to lie in the €3.8-€4.0 billion range at constant currencies. Also, non-IFRS cloud and software revenue outlook has been revised upward. It is expected to grow in the band of 7-8.5% instead of the previous 6.5-8.5% view at cc. Also, non-IFRS operating profit forecast for 2017 has been tweaked at the lower end of the earlier guided range. It is now estimated to be in the range of €6.85-€7 billion compared with the former €6.80-€7 billion band  at cc.Our TakeSAP’s resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth-drivers. The company’s S/4HANA has proved to be a solid profit-yielder, fueled by an increase in cloud subscriptions as well as support-revenue rise in recent times.Also, SAP’s new class of solutions that power the next generation of business applications — SAP HANA — has been its biggest top-line driver ever since its introduction. The company’s latest offering from the SAP HANA family, S/4HANA, has established itself as a mission critical control center for businesses pursuing digital transformation. This apart, the company constantly upgrades the existing products and launches new ones to expand its customer base, thereby offering a competitive edge over peers.However, dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters along with flat customer spending projections have affected the company’s performances. Also, over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances besides general economic slowdowns, which have adversely impacted the consumers’ purchasing power. Currency fluctuations in many of the company’s key markets are also hurting its financial performance.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSAP currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Nutanix Inc. (NTNX  -  Free Report).

1909,ADBE,"Shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) were up more than 10% in morning trading Thursday after the company felt a bullish reaction to several key announcements at its annual Adobe MAX user conference.Most importantly, Adobe revealed preliminary financial targets for fiscal 2018 at a briefing with investors and financial analysts. The company is currently aiming for results that would exceed our consensus estimates and mark impressive year-over-year growth.According to Adobe’s briefing, management expects total revenue of $8.7 billion next year. This comes in on the high end of our consensus estimate of $8.63 billion and would represent growth of about 20% from its estimated full-year 2017 total.On the bottom line, Adobe expects non-GAAP earnings to come in at $5.50 per share. That would crush the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15 and mark year-over-year growth of nearly 31% from our fiscal 2017 projection.“Adobe’s vision has never been more clear or more relevant – to empower people and businesses to design and deliver amazing digital experiences,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in an accompanying press release.It’s worth noting that Adobe’s fiscal year 2018 growth will be coming on the back of an already impressive year of growth in 2017. In fact, our current consensus estimates are calling for the company to finish the year with earnings growth of 39% and sales growth of 24%.On top of this, Adobe’s announcement included impressive growth projections throughout its key segments. For instance, management expects its Digital Media unit to witness revenue growth of 23%, while its Experience Cloud segment’s total revenue is expected to swell by 15%. Breaking it down further, Adobe projects that it will see 20% growth in subscription revenue from its Experience Cloud segment.In addition to its strong financial outlook, Adobe detailed even more of its future at this week’s MAX conference. Perhaps most interestingly, management clarified its overall intentions for its artificial intelligence platform.“We are not building a general purpose AI platform like some others in the industry are — and it’s great that they are building it,” Adobe CTO Abhay Parasnis noted in a press conference.“We have a very deep understanding of how creative professionals work in imagining, in photography, in video, in design and illustration… When one of the very best artists in Photoshop spends hours in creation, what are the other things they do and maybe more importantly, what are the things they don’t do? We are trying to harness that and marry that with the latest advances in deep learning so that the algorithms can actually become partners for that creative professional.”Adobe announced its Sensei AI platform about a year ago. The company is focusing on attempting to integrate Sensei into its industry-leading digital media creation products, and it seems to have a particularly defined vision for what Sensei should do.Currently, Adobe is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has been one of the hottest in an on-fire tech sector, and shares are now up about 50% year-to-date.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1913,ADBE,"In a matter of just a few years, “the Cloud” has evolved from a budding new tech feature to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector. Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software-related companies, and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech-focused investors.New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape, and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud. The markets have been paying attention, and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud-based companies, or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations.With this in mind, we’ve highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud-related activity, but also strong fundamental metrics. Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now:1. Workday, Inc. (WDAY  -  Free Report)Workday designs enterprise cloud applications for human resources and finance. It provides its customers—which fall in the tech, financial services, business services, healthcare, retail, and other industries—with the tools to manage critical business functions using industry-leading cloud solutions.WDAY is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is certainly an explosive growth pick. Based on current analyst estimates, we expect Workday to report EPS growth of 23% and revenue growth of 26% this fiscal year. Its valuation is stretched, but the stock also looks interesting from an earnings momentum perspective, having added 37% to its full-year EPS estimates within the past quarter. This means analyst sentiment has remained positive recently. 2. Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report)Adobe Systems is a provider of graphic design, publishing, and imaging software for Web and print production. The company’s main offering is its “Creative Cloud,” which is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product that allows users to access all of Adobe’s tools at one monthly price. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy).ADBE has been on an absolute tear lately, surging more than 70% in the past year. Interestingly enough, however, the stock sold off a bit after its latest earnings beat, giving investors a unique opportunity to buy as it continues to rebound.Shares are now trading at their lowest forward earnings multiple in a year. Plus, the company has plenty of expansion opportunity left. Earnings growth is expected to reach 53.6% in the current fiscal year, and Adobe is projected to see a long-term annualized EPS growth rate of more than 16% in the coming years. 3. Progress Software Corporation (PRGS  -  Free Report)Progress develops software and cloud-based products that assist clients with application deployment, application management, data connectivity, web content management, and predictive analytics. The company has shifted its focus to cloud computing and is looking to expand its cloud subscription offerings. Currently, PRGS is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In its recently-reported quarter, the firm surpassed earnings estimates for the seventh-consecutive period, inspiring some positive estimate revisions for upcoming quarters.

1916,ADBE,"Continuing with its efforts to enhance shareholder value, Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) last week announced that it is set to buy back $200 million worth of its common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. This initiative reflects the California-based company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.Last Thursday, the company announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association and MUFG Securities EMEA plc in this connection. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.8 million shares, while the remaining shares will be received on or before May 16, 2018, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys’ volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.ASR arrangements are an integral element of the company’s overall framework for enhancing investors’ worth. Since fiscal 2015, the company has completed $705 million worth of ASR program.Apart from the ASR agreements, the company has also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In June 2017, Synopsys approved an extension of the company’s existing share-repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. In fiscal 2017, it has repurchased $400 million worth of common stock.Synopsys’ financial strength enables it to continue with the buyback program. As of Oct 31, 2017, the company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.05 billion. Its aggressive share-repurchase policies are anticipated to boost investors’ confidence. Synopsys’ strategy to return wealth to shareholders highlights its growth potential and stable liquidity position.Notably, in the year-to-date period, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to. Synopsys has returned 53.8% during the said time period, while the industry has gained 35.3%.Other companies that have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report).We believe apart from enhancing shareholders’ return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip.Nonetheless, the company’s escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1917,ADBE,"Markets enjoyed another month of strong gains, boosted by encouraging economic data and hopes surrounding tax reforms. Additionally, the Fed chose not to hike rates in November and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy. Significant progress was made on President Trump’s much-vaunted tax legislation. Ultimately, the House of Representatives finally passed the much awaited tax cuts legislation now named as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.November’s PerformanceFor the month of November, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq surged 3.87%, 2.8% and 2.2%, respectively. The blue-chip index posted its eighth consecutive month of gains — the highest streak of gains in the last 22 years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also posted eight straight months in gains. The last time around when the S&P 500 had achieved such a feat was way back in 2007. The indexes have gained in the range of 18% to 28% so far in 2017.The Fed chose not to hike rates in November and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy and said that it has been improving at a ""solid rate."" On Nov 16, the House finally passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Finally, The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes indicated that a rate hike was almost certain in December, but stated that only one or two rate hikes are likely in 2018.Encouraging Domestic DataEconomic data released during November was largely encouraging. ISM Services Index increased from 59.8% to 60.1% in October, reaching its best settlement since August 2005. Construction spending increased 0.3% to $1.22 trillion in September, up from 0.1% in August.

PPI for October came in at 0.4%, in line with the previous month’s figure. Core CPI for October came in at 0.2%, up from 0.1% in September. Factory Orders increased by 1.4%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 1.3%. Consumer spending surged 0.3% in October, in line with the consensus estimate for the period.However, PCE Inflation for October came in at 0.1%, below the previous month’s figure of 0.4%.

(Read: Housing Starts Rebound Post Hurricanes: 4 Top Picks)Additionally, sales of new single-family houses in the United States increased 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October. This marks the biggest percentage gain since January 1992. (Read: Housing ETFs to Buy in 2018)Further, existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.48 million. Meanwhile, pending home sales for the month of October increased 3.5%, surpassing the consensus estimate of 2% growth.Q3 GDP Exhibits Highest Rate of Growth Since 2014According to the second estimate from the Department of Commerce, the gross domestic product of the United States expanded at an astounding 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017. This also marks it fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2014.Meanwhile, consumer spending, the biggest contributor to economic growth advanced 2.3% in the 3Q17. Further, spending on business equipment shot up 10.4% in the period, also notching up a three-year high. Meanwhile, corporate pre-tax profits have surged 5.4% year over year.Unemployment Hits 17-Yr Low, Job Additions RiseThe United States created 261,000 jobs in October, which came as a breather after only 18,000 job additions in September. Employment in key sectors like food services and drinking places, and professional and business services contributed to last month’s job creations. Employment in food services and drinking places created 89,000 jobs in October, after losing 98,000 jobs in September. Also, professional and business services added 50,000 jobs. However, October’s job additions were below the consensus estimate of 297,000 job additions.Additionally, average hourly wages remained mostly flat in October, which came lower than the consensus estimate of a gain of 0.2%. Meanwhile, in October the unemployment rate came down from 4.2% to 4.1%, lower than the consensus expectation of 4.2%. This is the lowest pace recorded since December 2000.Two Versions of New Tax Bill EmergeOn Nov 2, Republicans of the House finally unveiled a detailed tax cut policy under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which seeks to reduce corporate and revoke the taxes paid by large businesses. The tax bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20%, making it the permanent rate.On Nov 9, another version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. For instance, unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Such a confused state of affairs dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, market watchers speculated that no formal decision was likely on the tax Bill before Thanksgiving. Such fears weighed heavily on the broader markets.House of Representatives Passes CutsOn Nov 16, House of Representatives finally passed the much-awaited tax cuts legislation. This takes President Trump and his team one step closer toward realizing their most important agenda — tax reforms.Ultimately, in a 12-11 vote on Nov 28, the Senate Budget Committee advanced the Tax Bill proposed by the members of the GOP. Senators Bob Corker and Ron Johnson also voted in favor of the Bill. Senator John McCain also stated that he would vote in favor of the Bill.Black Friday Sales Push Retailers HigherHoliday shopping continued even after Black Friday, eventually boosting gains for retailers.

(DDS  -  Free Report) and Gap Inc.(GPS  -  Free Report) all increased 1.8%, 4.7% and 1.21%, respectively. On the other hand, fast food retailer Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and toy makers like Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel MAT declined 1% and 1.5%, respectively. Fed Refrains from Rate Hike, Powell to Be Next Fed ChairMarkets gained traction on Wednesday after the Fed decided not to raise the benchmark interest rates and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy. At the end of its two day meet, the Fed stated that the U.S. economy has been growing at a ""solid rate"" compared to a ""moderate rate"" in September.Although, the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged in the range of 1% to 1.25%, it indicated that there is a huge possibility of a hike in rate in December.  Meanwhile, a minority of policymakers maintained that the rate hike should be kept on hold till the inflation target of 2% is met.Meanwhile, President Trump appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Jerome Powell as Janet Yellen’s successor post the expiration of her term as Fed Chief in February.In the minutes of Oct 31-Nov 1 FOMC policy meeting, Fed officials clearly hinted at a December rate hike. However, some policymakers showed concerns over “persistent” slowdown in inflation and indicated that the central bank may scale back to one or at two rate increases next year, which was lower than the previously expected three rate hikes.5 Star Performers for NovemberI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):1.

1919,ADBE,"Black Friday usually offers a galore of shopping deals but Cyber Monday is likely to be more tempting. Bargain hunters are expected to take to the Internet on Cyber Monday (Nov 27), which is anticipated to be the busiest online shopping day in history.Many Americans prefer not to visit stores a day after an engaging Thanksgiving, primarily to avoid long queues. Tempting discounts on highly sought-after products is another attraction.According to a recent survey by National Retail Federation, as many as 78 million Americans, representing 48% of consumers, prefer shopping on Cyber Monday. This is way higher than 36% and 34% that planned to shop for Cyber Mondays during 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Cyber Monday to See Record SalesThis Cyber Monday is expected to be the largest online shopping fiesta of all times, according to Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report). The company projects online sales at $6.6 billion, up 16.5% from the year-ago level.   Already the customers have expended as much as $28.6 billion online in the first 21 days of this month, almost 18% higher than the year-ago level, per a report by Adobe.

(AMZN  -  Free Report), one of the major players in the online business, to steal the limelight this holiday season. CNBC added that Amazon will likely serve nearly half of the online shoppers this holiday season.     Strong Job Data Hint at High Consumer SpendingConsumers are looking at convenience factors more than ever this year. Lower-priced goods, free shipping and product availability are the primary factors driving online shopping this season.Strong economic indicators like record job data and declining unemployment rate are encouraging shoppers to spend billions of dollars online. As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the domestic economy generated 261,000 new jobs in October, the highest so far in 2017. Also, the unemployment rate of 4.1% in the month is the lowest this year.Impressive third-quarter results and record quarterly GDP numbers reflect the economy’s financial strength.

1920,ADBE,"Autodesk Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on Nov 28.In fiscal second-quarter 2018, the company reported non-GAAP loss of 11 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents. The figure was also much narrower than the guided range of a loss of 14–18 cents per share.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise track record. It has beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 23.52%.Revenues of $501.8 million beat the consensus mark of $494.8 million but fell nearly 8.9% year over year. The figure was better than the guided range of $488–$500 million.Management continues to emphasize on the fact that revenues will be negatively impacted by the business model transition from “upfront” to “ratably” as well as lower initial purchase price of new offerings.Notably, Autodesk’s shares have gained 72.6%, substantially outperforming the 35.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. We believe the company’s broad product portfolio and accelerating subscription base to sustain the share price momentum going ahead.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key FactorsAutodesk’s business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to boost subscriptions and deferred revenues. The marketing and promotional activities undertaken by the company are anticipated to sustain its growing subscription base.We note that Autodesk’s broad product portfolio generates new customers in both domestic and overseas markets as evident from the year-over-year triple digit growth in product subscriptions in major geographies including emerging countries.Strong adoption of products is driving subscription revenues for the company. In the last reported quarter, the company’s maintenance to subscription or M2S program recorded 63K subscriptions. New customers represented about 30% of the mix in the quarter and continue to contribute a significant portion of product subscription additions.Moreover, robust performance of BIM 360 and Fusion tools is the reason behind the continuous addition to cloud subscription.However, although the company plans to keep spending unchanged over the next one year, it remains concerned about increasing foreign exchange headwinds, which might weigh heavily on its expenses.Stiff competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) also remain headwinds.Autodesk, Inc.

1922,ADBE,"Shares of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) fell yesterday after the website — Ars Technica — reported that the credit information provider may have been subject to another cyber attack. Per Ars Technica, Randy Abrams, an independent security analyst, discovered that the company’s web site is prompting to install Adobe’s (ADBE  -  Free Report) Flash updates which has been found containing malware.Following the above discussed report, the company’s shares were seen tumbling around 3% during mid-day on Thursday. However, later in the day, the stock recovered almost half of the loss, after Equifax announced that it is not subject to any another cyber attack and its systems have not been compromised.Equifax’s spokesmen Wyatt Jefferies said that the company was “aware of the situation identified on the Equifax.com Web site in the credit-report assistance link.” He further added, ""Our IT and security teams are looking into this matter, and out of an abundance of caution have temporarily taken this page offline.""The company in a statement noted that, “The issue involves a third-party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data, and that vendor’s code running on an Equifax website was serving malicious content.” Equifax further stated that the vendor’s code has been removed from its webpage and it is conducting further analysis on this matter.Notably, the brand image and creditability of Equifax has already been in question ever since the company announced last month that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.Since then, Equifax has been facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.Shares of Equifax have lost approximately 24% of its value from the Sep 7 closing price. In the year-to-date period, the company has lost 8%, significantly underperforming the industry to which it belongs to, which has recorded growth of 31.7%.Investors seem concerned that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. It is feared that this will have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst cases in recent times. The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even for tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for longer periods of time.Hence, we believe investors’ concerns are justified as the mishap will have a lasting impact on Equifax’s results, in the form of financial costs relating to settlement of lawsuits and litigation expenses. Moreover, it will be very tough for the company to repair its brand image, as well as retain the current customer base.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1925,ADBE,"In a matter of just a few years, “the Cloud” has evolved from a budding new tech feature to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector. Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software-related companies, and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech-focused investors.New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape, and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud. The markets have been paying attention, and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud-based companies, or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations.With this in mind, we’ve highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud-related activity, but also strong fundamental metrics. Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now:1. Workday, Inc. (WDAY  -  Free Report)Workday designs enterprise cloud applications for human resources and finance. It provides its customers—which fall in the tech, financial services, business services, healthcare, retail, and other industries—with the tools to manage critical business functions using industry-leading cloud solutions.WDAY is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is certainly an explosive growth pick. Based on current analyst estimates, we expect Workday to report EPS growth of 23% and revenue growth of 26% this fiscal year. Its valuation is stretched, but the stock also looks interesting from an earnings momentum perspective, having added 37% to its full-year EPS estimates within the past quarter. This means analyst sentiment has remained positive recently. 2. Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report)Adobe Systems is a provider of graphic design, publishing, and imaging software for Web and print production. The company’s main offering is its “Creative Cloud,” which is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product that allows users to access all of Adobe’s tools at one monthly price.

Interestingly enough, however, the stock sold off a bit after its latest earnings beat, giving investors a unique opportunity to buy as it continues to rebound.Shares are now trading at their lowest forward earnings multiple in a year. Plus, the company has plenty of expansion opportunity left. Earnings growth is expected to reach 53.6% in the current fiscal year, and Adobe is projected to see a long-term annualized EPS growth rate of more than 16% in the coming years. 3. Progress Software Corporation (PRGS  -  Free Report)Progress develops software and cloud-based products that assist clients with application deployment, application management, data connectivity, web content management, and predictive analytics. The company has shifted its focus to cloud computing and is looking to expand its cloud subscription offerings.

1926,ADBE,"Shares of Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS  -  Free Report) have rallied to a new 52-week high of $40.33, eventually closing a bit lower at $40.25 on Oct 4.The momentum can be attributed to the strong adoption of the company’s products and expanding customer base, which drove top-line growth. In the last quarter, revenues increased 5.7% year over year to $479 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $478 million.Moreover, Cadence has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters with a positive average of 1.62%.Currently, Cadence has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, the stock has a market capital of $11.06 billion.Further, Cadence’s stock has returned 59.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 25.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Strong Product Adoption, New launches: Key CatalystsCadence is benefiting from strong adoption of products like Palladium Z1, Protium S1 FPGA-based prototyping system, Innovus and Tensilica.

1928,ADBE,"Congress’s nonpartisan scorekeeper in tax matters, the Joint Committee on Taxation, declared that the House Republicans passed an overhaul of the U.S. tax code that slashes corporate tax rates on Thursday.Big banks will benefit immensely from the tax cut as this will likely bolster investments. Lower tax rates also drive after-tax earnings for tech behemoths as it leads to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and development, as well as mergers and acquisitions.Small-cap companies are poised to gain enormously as well, mostly because they have been paying more taxes than their counterparts. Thus, investors should focus on multinational financial and technology service providers, as well as small-cap players, that can make the most of the slashed corporate tax rate.Senate Passes Tax Bill House Republicans approved a monumental bill to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals. The bill cleared the House 227-205, without Democratic support. The Democrats believed that it is a give-away to the wealthiest Americans. 13 Republicans representing districts with an already high average state and local tax deduction also voted against the bill.Such a high tax deduction will be scaled back significantly under the House plan. Nevertheless, the Joint Committee on Taxation said that around 92% of Americans will pay less or the same taxes until 2023 under the new plan.Republicans, in the meantime, have been rooting for a change in tax codes for several years but have repeatedly failed to garner support in the House until Trump’s election. Trump said that such a bill is a “big, beautiful Christmas present” for families, while the White House press secretary said that “a simple, fair, and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach.”This has set the stage for Republicans to execute their ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to overhaul an outdated U.S. tax code, providing financial relief to families and making American businesses more competitive globally.Great for Banks & Tech CompaniesThe bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, making it the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates ever.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut  to 20%.Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Let us also not forget that tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.Small Caps Rally on House VoteAfter the House passed the tax bill, small-cap stocks surged. After all, such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30% for quite some time, while their large-cap counterparts are paying close to 25%.Moreover, Trump’s call for more protectionism and less global trade boosted small caps that mostly generate less than 20% of its revenues from overseas. In contrast, large-cap companies typically generate more than 30% of their sales from abroad.The Russell 2000 Index, which comprises the smallest companies in terms of market capitalization, is up more than 27% since Trump was elected, while the S&P Small Cap 600 Index climbed more than 25% since the close of trading on Nov 8.Top 5 WinnersInvestors should double down on the hottest banking and tech bigwigs, as well as solid companies with smaller market capitalizations. We have, therefore, selected five relevant companies that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Eagle Bancorp, Inc.

1929,ADBE,"Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) has announced a restructuring program in a bid to expedite the transformation to a cloud-based subscription business, increase strategic focus as well as improve operational efficiency.The program will witness removal of some full-time positions and consolidation of facilities.. However, layoffs outside the United States will be subject to local law and consultation requirements.The company expects to incur around $60-$100 million pre-tax restructuring charges from the program. The same is inclusive of roughly $55-$70 million related to employee severance costs and around $5-$30 million, associated with consolidation of leased facilities and other expenses pertaining to the plan. The company hopes to complete most the restructuring activities during fourth-quarter 2017 and fiscal 2018.Notably, Citrix has been struggling on the bottom-line front for quite some time now. Apart from other headwinds limiting the bottom-line growth, frequent management changes at the company do not seem to bode well as far as investors’ confidence in the stock is concerned.Very recently, Citrix  announced appointment of Mark J. Ferrer as Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer. In addition, the company reported a change in board composition by roping in Dr. Ajei S. Gopal. Gopal is the President and CEO of ANSYS Inc. (ANSS  -  Free Report).Additionally, Citrix has been making frequent changes to the designation of CEO. Earlier in July, the company had appointed David J. Henshall as new President and CEO, thus recruiting four CEOs in a row in less than two years.Such recurrent management changes apart, Citrix’s bottom line has been hurt by considerable steep costs. Declining revenues from products and licenses also throw a severe challenge to the company.  In light of Citrix’s cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, it remains to be seen whether its actions increase profitability and find favor with shareholders.Citrix Systems, Inc.

1930,ADBE,"Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 20. The company’s revenues are likely to benefit from increasing adoption of its QuickBooks and TurboTax products. However, escalating expenses due to increased investments may hurt profitability.QuickBooks to Drive RevenuesThe company’s QuickBooks product offers financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses. The company has been witnessing tremendous growth in the QuickBooks online subscriber base, which is driving its Small Business Group segment’s revenues.The business and financial software space in which Intuit operates has huge growth opportunities. Notably, there are more than 29 million small businesses in the United States, of which majority still depend on third party or accountants to conduct data-entry process, as they feel it is a tedious and complex task.Therefore, to reach the untapped market, the company has introduced more convenient and easy-to-use version of its QuickBooks, which have been displaying remarkable results. In fiscal 2017, Intuit witnessed a 58% surge in its QuickBooks online subscribers which reached 2.38 million. QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers also increased to 390,000 from 85,000 at the end of fiscal 2016.The company forecasts year-over-year growth in the range of 37-42% in the QuickBooks online subscriber base. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal first quarter with a subscriber base of 2.475 million, marking year-over-year improvement of 51%.The tremendous increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive the company’s Small Business Group segment’s revenues.TurboTax Continues to Fuel RevenuesThe increasing adoption for the company’s TurboTax products — which offer income tax preparation products and services — continues to drive its Consumer Tax segment’s revenues. Notably, the segment had witnessed a 9% year-over-year increase in fiscal 2017 revenues, mainly driven by a 2% rise in TurboTax federal units and a shift in product mix.The company’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The analysts covering the stock expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, thereby boosting the overall top-line performance. Furthermore, the company’s TurboTax products derive high margins which will likely cushion its bottom-line results.Elevated Expenses to Hurt ProfitabilityIntuit’s high costs and expenses remain a major concern. In addition, during the last quarterly earnings conference call, the company had hinted that it would increase investments in engineering and marketing to grab the growing opportunity globally. Therefore, analysts are cautious about the company’s bottom-line results.What Does the Zacks Consensus Estimate Say?Analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $855 million, up 9.9% from the year-ago quarter. However, earnings are projected at 5 cents per share — reflecting an estimated year-over-year decline of 23.6%.Furthermore, our proven model does not conclusively show that Intuit is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Intuit currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -12.73%. The combination of Intuit's Zacks Rank #3 and negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Intuit Inc.

The figure is expected to further increase in the upcoming quarter, driven by strength in services and consumables across all geographical regions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter is pegged at $392 million.Strength in DGG & LSAG a Big PositiveIn the last quarter, revenues from Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) came in at $197 million. The segment was up 9% year over year, driven by strength in pharma, diagnostic and clinical end-markets. All businesses under this group (Dako, Genomics and Nucleic Acid Solutions) performed well. The segment is expected to perform well in the upcoming quarter too.

The company has shifted its focus to life sciences, genomics, diagnostics and wireless test markets, in which it has made a few important acquisitions and alliances.Agilent’s broad-based portfolio and increased focus on segments offer higher growth potential. The company’s decision to divest/wind up underperforming businesses has enhanced its focus on the new Agilent, while enabling expansion of a solid recurring revenue base and diversification of geographic and industrial operations for growth. Also, the company’s focus on aligning investments toward more attractive growth avenues and innovative product launches is a positive.The company’s solid market position, acquisition strategy and increased focus on segments with growth potential remain major growth drivers.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if these have a negative Earnings ESP.

1932,ADBE,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Pegasystems, Inc. (PEGA  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in PEGA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 95 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 91 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Pegasystems has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 23 cents a share from 26 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 10.6% in the past month.Pegasystems Inc. Price and Consensus Pegasystems Inc. Price and Consensus | Pegasystems Inc. QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer - Software industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report).

The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 16.6%.Solid Growth Drivers Currently, there is strong demand for Adobe’s Creative Cloud software, which is adding subscribers.

1934,ADBE,"Many Americans and investors continue to be focused on a group of four technology firms that have become some of the biggest companies in the world, known simply by the acronym “FANG.”The phrase, created and popularized by CNBC's Jim Cramer, refers toFacebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)—formally Google. These companies have all been extremely successful in recent years, experiencing continued sales growth and massive surges in their stock prices—which has spurred many investors to jump on board.Shares of FANG companies are all up over 20% since the start of the year, with Facebook’s 46.66% year-to-date price change leading the charge.Interestingly enough, Bank of American Merrill Lynch (BAC  -  Free Report) recently added two more names to the mix to create “FAAANG.” Savita Subramanian added Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) to the group of mega technology players.This might make some investors start to wonder if the core four FANG stocks are poised to keep growing this year, as several new companies are starting to be added to the conversation related to high-performance tech stocks.So are FANG stocks set to pop as we head full force into Q4? Let’s look to see how the next few quarters and the full-year are shaping up for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet.FacebookFacebook is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and the stock sports “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Based on our consensus estimates, Facebook’s current-quarter sales are projected to skyrocket 40.45%. For the full-year, the company’s revenues are set to pop 41.93% to hit as high as $40 billion. The social media giant’s earnings are set to pop 19.33% this quarter and 26.47% for the full year.Within the last 60 days, Facebook has received 11 upward earnings estimate revisions and zero negative revisions. During this same time frame, the firm has received 11 positive estimate revisions for the next quarter and 12 for the year, all without being downgraded.Amazon Despite Amazon’s extended run of success, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The firm’s “F” grade for Value in our Style Scores system helps to bring down its overall VGM grade, even with its “A” scores for both Growth and Momentum.The company’s 27.54% year-to-date price change is impressive and beats the S&P 500 average of 10.56%. But things could change for Amazon in the next few quarters. Over the last 60 days, the company has been dragged down by a wave of negative earnings estimate revisions, which greatly affect the Zacks Rank.The company has earned 10 downward revisions for its current quarter, and nine for its next quarter, while earning zero upward revisions. In this same 60-day time frame, Amazon has earned 11 downward revisions for both its current full-year and following year earnings estimates—again with no upward changes. Amazon’s sales are projected to continue to surge, with our consensus estimates calling for 28.45% growth this quarter and 28.71% growth for the year to hit an eye-popping $176.58 billion.But Amazon has spent billions and billions of dollars during its wave of expansion into almost every industry possible over the last few years. This has hurt the company’s bottom line and diminished potentially-larger earnings. Amazon’s earnings are expected to plummet 103.57% in its current quarter and 29.13% for the year.Netflix This streaming video company has obviously helped to shake up the movie and television industry as we know it. Netflix’s 45.96% year-to-date price change came in just below FANG category leader Facebook. This growth is set to continue, despite the company’s current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) status.Netflix’s revenues are expected to balloon to as high as $11.55 billion for its full-year, which would mark 30.47% year-over-year growth. Within the last 60 days, the streaming service has received 13 upward earnings estimate revisions and no downward changes. Within that same time frame, Netflix has earned 13 upward revisions and to just one negative for the full-year.Based on our consensus estimate, Netflix’s earnings are projected to pop 165.56% for its current quarter and soar 177.05% for the year.Google/Alphabet Alphabet’s market cap is the largest of the four FANG companies and its stock price has experienced a 21.75% year-to-date price change, which tops the S&P average but falls short of some of its peers’ more lofty gains. Google’s parent company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has received a mixed-bag of earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and the following quarter. For the full-year, Alphabet’s 13 negative earnings estimate revisions, with no upward changes, is the worst among FANG. Alphabet’s revenues are projected to gain around 20% for the quarter and the year to hit an upward estimate of $89.04 billion. However, the internet giant’s earnings are set to fall 7.39% for the quarter and 9.91% for the year.Bottom Line All four FANG tech companies are set to see their revenues jump at very impressive rates during the quarter and the year—with Facebook expected to post the biggest gains. Netflix’s earnings are projected to skyrocket almost 180% for the year. But Alphabet and Amazon are set to see major quarterly and full-year earnings declines.It seems, that for now, growth investors might want to consider Facebook and Netflix over the other two FANG firms. But Alphabet and Amazon are still likely strong long-term plays.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1936,ADBE,"The Priceline Group Inc.  reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 earnings.Non-GAAP net earnings of $35.22 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 91 cents and were better than the guided range of $32.4-$34.1 per share. Earnings increased over twofold sequentially and 18.6% year over year.Revenues of $4.43 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $89 million and were up a whopping 46.6% sequentially and 20.1% year over year.On a year-over-year basis, both agency and merchant business showed strong momentum. Room nights and Rental cars performed impressively. The only point of weakness was airline tickets. On the call, management stated that the company will continue to focus on investments in people, systems and marketing with a long-term outlook.Overall, we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market, Priceline’s strong position in international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position.However, weaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs. Year to date, the stock has surged 16.5%, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 61.5%.Let’s check out the numbers.Revenues in DetailsPriceline generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 16/77% in the third quarter (previous quarter split was (15/79%).Merchant revenues were up 37.4% sequentially and 10.3% year over year. Agency revenues increased 51.1% sequentially and 21.8% year over year.Advertising & Other revenues were up 16.5% sequentially and 27.1% from last year. This is basically non inter-company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.The Priceline Group Inc. Revenue (TTM) The Priceline Group Inc. Revenue (TTM) | The Priceline Group Inc. QuoteOn a sequential basis, room nights volumes increased 4.3%. However, rental car days decreased 8.9% and airline tickets were down 5.9%. On a year-over-year basis, room nights were up 18.6%, rental car days increased 5.5% while airline ticket volumes were down 11.8%.Priceline’s room night growth is attributable to its geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tends to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from local and international players. The company saw average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs decline 1% year over year. Rentalcars.com also did quite well but there was some softness in ticket volumes.BookingsPriceline’s overall bookings were up 4.6% sequentially and 17.9% (16% in constant currency) year over year and were at the higher end of the guided range.Merchant bookings were up 11.2% sequentially and 17.2% year over year. Agency bookings increased 3.6% sequentially and 18% from the year-ago levels.Margins and Net IncomePriceline reported pro forma gross margin of 98.7%, up 106 basis points (bps) sequentially and 141 bps year over year.Owing to the nature of its business and the mix of agency versus merchant revenues, management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter. Priceline’s gross profit dollars were up 48.2% sequentially but up 21.9% (19% in constant currency) from last year. It was also higher than the guidance. International gross profit grew 23% (20% on a constant currency basis). U.S. gross profit grew 11% from last year.Priceline’s adjusted operating income was up triple digit sequentially and 18.2% year over year to $2.1 billion. Operating margin of 48.4% was up 1749 bps sequentially but down 78 bps from the year-ago quarter.Priceline’s GAAP net income was $1.7 billion or $34.43 a share, compared with $720.2 million, or $14.39 a share in the June quarter and $506 million, or $10.13 a share in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetPriceline ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $7.3 billion compared with $6.4 billion at the end of the second quarter. As of Sep 30, 2017, Priceline generated $3.5 billion of cash from operations.

1937,ADBE,"ON Semiconductor Corporation (ON  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of 25 cents per share, much higher than the year-ago earnings of 2 cents per share. Earnings increased 14% sequentially.The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 40 cents per share.The company reported non-GAAP revenues of $1.39 billion, which surged 46% year over year and 4% from the previous quarter. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 billion. The figure was in line with the upper end of the guided range of $1.34-$1.39 billion.The year-over-year growth was driven by strong demand and adoption of the company’s diversified product portfolio for automotive, industrial and communications end-markets. Management is particularly positive about the strong operating model followed by ON Semi.Shares of ON Semi have gained 67.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 28.6% rally. Revenue DetailsON Semi has three business units namely – Power Solutions Group or PSG (revenues of $706 million), Analog Solutions (revenues of $492 million) and Image Sensor Group (revenues of $193 million).Automotive (30% of revenues) end-market revenues were approximately $411 million, up 30% year over year and were almost flat quarter over quarter. In the quarter, the company’s CMOS image sensors, power management products, mixed signal ASICs and sensor interface products witnessed strong demand.Industrial (25%) end-market revenues increased 51% year over year and 1% sequentially to $349 million. The company noted that its Python line of products for machine vision applications continues to grow at an impressive rate.Demand in industrial end-markets was driven by power modules and power management semiconductor solutions for industrial applications. The addition of Fairchild’s offerings to its product portfolio has made it further lucrative. Management expects the growth trend in this market segment primarily driven by the requirement of higher energy efficient products and automation related products to boost its market share.Communications (20%) end-market revenues grew 50% year over year and 9% quarter over quarter to $282 million. The company exited the mobile image sensor market during the second quarter. However, new platforms and increased adoption of the company’s content on major platforms offset the negative impact of the exit. Management is optimistic about the acceptance of USB Type-C solutions in the smartphone market.Computing (11%) grew 58% year over year and 16% quarter over quarter to $157 million, pertaining to the impressive performance of client and server solutions segments. Consumer (14%) end-market revenues grew 59% on a year-over-year basis and approximately 2% sequentially to $192 million. Strong performance of white goods consisting of heavy consumer durables contributed to segment revenues.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ON Semiconductor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ON Semiconductor Corporation QuoteMarginsNon-GAAP gross margin was 37.9%, up 100 basis points (bps) sequentially and 205 bps year over year, backed by revenue growth and improved operational efficiency. A favorable product mix also boosted margins.Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.6%, reflecting a sequential increase of 190 bps and a ear-over-year increase of 370 bps.Balance SheetCash & cash equivalents were $901.2 million, up from $871.6 in the previous quarter. In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $328 million compared with $333.2 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was $238 million, down from $264.2 million in the previous quarter.GuidanceON Semi reiterated its annual synergies run rate from the Fairchild acquisition to be $180 million. The company targets annual synergy rate of $240 million from the acquisition by the end of 2019.Management expects to see strong growth in revenue contribution from Fairchild in the near to mid-term. In the fourth-quarter, automotive revenues are expected to increase sequentially backed by the ramp up of IGBTs for electric vehicle traction motors in China. Revenues from industrial, computing, consumer and communications end markets are however expected to go down sequentially due to seasonality.ON Semi now forecasts revenues to be in the range of $1.33–$1.38 billion in fourth-quarter 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be in the range of approximately 36.8%–38.3%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are expected in the range of $294–$308 million.For 2017, On Semi now expects free cash flow of around $700 million, up from the prior guidance of $600–$650 million.ConclusionON Semi is benefiting from a diversified customer base as none of the end markets generate more than 5% of the revenues, thus lowering the risk of customer concentration.Divestiture of non-core and underperforming business segments are also proving to be beneficial for the company’s margins. The company anticipates consistent growth backed by high-margin products meant for the automotive and industrial end markets. Additionally, per management, past investments in the automotive, industrial and communications end markets are also reaping benefits.Moreover, integration and optimization of Fairchild’s manufacturing operations is anticipated to further boost the company’s profitability. Most recently, the company integrated Fairchild’s IT systems. The company is already enjoying cross-selling opportunities to a combined customer base that is aiding its top line and we believe this will help in improving its performance going forward.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderON Semiconductor carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1938,ADBE,"We issued an updated research report on premium scientific and technical instruments company, MKS Instruments, Inc. (MKSI  -  Free Report), on Oct 6.In the last month, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have yielded a return of 91.2%, outperforming 57.4% growth recorded by the industry.Notably, the attractiveness of this stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable VGM Score  B.Also, the stock’s projected sales growth is 41.8% and earnings per share growth is 79.5% for 2017 compared to the respective tallies of 10.7% and 57.1% estimated for the industry. Moreover, the company’s earnings are projected to be up 15.7% in the next three to five years.Why Should You Grab the Stock?MKS Instruments has a well-balanced technology portfolio and intends to boost its market share on the back of solid customer relationships. Semiconductor, electronic thin film, life & health sciences, research & defense, and process & industrial technologies are the major advanced and booming business domains of the company.  The company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues surpassed the year-ago tallies by 95.8% and 47.5% respectively. This upside stemmed from the robust semiconductor and other advanced markets’ sales. Premium technologies of MKS Instruments (such as the Green Idle Mode technology) and state-of-the-art products (like the EtherCAT pressure control product line) help solve complex end-user problems, in turn, strengthening the company’s customer relationships. The company believes these positives, as well as sturdy sales generated from the life sciences, general industrial and research end markets will likely drive its top- and bottom-line performance in the quarters ahead.Moreover, MKS Instruments intends to boost its financial fundamentals through strategic inorganic moves. For instance, the Newport Corporation acquisition (completed in April 2016) is driving the company’s top and bottom lines, by reinforcing its presence in the Life Sciences, Semiconductor, Research and Industrial markets. On the back of this buyout, the company anticipates generating $40 million cost synergies by the end of 2017.In addition, on Apr 3, 2017, MKS Instruments successfully divested its Data Analytics Solutions business to Sartorius Stedim Biotech. MKS Data Analytics Solutions offers a premium solution to end users, named Umetrics Suite. The company secured after-tax gain of $72 million cash from the spin-off process and intends to fund productive capital investment programs with the proceeds.MKS Instruments has also implemented a new financial strategy aimed at reducing interest expenses and deleveraging its balance sheet over the long term. Earlier this July, the company noted that it has successfully accomplished the third repricing of secured term loan and thereby trimmed the interest expense of its term loan by 50 basis points (from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 2.25%). Notably, via two consecutive prepayments, MKS Instruments reduced its principle owing amount from $780 million to $523 million.The company projects to report earnings within $1.32-$1.56 per share and revenues within $450-$490 million in third-quarter 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Applied Materials, Inc.

1939,ADBE,"Shares of Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS  -  Free Report) have rallied to a new 52-week high of $40.33, eventually closing a bit lower at $40.25 on Oct 4.The momentum can be attributed to the strong adoption of the company’s products and expanding customer base, which drove top-line growth. In the last quarter, revenues increased 5.7% year over year to $479 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $478 million.Moreover, Cadence has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters with a positive average of 1.62%.Currently, Cadence has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, the stock has a market capital of $11.06 billion.Further, Cadence’s stock has returned 59.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 25.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Strong Product Adoption, New launches: Key CatalystsCadence is benefiting from strong adoption of products like Palladium Z1, Protium S1 FPGA-based prototyping system, Innovus and Tensilica. Most recently, the company’s Genus Synthesis solution was selected by Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd. to improve the development of its multi-functional printer SoCs.Additionally, the launch of the company’s design integration platform Virtuoso system is a positive.Recently, Cadence launched Conformal Smart Logic Equivalence Checker (LEC), which delivers an average of 4 times runtime improvement compared with the previous generation of logic equivalency checking tools with the same compute resources.The company also launched Allegro PCB DesignTrue DFM technology, the industry's first solution to perform real-time, in-design design-for-manufacturing (DFM) checks integrated with electrical, physical and spacing design rule checks (DRCs).We also believe that increasing investments on emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems presents significant growth opportunity for the company in the long haul.In this regard, Cadence’s set of Design for Manufacturing (DFM) tools are now qualified on Samsung Electronics' 28nm FD-SOI/14nm/10nm process technologies. This will enable customers to develop complex, advanced-node designs for the automotive, mobile, IoT, high-performance compute (HPC) and consumer markets.Moreover, the company’s full-flow digital and signoff tools and custom/analog tools are now certified for Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) 22FFL process.Collaborations Expanding Product PortfolioCadence also collaborated with TSMC to advance 7nm FinFET Plus design innovation for mobile and HPC platforms.Moreover, the company announced that it is building the first Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (CCIX) test chip by using TSMC 7nm FinFET process technology. For this, Cadence is partnering with Xilinx (XLNX  -  Free Report), Arm and TSMC.CCIX will allow various system components to access and process data irrespective of where it resides and without the need for complex programming environments. By using the existing server interconnect infrastructure, CCIX will deliver higher bandwidth, lower latency and cache coherent access to shared memory. The company expects to deliver the test chip in early 2018.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has remained steady at $1.39 over the last 30 days. The estimate for fiscal 2018 has also been steady at $1.51 over the same time frame.Stock to ConsiderAdobe Systems Inc.

Net revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $1.31-$1.46 billion, which at the mid-point implies 3.4% growth from the year-ago quarter and 4.5% growth sequentially.NetApp stock has gained 31.4% year to date, outperforming the 21% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to ConsiderDuring the soon-to-be-reported quarter, NetApp partnered with Pixit Media for the purpose of providing scalability and quicker as well as reliable content access to Framestore, a prominent creative studio.Notably, CloudOps, a cloud consulting and services company, created an on-premise subscription based software, backed by NetApp’s flash storage system, SolidFire. This infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) software will work as a self-service portal primarily for management of cloud service orchestrator services.Additionally, the enhancement of the solutions portfolio with the addition of NVMe-enabled solution on the market and NetApp Converged Infrastructure Solution for Data Analytics is expected to drive its top line. Further, the enrichment of hybrid cloud data services with NetApp SolidFire Element OS, StorageGRID Webscale, ONTAP and OnCommand Insight software solutions are further tailwinds.We note that the company’s initiative to deliver better digital customer experience is also evident from the launch of its artificial intelligence (AI) enabled virtual support assistant, Elio.

1944,ADBE,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 9.The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 3%. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $3.30 per share, reflecting a beat of 5.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTransDigm’s excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies guided by three value driver concepts, has helped it generate sufficient organic & inorganic growth along with drive operating margin expansion over the past few quarters. The company anticipates business operation model to prove consistently conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter as well.TransDigm designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems with a significant aftermarket presence. For instance, about 90% of the company’s sales are generated by proprietary engineered products, that is, products for which the company owns the intellectual property. We believe this would enhance the revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle, consequently supplementing its financials.Of late, the company’s Defense business has also been performing better than expectations adding to its strength. Moreover, a diversified revenue base reduces the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and will continue to play a significant role in maintaining financial performance in the upcoming quarters.However, TransDigm is plagued with negative trends of late, like weaker defense aftermarket orders and soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues. This is likely to strain its top-line growth in the fiscal fourth-quarter results.This apart, in recent times the company’s commercial transportation business is suffering from inventory management issues from OEM customers, much of which appears due to rate reductions on wide-body platforms. Further, softness in this market can be traced to a decline in various fleet refurbishment projects. The refurbishment orders are getting rescheduled or delayed, which in turn may also dampen the fourth-quarter results.Further, the company’s interest expenses have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, the company anticipates its debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017. Thus, we believe that rising interest expenses will continue to pressure the company’s profits, going forward.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for TransDigm this time around.

1949,ADBE,"Although we’re not in a traditionally busy earnings period, there are several key reports to look forward to next week. Q2 earnings season was strong across the board, as broad-based growth reached the double digit levels for the second quarter in a row. These first reports could set the trend for the upcoming Q3 season, so investors will want to keep a close eye on the companies reporting soon.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of September 18.1.       Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report)San Jose-based Adobe System is one of the largest software companies in the world. Adobe is a leading provider in the digital marketing and digital media spaces, and its Creative Cloud studio is an industry standard. The company is set to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market closes on September 19.According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Adobe is expected to report earnings of $1.00 per share and revenues of $1.81 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 34% and 24%, respectively. Adobe also has a positive Earnings ESP of 1.04%, which implies that analyst sentiment has warmed as we’ve approached its report date. However, since the stock is also a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), the predictive power of this figure is nullified. 2.       FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report)FedEx is one of just a few notable names in the global delivery services industry, and the company has actually underperformed its rivals recently. In fact, over the past three months, the industry as a whole has gained 9.5% on average, and United Parcel Service (UPS) has gained about 10.5%. FedEx, however, is lagging behind with just a 7.9% gain over the time.FedEx will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on September 19. The company recently committed to modernizing its fleet, but that has led to subdued fiscal 2018 guidance. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings growth of just 9%, and FDX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 3.       The Finish Line, INc. Athletic apparel and footwear retailer Finish Line is scheduled to release its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on September 22. Finish Line shares are down about 44% year-to-date, and the company has struggled to adapt to a changing retail environment that has punished mall-based chains like itself.Heading into its report date, Finish Line is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for profits to slump by over 75% year-over-year. Still, Finish Line is sporting an “A” grade for Value and an overall VGM grade of “A.” Want more stock market analysis from this author?

Again, Workday has recently been placed in the “Leader” quadrant in Gartner’s “Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for Midmarket and Large Enterprises” report.Workday Planning and Workday Learning — the two new applications of the company — have also demonstrated well in terms of sale by adding over 140 and 165 new customers, respectively, in the last-reported quarter.

1954,ADBE,"Tech Data Corp. (TECD  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 31. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 34.53%. It has reported positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.73%.Revenues increased 28.5% to $7.7 million in the last quarter, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.3 million.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, Tech Data forecasts net sales in the range of $8.55-$8.80 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in the range of $1.95-$2.08 per share.We note that shares have outperformed the industry in the past one year. While the industry gained 38.2%, the stock has returned 47.3%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at Play We believe that Tech Data is well positioned to achieve strong growth based on increasing demand for data center systems, cloud and mobility offerings in the long run. The company’s efforts to diversify into new domains are significantly positive.We also note that the company has a diversified customer base in both North America and Europe. In addition, Tech Data continues to strengthen its position in the small and medium-business (SMB) customer segment in several countries.Acquisitions and strategic alliances have been an integral part of the company’s growth strategy. The company completed the acquisition of the Technology Solutions business from Avnet (AVT  -  Free Report) in February 2017. The combination looks promising, with Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure already added to its Cloud Marketplace.But lower demand for legacy enterprise servers and storage might dampen growth. Nevertheless, growing corporate PC demand in North America is a positive.However, its exit from businesses in less profitable regions, though a positive in the long run, will weigh on near-term results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Tech Data is likely to beat earnings in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Tech Data is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.04. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tech Data Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Tech Data Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Tech Data Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Tech Data’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with an ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is a stock you may want to consider as our model shows that this has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.54% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

1955,ADBE,"In a matter of just a few years, “the Cloud” has evolved from a budding new tech feature to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector. Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software-related companies, and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech-focused investors.New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape, and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud. The markets have been paying attention, and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud-based companies, or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations.With this in mind, we’ve highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud-related activity, but also strong fundamental metrics. Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now:1. Workday, Inc. (WDAY  -  Free Report)Workday designs enterprise cloud applications for human resources and finance. It provides its customers—which fall in the tech, financial services, business services, healthcare, retail, and other industries—with the tools to manage critical business functions using industry-leading cloud solutions.WDAY is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is certainly an explosive growth pick. Based on current analyst estimates, we expect Workday to report EPS growth of 23% and revenue growth of 26% this fiscal year. Its valuation is stretched, but the stock also looks interesting from an earnings momentum perspective, having added 37% to its full-year EPS estimates within the past quarter. This means analyst sentiment has remained positive recently. 2. Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report)Adobe Systems is a provider of graphic design, publishing, and imaging software for Web and print production. The company’s main offering is its “Creative Cloud,” which is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product that allows users to access all of Adobe’s tools at one monthly price. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy).ADBE has been on an absolute tear lately, surging more than 70% in the past year. Interestingly enough, however, the stock sold off a bit after its latest earnings beat, giving investors a unique opportunity to buy as it continues to rebound.Shares are now trading at their lowest forward earnings multiple in a year. Plus, the company has plenty of expansion opportunity left. Earnings growth is expected to reach 53.6% in the current fiscal year, and Adobe is projected to see a long-term annualized EPS growth rate of more than 16% in the coming years. 3. Progress Software Corporation (PRGS  -  Free Report)Progress develops software and cloud-based products that assist clients with application deployment, application management, data connectivity, web content management, and predictive analytics. The company has shifted its focus to cloud computing and is looking to expand its cloud subscription offerings. Currently, PRGS is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In its recently-reported quarter, the firm surpassed earnings estimates for the seventh-consecutive period, inspiring some positive estimate revisions for upcoming quarters. This is a stock to love based on its earnings growth, with consensus estimates calling for EPS expansion of 21% this quarter and 31% for the full fiscal year. But shares are also trading at an attractive 15.3x forward 12-month earnings. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.66%.Notably, on a year-to-date basis, Applied Materials’ shares have returned 74.7%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 67.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Strong Demand for Applied’s ServicesThe company has well-differentiated products and high market share, and is efficiently delivering key enabling technology to logic and foundry customers. Service is an important part of Applied's portfolio, which grew significantly in the last quarter. The Applied Global Services (AGS) segment increased 8.6% sequentially and 19.6% year over year. The figure is further expected to increase in the upcoming quarter, driven by improved device and yield performance. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the upcoming quarter for AGS is pegged at $812 million.Strength in Display to Drive RevenuesThe company has gained considerable success in expanding beyond semiconductors, particularly in display. New display technologies such as OLED are opening new market opportunities for Applied Materials. The available market opportunity is now more than 10 times that of the traditional LCD. In the last quarter, the Display segment was up 4.9% sequentially and 31.0% from the year-ago level. The segment is further expected to perform well driven by significant opportunities coming from investments in areas such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality and smart vehicles. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the upcoming quarter for Display segment is pegged at $676 million.However, increasing competition, high fixed-cost structure and customer concentration remain major concerns, which could affect the results in the upcoming quarter.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if these have a negative Earnings ESP.

Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1965,ADBE,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is well past the halfway mark with 372 S&P 500 members, representing 74.4% of the index’s total market capitalization, having already released their results.Picture Thus FarPer the latest Earnings Outlook, total earnings of these companies are up 7.8% on a year-over-year basis (74.9% of the companies beat EPS estimates). Total revenues are up 6.5% (65.7% of the companies beat top-line estimates).The earnings performance of the same set of companies has been unimpressive compared with the previous quarter but in line with the four-quarter average. Revenue growth is notably tracking higher.Third-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 5.5%. Notwithstanding the weak performance of the Finance sector, total earnings from the remaining index are expected to rise 11% while revenues are anticipated to grow 6.9% on a year-over-year basis.Notably, earnings estimate revisions for the fourth quarter continue to be favorable.On Nov 6, two Internet commerce stocks — The Priceline Group Inc.  and TripAdvisor, Inc. (TRIP  -  Free Report) — are scheduled to announce their third-quarter 2017 results. Let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact their results.Predictions for PricelineStrong agency revenues are expected to drive international results. Priceline generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 16/77% in the second quarter.We expect agency revenues to grow both sequentially and year over year in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by strength across priceline.com and booking.com. While priceline.com is expected to benefit from room night growth, booking.com is likely to ride on vacation rental properties growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for agency revenues is pegged at $3.5 billion. In the second quarter, agency revenues had increased 30.6% sequentially and 25.9% year over year.We observe that Priceline shares have gained 30.1% year to date, underperforming the 58.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merchant revenues are also expected to grow both sequentially and year over year, driven by strength across agoda.com and rentalcars.com. While agoda.com is likely to benefit from discounting in markets, rentalcars.com is expected to ride on continuous operational improvements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for agency revenues is pegged at $621 million. In the second quarter, merchant revenues were up 12.7% sequentially and 3.8% year over year.The U.S. Commerce Department estimates international travel to the United States to witness CAGR of 3.3% from 2016 to 2021. Inbound travel volumes from Mexico, China, Canada, India and South Korea will be the highest during this period. Visitor volume in 2017 is expected to be up 2.4% from 2016. Since it is a major international player, these trends play into Priceline’s sweet spot and will have an impact on its quarterly performance.Predictions for TripAdvisorIn the second quarter, TripAdvisor’s average monthly unique visitors on the company’s branded websites and applications were approximately 415 million, increasing 18% year over year. The number is expected to increase in the soon-to-be reported quarter driven by its rich content.The company offers more than 465 million travel reviews and opinions, growing at more than 290 contributions per minute. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $454 million.TripAdvisor’s Hotel segment revenues of $326 million increased 4% sequentially and 3%  year over year in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $328 million. Average monthly unique hotel shoppers were 153 million in the last reported quarter, increasing 11% year over year. Click-based and transaction revenues per hotel shopper decreased 2% year over year. We observe that TripAdvisor shares have lost 17.9% year to date, significantly underperforming the 58.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Lately, the company has been making efforts to get travelers to book hotels directly on its website instead of just using it as a review site. These efforts will continue to boost the company’s clicked-based advertising and transaction revenues, expanding its top-line growth in the third quarter.TripAdvisor’s non-Hotel segment revenues of $98 million increased 69% sequentially and 31% from the year-ago quarter. Growth will continue to accelerate, driven primarily by continued strength in attractions and restaurant businesses.However, mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company’s profits. Also, management has been spending huge amounts on acquisitions. Though these continued investments could boost the top line, it can have a negative impact on near-term profitability.What Our Model SaysPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.

QuoteWhat is Driving Better-than-Expected Earnings?Palo Alto allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose stringent security measures through its network security platform.The company is gaining customer accounts and increasing penetration of existing customers, consequently driving revenue growth. During the third quarter, the company added over 2,000 customers, bringing the total to approximately 39,500 worldwide, which includes over 86 of the Fortune 100 and more than 60% of the Global 2,000.It is to be noted that in each of the last 21 quarters, Palo Alto has added at least 1,000 customers. The vast customer base presents the company an opportunity to upsell products within its installed user base. Any product revamp brings in additional dollars as enterprises attempt to keep threat-management infrastructure updated. These factors, in turn, support the top line.Revenue growth seems to be steady, aided by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Customer wins along with expansion of the company’s existing customer base are other positives. We believe that its product refreshes and acquisition synergies will boost revenues, going forward.Notably, Palo Alto has strong record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 4.07%.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our proven model shows these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Micron Technology, Inc.

1969,ADBE,"According to an article in Svenska Dagblade, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) is planning to cut 25,000 jobs outside Sweden in a desperate bid to contain costs and take its restructuring efforts to the next level. Although CEO Börje Ekholm announced impending job cuts earlier this month, the sheer magnitude has left industry insiders stunned.Last month, the beleaguered infrastructure giant announced that it plans to double its 2016 underlying operating margin of 6% by ramping up its cost-reduction drive. To meet this end, Ericsson announced to implement cost savings with an annual run rate effect of at least SEK 10 billion ($1.2 billion) by mid-2018.Job Cuts in StoreOver the past year, the company has sacked 7000 jobs in North America. The company is striving hard to slash common and service delivery costs, while keeping research and development costs unaltered. Details of the latest planned layoffs has been kept under wraps, as Ericsson did not comment which departments or countries will bear most of the brunt.People familiar with the matter expect that the troubled media business, which is under review, and Managed Services division may be the worst affected. If sources are to be believed, Ericsson has plans to streamline operations by a whopping 80-90% in some markets and centralize operations in others.Headwinds GaloreThe premium networking, telecommunications equipment and services provider’s financial troubles over the past few years have been well documented. Ericsson’s repeated earnings misses, eroding profitability and precipitous revenue decline have left investors high and dry. Also, shrinking gross margins have been putting immense pressure on the bottom line. The stock has lost 9% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s average decline of 4.3%.Concurrent with its second-quarter 2017 results, the company slashed its full-year guidance, signaling bleak times ahead. Mr. Ekholm warned that an uncertain market could wipe out as much as SEK 5 billion ($600 million) of operating income over the next year. There is also an increased risk of market and customer project adjustments, which can have a negative impact of SEK 3-5 billion on the operating income in the coming 12 months.The consensus analyst community is showing no favor toward the stock, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 earnings has tumbled from 27 cents to 3 cents, dragged by three downward estimate revisions versus zero upward. Most of the company’s troubles have stemmed from drying-up investments by major telecom equipment makers across the world.These companies continue to slash investments in 4G and 3G services while waiting for the introduction of 5G networks. Ericsson expects a high single-digit percentage drop in the market for radio access networks this year, which is worse than previously expected. Also, sky-rocketing restructuring expenses, as part of itsconsistent efforts to turn around its ailing business, are making matters worse for Ericsson.Despite these challenges, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company believes that its cost-streamlining efforts, with focus on structural changes, will help generate lasting efficiency gains and boost cost competitiveness. Also, the company’s focus on stabilizing its IT and cloud-product portfolio, and Managed Services business is expected to be conducive to long-term growth.It remains to be seen whether Ekholm’s restructuring plan can help Ericsson improve profitability and revitalize its leadership in technology and markets.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

1970,ADBE,"Continuing its earnings streak for the sixth consecutive quarter, Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report), yesterday, delivered splendid third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom lines both came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported adjusted earnings per share (excluding all one-time items but including stock-based compensation expenses) of 84 cents, which came in 37.7% higher than the year-ago quarter’s adjusted earnings of 61 cents. On a non-GAAP basis (excluding all one-time items), earnings came in at 92 cents per share, up from 76 cents posted in third-quarter fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at 69 cents.The robust year-over-year bottom-line performance was mainly driven by strong revenue growth and efficient cost management. The company’s third-quarter revenues jumped 13% year over year to $695.4 million and came toward the higher-end of the previously guided range of $685-$700 million (mid-point $692.5 million).Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $690 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys’ products, and strength in IP and hardware products. About 90% of the revenues came from the backlog in the beginning of the quarter and the remaining 10% was contributed by a customer.Despite reporting strong quarterly results, shares of Synopsys were down as much as 3.3% during yesterday’s after-hour trade, before settling down at 1.4%. This may be due to the fact that the company’s non-GAAP earnings came in toward the lower-end of the previously provided guidance range of 91-94 cents.Nonetheless, Synopsys stock has gained 34.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 22.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter in DetailSegment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $603.8 million, up nearly 10.5% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues surged 32.7% year over year to $91.6 million.Non-GAAP gross profit was $544.4 million, up approximately 8.9% from the year-ago period. However, as a percentage of revenues, it contracted 300 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 78.3%.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3.3% on a year-over-year basis to $377 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, the same descended 510 bps from the year-earlier quarter to 54.2%.Synopsys’ non-GAAP operating income was up 24.1% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $167.4 million. Operating margin expanded 220 bps on a year-over-year basis to 24.1%.The company’s non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $141.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 21.9%.Synopsys, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Synopsys, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSynopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.302 billion million compared with $1.131 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $411.3 million compared with $373.8 million in the last quarter.During the first three quarters, the company generated $449.7 million of cash flow from operational activities. The company repurchased $300 million worth of its common stock during the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The company has remaining $500 million for its current authorization.GuidanceBuoyed by better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, Synopsys raised its fiscal 2017 outlook. The company now expects fiscal 2017 revenues to be in the range of $2.670-$2.685 billion (previous guidance $2.650–$2.670 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.67 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $3.29 and $3.32 (previously $3.24 and $3.29). GAAP earnings are projected between $1.92 per share and $1.99 per share, up from $1.84-$1.97 guided earlier. However, operating cash flow is still expected to come in the range of $580-$600 million.Apart from this, the company initiated guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company expects revenues in the range of $642-$657 million (mid-point $649.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $643.29 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses within $535-$545 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 55-58 cents, while GAAP earnings are projected between 26 cents and 33 cents.Our TakeSynopsys posted impressive fiscal third-quarter results. Revenues as well as earnings improved year over year, mainly due to strength in hardware and IP products. Additionally, the company’s fourth-quarter and upbeat fiscal 2017 guidance are encouraging.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company’s recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its near-term performance. Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to its customers.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics Corp., a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Couple of better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are Red Hat, Inc.

1974,ADBE,"In a matter of just a few years, “the Cloud” has evolved from a budding new tech feature to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector. Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software-related companies, and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech-focused investors.New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape, and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud. The markets have been paying attention, and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud-based companies, or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations.With this in mind, we’ve highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud-related activity, but also strong fundamental metrics. Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now:1. Workday, Inc. (WDAY  -  Free Report)Workday designs enterprise cloud applications for human resources and finance. It provides its customers—which fall in the tech, financial services, business services, healthcare, retail, and other industries—with the tools to manage critical business functions using industry-leading cloud solutions.WDAY is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is certainly an explosive growth pick. Based on current analyst estimates, we expect Workday to report EPS growth of 23% and revenue growth of 26% this fiscal year. Its valuation is stretched, but the stock also looks interesting from an earnings momentum perspective, having added 37% to its full-year EPS estimates within the past quarter. This means analyst sentiment has remained positive recently. 2.

1976,ADBE,"We have seen a number of major earnings beats this earnings season, but we shouldn’t see this as the new norm that will continue through the rest of this reporting cycle. A company’s earnings outperformance is as much a function of the overall business environment as it is of management effectiveness in executing operating and strategic plans. As such, the very strong results from a company like McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) doesn’t mean that all restaurant operators stand to shine this earnings season. What it does mean is that the operating environment is favorable for earnings growth, with effectively run operators able to capitalize on opportunities. All in all, the fundamental backdrop is favorable to earnings growth.With respect to the Q2 scorecard, we now have results from 128 S&P 500 members that combined account for 36.1% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +7% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 77.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.3% beating revenue estimates.Putting results from these 128 index members in a historical context, the growth pace is below what we had seen in Q1, but is about in-line with the 4-quarter average and presents a notable improvement over the 12-quarter average, as the comparison chart below shows.Unlike the growth pace, the proportion of companies beating estimates is tracking above historical periods, as the comparison chart below shows. The proportion of companies beating revenue estimates is particularly notable.In terms of standout sectors, the Tech sector results have been strong, with total earnings for the 37% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported up +13.2% on +11.1% higher revenues, with 90.9% beating EPS estimates and 81.8% beating revenue estimates. I even see strength in the Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) earnings report that many in in the market found disappointing. For a company this big to be able to grow the top-line in excess of +20%, entirely through organic means, is very impressive. We will see how the rest of the Tech sector results come out in the coming days, but it is reasonable to be optimistic about the sector’s earnings prospects based on what we have seen already from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and others. The Finance sector’s results have not been well received, but they aren’t bad either. Total earnings for the 54.1% of the sector’s market cap that have reported already are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues, with 82.9% beating EPS estimates and 68.6% beating revenue estimates.It is relatively early for the Energy and Consumer Staple sectors, but both of those sectors have gotten off to a shaky start this earnings season.Beyond Q2, earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +4.8% from the same period last year in Q3. Estimates for the quarter have started coming down, with the current +4.8% growth pace down from more than +6% at the start of the quarter. This pace of negative revision is about in-line with what we had seen in the run up to the Q2 earnings season, which was a material improvement over what we had seen in the last two years.Unlike the decelerating quarterly growth pace, the overall level of quarterly earnings is in record territory, as the chart in the accompanying video shows.

1979,ADBE,"Software, the programs that interface between human and machine to increase the efficiency of everyday operation and communication, is taking over our lives. For one thing, children these days lead much more digitized lives than we ever did, and for another, we do a lot of things on our mobile phones than our parents ever did on their desktops. Suddenly, it’s cooler to create a Facebook post than personally talk to people about what’s going on with us.Exponential growth in the number of machines: The really strong growth in the number of machines didn’t really start until smartphones. But once it was discovered that basic communication devices can be programed to do much more, they became far more coveted. Smartphones are getting smarter by the day with companies even offering personal digital assistants, but consumers today have also incorporated other smart devices like wearables, connected home products and the Internet of Things.So everyday things that incorporate a chip can now collect and transfer information based on programs written for them. This has led to an expansion in the definition of machines to anything that can hold a chip, and that’s the scope of software for the consumer segment.Exponential growth in data: In the past, information was shared in a format that didn’t easily lend itself to management, organization and analytics. But with a large chunk of communication now happening through electronic devices, it becomes possible to collect, store and evaluate the data to generate information for businesses, healthcare providers and consumers.IDC estimates that the world will create 180 zettabytes of this data (or 180 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, up from less than 10 zettabytes in 2015. What’s more, it expects data monetization (the transformation of raw data to actionable information that is then sold for a price) to become a major revenue generator by 2017-end.Consequently, it estimates that the market for big data and business analytics will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7% from $130.1 billion in 2016 to more than $203 billion in 2020. Software programs work on the data at every stage and it’s again software that delivers the data where required.Cloud computing and virtualization: Both companies and individuals are getting increasingly comfortable with highly scalable shared infrastructure called the cloud. While a lot of work still remains to be done, the cloud has opened up huge possibilities for software companies, whether providing the infrastructure (IaaS), or hosting software (PaaS) or providing applications for specific functions (SaaS).Increased virtualization of workloads and computing resources, employing both public and hybrid cloud environments indicate that the growth trend will continue. Another point to note is the relatively low penetration of the cloud in the SMB segment, which is what prompted companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) to step up their game.Security: The growing digital assets of companies mean increasing demand for security software. Although the market hasn’t done exceptionally well in the last year, the secular growth prospects are obvious. Particularly considering the number of security attacks in recent times.   Digitization of entertainment: With companies like Netflix, Amazon, Google’s YouTube, Twitter and Facebook increasingly bringing us favorite shows, programs, movies and games on our digital devices, a growing number of people -- mainly millennials and Generation Z -- are moving away from TV. This is also broadening the market for software providers.Need for automation: Another driver is increasing automation, not only of routine mental jobs like customer care that can be handled by chatbots, but also on the factory floor where robots are taking over many routine functions. These bots work on the basis of their software programming and also increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence.As a result, a recent survey by Morgan Stanley of Chief Information Officers (people who determine and disburse IT budgets across industries) shows that the group expects external software spending to increase more than 4.2% this year beating IT budget growth rates of 3.5%.Given this backdrop, it isn’t hard to find stocks in the Zacks-categorized Computer-Software industry, which is in the top 41% of the 256 industries covered by Zacks. So here are a few you may want to put in the kitty, selected on the basis of their Buy ranks:Red Hat.
