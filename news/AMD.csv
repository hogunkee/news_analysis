0,AMD,"Earnings season is drawing to a close with most of the S&P 500 having reported already, making NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) easily the hottest earnings from last week. The online travel agents continued to disappoint, with both Priceline  and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) shares plummeting. These and Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) deal with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) were the top stories from last week-EarningsNVIDIA: NVIDIA reported very strong revenue and earnings growth in its fiscal third quarter, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both top and bottom lines. Gaming (driven by strength across geographies and form factors, Nintendo Switch and cryptocurrencies) Data Center (driven by cloud service providers and HPC) and Professional Visualization (driven by VR adoption at defense and automotive customers, stronger demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations) were all up strongly from last year. The guidance indicates that the strength will continue.Priceline: Priceline reported a strong quarter with both top and bottom lines ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus estimates. The company’s hotel revenues did better than its rental cars and flight bookings, both of which saw weaker volumes. While bookings at the start of the current quarter were at the high end of management expectations, so can’t be considered unusually weak, the guidance was disappointing even by Priceline’s standards (it usually guides conservatively). The reason for the weakness, especially on the hotels side isn’t clear but could be because of efforts by hotels to reach customers directly rather than through a distribution channel.TripAdvisor: TripAdvisor reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on revenues that disappointed. While revenues continued to grow albeit very slowly, earnings dropped over 32% from last year. The hotels side of the business was weak, with other revenues (from attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals) remaining strong. The company burnt cash and saw a reduction in its net cash position.Intel & AMD Finally Have a DealEveryone expected Intel and Advanced Micro Devices to get closer together after Intel’s forced licensing deal with archrival NVIDIA expired in Jan 2017. But one of the things that stood in the way was the fact that AMD also competed with Intel, on multiple fronts.For AMD, licensing technology to Intel would mean sacrificing profits from chip sales in exchange for royalties from a larger number of chips. It was likely a difficult decision, made easier only by the fact that their combination could help them take share in a market they were both targeting (i.e. high-end gaming laptops), one that is currently dominated by the common enemy NVIDIA.There are also other areas of interest. The first would be the shrinking PC market and Intel’s need to maintain position while investing in emerging areas like AI, cloud, IoT, auto, etc. The second would be AMD’s unattractive financials that would improve with a steady flow of revenues from Intel.Third, AMD’s limited presence in the PC gaming segment (the only part of the PC market that still has attractive growth rates) where its discrete GPUs are up against NVIDIA’s, but where Intel has limited presence because it only sells an integrated version. Marrying AMD graphics with Intel processing power would strengthen the integrated solution versus the discrete one.For those with any doubts about whether the relationship is a short term one or part of a larger-scale alliance between the two, it’s worth noting that AMD VP and chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group, Raja Koduri is now an Intel employee as its chief architect, SVP of its newly formed Core and Visual Computing Group, and GM of a new initiative to drive edge computing solutions.The actual product details are limited at this point, but Intel has said that this will be part of its 8th Gen Intel Core family, bringing together its high-performing Intel Core H-series processor, second generation High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) and a custom discrete graphics chip from AMD’s Radeon Technologies Group – all in a single processor package.The integration will be facilitated with Intel’s Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) that will be used for the first time in a consumer device. The purpose of the integration is to fit in more power and performance with better thermal dissipation and consuming less energy into a smaller form factor.TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+1.26%+11.90%FB-0.26%+18.71%GOOGL-0.56%+9.32%MSFT-0.32%+22.64%INTC-1.63%+28.28%CSCO-1.38%+1.61%AMZN+1.24%+17.05% Other StoriesCorporateApple Raising Debt Again: President Trump’s tax relief plans notwithstanding, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is going ahead and borrowing more cash to fund its $300 billion shareholder return program. 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year and 30-year fixed-rate notes with maturity dates in November 2019, November 2020, January 2023, January 2025, November 2027 and November 2047.Apple Supplier Planning India Expansion: Wistron Corp, Apple’s iPhone assembler in India is looking for 100 acres of land in Bangalore and have short-listed a few parcels of land, Bloomberg reports. Apple currently assembles only the SE in India and all the high end models are still imported, so they have an import duty stacked on the already-high prices. Nevertheless, Wistron said that the additional capacity may also be used for customers other than Apple.Raja Koduri Joins Intel: Intel plans to make a mark in the graphics chip business, where it is a secondary player to AMD and NVDIA. So just before NVIDIA reported, the company announced that it had whisked away Raja Koduri, senior vice president and chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group at AMD to head this effort. Koduri has more than 25 years of experience in graphics hardware, software and system architecture in visual and accelerated computing advances across a broad range of devices, including PCs, game consoles, professional workstations and consumer devices.Davidson Sees Cisco Share Loss: Mark Kelleher of D. A. Davidson is excited about Arista Networks’ stellar results and strong revenue growth rate and thinks it will continue to take market share away from Cisco for years to come. Accordingly, the analyst raised his price target on the shares from $180 to $224 while upgrading the shares from Neutral to Buy.The strong results were despite weaker-than-expected revenues from the top cloud vendors because of a product workaround related to Cisco patents, which therefore extended the qualification with them. Other analysts conceded that the company was growing strongly but also pointed to the rich valuation that kept some of them on the sidelines.Microsoft Buys Chevron Data Center: Just a day after Microsoft signed a 7-year deal to provide cloud computing services (including data analytics and IoT) to the giant energy company Chevron Corp, its subsidiary Chevron USA sold its 5200 Rogers Road data center to Microsoft. While the purchase price was kept under wraps, the Bexar County Appraisal District fixes the value at $80 million. The company’s massive operational scale generates 1TB of data per day, which can be processed to generate operational efficiencies and savings for the company.Tesla Nabs Microsoft Engineer: Microsoft just lost Scott Simms, one of the leading engineers at its video game engineering unit to Tesla as its ""Director of UI Engineering."" Simms’ LinkedIn profile says that he was involved in ""AR & 3D reconstruction on mobile devices.” He also says that he managed computer vision, UI and app teams developing monocular SLAM and 3D reconstruction running real time on resource constrained hardware.Amazon Pop-Ups at Whole Foods Stores: For the holidays, Amazon will be opening pop up stores within 100 Whole Foods outlets in Illinois, Michigan, Florida, California and Colorado so people can try Amazon devices and familiarize themselves with Prime and other subscriptions. Whole Foods is also offering Black Friday deals on Amazon's merchandise, including $20 off the Echo Dot, $20 off the new Amazon Echo, $30 off the new Echo Plus and $30 off the Fire HD 8 tablet.The stores already process Amazon returns and have Amazon lockers for product pickup. The integration is going well and further plans are afoot that might see Prime members getting special deals inside Whole Foods stores.Amazon’s Echo Group of Devices in Japan: Amazon has now introduced Alexa and its Echo group of devices to Japanese customers. Alexa for Japan has been built from the ground up especially for Japanese customers with a new Japanese voice, local knowledge and over 250 skills from Japanese developers.Legal/RegulatoryIsraeli Startup Claims Apple Infringed Its Tech: Tel Aviv-based Corephotonics, which has raised $50 million from several high-profile venture capital firms and other investors, has filed a patent infringement case against Apple. The company claims that Apple had used its patented dual camera technology in its Phone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus without authorization. According to the filed complaint, ""Apple’s lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics’ patents, telling [CEO] Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something.""Samsung Ventures, Apple supplier Foxconn and chipmaker MediaTek are investors in Corephotonics through its latest funding round in January. Other investors include Magma VC, Amiti Ventures, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Solina Chau’s Horizon Ventures, flash storage maker SanDisk and Chinese telephone services provider CK Telecom.Waymo-Uber Lawsuit Update: U.S. District Judge William Alsup, in an order the details of which were kept secret to allow both sides an opportunity to review his reasoning privately, has dealt a big blow to Alphabet’s Waymo in its case against Uber. The case was about the theft of intellectual property by one Anthony Levandowski, who stole files and transferred the information to his self-driving trucking company called Otto Trucking that was soon acquired by Uber.The ruling is a blow on two counts; the first being the disqualification of Waymo’s damages expert/striking out of the report on which he is relying (it’s hard to tell which or both from media reports currently available) and the second, the removal of Otto as a joint defendant in the case. Without the expert, it could be harder for Waymo to prove why it deserves a billion dollars in damages on a case involving technology that hasn’t yet come to market. Without Otto in the picture, it will be harder for Waymo to fix responsibility on Uber, since the technology moved through Otto to Uber.New Products/TechnologyApple AR Glasses: Bloomberg says that according to people familiar with the matter, Apple will have an AR headset powered by a new chip and with its own display and operating system ready to ship by 2019. Apple is moving aggressively, according to the people although the deadline could still get pushed back.CEO Tim Cook who is extremely positive about the technology, has said that he already sees how AR will “transform the way you work, play, connect and learn” and the way that’s it’s going to “change the way we use technology forever.”Housing Rentals Come to Facebook Marketplace: Facebook is partnering with companies like Apartment List and Zumper, which are in turn working with brokers, agents and property managers to greatly expand the list of housing rentals on the platform. Users looking for suitable homes will be able to filter results based on location, price, rental type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, pet-friendliness and other criteria. Users can also put up their own listings directly to the site using 360 degree images.Google Files Go: Google is working on a new app called Files Go to be available as a part of the stock Android version, for file management, sharing and cleaning. Sharing files on Android devices is possible, if not too comfortable today. So both users have to have the concerned app open and have to tap their phones together to make the connection via NFC. It’s awkward and not very well known among users. Files Go will likely solve this problem.Additionally, it will also help to clean up disk space. The app has a dashboard that shows how much storage your phone has left, a button to clear cached files, and suggestions to remove large files that you’re apparently not using any more, all with the goal of freeing up space. There’s also a files manager that lets you browse through local photos, videos, music and other documents.Amazon Fire TV Stick Across 100 Regions: Amazon has launched the basic version of its Fire TV stick in over 100 more countries, so people can simply plug the device into the HDMI port of their HDTVs to stream the latest shows, Amazon Prime content and also play games. Customers can also set their default language as Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian, German or English.Collaborations and M&AApple Acquired InVisage: Apple has acquired an image technology company that raised $98 million from various sources including Nokia and Intel Capital. The reason these companies were interested in InVisage is a technology called QuantumFilm that appears to be a breakthrough in materials science.This specialized device works with dedicated software to deliver highly accurate images in a very small form factor and even in low light conditions. Considering the way technology is developing, image processing is a super-important market with scope for application in not only smartphones and computing devices, but also IoT, security, automotive, AR/VR, filming and others.This is likely to be an important piece of technology for Apple, but one that we won’t know much more about because of the size of the acquisition that makes it immaterial to Apple’s operations, which therefore doesn’t carry a statutory requirement to disclose.Microsoft-Ola: Microsoft has signed an important alliance with Ola Cabs of India that will see the ride-hailing service transfer automotive data to Microsoft’s Azure instead of Amazon’s AWS and integrate Microsoft’s artificial intelligence and productivity tools into Ola Play (the company's existing connected car platform). This appears to be a step toward Ola’s self-driving car goals and furthers Microsoft’s objective of wresting corporate customers from AWS.In the meantime, it also enables improved in-car productivity (users get Office 365 and Skype for Business, as well as voice-assisted controls built using Microsoft Cognitive Services and Bot framework, in-car during their rides), vehicle diagnostics,  advanced navigation and predictive maintenance of vehicles. Ola recently raised around a $1 billion in a funding round that included Tencent and Japan’s Softbank.Google, Salesforce Get Cozier: Google and Salesforce are integrating their software so their solutions are more complete, useful and competitive versus offerings from Microsoft Azure. Of course Salesforce also integrates with AWS, the other major Azure (and Google Cloud) competitor. In Google’s case, the partnership involves Salesforce CRM working closer together with Google G Suite productivity apps so customers can make the most of Salesforce Lightning and Quip along with Gmail, Hangouts Meet, Google Calendar, Drive, Docs and Sheets.It also brings sales, marketing and advertising data across Salesforce Sales Cloud, Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Google Analytics 360 together for better number crunching. There are a number of benefits for Google as well: First, Google’s ability to offer better analytics to retailers competing with Amazon, which uses CRM from Salesforce.Second, Google gets access to those of the 150K Salesforce customers that are new to G Suite, thus expanding its enterprise customer base. (These customers will get a year’s worth of the service free of cost provided they qualify). Third, Salesforce will use Google infrastructure where required as it expands internationally (it only uses AWS now), which can only be positive for Google.Tencent Invests in Snap: Changes are coming to Snapchat, the oh-so-popular teen app from the company that doesn’t have the revenues to show for it. Most of its innovations are copied by Facebook in record time, which quickly rolls them out to its much larger customer base. The truth is, Snap can’t make it big without targeting a bigger audience. So it’s doing a number of things to grow the numbers, both users and engagement.The first is a redesign that will place personal stories on the left and curated content on the right to facilitate discovery. The second is the exploration of new strategies or avenues of growth, possibly through partnerships.The company also disclosed last week that China’s Tencent had bought 145.8 million non-voting shares in the company for an additional 12% stake. It’s likely that Tencent will bring gaming content to the platform. An emailed statement from the company reads thus: “The investment enables Tencent to explore cooperation opportunities with the company on mobile games publishing and newsfeed as well as to share its financial returns from the growth of its businesses and monetization in the future”.Some NumbersiPhone X Teardown: According to an IHS Markit teardown, the stainless steel case, 3-D facial recognition system on the front and 5.8-inch OLED screen of the iPhone X that aren’t part of the iPhone 8 have increased bill of materials for Apple’s flagship device. The cost therefore comes to $370.25 for the 64GB model compared to $255.16 for the iPhone 8 with the same storage.TechInsights, on the other hand, places the cost at $357.50 and given the $999 retail price, estimates the gross margin on the device of 64%. The iPhone 8 in comparison fetches a gross margin of 59%, according to the company.But drop tests (from 6 and 3 feet heights) reveal that the phone is the most breakable and expensive to replace. The corner drop is the least disruptive, but dropping on the front or back face shatters the device, for which Apple will not sell the parts destroys but replace the entire device for $549, which is $150 more than the cost of replacing the iPhone 8 glass.Amazon Discounting Third Party Sellers’ Wares: Moving away from its practice of discounting only those products that it ships directly, Amazon has started discounting products it sells on behalf of third party sellers. If a product is sold on an Amazon discount, the full amount including the discount is paid to the seller by Amazon.The discount is obviously intended to move customers away from competing platforms and traditional retailers like Walmart. But third party sellers may not be thrilled for a number of reasons: discounts that they didn’t plan for might lead to inventory imbalances. Moreover, it could devalue their brands. Amazon says that while the discount is clearly labelled as coming from Amazon, sellers can still opt out at any time.Twitter Doubles Character Count: Twitter has finally doubled the character limit from 140 to 280 so users can express themselves better. All users that is, except those in Japan, Korea and China, because those languages are denser and therefore more expressive, according to the company. Twitter has been testing the increased character limit with a number of users since September and found that most users don’t send very long tweets.On the other hand, the option to say more in a single tweet meant that users generally could think less about the composition, so they could be more spontaneous. They could also probably (or at least more often) do without screen shots of longer messages, or tweet storms (saying what they mean in a series of tweets rather than a single one because of the character limitation). Some older Twitter users are afraid that the character of the platform will change with longer tweets. But the ability to express themselves more fully will definitely attract more users, make it more social and increase engagement on the platform.Other Earnings Reports From Last Week: Snap, Microchip, Skyworks, GoDaddy, Take Two Interactive.Some Companies Reporting This Week: CSCO, AMAT, NTAP, SSYSLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1,AMD,"Investors in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 17, 2017 $24 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Top 41% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 4 cents per share to 5 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2,AMD,"Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.Last week we dove into the brave new world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. I read some good passages from a prescient 2014 essay by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen who explained and validated many of the amazing accomplishments we've come to see from ""fintech"" and Bitcoin, nearly four years later.In this episode of the podcast, I read a few more important ideas that Andreessen shared back then, including his explanation of Bitcoin as ""a classic network effect, a positive feedback loop"" of at least four constituencies: consumers, merchants, miners, and developers.Andreessen believed that all four players were important but that developers played a special role. Here's what he said...All over Silicon Valley and around the world, many thousands of programmers are using Bitcoin as a building block for a kaleidoscope of new product and service ideas that were not possible before. And at our venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, we are seeing a rapidly increasing number of outstanding entrepreneurs – not a few with highly respected track records in the financial industry – building companies on top of Bitcoin.For this reason alone, new challengers to Bitcoin face a hard uphill battle. If something is to displace Bitcoin now, it will have to have sizable improvements and it will have to happen quickly. Otherwise, this network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance.What Andreessen got right was the success of Bitcoin. What he may not have seen is that other platforms could evolve with new features.As we discussed last week, while Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan calls Bitcoin ""a fraud,"" he built a new blockchain banking technology called Quorum on the Ethereum cryptocurrency protocol.""Bitcoin Surges Back Above $7200 As Square Tests Crypto Payments""That was the headline this morning from ZeroHedge. Recall in last week's podcast Blockchain 101: If Bitcoin's a Fraud, How is Ethereum Different? we talked about Bitcoin surging to new highs above $7,000 after CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced they would be launching a futures contract on Bitcoin.That further validated Bitcoin as a legitimate member of an asset class -- or, more likely, a new asset class of its own as Marc Andreessen would probably suggest.But the day after my podcast, a big decision event for Bitcoin miners and developers transpired, sending share flying first higher, then over $1,500 lower. That potential event, known as a ""hard fork,"" is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid, and as such requires all nodes to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol.This is why I asked my colleague and Bitcoin fanatic Dave Bartosiak to be a guest on my podcast and help me break it all down. He explains the ""hard fork"" and why it didn't happen. He also explains how to avoid losing your hard-earned cryptocurrency with the right kind of crypto ""wallet.""One thing Dave explained is that Bitcoin started surging on Monday from below $6,000 up over $6,500 as word got out that a hedge fund master named Novogratz bought between $15 and $20 million worth over the weekend. More on him coming up.Back to SquareThe ZeroHedge story was actually broke by Forbes on Tuesday night as Laura Shin reported “Some customers of Square's Cash app have gotten a surprise in the past week. The app, which is used for payments between friends and is a competitor to Venmo, has also given them the option to buy or sell Bitcoin.”Not-so-ironically, word started spreading on Twitter, as Jack Dorsey was a founder of both companies. Early Wednesday morning, Bitcoin was in surge mode, up over $700 to $7,300 because the Square experiment added further validity from a leader in ""liberated"" payments processing.Square (SQ  -  Free Report), the peer-to-peer payments provider which just hit a $15 billion market capitalization today above $40 per share, is apparently testing integration of cryptocurrency payments in its cash app.According to CoinTelegraph, Square has issued a rollout to a limited number of customers, using pooled wallets to allow Bitcoin payments without the current high fees.""We’ve found that customers are interested in using the Cash App to buy Bitcoin,” the company said in a statement.“We're exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash App customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we're excited to learn more here.”Banks and Hedge Funds Are Getting Ready for Bitcoin AdventuresIn addition to JPMorgan's entrance in October into the Blockchain realm with Quorum, in September there was chatter about Goldman Sachs launching a trading desk to facilitate liquidity and hedging for their institutional clients. They probably knew that CME was researching a Bitcoin futures contract.Well on Monday, Reuters talked to Mike Novogratz, the former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group who now runs Galaxy Investment Partners, a firm that bets on cryptocurrencies and related businesses. He believes that mainstream institutional investors are about six to eight months from adopting bitcoin.In the article Big money is coming to bitcoin, Novogratz is quoted talking about a ""turning-point product"" from a big financial firm that could make buying Bitcoin as easy as picking up the phone. There is also a video interview in that link.“When it’s that easy, the price of bitcoin or ethereum is going to go much higher. And that is a lot closer than people think,” said Novogratz, who spoke at the Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit in New York.Novogratz also told Reuters that he bought $15 to $20 million worth of Bitcoin over the weekend in that recent pullback.And on Tuesday, Reuters spoke with Luke Ellis, CEO of hedge fund firm Man Group, with $100 billion AUM. Ellis said the firm will add Bitcoin to its 'investment universe' if CME launches a futures contract as planned. So there is a case of an established trading institution like CME attracting other entrants.But maybe the Square news is what Novogratz was talking about. He did tweet this on Wednesday: ""Big news -- looks like Square is adding a function to buy and sell BTC... the herd is coming #bitcoin.""Note: in the podcast, I mistakenly referred to Novogratz as the CEO of Man Group.CME Group to Provide Regulated Price Discovery… and ArbitrageWhile there has been concern about CME entering the Bitcoin market, I am a firm believer that it's a fantastic move for all participants. I used to work for the exchange and came to understand its economic functions of risk transfer and price discovery quite well across all asset classes.The CME Bitcoin futures will bring a new level of transparency and access to big institutions, small hedgers, and private speculators. And obviously, a new ability to ""go short"" Bitcoin will provide its own brand of fun to those who believe that the cryptocurrency is a bubble waiting to burst.In the podcast, Dave said he's getting the popcorn ready for mid-December when the contract launches. We also discuss the pros and cons of the newest CME initiative. You can learn more about the CME contract here.On the pro side, I really like the fact that exchange officials and quants did their homework for the past year to track and create reliable Bitcoin cash market price information. This is extremely important since the futures contract will be cash-settled in some rule-based relationship to these prices.This brings in a vital market function that links various related cash markets and their derivatives: arbitrage. In short, if a price isn’t “fair” in one location, a bank or large trading institution should be able to buy the cheaper version and sell the pricier one.According to the CME website, ""CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) and CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index (BRTI), a standardized reference rate and spot price index with independent oversight are accelerating the professionalization of bitcoin trading and further establishing digital assets as a new asset class.""The BRR and BRTI launched November 14, 2016 and CME notes that ""Several bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms will provide pricing data, including Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken.I'm really looking forward to the launch of this futures contract and all the other financial, trading, and payment institutions that will step out before year's end with their own Bitcoin initiatives.This week's past news and research has really opened my eyes and I now have a ""sure thing"" prediction of my own: Bitcoin will reach $20,000 sometime in the next year, well before it ever fails and collapses to zero as the naysayers believe.What's a Teraflop and Why Does the New Xbox Have 6?Dave is also a ""gamer"" and so while I had him on the show, I had to ask about the exciting new launch of the Xbox OneX. I heard that sales in the UK were trouncing the new PS4 Pro and that it is now the fastest console on the planet with 6 teraflops of processing power.A teraflop is the capability to handle one trillion ""floating point operations per second"" (FLOP).Dave explained that the One X also has the capability to be upgraded, thus eliminating hesitation and preventing buyer's remorse over obsolescent consoles.Check out the full podcast for his views on the console wars between Sony and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and the GPU chip wars between Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) -- both of who also make the chips that power cryptocurrency mining.Finally, I asked Dave -- a car fanatic like none I've ever met -- what we should expect from Tesla's big announcement Thursday about their new electric truck. While we can be pretty sure one reveal will be that the truck is autonomous too, Musk usually has more surprises too.And a tweet on Sunday was already prepping the hype...“Tesla Semi Truck unveil to be webcast live on Thursday at 8pm! This will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension. Just need to find my portal gun.”Be sure to tune into the Mind Over Money podcast to hear my favorite car expert's wild prediction about what Elon could have in store for us.The one burning question I forgot to ask Dave was this: ""Why didn't you tell me to buy Ethereum at $10 earlier this year?""Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and AMD for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

3,AMD,"Yesterday, after the bell, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report) announced solid results, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9% on the top line and 41.5% on the bottom line. Both numbers were up strong double-digits from the same quarter last year.The Gaming segment that contributes more than two-thirds of its total volume, grew 25%, as the company saw strength across regions and form factors. Management also called out strength in the Nintendo Switch console and cryptocurrencies as drivers. The Data Center segment, which accounts for most of the balance, saw the strongest growth of 109%, testimony to NVIDIA’s growing position at cloud service providers and prowess in high performance computing (HPC). The emerging Professional Visualization segment grew 15%, as VR adoption at defense and automotive customers increased and demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations and grew.Coming off the strong results, management raised the quarterly dividend and promised to return $1.25 billion in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases.Guidance was also encouraging with revenue expectations of $2.65 billion for the January quarter bettering the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 billion.Investors responded to the news by sending share prices up 3.2% in extended trading. But is the stock a buy at these levels? Let’s find out:The share price has increased 8.7% over the past month compared to the industry’s 13.6%. The S&P 500 has however has grown much slower, at 1.9%. Over the past year, the S&P 500 has gained steadily to trade close to its 52-week high, but NVIDIA shares have been far more volatile. Significantly, its median value of 94.3% is higher than the S&P 500’s 91.6% although both NVDA and the S&P 500 are currently trading considerably higher than their median levels.The industry has a much lower median value, although it is currently trading closer to its 52-week high. These comparisons seem to indicate that there is room for further upside in NVDA shares. P/EThe forward 12 months price-to-earnings ratio for NVDA is currently 53.3X compared to the S&P 500 average of 18.8X and the industry average of 20.0X. The high, low and median values are also higher. Moreover, the trend lines indicate that NVDA is clearly overvalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry. P/SThe trailing 12 months price to sales ratio tells the same story. The P/S ratio for NVDA is currently 15.6X, which is higher than the S&P 500’s 3.15 but much lower than the X industry’s 6.25. The median of 3.34 is slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s 3.4 and the industry’s 5.0X. The highs and lows also indicate that NVDA is overvalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry. P/CFIn terms of cash flow, NVDA’s valuation of 56.4X is much higher than the S&P 500’s 23.1X and the industry’s 25.0X. Moreover, the highs, lows and median values are also much higher. Look at Its Peers…While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) is NVIDIA’s closest competitor when it comes to GPUs, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) is the one that it is increasingly pitted against as both companies look for growth in the data center, self-driving cars and other IoT. So let’s compare the two first.Intel’s current P/E based on forward 12 months earnings is just 14.2X, its price to sales ratio is 3.6X and its price to cash flow is 18.4X. So NVDA is obviously overvalued compared to Intel. A comparison with another semiconductor company Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) shows that this chipmaker has a P/E based on forward 12 months earnings of 21.7X, a price to sales ratio of 6.7X and a price to cash flow of 21.6X. Here too, NVDA looks overvalued. ConclusionIt’s true that NVDA has a solid pipeline that should continue to generate strong growth for years to come. But given the strong competition from companies like Intel and ongoing consolidation in the space, it could soon see many other competitors in Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), etc.So the high valuation with respect to the S&P 500, the industry in which it operates and a couple of its semiconductor peers, is good reason for caution. Or at least, it’s good reason to go for Intel or Texas Instruments instead. Both these companies have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here - that’s better than the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) assigned to NVIDIA.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

4,AMD,"It’s been a great Q3 earnings season throughout Wall Street, and we’ve seen tech stocks—the market’s chosen darlings of 2017—dominate the headlines as marquee company after marquee company has posted solid results.One thing investors are always looking for during reporting season is a plethora of earnings beats. Strong growth and positive consumer trends are always great, but investors want to see companies exceed expectations and post surprises.So far this earnings season, about 73% of S&P 500 companies have surpassed earnings estimates, while 67% have beaten revenue estimates. Not surprisingly, the red-hot tech sector has contributed several of these positive surprises, and a few notable companies have emerged as significant over-performers.Today, we’ve decided to highlight a few of these great tech earnings reports. Check out these three tech stocks that recently crushed earnings estimates:1.       Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report)After struggling to generate much positive momentum for years, Twitter is finally starting to show signs of a full-fledged turnaround. The social media company recently reported earnings of 10 cents per share, comfortably beating our consensus estimate of 6 cents. Management noted that its investments in livestreaming and original content are starting to pay off, and investors seem to be responding appropriately. Twitter shares have gained more than 15% since its earnings announcement. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 2.       Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report)2017 has been the year of the tech stock, but more specifically, it’s been the year of the trendy chipmaker. One of the most noteworthy of this bunch is, of course, AMD. The oft-unpredictable stock has gained just 3% this year, but a strong earnings report, coupled with an encouraging outlook, has helped earn it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In its latest quarter, AMD reported earnings of 10 cents per share, beating our consensus estimate of 8 cents and soaring more than 230% year-over-year. 3.       BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report)In a year that has seen the Backstreet Boys embark on a nationwide tour, the once-iconic mobile phone brand BlackBerry has also been declared “back.” Brothers, sisters, everybody sing: BlackBerry is relevant again. The company has ditched its phone manufacturing business and shifted towards a software-first focus, and things are finally starting to pick back up again. In its most recent quarter, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) posted a surprise profit of 5 cents per share, crushing our consensus estimate that called for a loss of a penny. BlackBerry shares are now up over 55% year-to-date. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

5,AMD,"Shares of Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) dipped on Thursday morning, just hours before it is set to release its Q3 earnings report. The slump came after Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) announced that it hired one of Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) top systems architects to help Intel compete in the quickly growing graphics chip market.Nvidia grew to prominence based largely on the success of the company’s high-powered graphics chips, which are a favorite among PC users—and video gamers more specifically—around the globe.Over half of the semiconductor company’s revenues come from its Gaming division, which is driven by these graphics chips (also read: Will Gaming Remain Dominant For Nvidia In Q3?).Now, Nvidia’s much larger rival, Intel, is fighting to make inroads in the market Nvidia currently dominates.Intel announced on Wednesday night—less than 24-hours before Nvidia is set to report its third-quarter results—that it hired Raja Koduri. The former top graphics architect at AMD will take on the role of “chief architect and senior vice president of the newly formed Core and Visual Computing Group and general manager of a new initiative to drive edge computing solutions,” according to an Intel press release.Koduri will leave his role at AMD, where he was most recently the senior vice president and chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group. In that role, he oversaw “all aspects of graphics technologies used in AMD’s APU, discrete GPU, semi-custom and GPU compute products.”The news of the big hire, which is intended to help Intel compete more directly in a graphics market dominated by Nvidia, helped send shares of Nvidia down more than 2%.On top of that, shares of AMD sunk by over 5% on Thursday morning after word spread that Intel was able to lure one of its most important executives away. This also comes only days after AMD’s shares popped following the announcement that it is set to partner with Intel to compete against Nvidia in the laptop chip market.""Our collaboration with Intel expands the installed base for AMD Radeon GPUs and brings to market a differentiated solution for high-performance graphics,"" Scott Herkelman, an AMD VP, said in a statement.""This new semi-custom GPU puts the performance and capabilities of Radeon graphics into the hands of an expanded set of enthusiasts who want the best visual experience possible.""Bottom Line The graphics chip market is set to get more competitive than ever with these recent moves. Thankfully for Nvidia investors, the company has made strides in driverless vehicle technology, the artificial intelligence sector, and datacenters.Nvidia is set to release its Q3 earnings after the closing bell. Based on our current consensus estimates, the company’s earnings are set to jump 13%, while revenues are expected to soar 18% year-over-year.Be sure to check out our full guide for more details ahead of Nvidia’s earnings report: What To Expect From Nvidia's Q3 Earnings Report.And make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Nvidia’s actual results later this week!Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

6,AMD,"Bitcoin is one of the most popular cyrptocurrencies on the market, primarily backed by a rising user base. According to coinmarketcap.com, the market capitalization of the currency presently stands at more than $124.5 billion, much higher than the stock market valuation of  both Goldman Sachs, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), which sit at $94.6 billion and $91.9 billion, respectively.Also, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin has outclassed the S&P 500 index. From $963.66 on Jan 1, the price of bitcoin has risen more than 600% against only 15.7% for the S&P 500. Thus, it is the right time for investors to add stocks that have a positive correlation with the virtual currency.Record Customers Open Bitcoin AccountsThe virtual currency market has witnessed a record number of accounts for bitcoin traders after CME Group Inc. (CME) — the operator of the largest options and futures exchange in the world — announced its intention to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the October-to-December quarter of 2017.Coinbase — the United States’ largest bitcoin exchange — has roughly 100,000 new users willing to buy or sell the digital currency, per Alistair Milne. Coinbase added that as of now, it has as many as 11.9 million users. Also, CME Group’s plan to launch bitcoin futures pushed the virtual currency to its highest mark of $7,454.04 on Nov 3.Mining Demand RisesWith an increasing number of bitcoin buyers and sellers, we are expecting more transactions that will need more mining. Transactions refer to transferring value between the customer’s bitcoin wallets, while mining specifies the process through which all the transactions will get verified and processed.Investors should know that bitcoin is not a physical coin, and no central authority creates the virtual currency. Instead, computers create bitcoin through mining. A special software is being used by the miners for solving critical mathematical problems and thereby keeping the bitcoin network secure by verifying payments. In exchange, the miners receive a small amount of the digital currencies as rewards. That is how bitcoin operates. Which Stocks Will Benefit?New businesses associated to mining have emerged and companies offering digital mining equipment are in high demand. Miners require advanced hardware to solve more complex problems. Hence, the need for computer processors and chips used by miners for creating bitcoin have surged. Companies producing these chips are now in high demand, and investing in such stocks will be a smart option. Four stocks in particular are poised to gain the most on the bitcoin price surge, per Bloomberg. All the stocks also carry a solid Zacks Rank. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) primarily provides microprocessors (x86-based), chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) and professional graphics. Notably, the miners of digital currencies are increasingly using GPU.The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and posted an average positive earnings surprise of 31.67% for the last four quarters.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, is a worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of GPU, which is a high-performance processor generating realistic, interactive graphics on workstations, personal computers, game consoles and mobile devices.The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). NVIDIA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 34.54%.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), headquartered in Boise, ID, has established itself as one of the world’s leading providers of semiconductor memory solutions, including manufacturing memory chips. The memory chips, among the most important parts of mining rig, will be useful for miners said Stifel Nicolaus, an investment banking firm.The #1 ranked stock also has an excellent earnings surprise history. Micron beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings in the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 10.98%.Based in Santa Clara, CA, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductor products. The company’s innovative efforts are speeding up the entire computer, and not just the central processing unit (CPU), which is helpful for the miners. In fact, Stifel Nicolaus believes that the processors of Intel will be highly useful for mining the digital currency.The Zacks #1 Ranked stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the prior four quarters, posting an average beat of 9.75%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

7,AMD,"Qorvo Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. The figure jumped 17.8% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues on a non-GAAP basis declined 5% year over year to $820.6 million. However, the figure was slightly better than the high-end of management’s guidance of $800-$820 million.The results reflected an improved demand environment in China. The company benefited from increasing dollar content across power amplifiers, switches, tuners and Wi-Fi in flagship smartphones from Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and others.Management stated that the unit growth is primarily driven by strong demand in India. Qorvo expects India to be an almost $1-billion opportunity for RF products by 2020.However, mix remains a drag in both regions as consumers are favoring mid-tier phones, which have lower dollar content. Qorvo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Qorvo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Qorvo, Inc. QuoteRevenue View UnimpressiveFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, Qorvo expects non-GAAP revenues between $830 million and $850 million. The mid-point of the range missed the consensus mark by almost $50 million.Qorvo cited delayed product cycle at its largest customer to be one of the multiple reasons that will hurt Mobile Products (MP) revenues in the current quarter. However, Infrastructure and Defense (IDP) revenues are projected to grow mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 revenues are projected to decline sequentially.Qorvo fell almost 3% following the results. Notably, the company’s shares have returned 41.2% year to date, underperforming the 44.4% rally of the industry.Quarter DetailsSegment-wise, MP revenues were $630 million, which surged 38% sequentially, driven by robust performance in China.Qorvo’s BAW filters, antenna tuners, RF front end modules and envelope tracking power management solution were used in Huawei’s flagship Mate 10 device. Moreover, the company shipped more than $9 of RF content into Xiaomi’s Mi Mix 2 device.Infrastructure and Defense (IDP) revenues grew 21% year over year to $190 million. The growth reflects strong demand for the company’s solutions in defense (advanced radars and other electronic warfare products) and connectivity (Wi-Fi and emerging IoT applications).IoT revenues surged 50% from the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, Qorvo won a RF front-end module design, which supports the Tile tracker family. Moreover, dollar content per car from automotive IoT applications increased to $7 due to multiple design wins in the quarter.Moreover, Qorvo experienced strong demand for its 900 megahertz narrow band IoT infrastructure in China.Qorvo stated that its RF solutions are being selected at majority of the baseband platforms like Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), HiSilicon, MediaTek, Samsung, and LSI. This is proving to be a key catalyst for the company’s top-line growth.Operational DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 460 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 47.4%, lower than management’s guidance. This was primarily due to unfavorable mix and negative impact from an isolated air contamination issue in the company’s Florida fab.Non-GAAP research & development (R&D), as percentage of revenues, increased 70 bps from the year-ago quarter to 13.5%. Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses, as percentage of revenues, remained flat at 6.7%.During the quarter, Qorvo reduced head count, which was primarily aimed at reducing cost and improving operating efficiency.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 530 bps to 28.1%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, cash and cash equivalents were $574.9 million compared with $512.6 million as of Jul 1. Long-term debt was $989.7 million as compared with $989.4 million at the end of the previous quarter.Net cash provided by operating activities was $220 million up from $104 million in the previous quarter. Capital expenditures declined sequentially to $68 million.Further, Qorvo has returned $57 million to shareholders under its ongoing $500 million repurchase program.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, gross margin is anticipated to be almost 47.5%, almost flat sequentially, primarily due to unfavorable product mix.Operating expenses are forecast to remain flat at approximately $158 million for the third quarter. Moreover, earnings are projected to be $1.60 per share at the mid-point of the company’s target range.Management’s guidance reflects strength at customers' flagship models and continued strength in IDP.Qorvo doesn’t expect 50% gross margin, while exiting fiscal 2018. However, the company anticipates gross margin expansion to restart in the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2018 and continue throughout the next fiscal driven by improving mix, ongoing productivity efforts and increasing fab utilization.Qorvo now expects revenues to decline less than seasonally over the December to March time-frame. In the second half, management expects double-digit year-over-year growth, with gains on new mobile platforms and continued strong IDP growth.Operating expenses in dollar terms are expected to decline from fiscal 2017 level. The company remains on track to achieve operating margin of 20% or lower in the long haul.Management expects capital expenditure to trend lower through the rest of the year, ending the full year below $300 million or less than 10% of sales.Zacks Rank & Key PickQorvo carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a stock worth considering in the broader sector.

8,AMD,"GoPro, Inc.’s (GPRO  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate which was at breakeven level. Before first-quarter 2017, the company lost money in six of the last seven quarters. Notably, the company’s substantial cost-cutting initiatives have proved conducive tobottom-line performance.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 10 cents for the quarter, compared witha loss of 74 cents in the prior-year period. The company posted better-than-expected revenue numbers for the quarter and also reduced operating expenses significantly.Inside the HeadlinesGoPro surprised investors with its sales figures, as its quarterly revenues grew 37.1% from the prior-year quarter’s tally to $329.8 million. This marked the company’s second consecutive quarter of revenue growth. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $314.3 million.Revenue growth was driven by robust sales of the latest Hero5 cameras and launch of its premium-priced HERO6 Black with global on-shelf availability.GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GoPro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GoPro, Inc. QuoteHERO5 Black was the best-selling digital imaging device in units and dollars in the United States for four consecutive quarters. More than half of GoPro's revenuescame from outside the United States. GoPro also had a ""strong start"" for its Karma drone.For the quarter, R&D expenses were down 42.7% year over year. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses plunged 49.1% year over year. Third-quarter operating expenses came in at $122.5 million, down 42.4% year over year.Non-GAAP gross margins contracted 50 basis pointsyear over year to 40.1%. Non-GAAP operating income came in at $24 million, down 127.2% from $88.6 million generated last year.RestructuringGoPro has been aggressively cutting costs in recent times through a series of layoffs. Last year, the company conducted two rounds of layoffs, cutting 7% and 15% of its workforce in January and November, respectively. GoPro also shuttered its entertainment and media business as part of restructuring.The companyalso shifted most of software development to a more economical location like Romania, while customer support and administrative services have been moved to the Philippines. The company has streamlined supply chain and also made changes to its product packaging and shipping.GoPro believes that restructuring efforts will help it bring down full-year GAAP operating expenses below $585 million and non-GAAP operating expenses below $495 million. The company also assured that it would bring down operating expenses by over $200 million and return to EBITDA profitability in 2017.Moreover, the companyaffirmed that these cost-cutting efforts will not interfere with its pipeline of hardware and software product launches.Notable DevelopmentsIn October, GoPro announced its intention to increasepresence in Bucharest, Romania. Since expanding presence of engineering team to Bucharest, the company has witnessedimmense contribution fromits Bucharest team in release of HERO6 Black, Fusion, and QuikStories. Going forward, the company will continue to focus on development of GoPro’s web and e-commerce platforms.LiquidityExiting the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $164.6 million, down significantly from $192.1 million as on Dec 31, 2016.Guidance In light of a comparatively strong quarter, the company gave a decent guidance for fourth-quarter 2017. It projects revenues of about $470 million (+/- 10 million) for the quarter.For full-year 2017, GoPro plans to limit operating expenses in 2017 to $490 million, in an attempt to try to return to full-year profitability next year.GoPro should be able to attain these massive cost reductions, in light of its recent job cuts and business restructuring, which did away with many high-cost operations, including its entertainment division.Our TakeGoPro has been aiming towards transforming itself from the ‘camera maker’ to ‘content maker’, and has taken significant steps to diversify into higher-margin businesses including video editing and virtual reality. The company is developing various types of software solutions and hardware to curtail the complexity of managing, editing and sharing contents on different media platforms.The company has made significant improvements to its editing software, on the back of its recent acquisition of two of the most popular mobile editing apps, Replay (which has been rebranded as Quik) and Splice, which are experiencing robust adoption. We believe that these efforts will pay off in the long term, and go a long way toward opening GoPro to a wider audience and expanding the user base.GoPro currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Imax Corporation (IMAX  -  Free Report), Gildan Activewear, Inc.

9,AMD,"Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents in third-quarter 2017. Further, adjusted earnings fell 25% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings per share of 31 cents, down 11.4% compared with the year-ago figure. A rise in total costs, along with cost of investment in new business areas proved to be a drag on the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues in the quarter was $842,820 million, up 0.5% year over year on a reported basis. However, revenues were flat, when adjusted for currency impact.As for the segments, on a reported basis, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) Solutions revenues dipped 7.4% year over year to $ 414 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 8.6%) and International Mailing Business (down 3%). Lower recurring revenue streams and lower sales in the top of the line products led to the lackluster performance of the North American Mailing business. Additionally, decline in recurring revenues proved to be a drag on the International Mailing Business.Enterprise Business Solutions (“EBS”) revenues increased 1.4% year over year to $223.5 million. Decent performance form Presort Services (up 4%), partially offset by the production mail business (down 1.9%) drove the top-line growth of this segment. Higher print equipment sales bolstered performance of the production mail business. Higher support services revenues also proved conducive to the growth of this segment.Digital Commerce Solutions reported 19% year-over-year growth in sales to $205.6 million, on the back of strong Global e-commerce (up 28%) as well as Software Solutions businesses (up 12%). Impressive performance in all cross-border geographies and growth in domestic shipping acted as tailwinds for the Global e-commerce business. Growth in the Software Solutions business was primarily driven by higher license revenue, mainly in Location Intelligence and Customer Information Management.Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pitney Bowes Inc. QuoteLiquidity and Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, free cash flow was $108.9 million compared with $119.9 million as of Sep 30, 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,697 million compared with $764.5 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2017, was $3,562.7 million, down from $2,750.4 million as of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceThe company tweaked guidance for full-year 2017. It expects earnings per share to lie in the range of $1.38-$1.46, compared with the earlier guided range of $1.70-$1.78. Revenues, on a reported basis, are expected to grow in the range of 3-5% year over year compared with the previous guidance of flat to 1% growth.Pitney Bowes believes that new products and digital capabilities of SMB, expansion of the Presort Services network and robust e-commerce volume growth will act as major catalysts, stoking top-line growth for full-year 2017. Moreover, the company’s focus on operational excellence will help it trim costs and expenses, consequently supplementing growth.Our TakePitney Bowes’ concerted efforts to transform business have started to show results as evident from growth across most business lines. The transformation initiatives and constant introduction of new products have also provided a boost to performance. This apart, the company’s prolonged effort to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform also bode well for the company.Moreover, the company’s Global e-commerce business is proving to be one of the strongest profit churners, and is anticipated to boost top-line growth in the upcoming quarters as well. In less than five years, Global e-commerce has grown from $20 million business to a worth of over $400 million. The company also anticipates segment’s growth rate to accelerate going forward, in light of growth in overall retail volumes and customer wins.However, continued softness in the mailing business is likely to affect Pitney Bowes’ growth momentum for the quarter under review. Lower recurring supplies revenues are expected to adversely affect the mailing business in the upcoming quarter. Additionally, currency fluctuation remains a headwind.Pitney Bowes currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc.

(MRK  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report), shares of which declined 6.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Merck suffered its biggest two-day decline following reports that it had withdrawn its application seeking approval for the usage of its cancer immunotherapy drug in Europe.Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven ended in the red, with healthcare stocks leading the decliners. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) dipped 1.1% on Monday, posting its worst one-day dip since Aug 17. Moreover, a decline in the shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) led the S&P 500 lower.While, shares of AMD declined after some analysts from Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) commented that demand for cryptocurrency mining chips will be reduced almost 50%, shares of GM plunged after analysts from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) downgraded the stock to sell.House Proposes ‘Gradual Phase-in’ of Corporate TaxesReports from Bloomberg surfaced on Monday that legislators from the House  who are involved in the formulation of the new tax code were considering a possible ‘phasing-in’ of the corporate tax-rate cut. This would effectively reduce the current rate of corporate tax — at 35% — to 20% by 2022. However, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady commented that the procedure is still under review and there has not been any formal decision on it.The guidelines of the proposal state that tax rates would be slashed by three percentage points each year, beginning in 2018. The economists have clearly stated that if such a framework is adopted it would not only become less effective but would also delay any economic effects that President Trump and his aides aim to achieve. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a press meeting, commented that Trump wants to immediately slash the tax rates.Such news led to losses for the Russell 2000 index which declined 1.2% to post its worst single-day decline since Aug 17.Investor sentiment was also hurt after Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States for an alleged Russian meddling in 2016 Presidential elections. Meanwhile, investors also eagerly wait to know as to whom Trump would choose as the next Fed Chief. Trump is expected to announce his decision on Thursday.Economic DataOn the economic data front, personal income for the month of September increased 0.4%, up from 0.2% in August. The consensus estimate for the period was also 0.4%. On the other hand, the consumer spending surged 1%, more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 0.8%. This marks its highest level in almost 8 years. Such a rally can be attributed to the fact that the residents of hurricane ravaged Texas and Florida replaced their flood-damaged automobiles. Economists believe that this would have only a short term effect on consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Core PCE inflation for September increased 0.1%, in line with the consensus estimate.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnder Armour Q3 Earnings Top, Stock Tanks on View CutUnder Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) reported mixed quarterly numbers in third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.

11,AMD,"The technology sector has been leading this month buoyed by soaring FAANG stocks — Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — and encouraging fundamentals like improved overseas demand, Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario.Notably, the semiconductor industry has been outperforming the broad sector buoyed by innovative technologies. New areas such as autonomous cars, cloud computing, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence are fueling exceptional growth in the industry, offsetting struggling traditional businesses like PCs and smartphones.Further, the industry is benefiting from an astronomical surge in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that has pushed semiconductor stocks to record highs. This is because mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. A hardware known as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) has been designed exclusively for mining bitcoin (read: ETFs Riding High On Bitcoin Surge).Moreover, the deluge of strong earnings reports from the major players such as Micron MU, Texas Instruments TXN, Intel INTC, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) added to the strength.Given this, investors might want to tap the space with the top-performing semiconductor ETFs and stocks of this month.

12,AMD,"Connectivity and sensor solutions manufacturer, TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 1.TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.5% in the trailing four quarters. The company scored its seventh consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, beating estimates by 6%. However, the company anticipates weak revenues in Transportation Solutions in the upcoming quarter, which constitutes the major portion of its total revenues.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPrimarily depended on end market dynamics, TE Connectivity’s business remains susceptible to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer. Though the company witnessed some extent of stability in direct business with OEMs, poor sales through distribution channels took longer-than-expected recovery time, consequently hurting the segmental performance. These factors could be a drag on segment margin and affect its profitability in the upcoming quarter.The company’s commercial transportation market is yet to witness signs of stabilization due to weak global construction and agriculture markets, along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets. This apart, the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review. These factors can severely undermine TE Connectivity’s growth prospects.Moreover, sluggishness in oil and gas markets along with its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as major headwinds for TE Connectivity. Further, helicopter demand has also been impacted negatively, which can prove to be a drag on the company’s aerospace business.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains low at $1,670 million compared with fiscal third-quarter revenues of $1,765 million. Revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are also anticipated to be low sequentially, with an estimate of $880 million compared with reported revenues of $905 million in the prior quarter.However, being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, TE Connectivity is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. In the past five years, the company’s harsh business applications have had experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth. Going forward, we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion in the upcoming quarter.Moreover, the company’s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China. Growth in electronic content as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for the company’s transportation business, going forward.Furthermore, during the previous quarter, the company enhanced its harsh environment portfolio with bolt-on acquisitions in the Automotive and Medical business by entering into an agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication and purchasing MicroGroup. These acquisitions will unlock expansion opportunities, and advance content growth in key applications for the automotive and medical markets. This bodes well for the to-be-reported quarter’s top-line.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for TE Connectivity this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.16. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | TE Connectivity Ltd. QuoteZacks Rank: TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.28% and a Zacks Rank #2.Fitbit, Inc.

13,AMD,"After the revival of Trump bump, Wall Street seems to have taken a breather. The Dow Industrials and S&P 500 indexes underwent their worst day in seven weeks on Oct 25. The S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 0.5% each on that day (read: 5 Biggest ETF Winners of Trump Trade Resurgence).   The broader market had a great run since Trump announced plans for tax reform in late September. However, the double whammy of rising rates and subdued earnings weighed on the market recently, if we go by an article published on Reuters. On Oct 25, 207, yield on 10-year benchmark Treasury yield was 2.44%. Yields have been on an uptrend on faster Fed policy-tightening projections. A prolonged source of easy money contributed to the eight-year long bull market greatly. Now, indications of fast ceases in easy dollars may cut the rally.Plus, overvaluation concerns have been rife in the U.S. equity market for quite some time now. Though the ongoing earnings season has been pretty upbeat, investors probably have started analyzing to what extent this surge in earnings justify the inflated valuations, as per the Reuters article.If this was not enough, lackluster earnings from AT&T (T  -  Free Report) (down 3.9%) weighed on indexes. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) lost about 2.9%, 13.5% and 14.6% on Oct 25 as an aftershock of earnings or guidance disaster.Amid all the upheavals, volatility levels flared up, with iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN (VXX  -  Free Report)) rising about 3.1% on Oct 25. These worries may keep the stock market volatile, giving investors a chance to ride it out through inverse ETFs. While there are several options available in the space, we have highlighted a few ETFs that are widely spread across a number of sectors and not concentrated on a particular sector or industry.ETFs to PlayProShares Short S&P500 ETF (SH  -  Free Report)This fund provides unleveraged inverse exposure to the daily performance of the S&P 500 index (read: Politics & Geopolitics Loom: Short S&P 500 with These ETFs).Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 1x Shares ETF (SPDN  -  Free Report)The fund seeks daily investment results of 100% of the inverse (or opposite) of the performance of the S&P 500 Index.ProShares Short Dow30 ETF (DOG  -  Free Report)It offers inverse unleveraged exposure to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index.AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF (HDGE  -  Free Report)This ETF is active and does not track a benchmark. Its objective is capital appreciation through short sales of domestically traded equity securities.Proshares Short QQQ (PSQ  -  Free Report)It offers inverse unleveraged exposure to the NASDAQ-100 Index.Bottom LineAs a caveat, investors should note that such products are suitable only for short-term traders as these are rebalanced on a daily basis (see: all the Inverse Equity ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

14,AMD,"Markets tanked on Wednesday after the Dow and the S&P 500 suffered their worst single-day declines in almost seven weeks. The Dow declined after shares of Boeing nosedived following a steep rise in its production cost. The S&P 500 ended in the red after a decline in shares of Advanced Micro Devices and Chipotle Mexican Grill weighed heavily on the benchmark. Meanwhile, new home sales and durable orders for September came in above the consensus estimate.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 23,329.46, declining 0.5%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.5% to close at 2,557.15. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,563.89, decreasing 0.5%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,674 to 878. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 1,310 to 936. The CBOE VIX increased 0.5% to close at 11.21.Dow, S&P 500 Post Their Biggest Losses in Two MonthDow shed 112.30 points on Wednesday to post its biggest loss in about seven weeks. The blue-chip index suffered such losses after shares of aerospace giant, Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), tanked 2.9% following a decline in revenues of two of its business units, as compared to the last year. The company stated that it had incurred $329 million in costs due to problems associated with production of its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker. This marked the Dow’s biggest single-day dip since Sep 5, 2017 when the blue-chip index swooned 1.1% in a single day.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost almost 12 points to end in negative territory. All Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended in the red with industrial and energy shares leading the decliners. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) declined almost 1% and 0.7%, respectively. The S&P 500 also registered its worst day since Sep 5, the biggest drags on the benchmark being shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report). Shares of AMD and CMG declined 13.5% and 14.6%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Advanced Micro Devicesreported non-GAAP earnings of 10 cents per share compared with 3 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents per share.  Revenues increased 26% year over year and 34% sequentially to $1.64 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 billion. (Read More)Meanwhile, shares of Chipotle Mexican Grilldeclined nearly 10% in afterhours trading on Oct 24, after the company reported lower-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results. An expected slowdown in new restaurant openings led to the slump in the stock price. Chipotle reported earnings of 69 cents per share, up significantly from the prior-year quarter earnings of 27 cents per share. (Read More)Trump Keeps Investors on TenterhooksAmidst much speculation regarding who will go on to head the Fed, investors eagerly wait for President Trump’s decision to choose Janet Yellen’s successor, post the expiration of her term as the Fed Chief in February, 2018. In a surprising move, Trump sought help of the Senate Republicans on Tuesday to zero in on a potential candidate for the post of Fed Chief. In a show-of-hands, Senators from the GOP unanimously vouched for Stanford University Professor John Taylor to be the next Chief of Fed. Trump would reportedly announce the name of Yellen’s successor officially before he heads out on a trip to Asia. Some experts commented that ‘show-of-hands’ might possibly be a decisive factor affecting Trump’s decision.Meanwhile, broader markets gained from positive investor sentiment due to hopes that the existing tax code would soon be amended. The green signal to the budget blueprint ensures taxpayers that existing tax codes would be rewritten, more so because it has unlocked a procedure using which President Trump and his team can push through their tax reforms using only Republican votes.Economic DataOn the economic data front, new home sales surged to 667,000 in September, up from 561,000 in August — an increase of 18.9% from the previous figure. The consensus estimate for the period was an increase of 557,000. Meanwhile, durable orders increased 2.2% in September, up from 2% in August. The consensus estimate for the period was an increase of 1.2%.Stocks That Made HeadlinesSuncor Earnings Top Estimates in Q3, Revenues Up Y/YCanadian energy giant Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

15,AMD,"Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of Behavioral Economics.In our last episode from October 17, we explored the powerful new computing technologies known as machine learning and deep learning. These AI “genies” were let out of the bottle by computer scientists and engineers who learned to harness semiconductors that were originally designed for advanced gaming graphics.What the researchers discovered was that the GPU (graphical processing units) chips made by NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) provided the parallel processing required to teach machines to go beyond replicating simple human intelligence tasks like filtering your email for junk and to do things such as win at ""extensive"" -- or, extremely complicated -- games like the Chinese Go or Texas Hold'em.With lots of data -- both structured and messy -- a computer can be trained to automatically analyze language, images, faces, and even behavior that seems like it could be financial fraud.But what about the threats that AI could pose, especially if it is used by hackers or nation-state cyber-terrorists to wreak havoc?Elon Musk, founder and CEO of Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), has been an outspoken Cassandra on the dangers of AI that is misunderstood or misused. He knows, of course, how it can be used for good and will be applying it in the R&D of his own products and services.And he is right to use his platform to warn others about the potential for unintended consequences, to say nothing of the odious ones.But I see the evolution and application of AI as nearly unstoppable, and we'll have to take the bad with the good as it comes at us.Because no government will be able to keep up with the innovations at the university, corporate, or nation-state levels.In the Mind Over Money podcast that accompanies this article, I share some recent articles, studies, and resources for managing our own education in this brave, new world.We either learn all we can about what's unfolding or, in the words of Will Ramey, NVIDIA's Director of Developer Marketing, ""it will all seem like magic.""What AI Is, And Isn'tIt's important to keep in mind what AI's workhorses, machine learning and deep learning, can and can't do.Most programs are created and trained to do very specific tasks. If an algorithm was created with a neural network to recognize financial fraud, it's not going to be able to play you in chess, cook you dinner, drive your car, or empty your bank account.Could a mega-AI be created to do all these things and appear truly ""intelligent"" as a human? Probably. But many natural constraints exist to both practical computing power (who pays for it, who maintains it, etc.) and undetectable crime.Parallel processing platforms can create levels of training, ""learning"" through experience, and what computer scientists call ""tuning"" that allows inference based on that experience and repetition. From this structure, an AI platform can make predictions, judgements and recommendations that are probability-based. But it can’t act on decisions that it is not programmed to act on or decide for.In essence, very specific types of tools can be created that are just like task-focused, rules-based software, except that machine and deep learning tools can both adapt and improve their skill in that task.And that's why AI programs can act as “first filters” for massive amounts of data, automatically, from tailoring an online shopping, entertainment, or research experience to driving your car or detecting skin cancer.Neural Isn't NeurologicalBut this is all to augment and amplify the human experience, not to completely take it over or replace it.Computer scientists and AI practitioners love their work and love comparing it to human brains because the neural networks and if/then logic circuitry they create with clean, layered-and-ordered-complexity architecture (nodes) are easier to work with and ""repair.""But despite their clean, efficient, rational world, these experts also know that the messy-complexity of neurons, synapses, dendrites, and biochemical messengers has orders of magnitude superiority when it comes to broad and general intelligence -- even if it took millions of years of chaotic trial and error to get here.Of course, in just a few sentences, I run the risk of greatly oversimplifying the evolution of deep learning from machine learning.There are many different paths that researchers at universities and corporations have taken using these technologies. And the best way to talk about them and learn from them is on a case by case, problem by problem basis.I do that in this episode of the Mind Over Money podcast by approaching several examples, including IBM's Watson, Google's DeepMind AlphaGo, and our main topic last week, the team at the University of Alberta who ""solved"" Texas Hold'em poker with DeepStack.AlphaGo Zero Takes AI Intuition FurtherJust last week, an Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) AI division known as DeepMind conquered their next challenge in the Chinese game Go by creating a deep learning platform that completely taught itself to play without following human examples.In other words, while the AlphaGo program that beat the world human champ in 2016 had relied on analyzing thousands of games involving good players, the new AlphaGo Zero began with a blank Go board and no data apart from the rules.Then it “simply” played against itself, just like DeepStack did with no limit Texas hold’em poker.""Within 72 hours it was good enough to beat the original program by 100 games to zero"" according to Rory Cellan-Jones in his BBC News article Google DeepMind: AI becomes more alien.I haven't see the DeepMind paper, but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that, for a game with as many possible outcomes as Go,  Zero had to play tens of millions of games in 72 hours to teach itself to become that good.I would also assume that it uses some form of CFR (counterfactual regret) training and that the result is a form of “intuition,” just like DeepStack. I'll be looking for the scientific paper associated with DeepMind's stunning achievement.The Intelligent (and Invisible) Robots Are ComingI ended last week's episode (Part 1) on the positive note of ""Let's learn all we can cause AI is coming!""This past week I found several articles and resources that got me excited about how to do just that, from MIT to Coursera.One article that caught my attention because it seemed almost absurd was from the UK's Guardian citing a British business group calling for the government to launch an AI commission to predict the impacts on jobs and productivity.If you caught my May 9, 2017 podcast What to Do Before the Machines Take Over, on the ""threat of automation"" and Yuval Noah Harari's book Homo Deus, you know that I've covered some of the dark side of the coming technology revolutions.But as I stated earlier in this article, I see the evolution and application of AI as nearly unstoppable, and no government will be able to keep up with the innovations.In other words, different aspects of business and society will already be in the middle of a ""next-transformation"" by the time some commission has figured out the last transformation.As MIT recently titled a piece on their blog, corporations need to Keep Calm and... Massively Increase Investment in Artificial Intelligence.To wit, companies like Amazon and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) are doing just that. Wells Fargo analysts noted in a research report last month, when they set a price target on BABA shares of $225, that China will see a $7 trillion impact on its economy in ten years from AI according to PwC.That should make the UK government analysts, who predict an $814 billion impact to their economy by 2035, go back to the drawing board.The New ElectricityBe sure to listen in to this podcast and catch all the gems of insight that I don't have time to write down here, including that of Andrew Ng, VP & Chief Scientist of Baidu, Co-Chairman and Co-Founder of Coursera, and an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University.Professor Ng calls AI ""the new electricity"" because it will soon be as powerful, ubiquitous, and ordinary for society as that technology was a century ago.I also share a story about veteran AI theorist, cognitive psychologist, entrepreneur and educational reformer Roger Schank and his war of ideas (and words) against IBM's (IBM  -  Free Report) Watson.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA, AMD, and BABA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

16,AMD,"Shares of semiconductor behemoth Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) opened relatively flat on Wednesday, just one day ahead of the release of the company’s pivotal third-quarter earnings report.The semiconductor space has been on fire all year, and as the largest chipmaker in the world, Intel is always a key bellwether for the industry as a whole. However, Intel shares have gained just 12.9% year-to-date, which lags behind the industry average.Indeed, Intel’s dominance has been threatened by several high-growth competitors, including Wall Street darlings Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) and AMD (AMD  -  Free Report). Nevertheless, the company has met or surpassed earnings estimates in 14 consecutive quarters, and with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the stock is looking strong heading into its report date.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Intel to post earnings of 80 cents per share and revenues of $15.71 billion this quarter. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 0.4% and -0.42%, respectively. While we are projecting relatively flat results in Q3, the company is expected to record full-year earnings growth of 10.7% and sales growth of 3.3%.But earnings and revenue aren’t the only thing investors will be interested in seeing once Intel reports on Thursday. On top of this, we’ll want to note how well the company is responding to the growth of new industry trends, such as cloud computing and the Internet of Things.Luckily, we can use our exclusive non-financial metrics estimates file to gauge the performance of Intel’s key divisions.

While not catastrophic, a 3% slump in revenues would underscore the threat of Intel’s aforementioned competition. This unit includes the company’s products designed for notebooks and desktops, so it could certainly feel the effects of gaming-friendly chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD.Nevertheless, Intel should see a nice gain in its Data Center Group. This is the company’s enterprise-focused segment, and with the rise of cloud computing, we’ve seen increased demand for products needed in high-performance networks and data storage centers.Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect Intel’s Data Center Group to report sales of $4.82 billion, up from $4.54 billion in the year-ago period.In a similar vein, Intel’s top line should see a nice contribution from the company’s Internet of Things Group. Intel designs a variety of products for use in many IoT markets, including retail, transportation, and smart cities—so it should stand to benefit as these trends continue to gain momentum.If our latest consensus estimates hold up, Intel is expected to post revenues of $772 million from its Internet of Things Group.

17,AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) reported non-GAAP earnings of 10 cents per share compared with 3 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents per share.Revenues increased 26% year over year and 34% sequentially to $1.64 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 billion. The quarterly revenue figure was also the highest since 2011, primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s product portfolio comprising Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon Vega.SegmentsAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments — Computing and Graphics (focused on the traditional PC market) and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities). Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics segment revenues witnessed year-over-year increase of 74% to $890 million. The growth was backed by accelerated sales of Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors.Operating income for this segment was $70 million against a loss of $66 million in third-quarter 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues.Client computing revenues recorded strong double-digit growth from the year-ago quarter driven by solid demand for the expanded Ryzen processor family in the desktop market. Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 processors constitute around 40% to 50% of the desktop market share. Additionally, the accelerated ramp up of shipments by OEM customers prior to the holiday season has increased adoption as well.Ryzen 3 processor has expanded the company’s foothold in the mainstream segment. Moreover, Ryzen Threadripper processors have enabled AMD to re-enter the high end desktop market. Notably, the company’s Ryzen PRO-based offerings have already been adopted by prominent commercial PC providers including Dell, Lenovo, and HP.The company achieved record Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) revenues on the back of improved average selling price (ASP) and higher unit shipments compared with the year-ago quarter.The company’s release of Vega-based GPUs and increasing demand for its Polaris products in both gaming and blockchain industries led to improved revenues. Launched during the quarter, Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs aimed at gaming enthusiasts has performed better than  previous Radeon GPUs.Additionally, AMD started the shipment of Radeon Instinct MI25 to major cloud data center customers and Radeon Pro WX 9100 graphics cards to the high-end content creation market during the quarter.Notably, the company entered into a partnership with Baidu during the quarter to focus on “optimizing” software for AMD’s Radeon Instinct GPUs in Baidu datacenters. Moreover, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Web Services announced that it is powering Amazon AppStream 2.0 with AMD Radeon Pro technology, aimed at driving cloud delivery of virtual applications.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomSegment revenues amounted to $824 million, almost flat  year over year but up 46% sequentially. However, higher costs brought down operating income for the segment from $136 million to $84 million for the quarter.The sequential increase in revenues was based on an increase in semi-custom revenues. Management expects the trend to continue in the holiday season.The ramping up of EPYC datacenter processors sale to cloud and OEM customers have boosted server revenues. Management remains optimistic about this product with companies like Tencent and JD.com planning to deploy the company’s EPYC processors. Baidu and Microsoft also announced plans of deploying EPYC based products in their hyperscale environment, which is another positive for AMD.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

18,AMD,"Investors in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 27, 2017 $18 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Bottom 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 7 cents per share to 8 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

21,AMD,"This week, over 30% of S&P 500 companies are set to release their third-quarter earnings reports, and one of the most noteworthy firms on this list of giants is the largest semiconductor maker in the world, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).Investors will want to pay close attention to Intel when it reports its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, as its results could underscore the growth of several major tech sector trends.The company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an overall VGM grade of “B.” And though shares of Intel have gained only 12.57% this year, which is less than the S&P 500 and well below the industry’s average gain, the stock does currently rest firmly near its 52-week high.These lofty heights can be attributed to Intel’s 15% climb over the last 12-weeks, including a nearly 10% gain in the last month alone. However, Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), AMD (AMD  -  Free Report), and other semiconductor companies have helped to curb Intel’s sector-wide dominance.In Q3, we expect Intel to post earnings of 80 cents per share and revenues of $15.71 billion, based on our latest consensus estimates, and intense competition among the top semiconductor players is part of the reason for these relatively flat projections.Yet, for the full-year, Intel is expected to post earnings growth of 10.7% and revenue growth of 3.3%. This should be good news for investors, but as we know, revenue and earnings are not the only things that matter.More detailed dives into Intel’s third-quarter are needed in order to gain a better understanding of the company’s current strength. This is where we can check our exclusive non-financial metrics estimates file to help determine how some of Intel’s specific divisions, including its vitally important Data Center Group, are expected to perform.These important stock drivers are from our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file.

22,AMD,"As we head further into the busiest stretch of the Q3 earnings season, investors are starting to turn their attention to the upcoming report from Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), the largest semiconductor company in the world. This chip-making behemoth will release its third-quarter financial results on Thursday, October 26.The semiconductor industry has been red-hot in 2017, especially as demand from emerging markets like cloud computing and the Internet of Things continues to heat up. However, Intel shares—which are up 12.5% on the year—have lagged the industry’s gains.Intel’s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with the chipmaker’s competition.Recently, Intel has felt pressure from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report). Nvidia’s artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment.But have Nvidia and AMD done enough to put a dent in Intel’s upcoming earnings report? Well, one approach to answering this question is to focus on Intel’s core business segments.Luckily, by using our exclusive non-financial metrics estimates file, we can gauge analyst sentiment and predict the company’s performance in its key units.  These important, stock-driving estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. Learn more here>>>Because of Nvidia and AMD’s popularity in the gaming market, we might expect to see an impact in Intel’s Client Computing Group. This business segment includes the company’s products designed for notebooks and desktops, so it could certainly feel the effects of these gaming-friendly chipmakers.According to our latest consensus estimates, the Client Computing Group is expected to post revenues of $8.62 billion, which would represent a slump of about 3% from the $8.89 billion posted in the year-ago period.Still, while this dip could imply that Intel is losing some market share in the personal computing space, the company has made some strides in this area recently. For example, Intel recently launched its eighth-generation Core processors, which should lift the company’s gaming endeavors.And on top of this, the Client Computing Group has been a surprise performer for Intel this year. In fact, in the second quarter, Intel posted revenues of $8.21 billion in this unit. That results smashed our consensus estimate of $7.82 billion and marked year-over-year growth of nearly 12%.Heading into its report, Intel is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock also has a positive Earnings ESP of 0.06%, so we can feel more confident about the company’s chance at an earnings beat.Intel shares are sitting near their 52-week, but if the company can outperform again—especially in key categories like Client Computing—the stock might just break into a new range (also read: 3 Key Estimates for Intel's Q3 Earnings Report).Make sure to check back here for our full analysis once Intel releases its report later this week!Want more stock market analysis from this author?

24,AMD,"Shares of semiconductor behemoth Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) opened relatively flat on Wednesday, just one day ahead of the release of the company’s pivotal third-quarter earnings report.The semiconductor space has been on fire all year, and as the largest chipmaker in the world, Intel is always a key bellwether for the industry as a whole. However, Intel shares have gained just 12.9% year-to-date, which lags behind the industry average.Indeed, Intel’s dominance has been threatened by several high-growth competitors, including Wall Street darlings Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) and AMD (AMD  -  Free Report). Nevertheless, the company has met or surpassed earnings estimates in 14 consecutive quarters, and with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the stock is looking strong heading into its report date.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Intel to post earnings of 80 cents per share and revenues of $15.71 billion this quarter. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 0.4% and -0.42%, respectively. While we are projecting relatively flat results in Q3, the company is expected to record full-year earnings growth of 10.7% and sales growth of 3.3%.But earnings and revenue aren’t the only thing investors will be interested in seeing once Intel reports on Thursday.

25,AMD,"We are in the heart of the Q3 earnings season, with more than 700 companies, including 180 S&P 500 members, expected to come up with their financial numbers by the end of this week.The Picture Thus FarWe already have Q3 results from 87 S&P 500 members that combined account for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Per the latest Earnings Trends (as of Oct 20), total earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the prior-year quarter on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% positive earnings surprises and 70.1% beating revenue estimates.Revenues for this cohort were up 4.4% sequentially.So far, the results paint a positive and reassuring picture of corporate earnings, which is expected to strengthen and get reconfirmed through the remainder of this reporting cycle.Coming to the technology sector, we expect it to benefit from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Let’s take a look at these three companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Oct 24.Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI  is likely to beat third-quarter 2017 expectations as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 0.07%.Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteWe expect TI to perform well driven by strength in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. It continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in these areas. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the past four quarters, TI’s analog business has witnessed both sequential and year-over-year growth. We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.6 billion.Given the strong product lines, we also expect Embedded Processing segment to perform well in the upcoming quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $904 million.We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have gained 30.4% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 33.8% rally. (You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Let’s take a sneak peek at Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report), the leading producer of microprocessors and chipsets in the world that is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.Notably, the company has a record of positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 35%. We note that AMD has introduced a host of new products during the quarter which is anticipated to give the top line a boost going forward. The company unveiled AMD4U comprising gaming applications and tools that are in compliance with AMD processors and graphics.The stock has an Earnings ESP of -7.90% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 7 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 8 cents. The stock’s negative ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) makes surprise prediction difficult.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD expects third-quarter 2017 revenues to increase 23% sequentially (+/- 3%). At the mid-point, this reflects 15% growth on a year-over-year basis. Further, gross margin is likely to be 34%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $400 million. (Read: What's in Store for Advanced Micro in Q3 Earnings?)We observe that shares of Advanced Micro have gained 21.8% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 27.9% rally.Lastly, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) is a global provider of content delivery network (CDN) and cloud infrastructure services.Notably, the company has a record of positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 35%.

We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteAkamai's top-line growth continues to be affected by lower revenues from the large Internet Platform group companies. We expect the newly launched products to take some more time to generate meaningful growth.However, in the last quarter, Akamai stated that it witnessed high level of network traffic on its platform, which is anticipated to be a major tailwind for the company’s revenues.For the upcoming third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $610 million, indicating 4.5% year-over-year increase. Revenues in the second quarter came in at $609 million. Earnings are projected to be 59 cents per share, lower than 62 cents per share reported in the last quarter.Notably, effective second-quarter 2016, Akamai started reporting its business under three main divisions – Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects Media division revenues to be around $271 million.

26,AMD,"Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26.Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 5.59%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.88%.Intel guided third-quarter 2017 revenues of around $15.7 billion (+/-$500 million), almost flat sequentially and up 3% year over year. This excludes revenues from Intel Security Group business.The company’s results will benefit from stable PC trends and anticipated demand for newly launched Xeon Scalable processors. This will boost Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center Group (DCG) revenues that account for almost 56% and 30% of top line, respectively.Moreover, Intel’s expanding presence in the rapidly-growing autonomous vehicle market is a key catalyst.CCG — Stable PC Trend PositiveWe note that segment revenue growth rate has outperformed the PC market in the last couple of quarters. Market research firms — Gartner and IDC — believe that the PC market trends are showing signs of stability, which bodes well for Intel.However, intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD  -  Free Report) based on an expanding product portfolio is a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the CCG segment is currently pegged at $8.62 billion.DCG —  Purley Upgrade to Drive GrowthIntel’s newly launched Xeon Scalable (formerly known as Skylake) processors on Purley platform accelerates inference throughput for High Performance Computing (HPC), Virtual Reality (VR), AI cloud, storage, communication and Internet of Things (IoT).Data center operators are likely to upgrade their servers from Grantley to Purley post Xeon Scalable launch. This presents significant growth opportunity for Intel. The company currently addresses almost 40% of the data center market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the DCG segment is currently pegged at $4.82 billion.Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation Quote Mobileye Buyout Improves Competitiveness We believe that the acquisition of Mobileye, which was completed during the last quarter (more than 97% shares tendered), strengthens Intel’s competitive position against NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) in the autonomous vehicle market.The acquisition now enables Intel to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles — cameras, in-car networking, sensor chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management.In our view, Intel’s collaboration with Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) division, Waymo, is also a key catalyst.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Moreover, our proven model shows that Intel is likely to beat earnings due to the favorable combination of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and +0.06% Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

27,AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24. Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 35%.In the last quarter, the company reported a loss of a penny per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents per share. Revenues increased 19% year over year to $1.22 billion, primarily driven by growing demand for the Graphics Processor Units (GPU) and an expanding customer base. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 billion.           AMD expects third-quarter 2017 revenues to increase 23% sequentially (+/- 3%). At the mid-point, this reflects 15% growth on a year-over-year basis. Further, gross margin is likely to be 34%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $400 million.AMD stock has gained 23% year to date, underperforming the 28.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe note that AMD has introduced a host of new products during the quarter which is anticipated to boost the top-line positively going ahead. The company unveiled AMD4U comprising gaming applications and tools that are in compliance with AMD processors and graphics.Notably, the lineup of Ryzen mainstream desktops was completed with AMD releasing Ryzen 3 1300X and Ryzen 3 1200 processors during the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company also focused on certain advancements related to creation of professional content as evident from the company’s introduction of Radeon Pro WX 9100 and Radeon Pro SSG, a new range of professional graphics cards.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteThe company also launched Radeon RX Vega, a gaming card aimed at enhancing experiences on PC gaming platforms. Additionally, arrival of 16-core, 32-thread Ryzen Threadripper 1950X and 12-core, 24-thread Ryzen Threadripper 1920X processors is a further positive for the company.We believe these new launches will prove to be beneficial for the company’s top line, thereby providing AMD with a competitive edge against industry peers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report).Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Advanced Micro is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Advanced Micro’s Earnings ESP is -7.90%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 7 cents per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 8 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Advanced Micro carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of 0.19% and sporting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

28,AMD,"(0:30) - What Is AI?(2:00) - An Inside Look At Nvidia(9:00) - What Not To Do In The Stock Market: Phil Hellmuth(14:30) - Facebook and Intel's AI Partnership (19:00) - AI Plays Poker (24:00) - Creating A Computer With Intuition(31:00) - Episode Roundup:Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of Behavioral Economics.Since I am an investor in an exciting technology company you may have heard of called NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), I often find myself in the position of having to explain to my followers and fellow investors ""what exactly is AI"" in a practical, right-now sense, and not some science fiction sense.NVDA's type of computer chip, the GPU, is at the heart of modern AI R&D and they sell a lot of them not just for advanced gaming graphics but also to industry for applications in autonomous driving where Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), Toyota and Mercedes are customers.NVDA also has a bigger business selling their processors to big cloud companies like Amazon, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft, IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report). In fact, NVDA AI chips power IBM's Watson.If you want to learn more about NVDA's GPU chip technologies, see my video Get Your MPA in Deep Learning.In the podcast that accompanies this article, I break down where NVDA will earn its $9 billion in revenues this year.What’s the Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?My objective today is to explain what the terms ""machine learning"" and ""deep learning"" mean and what their applications can be used for. Here are my layman's definitions, because I thought if I can't put computer scientist jargon into my own words, then I don't understand it well enough.Machine learning (ML) is how computer scientists can train a system to recognize sets of data and their attributes well enough to compare/contrast and make decisions about what is selected or acted on when presented with new data.Engineers speak of ""training"" computers to analyze, evaluate, and choose at various pre-determined decision points based on past recorded experience with a database.Deep learning (DL) is an advanced subset of ML that takes everything a step further by creating new outcomes or ""answers"" that are not part of a pre-determined list of choices, or a database. The description of what is going on here is called ""inference.""Disclaimer: I am not a computer scientist or engineer. I am simply an investor who is fascinated by technology that changes our lives, or that solves uniquely challenging problems, even as it invents new ones.So I will not pretend to be an authority on AI, machine learning, or deep learning.Consider this podcast an experiment... where I will attempt to highlight the unique aspects of these exciting technologies. It's such a big topic, I'll be doing this in two parts at least.Because the science and the companies applying it could fill hours and I'd never get bored. I hope after this first episode that you feel the same way.I’ll be reading from some articles on the work of the computer scientists who solved a particular puzzle and I will tell you where you can find the source articles and scientific papers, including the NVDA blog and podcast.If I screw something up, or could have explained it better, I expect to hear from you: email me at KCook@Zacks.comAnd if you are an AI expert who wants to be on the show to help clear the waters I might have muddied, let me know that too.Hellmuth's HellToday's lesson begins with a poker blow-up...I spent some time this past weekend watching YouTube videos of pro poker tournaments. Phil Hellmuth is infamous for not keeping his cool like Daniel Negreanu. Hellmuth gets emotionally upset and angry about two things:1) opponents not playing rationally optimal (he shames them)2) wild randomness (he blames bad luck as well as opponent's good luck)See my recent video Gaming the Stock Market with Poker Smarts for more on the behavioral skill of Negreanu.I'm not a very experienced poker player and I've never played high stakes. So I can't say I wouldn't get as emotional as Phil Hellmuth after losing $50,000 or $500,000. But I do have deep experience where this type of self-management does not work: trading and investing.In the early 2000s I invented a probability training simulation called Probability, Risk, and Optimal Profit (PROP) to teach new traders how to over-ride their emotional patterns and cognitive biases.The way I learned to trade, probability-based thinking and habits were the antidote to irrational, emotion-driven decisions. I used to teach my students this phrase...""I'm just a surfer looking for the next wave, never blaming or hating the ocean for being itself.""After a weekend of thinking about Hellmuth and how I have spent the last 20 years trying to do the opposite of him in the stock market, I was thrilled to stumble across the NVIDIA AI Podcast on Monday morning in which host Michael Copeland interviewed Michael Bowling, the lead scientist behind the extremely rational and disciplined skill of an AI poker “player” named DeepStack.You can learn more about it in my podcast, including how to get the 2015 Science paper from DeepStack's inventors at the University of Alberta.Deep Blue Was ""Brute Force"" ComputationWhen you think of computers winning at complicated games with randomness, probably the first thing that comes to mind is IBM's Deep Blue tackling Garry Kasparov in a 6-game match in the 1990s.That was a super-computer which could calculate all the possible decision points out to some end-game state and then choose the highest probability path each time. Billions of calculations per minute are what is known as ""brute force"" computing.Other early applications of ML were email spam filters (no offense to the canned meat or anyone who enjoys it).And ML computer vision is being used in factories and autonomous driving systems like that of Mobileye which was purchased by Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) this year for $15 billion.Cyber-security companies like FireEye (FEYE  -  Free Report) also use both machine and deep learning applications to detect and thwart network threats. Solving Texas Hold'emBut compared to chess, poker is much more complicated puzzle to ""solve"" because it offers incomplete information: you don't know what cards the other player is holding.Poker is not only a terrific laboratory to do AI R&D, it's also a great classroom to learn about the methods and achievements of AI scientists.And that's because the heads-up limit version of Texas hold'em offers complexity of just 10 to the 14th power, whereas the no-limit version creates nearly infinite complexity of 10 to the 160th power!For their first victory, the team at the University of Alberta used AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) chips in their poker-player-destroying machine. For the new wrecking ball, they used NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1080 series.Check out my podcast to learn what the computer scientists from Edmonton mean by ""solved"" and how they taught their machine to use its ""intuition.""Intuition may sound like a stretch to teach a computer but researchers have been perfecting a prerequisite to machine learning for decades. They call it CFR for counterfactual regret. Be sure to tune in to hear what that’s all about.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA, BABA, FEYE, and AMD for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

29,AMD,"Investors in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 20, 2017 $28 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics – Semiconductorsindustry that ranks in the Top 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 7 cents per share to 8 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

30,AMD,"(1:00) - What The Framers Couldn't Imagine(7:00) - Monty Hall: The Probability Brain Buster(12:30) - Jeff Yass: The Power Of Rational Thinking(18:30) - Breaking Down The Probability Of The Monty Hall Problem(24:00) - Daniel Negreanu: Probability Simulation(28:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of Behavioral Economics.Last week, I made a video presentation called Gaming the Stock Market with Poker Smarts where I drew some very important connections between the behavioral analysis of poker champion Daniel Negreanu and the work that I do in playing stocks.I wanted to follow-up this week with an expanded discussion on the topic.And then something happened over the weekend that made me more certain about what angle to take: the legendary game show host Monty Hall of ""Let's Make a Deal"" fame passed away at the ripe young age of 96!Monty's fun and laughs with his infamous Big Deal to win a new car simply by choosing one of 3 doors became a fantastic probability brain buster because of the fact he always gave contestants a chance to switch their original choice -- and risk ending up with a goat.But Hall helped you by opening one of the doors that had a goat, so now you knew there was one less goat lurking behind the door you chose and the other that he was offering you. In the 1970s and 1980s it became a big discussion in national newspapers about whether it mattered if you switched your original choice.And many times it was math professors who got the answer wrong.I learned to dissect this probability challenge from one of the great Market Wizards in Jack Schwager's books.I'll explain both The Monty Hall Problem and the options trader who helped me understand it in a moment.Prayers for VegasBefore I dive into today's episode though, I want to be thoughtful and respectful with regard to one of the US kingdoms where this gambling math reigns: Las Vegas, NV.Just two days ago, on Sunday October 1 at around 10pm Las Vegas time, a twisted coward opened fire with several assault weapons on a large concert crowd by the Mandalay Bay resort and casino, owned by MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report).At this time, nearly 60 people have lost their lives and hundreds more are injured, with dozens still fighting for their lives.While there will be endless media coverage all week, all any of us really need to do is just imagine the horror of watching one of your friends or loved ones die in your arms. It makes me want to be very quiet, utterly speechless in sadness.I have taken many moments of silence in the past two days for all that pain and suffering at the hands of some angry idiot with access to too much lethal military-grade destructive force.But more importantly, in the aftermath of the tragedy as so many families in Vegas and beyond are hurting terribly, we have to lift up our heads and acknowledge all the police, fire, and medical personnel who helped and continue to help victims. Their lives will never be the same.And then there are the strangers who helped one another, and those heroes who lost their lives trying to protect and save others. Strength and peace to all of them.The Monty Hall ProblemIn the mid-1990s as a clerk on the trading floors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, I was fortunate to come across two books by a thinking man's trader, Jack Schwager. His Market Wizards books were packed with interviews of great commodity, currency, and stock traders like George Soros, Paul Tudor Jones, and Monroe Trout.In The New Market Wizards, Schwager talked to Jeff Yass who used a variation of Monty Hall's Big Deal to explain the power of probability-based thinking.Do you know how to put the odds in your favor to win a car instead of a goat?It's trickier than you think, even when you think Monty is trying to trick (or help) you.That's where Jeff Yass, a billionaire trader and founder of options giant Susquehanna International, comes in to help us.Yass built his options empire, with five other partners, near Philadelphia where he earned his wealth of trading experience as a member of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in the early 1980s. This was just about the time that stock options trading was really taking off with the aid of computers.And it was after Yass and his buddies made millions gambling the odds in Vegas.In 2009, PhillyMag.com profiled Yass and gave a great intro to the Monty Hall Problem...Let's play a game. Let’s say you’re a contestant on Let’s Make a Deal, Monty Hall’s game show from a generation ago. It’s your moment. There are three doors. Behind one door is a brand-new Camaro. Behind each of the other doors, there’s a goat. If you pick the right door, the Camaro is yours.Silky-voiced Monty Hall gives you the big question:“Do you pick door number one, door number two or door number three?”The studio audience weighs in, and tension builds, as you think. Finally you pick, let’s say, door number one. But Carol Merrill, Monty’s assistant, doesn’t open it, not yet. Instead, Monty Hall directs Carol to open one of the other doors — door number two, say. Behind that door is … a goat. The audience titters nervously — that Camaro, still hidden, might yet be yours.First, though, Monty is going to give you another choice. He’s going to give you both an option, and a dilemma:“Would you like to stay with door number one,” he asks, “or would you like to switch to door number three?”You ponder. But it’s a no-brainer, right? With two doors left, there’s a 50-50 chance the Camaro is behind either one. So you might as well stick with door number one.(end of PhillyMag.com excerpt)For the wisdom of Jeff Yass on the best way to think about this dilemma, be sure to listen to my podcast.I also explain what inspired me to teach myself probability and statistics in my 30s (after spending the first 30 years of my life ""allergic to algebra"") and two reasons why everyone should strive to learn more of these essential maths:First, because it has always been true that people can lie and fool you with statistics, whether from science or public policy.Second, we have never been more inundated with data in the age of IBM, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), the data-crunching and creating monsters, and their data workhorses, the semiconductor companies creating the future of advanced computing and AI, like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report).Hence, being adept with probability and statistics will become an absolutely vital 21st century knowledge-skill set.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and AMD for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

31,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) moved higher throughout morning trading hours on Tuesday, eventually hitting an intraday peak of $13.48—a 6% climb from Monday’s close—just before noon.The move comes on the back of the chipmaker’s latest product announcement. On Tuesday, AMD unveiled its Embedded Radeon E9170 Series graphic processing unit, a GPU that is optimized for low-power embedded applications.“The new AMD Embedded Radeon E9170 Series GPU not only achieves up to 3X the performance-per-watt over previous solutions, but is the first ‘Polaris’-based Embedded GPU available in the MCM form factor to enable sleek designs in a variety of sizes, striking the optimal balance of performance and power efficiency,” said Colin Cureton, director of product management at AMD Enterprise Solutions.In its press release, AMD mentioned that the E9170 Series has a wide variety of applications. Of these, the chipmaker described how the new GPU could power digital casino games, thin clients, medical displays, retail signage, and industrial shock tests.Investors are clearly bullish about AMD’s newest GPU, which is yet another example of the graphics chipmaker working to legitimize to its enterprise offerings. Expanding its enterprise GPU line—and competing against the likes of Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report)—is a key goal for AMD.AMD’s graphics chips have seen increased demand from cryptocurrency mining, which has skyrocketed in popularity as the price of things like bitcoin and ethereum have grown. But the company itself has admitted that cryptocurrencies are not a long-term growth driver—making product announcements like today’s even more important.Interestingly enough, the latest surge in AMD shares is also coming on the same day that short interest in the stock reached an all-time high. According to Business Insider and financial-analytics provider S3 Partners, AMD shares sold short rose to 159 million—a new record and an estimated 18% of total shares available.Shorting AMD has not been a consistently profitable strategy this year, but after the stock’s 83% gain over the past 52 weeks, many investors are betting that the popular chipmaker will lose steam soon. As for now, AMD sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

32,AMD,"Mellanox Technologies Inc. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is riding high on expanding customer base and portfolio strength driven by strategic partnerships.To date in 2017, the company’s products have been selected by cloud computing and semiconductor bigwigs like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Alibaba Group (BABA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD  -  Free Report).Moreover, collaborations with the likes of VMware and HPE has significantly expanded Mellanox’s product portfolio.Interconnect Solutions Gain Rapid AdoptionMarket research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. This exponential growth bodes well for Mellanox’s interconnect solutions owing to growing demand for higher network speeds for fast processing of data.InfiniBand is highly scalable and its off-loading capabilities that reduce load on CPUs are attracting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning providers. Moreover, increasing adoption of cloud computing is driving demand for Ethernet, which is considered better than Fibre Channel, primarily due to its high speed (100 G versus 16/32 G) and low cost.Recently, Mellanox’s Spectrum Ethernet Switch was selected by Hewlett Packard to power its StoreFabric M-series storage networking switches. Spectrum is the part of Ethernet Storage Fabric (ESF) solution, which per Mellanox, is the fastest and most efficient Ethernet storage network available for the enterprise and cloud.Mellanox’s products are gaining rapid adoption, which is evident from Alibaba’s deployment of 25GbE and 100GbE ConnectX-4 EN family of Ethernet adapters in its data centers.Moreover, Mellanox’s Ethernet and InfiniBand interconnect solutions are powering AMD’s EPYC processors, which were launched in June, this year. Intel’s Xeon Scalable processor-based compute and storage platforms are also using the company’s InfiniBand solution.Collaborations Drive Customer BaseApart from strong demand for Mellanox’s interconnect solutions, collaborations with the likes of VMware and Hewlett Packard have helped the company gain strong footprint in the cloud and data-center market.Mellanox has partnered with VMware to combine iSER (iSCSI Extensions for Remote Direct Memory Access) networking solutions with vSphere. The company’s iSER uses an Ethernet Storage Fabric as a unified connectivity solution for compute and storage. This provides improved performance at lower costs.Mellanox has also partnered with Hewlett Packard, under which the former’s ConnectX-5 InfiniBand adapters and Switch-IB2 InfiniBand switches were used in latter’s HPE SGI 8600 and HPE Apollo 6000 Gen10 systems.We note that NASA Ames Research Center has selected Mellanox’s EDR InfiniBand solutions along with HPE SGI 8600 liquid cooled platform to expand its “Electra” supercomputing cluster.Mellanox’s collaboration with Microsemi Corporation is also expected to solidify the company’s footprint in the high performance computing market going forward.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

34,AMD,"Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) recently announced that its 8 Generation desktop processors will be available in the market from Oct 5, 2017. These processors are primarily aimed at gaming and overclocking customers who need faster computing speed.The processor family consists of upgraded versions of Core i3 to Core i7. It includes 6-core Core i5 and 4-core Core i3 desktop processors as well as Core i7-8700K. This is reportedly Intel’s best desktop processor with a 4.7 GHz maximum single-core turbo frequency and is touted as an apt processor for single and multithread based applications.Notably, supported by Intel ""Z370"" chipset-based motherboards, the new chipsets are capable of editing 4K 360-degree videos at a 32% faster speed compared with the prior edition. Moreover, the addition of unlocked ""K"" processors that deliver high level of tuning flexibility has made the new launch even more lucrative.PC Gaming Market Growth to Boost Chip SalesIn a recent article, PC Gamer quoted Gartner, which predicted that sale of gaming PCs will increase from 6 million units in 2016 to 8.7 million units in 2020. These will contribute to around 13% of the entire PC shipment revenues.Moreover, per Jon Peddie Research, the PC gaming industry is anticipated to witness CAGR of 6% through 2019. The optimistic projections driven by strong demand for gaming PCs bode well for Intel’s next-generation desktop processors.The launch of game-focused processors comes at an opportune time for the chipmaker. Intel is facing stiff competition from a resurgent Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) in most of its operating segments including PCs. In the mobile segment, the company has failed miserably against Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report).Recently, Digitimes reported that Intel has delayed the release of some of its next-generation Cannon Lake-based processors, mostly the ones with an integrated GPU, to the end of 2018. These processors reportedly ensure 25% improvement in performance and consume 45% less power compared with the existing 14 nm Kaby Lake processors.We believe that the delay in Cannon Lake release will hurt notebook sales in the near term. Some Intel partners are speculated to skip Canon Lake for the next-generation Ice Lake CPUs. This may hurt the company’s top line as PC sales continue to remain sluggish per the data available from Gartner.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

36,AMD,"Shares of Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) were down more than 3.3% through early afternoon trading Thursday. The dip appears to be a cautionary response to recent reports that a certain electric car giant had chosen its chip-making rival for a new AI partnership.On Wednesday afternoon, CNBC reported that Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) had recruited the services of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) to develop an AI-powered self-driving car chip. According to the publication’s source, Tesla has assigned more than 50 employees to the project.Wall Street’s immediate reaction was to declare the partnership a significant validation of AMD’s technology, and shares of the chipmaker subsequently popped more than 5% on Wednesday afternoon (also read: Investors Bullish on AMD's AI Partnership with Tesla).“The net/net here for AMD is that Tesla has confirmed AMD's CPU and GPU roadmaps in a field that nobody was considering as viable; it says that AMD's CPU/GPUs in PC and server markets are the real deal,” said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann in a note.Up to this point, Nvidia has been considered the standalone AI chip king, so an entrance into this booming market by AMD—already a major competitor in the GPU space—might be enough to make some investors cautious.However, we’ve already seen some detraction from CNBC’s original story. In fact, Reuters just published a new report that cited a spokesperson from GlobalFoundries, which fabricates chips for AMD, who said that Tesla has not committed to any partnership with the chipmaker.“Tesla has not committed to working with us on any autonomous driving technology or product,” the spokesperson told Reuters.On top of this, it’s unlikely that the partnership would have a significant impact on AMD’s bottom line, so analysts were quick to tell Nvidia investors to shake off the news. In a note on Thursday, RBC Capital analyst Mitch Steves told investors to “ignore the noise,” while B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis said the report was more of a “psychological” negative than anything else.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

37,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) opened higher on Thursday as investors continued to react to reports that the trendy chipmaker is working with Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) to develop AI processors for self-driving cars.On Wednesday afternoon,CNBC reported that the two companies were working together on the autonomous car chip, and according to the publication’s source, Tesla has assigned more than 50 employees to the project.Just a few hours after the initial reports emerged, analysts were already reacting to the partnership. In response to the news, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his “buy” rating for AMD and praised the new relationship.“The Tesla/AMD move has disruptive implications to the multi-billion self-driving market,” Mosesmann said. “The net/net here for AMD is that Tesla has confirmed AMD's CPU and GPU roadmaps in a field that nobody was considering as viable; it says that AMD's CPU/GPUs in PC and server markets are the real deal.”Mosesmann wasn’t the only analyst to view the Tesla/AMD partnership has a validation of AMD’s technology. In a note to clients on Thursday, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis also reiterated his “buy” rating on AMD and echoed a very similar sentiment.“While we would not expect shipments of AMD chips to Tesla to have a material impact near term to AMD bottom line … we think this would constitute a critical win for AMD as it would support our thesis that with its parallel processing GPUs, AMD is a beneficiary,” Lipacis wrote.AMD shares popped more than 5% in afternoon trading on Wednesday. On Thursday, the stock opened another 1% higher but quickly sunk into the red—along with the markets as a whole.AMD has gained more than 118% over the past year, making it one of the biggest movers in the red-hot semiconductor space. For now, the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

38,AMD,"Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) shares are on a tear this year, having gained about 75% (as of Sep 18, 2017). But the latest jump came on the back of “a hyper-bullish report from Evercore ISI senior equity research analyst C.J. Muse.” Shares added more than 4% on Sep 18.Muse's report on Friday morning pushed up the semiconductor company’s price target from $180 to $250, breezing past Wall Street's previously highest target of $200, as quoted on CNBC. The analyst noted that “we are only at the cusp of AI's growth potential and NVIDIA is creating THE AI computing industry standard.""Another analyst believes that Nvidia “looks [a] lot like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) did back in the early 1990s before a multiyear rally that took that stock up some 17-fold.”Nvidia, which designs, develops and markets a top-to-bottom family of award-winning 3D graphics processors, graphics processing units and related software, is hugely benefiting from a cryptocurrency rally.Bitcoin is on fire this year. These are ‘mined’ by using a greater amount of computer processing power. Creation and transactions in bitcoin are controlled through cryptography to keep transactions secure (read: Bitcoin Skyrockets, Race to First Cryptocurrency ETF Heats Up).Like bitcoin, Ether or etherum is also quite popular this year. Now, mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. A hardware known as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is designed explicitly for mining bitcoin.This where semiconductor companies can gain traction. As per Bloomberg, there was a 10-fold rise from April to June in the Ethereum market which helped shares of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) substantially (read: Should You Buy These Semiconductor ETFs & Stocks Now).Inside Stock Strength The earnings projection for the upcoming quarter was upped to 94 cents per share from 78 cents in the last 60 days. Seven out of eight analysts raised estimates while none did the opposite.Nvidia has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of C. The Zacks Industry Rank and Zacks Sector Rank are in the top 1% and top 31%, respectively.ETFs to BuyGiven the bullishness, investors should definitely ride the surge in a basket form.

39,AMD,"Given the recent optimism surrounding NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), it is just a matter of few days that the stock will gain another $13 and breach the $200 mark. The stock closed trading at $187.55 yesterday.Shares of NVIDIA have gained a whopping 75.7% year to date (YTD). If you still haven’t taken advantage of this appreciation yet, then this is the right time to add the stock to your portfolio. Notably, NVIDIA has substantially outperformed the industry to which it belongs to, which has gained 24.1% YTD.Raised Target Price Boosts Share PriceThe stock hit new highs, back to back, over the last two trading days. This upswing came after two major investment firms raised the target price and commented that the company’s prospects look promising. The firms further noted that the stock is poised to carry this bullish momentum ahead, in turn boosting its share price.The stock first scaled a 52-week high of $180.11 last Friday, after investment firm Evercore ISI’s analyst, C.J. Muse, reiterated his outperform rating on the stock and raised the target price to $250 — approximately 48% higher than the previous day’s closing price of $169.40.On the very next trading day, i.e. Monday, NVIDIA crafted its all-time high of $191.20 after Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s analyst — Vivek Arya — raised its target price to $210, which is again nearly 17% higher than Friday’s closing price.What’s Raising the Optimism?Both analysts believe NVIDIA will dominate the Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip market in the near future, similar to its performance in the gaming and data center markets.Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients, “Our positive view on Nvidia is based on its underappreciated transformation from a traditional PC graphics chip vendor, into a supplier into high end gaming, enterprise graphics, cloud, accelerated computing and automotive markets.” He further added, “Similar to other large successful tech industries, we expect the $30bn AI chip market to also feature one dominant supplier – we think NVDA.”Evercore ISI’s Muse shares a similar view and believes NVIDIA is building “the industry standard” in artificial intelligence computing, which “will be nearly impossible to replicate.” He further added that the company is well poised to get the “first-mover advantage” and will continue maintaning its sturdy presence in the AI training system.Bottom LineNVIDIA remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. Given the accelerated momentum in gaming, datacenter and automotive technology, we believe this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, with a long-term EPS growth estimate of 10.3%, will continue to rally in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Many might argue that NVIDIA, with its hefty forward P/E valuation of 52.1x compared with the industry average of 18.2x, is a risky bet. Nevertheless, we beg to differ as high valuations and increasing share prices do not necessarily imply that the stock does not have much upside potential left.NVIDIA has grabbed attention with striking performances on the back of solid earnings results and strong growth projections.Furthermore, with its consistent efforts toward attaining robust position in several emerging industries such as AI, deep learning and driverless cars industry, NVIDIA has outpaced other competitors in the space such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report), in terms of growth.Therefore, we believe investing in this stock will yield promising returns for your portfolio in the short term.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity. But which stocks should you buy? Zacks just released Cybersecurity: An Investor’s Guide to Locking Down Profits to help answer this question.This new Special Report gives you the information you need to make well-informed investment choices in this space.

40,AMD,"(0:40) - Investing With AI & Big Data(3:45) - Natural Language Processing(5:20) - What Is The Source Of The Big Data Used?(10:00) - BUZZ U.S Sentiment Leaders ETF Overview: BUZ(12:45) - Market Value and Sector Weighting Breakdown(15:35) - Investing Themes Using BUZ Strategy: The Rise Of Big Data(20:40) - What's Next For AI, Big Data and Social Media?(22:25) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comAs more and more content appears online, it is creating a tsunami of data that is on a totally unprecedented scale from a historical perspective. Tweets, Facebook posts, blog entries, and a variety of other content fills up the internet with millions of messages and fresh data points on a minute-by-minute basis, and it is only increasing by the day.Some might think there is too much noise out there and that any sort of useful signal is too difficult to find in this sea of data, but that may not be true. That is because recent advances on the technological front—specifically in the fields of Big Data and natural language processing—make sifting through loads of data a whole lot easier than what we saw even a few years ago.This could be great news for stock investors too, as we can now utilize new Artificial Intelligence applications to shift through the data and find key trends in terms of online sentiment. For more on this approach, I spoke with Jamie Wise, the CEO and founder of Buzz Indexes in this week’s Dutram Report to learn how investors are tapping into technological advances, and how ETF investors can play this information revolution too. Buzz ApproachFirst off, Jamie and I discuss what is actually meant by ‘natural language processing’ and what kind of technological advances we have seen in the data world over the past few years. These key changes make analysis of online sentiment trends possible for stock investors, allowing algorithms to read online posts and determine if they are focused on the stock, or on a given customer’s experience with a company instead.Once we’ve gone over the basics, we move on to what kind of sources are used for the information, and this includes everything from Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), to posts on various other sites as well. Some do receive higher weights than others in the models, but it is clear that a number of sources are used for the data.Index & BUZ ETFBeyond that, we also talk about how this is put into practice with the BUZZ NextGen AI US Sentiment Leaders Index, the basis for the BUZ ETF. Jamie lets us in on how this index was developed, and some of the key factors that go into this benchmark’s construction. We also talk about what is meant by ‘sentiment’ and why focusing on this metric could be a good idea for investors.One area that was especially interesting to me, was the idea that investors generally focus in on a few companies in a select number of industries. How does one expand the reach to a broader company list, and is there enough info for some of the smaller stocks out there? Jamie walks us through the answers to these questions in the podcast, but it definitely seems like the group of possible stocks is growing by the day as more information is hitting the web all the time.We also discuss a few ways in which this approach has been helpful as of late, focusing in on the tech sector. In particular, we zero in on the chip space, which has definitely been in the spotlight lately.Two companies that we highlighted were Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report). Check out the podcast for more on how the Buzz model spotted these stocks ahead of some strong performances for both, and what this means for stocks in the future too. But definitely check out the podcast for additional information on the index’s construction, and the key things to note about this AI-focused approach!What’s Next?Jamie and I also talk about what is coming down the pike for Buzz Indexes, and the additional ways this approach could be utilized in the ETF world. I also make the parallel between this technique and the idea of the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ and we discuss how this index—in many ways—is a more advanced application of that popular concept.Finally, we also discuss what is ahead for the world of social media and the big data landscape too. Check out the podcast for more information on these topics, and more, in this edition of the Dutram Report!Bottom LineBut what do you think about this approach to finding winning stocks? Can the wisdom of the crowd be a leading indicator for investing?

41,AMD,"The blockchain fever is high thanks to an astronomical surge in bitcoin price. The digital currency skyrocketed to a fresh high of above $5,000 in late August from around $997 at the start of the year (read: Bitcoin Skyrockets, Race to First Cryptocurrency ETF Heats Up).Inside The SurgeThe excitement surrounding the cryptocurrency is due to the blockchain technology that backs bitcoin. The blockchain is a decentralized public ledger, which offers a secure, fast and cheaper medium of carrying out online transaction and online transfer of information without the need of third-party verification. Other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are also powered by the blockchain technology.According to the Market and Markets report, business surrounding the blockchain technology is expected to grow from $210.2 million in 2016 from $2.32 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 61.2%. The global Blockchain Technology Market’s research report projects a CAGR of 55.6% from 2017 to 2021.Additionally, the split of the digital currency into bitcoin and bitcoin cash added to the strength last month. The action will expedite transaction time, leading to a speedy growth of the cryptocurrency (read: Bitcoin Soars to Record High: Fork, Futures and ETFs Explained).Further, bitcoin is gradually becoming a safe-haven currency as tensions between North Korea and the United Stated as well as the Washington turmoil have spurred a rally in the digital currency. Moreover, strong demand from Japan and rising institutional investor interest are pushing up the price of bitcoin.Dip: A Buying OpportunityThe cryptocurrency is currently trading below $4,000, down 20% since the start of this month following talks of China's central bank restricting the trade of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on domestic exchanges. The current dip could be a buying opportunity for investors to capitalize on the strong optimism surrounding this innovative technology (see: all the Technology ETFs here).How to Play?Given this, we have highlighted three ETFs & stocks that are benefiting most from the bitcoin surge and the blockchain technology boom. The trend is likely to continue in the months ahead.ETFsWhile several issuers have filed for bitcoin ETFs in recent months, none of these have received approval until now. However, the popularity and success of bitcoin is driving up these ETFs (read: Bitcoin ETFs: More Issuers Join the Race):   ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW  -  Free Report)The surge in bitcoin prices is a big boon for this disruptive-companies focused ETF as ARKW is the first ETF to add bitcoin to its roster. This is an actively managed fund focusing on companies that are expected to benefit from the shift in technology infrastructure to the cloud, enabling mobile, new and local services. The fund holds 43 stocks in its basket with none holding more than 6.9% share. The ETF has amassed $90.9 million in its asset base and trades in a lower average daily volume of around 44,000 shares. The expense ratio comes in at 0.75%. The ETF is up 61.5% in the year-to-date time frame.ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK  -  Free Report)This is also an actively managed fund focusing on companies that are expected to benefit from the development of new products or services, technological improvement and advancements in genomic revolution, Web x.0 and industrial innovation. The fund holds 52 stocks in its basket, with each holding less than 6.2% share. It has AUM of $131.2 million in its asset base and trades in a light average daily volume of around 56,000 shares.

42,AMD,"If you’ve been paying attention to tech stocks over the past few year or so, one name has emerged as the most exciting growth opportunity in the industry: Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report). Shares of this remarkable graphics chip manufacturer have soared more than 58% in 2017 alone, and so long as the tech sector stays hot, Nvidia is showing very few signs of slowing down.Of course, Nvidia is also a perfect example of investors tossing several traditional valuation metrics to the wind. At 46x earnings and 11x sales, this stock isn’t cheap—but in today’s tech sector, even the priciest stocks can still provide solid returns.However, the introduction of some fresh volatility has hampered tech stocks recently. This once red-hot sector has plateaued over the past month or so, and investors look ready to slow things down and reevaluate as we begin to wrap up the calendar year.So is it too late to be buying Nvidia right now, or does this investor favorite still have some profits to produce in the latter portion of 2017? Let’s take a closer look.Fundamental OutlookAs we dive into Nvidia’s financials, let’s check out some of the company’s key fundamentals:As we can see, Nvidia is currently sporting an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. With an “F” for Value and “C” for Growth, this category is clearly Nvidia’s strongest—and this makes sense given the stock’s insane price action over the past year.Still, Nvidia has pin-balled around over the last couple of weeks, and the stock currently sits about 5% below its 52-week high of $174.56 per share. This means that NVDA actually has some room to grow before it attempts to break into a new range, which should interest investors that worry about buying a stock at the very top of its 52-week high.What’s more, the company looks poised to deliver impressive growth in several key areas. For one, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently calling for EPS growth of 40.13% this fiscal year. Nvidia has also surpassed our consensus estimate by an average of 35% in each of the trailing four quarters, so it would hardly be a surprise if the company outperformed again, surpassing this expected growth rate in the process.Furthermore, Nvidia is absolutely raking in the cash right now. In fact, the company’s current cash flow growth is significantly better than the 18.34% average cash flow growth it has recorded over the past three to five years. This implies that Nvidia’s financial position is improving, which should benefit the company long-term as it attempts to transition from exciting growth prospect to established industry leader.Also, we should note that our current consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to post GPU sales of $7.45 billion this fiscal year. Last year, the company recorded sales of $5.82 billion in this all-important segment, so this result would represent strong year-over-year growth.Nvidia owes a lot of this growth to the continued strength of the gaming market, as its top-of-the-line graphics processors are a favorite among hardcore PC gamers. But on top of this, Nvidia and other GPU makers like AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) have benefitted from increased demand from cryptocurrency miners.As the prices of popular digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared, more and more users are building personal super-computers to “mine” them. This has resulted in an entirely new market for Nvidia, whose high-end GPUs provide the power that these miners need.Overall, this new market speaks to the greatest strength for Nvidia right now: potential. Even with its remarkable growth to this point, Nvidia stands to benefit even more from the advent of artificial intelligence and self-driving cars—two emerging markets that it is already a dominant leader in.Of course, we also need to point out that Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Earnings Estimate RevisionsRemember, the Zacks Rank is heavily influenced by earnings estimate revisions, so let’s check out a quick snapshot of the revision activity we have seen for Nvidia recently:As is pretty obvious from the above snapshot, Nvidia’s estimate revision activity has been incredibly strong recently. We’ve seen significant improvements and unanimous analyst agreement for each of the company’s upcoming fiscal periods, including next year.Here at Zacks, we believe these positive revisions are one of the best available indicators of future share price performance. These analysts spend hours poring over all of the latest financial information, so if they feel like the company’s outlook is improving, it’s typically a good sign.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

43,AMD,"An article published on MarketWatch highlighted an analyst’s claims that chip inventories are at multi-year highs. This along with Qualcomm’s litigation case related to Korea Fair Trade Commission ruling weighed on the U.S. semiconductor sector on Sep 5.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report), PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI  -  Free Report) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) lost in the range of 1.2% to 1.4% on the day. However, investors should note that this is a short-term or almost negligible blip as several positive factors are in play.Investors can very well use this dip as a buying opportunity to the broader semiconductor sector, relying on the below-mentioned factors:Upbeat Sales The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) recently announced that global sales of semiconductors were $33.6 billion in Jul 2017, marking a year-over-year gain of 24% and a sequential rise of 3.1%. All the key geographies registered both year-over-year and month-over-month increases in July, and the Americas market were at the forefront with year-over-year growth of 36.1% and a sequential rise of 5.4% (read: Semiconductor ETFs to Roar Higher As Q2 Earnings Unfold).Usage of Semiconductor in Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin is on a tear this year. The digital currency has now more than quadrupled in value from around $997 at the start of the year. Bitcoins are ‘mined’ by using a greater amount of computer processing power. Creation and transactions in bitcoin are controlled through cryptography to keep transactions secure (read: Bitcoin Skyrockets, Race to First Cryptocurrency ETF Heats Up).Like bitcoin, Ether or etherum is also popular this year. Now, mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. A hardware known as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) has been designed exclusively for mining bitcoin. This where semiconductor companies can gain traction.As per Bloomberg, there was a 10-fold rise from April to June in the Ethereum market which helped shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) substantially. Barclays recently added that Nvidia is better placed than its competitors to cash in on the cryptocurrency rally.DRAM/NAND Supply/Demand DynamicsDRAM and NAND prices have improved primarily due to higher-than-expected demand for PCs. It is a really promising area for the semiconductor market.In the early phase of the year, HP Inc hinted that there may be a shortage of DRAM and Flash memory chips. Notably, NAND flash memory chips are also used in smartphones and tablets. With rising adoption of smartphones, especially in emerging markets, demand for NAND chips are self-explanatory.Value-Centric AreaIn any case, semiconductor is the value-centric traditional tech area that is likely to have an upper hand in an edgy investing environment. Moreover, the semiconductor space is consolidating rapidly with a number of deals announced lately.Favorable Zacks RanksThe Zacks Sector Rank is in the top 44%. While semiconductor stock Applied Materials Inc.’s (AMAT  -  Free Report) Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 2%, Micron Technology Inc.’s (MU  -  Free Report) Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 1% and NVIDIA Corp.’s Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 1%.

44,AMD,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) were down more than 4% through early afternoon trading hours Tuesday after the chipmaker lost its legal bid to postpone changes to its cellular patent licensing process in South Korea.The semiconductor manufacturing giant confirmed on Monday night that the Seoul High Court had denied its application to put a stay on a remedial order by the Korea Fair Trade Commission over the way it licenses cellular patents.Qualcomm was seeking to delay the Fair Trade Commission’s order while the company appeals the regulator body’s findings in court. Nevertheless, South Korea denied the request and ruled that Qualcomm’s business would not suffer irreparable harm if the order took effect during the appeals process.Qualcomm shares dropped about 4% to $50.08 by early afternoon. However, at least one analyst argued that the ruling wouldn’t really have a major effect on the company’s results.“While this is interesting, we do not believe it affects QCOM treatment in other countries,” said JPMorgan’s Rod Hall in a note. “We also point out that the smartphone volumes in Korea are tiny relative to global volume and have little impact on Qualcomm’s licensing revenue stream.”Indeed, Qualcomm’s slump appears to be coming on a weak day throughout the semiconductor industry. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor Sector ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down more than 1.5%, while major chipmakers like AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) were down more than 3%.Other industry giants, including Micron Technology (MU), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), also fell on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down over 1.3% through Tuesday afternoon trading.Tech’s rough day was mirrored by nearly all major sectors, as several major international stories, as well as the onset of the market’s historic worst month, helped drag stocks down on Tuesday (also read: Stocks Dip To Start September, The Market's Traditional Worst Month).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

45,AMD,"Digital currencies received a massive jolt on Monday when China’s authorities issued a notice declaring that initial coin offerings (ICOs) were illegal. Following this announcement, the price of bitcoin declined from $4,584 to nearly $4,350 per bitcoin. By Tuesday morning, the virtual currency was hovering just above the $4000 mark, nearly 20% lower than the record level of $5,000 it had hit over the weekend.Bitcoin’s fall has prompted some commentators to state that the virtual currency is entering a new phase of price discovery. However, most market watchers are characterizing this three day slide as a short term phenomenon. Bitcoin is likely to emerge stronger after such systemic cleansing, which makes it a good idea to invest in stocks gaining from the virtual currency.   China Bans ICOsOn Sep 4, seven of China’s government agencies, including the People’s Bank of China and the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a statement which declared that ICOs were illegal. According to this notice, the use of ICOs as a fundraising tool stands effectively suspended, since this could lead to financial irregularities.Additionally, the document mandates that funds already raised using ICOs should be returned. Further, illegal financial activity emanating from this mechanism would be investigated. Digital fundraising platforms are also likely to be required to have enhanced oversight mechanisms in the future. Curbs Difficult to ImplementChina’s ban on ICOs led to a substantial fall in the value of bitcoin and another popular cryptocurrency, ethereum. ICOs are utilized by start-up companies to raised funds via the sale of cryptographic tokens to prospective investors. In return, the start-up receives more widely accepted digital currencies such as bitcoin or ethereum.At first glance, restrictions on ICOs should not directly impact the likes of bitcoin. However, this development has had a negative impact on the virtual currency category as a whole. But curbs may be difficult to implement in practice since putting an end to cryptocurrency would mean fighting evolving technologies.Bitcoin’s Decline Only TemporaryOf course this hasn’t stopped several governments from seeking to place restrictions on the category. Developments in china closely mirror the actions of the SEC two months ago. At that point, the SEC had declared that ICOs were also investments and hence subject to the same regulations as stocks.Market watchers feel that ultimately the category will emerge stronger from purges of this nature. Analysts have gone on record to state that stricter regulation will lead to a “new gold standard of ICOs."" Others think that this short-term dip is likely only profit taking after bitcoin hit a record high of $5,000 recently.Our ChoicesDespite China’s latest restrictions on ICOs and bitcoin’s subsequent decline, long term prospects of the cryptocurrency remain undiminished. In fact, market watchers think that bitcoin will emerge stronger from such regulatory action.Investing in stocks from the bitcoin phenomenon continues to be a smart option. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.NVIDIA Corporation’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) GPU sales have gained substantially from the Bitcoin phenomenon. Increased demand for cryptocurrencies owing to increased adoption of bitcoin and newer technologies like ethereum has helped in lifting GPU demand, thereby contributing to the company’s GPU sales growth. This is also true for its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report).NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has expected earnings growth of 40.1% for the current year. Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 16.8% over the last 30 days.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is the largest manufacturer of memory chips in the United States. Memory chips are among the key components of a mining rig, the hardware setup utilized to extract cryptocurrency tokens from a blockchain, which is why Micron stands to benefit from the popularity of bitcoin.Micron’s earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 4.1% over the last 30 days. The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) is 5.45. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zynga Inc.  was among the first companies to accept bitcoin transactions. It will likely continue to incentivize the use of blockchain related transactions, thus benefiting from the bitcoin phenomenon.Zynga has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company has expected earnings growth of more than 100% for the current year. Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 12.5% over the last 60 days.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

46,AMD,"On Aug 31, we issued an updated research report on California-based Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report). The company is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of semiconductor products.Intel has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 5.59%. The company reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2017 results. Both the top and bottom lines surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and also improved year over year.Moreover, management raised the bottom-line guidance for fiscal 2017. Earnings are now anticipated to be $3.00 (+/- 5%) per share, up from the previous guidance of $2.85.Notably, Intel stock has lost 2.1% year to date, underperforming the 18% rally of the industry it belongs to. We believe that new product releases along with improving growth opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), High Performance Computing (HPC) and Internet of Things (IoT) will help shares rebound in the long run.Key FactorsIntel’s recent launch of Xeon Scalable (formerly known as Skylake), which is 1.6 times faster than the prior-generation product is a game changer in our view. The company had already delivered 500,000 units of Xeon Scalable to over 30 customers till the announcement of second-quarter results.Intel also unveiled Movidius Myriad X chip aimed at deep learning, which will ultimately strengthen its position in the IoT market.Moreover, the company is focused on fast penetrating the rapidly growing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The acquisition of MobilEye has significantly expanded its product portfolio.Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM) Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Intel Corporation QuoteFurther, the announcement of the formation of a consortium for building autonomous car ecosystem is a key catalyst as it improves Intel’s competitive position against the likes of Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Additionally, we expect the launch of Core 8 processors to boost the company’s PC market share amid intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). Notably, top-PC makers like HP, Lenovo, and Asus are set to launch PCs based on Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) ARM-based Snapdragon processor, which is a headwind for Intel.Zacks RankIntel currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

47,AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) is collaborating with Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) to focus on “optimizing” software for AMD’s Radeon Instinct GPUs in Baidu datacenters. We believe that the partnership will help the company sell more GPUs in the rapidly-growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) space.AMD started shipping the Radeon Instinct GPUs in the second quarter of 2017. The GPUs combine the company’s strength in heterogeneous computing as well as its focus on using open-source software. The Instinct line-up comprises MI25, MI8 and MI6, which are based on the “Vega”, “Fiji” and “Polaris” GPU architectures.The products use Radeon Open Compute project (ROCm), an open source coding language for AI systems, which now supports MIOpen 1.0. Moreover, the open source MIOpen GPU-accelerated library that supports machine intelligence frameworks including planned support of Caffe, TensorFlow and Torch is also available with the product line up.We believe that the cost-effective products will boost AMD’s competitive position in the AI and machine learning market, which is currently dominated by NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report).AMD’s stock has gained 64.2% in the last 12 months, substantially outperforming the 27.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Partnership to Boost AMD’s China FootprintDespite Baidu’s long-standing relationship with NVIDIA, we believe that the company will aid AMD to penetrate the Chinese AI market going forward. Baidu is considered a pioneer of AI techniques along with Tencent and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report). Notably, per Forbes, China-based companies absorbed more than 17% of all AI investments, second to the U.S.-based companies’ 66% in 2016.Moreover, last year, Baidu spent $20-$30 billion on AI projects. The company’s focus on using AI techniques – machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) – has helped it to provide more useful and personalized search results. The company is also using neural networks to effectively target online advertisements.According to the National Development and Reform Commission statement (May 2016), China will increase investments on developing the AI sector and plans to create a market worth more than 100 billion yuan (US $15.26 billion) over the next three years. The programme will involve key projects such as intelligent home appliances, smart automobiles, intelligent unmanned systems, intelligent wearable devices and robots.We believe that higher spending on AI will increase demand for GPUs, which is favorable for AMD.AMD’s Expanding Product Portfolio: Key CatalystAMD is benefiting from strong sales for its recently released products like Ryzen CPU and Radeon Vega GPU products. The company recently unveiled its new Radeon RX Vega 56 and 64 graphics cards. Vega’s incredible speed and sleeker memory allocation & usage capabilities is anticipated to make AMD a potent force in the AI market.Moreover, AMD has been gearing up to solidify footprint in the Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) market with Radeon and Ryzen chips. In April, the company acquired Nitero, which develops a wireless chip that enables transmission of data from desktop PCs to VR headsets. We believe that the addition of Nitero’s technology boosts AMD’s competitive prowess in the untethered VR market.Further, strong adoption rate for AMD’s recently released EPYC processors is positive for the top line. The company’s partnerships with the likes of Tencent, JD.Com, Lenovo and Sugon will further expand market share, in our view. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

48,AMD,"The rising tide for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple have lately shaken the investing world. Among the lot, bitcoin has been firing on all cylinders since the beginning of 2017, having hit a series record highs. In three months, the price of the digital currency has surged about 94%.Investors should note that bitcoins are ‘mined’ by using a greater amount of computer processing power. However, since there is a fixed amount of bitcoins, as the limit is reached, it becomes hard to ‘mine’ for the coins. The best part of this system is that it is beyond the reach of central banks (read: Explaining Bitcoin and Crypto Currency).The currency is in the limelight probably because of the fact that “bitcoin isn’t regulated by any government and has been used by consumers worldwide to shelter assets from inflation or political upheavals in their home countries.” As per an article published on CNBC, bitcoin is emerging as a safe haven asset like gold.source: coindesk.comNeedless to say, amid a sky-high price rise, the digital currency is gaining favor from ETF issuers, though the SEC is no quite happy with the concept. After rejecting the filing for an ETF on this cryptocurrency by Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, the SEC is reviewing its decision once again.The SEC is seemingly looking for more proof of safety in this trade. Meanwhile, some more ETF issuers have lined up to seek regulatory approval with their bitcoin-related products (read: Will We Finally See a Bitcoin ETF?).Inside New Filings Investment firm VanEck filed for an exchange-traded fund to invest in bitcoin derivatives in mid-August. Though VanEck acknowledged the riskiness of the product and believes that this digital currency is no match to gold as far as safe-haven status is concerned, the issuer could not overlook bitcoin’s monumental craze (read: Bitcoin Skyrockets, Race to First Cryptocurrency ETF Heats Up).VanEck noted that the digital currency cannot even replace the necessity of the dollar, rather it is likely to end up in carving a place for itself as a niche product. VanEck’s proposed product will invest in certain Bitcoin Instruments through the Subsidiary and the investment in that subsidiary is likely to be limited to 25% of the portfolio, thus meaningfully lowering the risks.After VanEck, ETF Firm REX also planned a new fund that will invest in bitcoin-based derivatives. There are two products filed by REX, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. The ticker codes and expense ratios of those funds are yet to be disclosed.As per the filing, the long fund “seeks to achieve its investment objective, under normal circumstances, by obtaining investment exposure to an actively managed portfolio of financial instruments providing long exposure to movements in the value of bitcoin, together with an actively managed portfolio of fixed income instruments” while the short fund is intended to offer the negative exposure of the same asset.What Lies Ahead?The tussle between the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and Winklevoss over the launch has been going on for about three years. In fact, the issuer has restructured the proposal for the Bitcoin ETF multiple times.However, it looks like that the SEC may approve a fund in the coming days given rising pressure from issuers. Plus, the Russian government is also expected to make cryptocurrencies legal financial instruments in 2018, as per the source. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari pointed to the strength of the blockchain technology supporting bitcoin.Among other interested candidates, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has teamed up with Gemini, the bitcoin exchange backed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, in order to launch cryptocurrency derivatives trading.Bitcoin’s Impact on the ETF World?While it is still unclear if we will get a bitcoin ETF soon, the sheer success of the cryptocurrencies should benefit semiconductor ETFs like iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report). This is because mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. A hardware known as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is designed explicitly for mining bitcoin.As per Bloomberg, there was a 10-fold rise from April to June in the Ethereum market which helped shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) substantially (read: Should You Buy These Semiconductor ETFs & Stocks Now).On the other hand, since some view the currency as “digital gold,” bitcoin trading may snatch some buyers from SPDR Gold Trust (GLD  -  Free Report). Bitcoin’s un-correlated nature to the other asset classes and strong momentum may hurt GLD in the current scenario.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

49,AMD,"It can be very difficult to find companies that are both flying under the radar, and still might have potential for gains. Many times, stocks are off investors’ radar screens for a reason, though there are some hidden gems that could be worth uncovering by those with a high risk tolerance.   One way to find these underappreciated stocks is by looking at companies that haven’t seen their share prices move higher lately, but have observed analysts raising earnings estimates for their stock. This trend could signal that investors haven’t quite embraced the rising estimate story yet, but that the potential for a big move higher is definitely there.One such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). This Electronics – Semiconductors stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 28.6%. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock lost 10.6% over the same time frame.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteThis year’s significant earnings growth expectation over the prior year should ultimately translate into price appreciation.And if this isn’t enough, AMD currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which further underscores the potential for its outperformance (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here: About Zacks Performance).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a stock flying under-the-radar that is well-equipped to bounce down the road, make sure to consider Advanced Micro Devices.

50,AMD,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsAMD reported earnings of 2 cents in second-quarter 2017, which was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a break-even. The company had reported loss of 5 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 19% year over year to $1.22 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 billion. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by strong demand for the company’s Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) and expanding customer base.Quarter DetailsAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments — Computing and Graphics (focused on the traditional PC market), and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities). The details of these segments are discussed below:Computing and Graphics includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics. This segment accounted for 53.9% of revenues and was up almost 51.5% year over year to $659 million. The year-over-year growth was driven primarily by higher demand for graphics and Ryzen desktop processors. Ryzen-based desktop systems have been adopted by major PC OEMS.Client average selling price (ASP) increased year over year driven by higher desktop processor ASP owing to the first full quarter of shipments of Ryzen processors. Graphics processor units ASP increased year over year primarily due to strong demand for Radeon RX GPUs.The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties. This segment brought in the remaining 46.1% of revenues, down 4.9% year over year to $563 million. The year-over-year decline can be attributed to lower semi-custom SoC sales.However, investments in graphics and data center R&D resulted in an increase in operating expenses to $381 million compared with $342 million in the year-ago quarter.Product HighlightsDuring the quarter, Advanced Micro launched its new ""Zen"" architecture-based EPYC 7000 series processors.The company also introduced its series of Ryzen processors - Ryzen Threadripper for ultra-premium desktop systems, Ryzen PRO for enterprise desktops, Ryzen 3 for desktop CPUs and Ryzen Mobile APUs for the consumer market.It launched Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, Radeon RX 580 and Radeon RX 570 graphics cards this quarter.Moreover, Apple announced the new iMac Pro, which will be powered by Radeon Pro Vega product, while its expanded iMac offerings are already being powered by the Radeon Pro 500 Series.The company’s Radeon Instinct MI25 accelerators were shipped to strategic datacenter customers in the quarter.Balance SheetCash, cash equivalents & marketable securities were $844 million at the end of the second-quarter 2017, compared with $943 million at the end of the previous quarter. Payables to related parties were $374 million in the quarter.Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $1.38 billion, down from $1.41 billion in the previous quarter, primarily attributable to debt reduction activities.GuidanceFor third-quarter 2017, Advanced Micro expects revenues to increase 23% sequentially (+/- 3%). At mid-point, this reflects 15% growth on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin is likely to be 34% while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $400 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Advanced Micro's stock has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the last quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookWhile estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We are looking for an above average return from the stock in the next few months

51,AMD,"NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) share prices have appreciated 51.3% this year when the S&P 500 managed a mere 8.5%. So it’s reasonable to feel at least a little concerned about the valuation, even if the company’s growth opportunities abound.And there’s no denying the secular drivers in each of the markets NVIDIA serves, whether it’s gaming, data center, artificial intelligence or cryptocurrencies.The current boom in the most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin (on the blockchain system) is driven by bitcoin mining (requires tremendous processing power offered by GPUs), with the momentum unlikely to continue through next year. But new cryptocurrencies like ether (supported by the Ethereum system) and other coins like Monero, Dash, Stratis, Syscoin, Litecoin and Factom are emerging that should ensure continued momentum in GPU demand.The underlying reason that the market remains hot is the stability relative to most other currencies in the world. Moreover, cryptocurrencies actually appreciate in value when geopolitical factors negatively impact the currency market, further boosting mining and the demand for processing power.NVIDIA has competition from the other discrete GPU provider Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), but the company is really well positioned in areas like gaming. The success of the Nintendo Switch has been very good for NVIDIA. Gaming is an ever expanding market, given the move toward e-sports, which in the past management called “as popular among U.S. male millennials as America's favorite pastime. More people watch gaming than HBO, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), ESPN, and Hulu combined.”VR is yet to gain momentum because of limited volumes of machines that can handle the content and a relatively limited volume of content. But this is definitely one area waiting to grow and NVIDIA is ready for it with its GTX 1080 Ti. It is however seeing some interest on the professional VR side with a rather illustrious customer in Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report).The biggest driver of shares is, however, the data center. Sequential growth in the last quarter was less than exciting (due to new product transition issues), but it’s equally hard to ignore the 175.5% growth from last year. There are two major legs to this growth, the first being machine learning and the second, high performance computing (HPC). GPU acceleration (the 100X faster Volta-based V100 accelerator started shipping last quarter) of servers is very cost effective for data center operators, so growth should continue for several years at least as corporate workloads keep moving to the cloud. In the last quarter for instance Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) agreed to use NVIDIA GPUs in its AWS G3 instances.To put all of this into perspective, note that NVIDIA generated 53% of its revenue from Gaming in the last quarter, with the balance coming from Data Center (19%), Professional Visualization (11%), Auto (6%) and OEM & IP (11%). So Gaming and Data Center together account for 72% of the business and have a combined average growth rate of around 72%. Plus there are multiple growth drivers in both to ensure than this strong momentum continues. This is pretty phenomenal and the reason the share price appreciation is not just about hype. It therefore makes perfect sense to buy the dips whenever possible.NVDA shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

52,AMD,"Bitcoin soared to a new high above $4,300 today, rising more than 28% over the past week. The digital currency has now more than quadrupled in value from around $997 at the start of the year. $1 invested in bitcoin seven years ago is now worth over $1.4 million. Recent surge in bitcoin price resulted from strong investor demand from Japan as also some safe haven buying. Investors have also become increasingly bullish after the smooth split of the cryptocurrency into two. (Read: 4 ETF Ways to Hedge Against Volatility) Bitcoin’s gains this weekend appeared to be at the expense of other newer digital currencies. Below is the one-week price chart from coindesk.com:What is Bitcoin? Unlike traditional currencies, which are issued by central banks, bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. It trades 24/7 around the world without any involvement of central administrator or clearing agency. The market, which remains largely unregulated, is more like a peer-to-peer digital payment network. Creation and transactions in bitcoin are controlled through cryptography to keep transactions secure. And, while users remain anonymous, the record of these transactions is available on the bitcoin network. Bitcoin Becoming Mainstream? Bitcoin now has a market value exceeding $70 billion per coinmarketcap.com. Total value of all cryptocurrencies is more than $139 billion now. They are no longer fancy assets with few backers. In April, Japanese regulators announced rules for bitcoin, establishing it as a legitimate method of payment in the country. Per Goldman Sachs analysts, “whether or not you believe in the merit of investing in cryptocurrencies (you know who you are), real dollars are at work here and warrant watching.” Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report)’s CEO said in a recent conference call, “cryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to grow, and over time it will become quite large.”  Nvidia and AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) are among the main supplier of chips used for cryptocurrency mining. Is Bitcoin a Bubble? Bitcoin’s astronomical surge has raised bubble fears. Some are even comparing it to tulip mania. But unlike tulips, bitcoin has real value and is accepted by hundreds of thousands of merchants worldwide. One of the reasons behind the surge is bitcoin’s limited supply. According to the Economist, there are about 16.3 million bitcoin in circulation, with only 1,800 new ones minted every day. The currency’s total supply would be capped at 21 million units. (Read: Follow Gundlach with These ETF Strategies) On the other hand, demand has been rising due to geopolitical uncertainty. Many consider bitcoin a safe have asset like Gold. Due to its low correlation with other asset classes, it also acts as a portfolio diversifier. It is difficult to arrive at a fair value for the bitcoin. I read about a model in FT that is based on the presumption that bitcoin’s core utility value is serving as a currency for the dark economy. The model found the cryptocurrency to be grossly overvalued. Standpoint's Ronnie Moas raised his price target on bitcoin to $7,500 today as he told CNBC, ""I believe there are hedge funds and very deep-pocketed individuals going into this now, really hundreds of millions of dollars."" Another bitcoin bull Max Keiser predicts $5,000 would be the next target, driven by panic buying by the world’s affluent with “rising war tensions and central bank malfeasance.” If bitcoin’s surge looks excessive, consider this—bitcoin’s closest rival ethereum is up more than 3,400% this year. (Read: Ethereum ETF? The Bitcoin Crushing Digital Currency Explained) Investors should also remember that cryptocurrencies are very volatile and usually go through boom-bust cycles.  Bitcoin ETFs Under SEC Review The race to the first digital currency ETF is heating up. VanEck Vectors recently filed for an actively managed “Bitcoin Strategy ETF” which will invest in exchange-traded bitcoin-linked derivative instruments and other investment vehicles that provide exposure to bitcoin. Earlier this year, the SEC had rejected the ETF proposed by Winklevoss twins but they are now reviewing the decision again. Another bitcoin ETF, proposed by SolidX Management, was also rejected in March. The third one proposed by Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is being reviewed. (Read: 5 Smart Beta ETFs with Brilliant Returns) Bitcoin derivatives are likely to be available to investors much sooner. CBOE plans to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of 2017 or early 2018, pending regulatory approval. Last month, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved digital currency-trading platform LedgerX to clear bitcoin options. The exchange plans to launch bitcoin options in early fall, and ethereum options within a few months, per CNBC. Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

53,AMD,"Bitcoin and Ether have garnered a lot of attention this year due to explosive surge in prices as also extreme volatility. Ether or etherum had surged to about $400 in June, up almost 5,000% from $8 in January. This week, it fell to below $200, down more than 50% from the recent high but still up more than 2,000% year-to-date. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is up about 125% this year. (Read: Bitcoin ETF—The Skyrocketing Cryptocurrency Explained) While bitcoin is arguably better known, ether is fast catching up. At this pace of growth, ether, which was founded just about two years back, could become the dominant digital currency in the world in the coming months. There are several reasons for ether’s rising popularity. Ongoing feud among bitcoin developers, miners and technical experts over how to expand its processing capacity in order to meet increased demand has also led many investors to ethereum.   The bitcoin network currently imposes a limit of seven transactions per second, which has slowed trading and resulted in higher fees. Some believe that bitcoin would eventually be split into two forms. According to a recent survey of digital currency users, 94% of the respondents were positive about the state of ethereum, versus only 49% positive about bitcoin. Per Coindesk, some of the negativity toward bitcoin results from surge in the transaction fees and long processing times. Another reason was many users view bitcoin as less of a digital currency and more of a digital gold or store of value, whereas they believe that ether could function as a currency. (Read: Gold ETFs Awaiting Bullish Reversals in Second Half of 2017?) Bitcoin’s reputation has also been hurt by recent global cyberattacks where ransom was demanded in bitcoin. Ethereum has won approval from some of finance and tech giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), which have teamed up with many other companies to form the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which will develop standards and technology for ethereum blockchain. Like bitcoin, all of ether’s transactions are recorded in a ledger called blockchain, where users remain anonymous. Additionally ether’s software enables creation of online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts. So, ethereum provides a global computing network or a platform, where decentralized applications, or Dapps can be built. (Read: 3 ETFs Loaded with Positive ESP Stocks) Is the Digital Currency Boom Boosting Nvidia and AMD? Rising demand for graphic processing units (GPUs), for self-driving cars, data centers and gaming, are boosting the shares of Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report). Another area where demand for GPUs is rising is digital currency mining. Per RBC Capital, 100 million worth of GPU processors were added to the ethereum mining networks in just 11 days in June. Will We See an Ethereum ETF Before a Bitcoin ETF? SEC is currently also reviewing an ethereum ETF proposal, filed by the backers of the EtherIndex Ether Trust . Earlier in March, the SEC had rejected the bitcoin ETF proposals by Winklevoss twins and SolidX Management. The third one proposed by Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is being reviewed. Some believe that the ethereum ETF has better chances of getting approved due to ether’s corporate backing and wider acceptance. The Bottom Line While the market for digital currencies is slowly becoming more mature, investors should be prepared to stomach violent price swings. The recent trajectory of digital currencies looks unsustainable, but it is very hard to predict whether or when the bubble will burst. In fact, trying to predict the future direction of digital currencies may be a fool’s errand. But at the same time, digital currencies are assuming a greater role as medium of exchange and store of value and their importance will grow immensely in the coming years. More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple Like Run                                                                                                                                                                   Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

54,AMD,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) climbed nearly 2% on Monday despite news last week that a Chinese court ordered the semiconductor giant to stop selling some of its memory chips in the world’s second-largest economy. So let’s see why Micron stock looks like such a great buy right now, allowing investors to feel comfortable shrugging off the recent Chinese ruling.Recent NewsLast week, a Chinese court ruled in favor of Taiwanese firm United Microelectronics’  patent infringement lawsuits against the American chip company. But Micron’s leadership was quick to assure investors that the affected products—Crucial and Ballistix-branded DRAM modules as well as solid state drives—make up just over 1% of the company’s annualized revenues.Micron noted that it continues to expect its fiscal fourth quarter revenues to fall within its previously guided range of $8 billion to $8.4 billion. “Micron has a long-standing history of successful business operations in China, including a significant assembly and test manufacturing facility in Xi'an, as well as deep relationships with many valued China customers,” Micron senior VP of legal affairs Joel Poppen said in a statement.“Micron will continue to aggressively defend against these unfounded patent infringement claims while continuing to work closely with its customers and partners.”Stock MovementThe fact that the Chinese court ruling is not expected to present a significant impact on Micron’s top line came as welcome news to investors and might help its stock bounce back after a rough stretch. In fact, prior to Monday’s climb, shares of Micron had sunk roughly 11% over the last month.Still, Micron stock has been on a stellar run over the last two years, with its stock price up 330% since July 2016. This climb crushes the S&P 500’s 86% surge as well as fellow growth giant Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 130%. Investors will also see that Micron has outpaced its industry’s average—which includes the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report)—since the start of the year. ValuationNow that we have touched on MU’s recent performance, it’s time to take a look at its current valuation picture. Right off the bat, shares of Micron currently rest roughly $10 below their 52-week high, meaning that MU stock technically costs less than it has over the last few months.Diving a bit deeper, Micron stock might be one of the best value plays on Wall Street, for the simple fact that it is currently trading at 4.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. This marks a significant discount compared to its industry’s 11.5X average, the S&P’s 17X, and blows away fellow chip power Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) 34.5X.Furthermore, Micron stock has traded as high as 6.9X and as low as 4.1X over the last year, and sports a one-year median of 5.4X. Therefore, investors should be able to say with a great degree of confidence that Micron stock presents solid value and is even cheaper than it has been throughout much of the last year.OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s quarterly revenues to hit $8.22 billion, which would mark a roughly 34% climb from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s full-year revenues are projected to soar nearly 48% to reach $30.13 billion.Moving onto the bottom line, Micron’s quarterly earnings are projected to surge roughly 63% to touch $3.30 per share. The company’s full-year earnings are expected to soar 136% to reach $11.72 per share.Bottom LineMicron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system as well as an overall “A” VGM score. MU has also earned six upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter, against zero downward changes, all within the last 30 days. More importantly, during this same timeframe, Micron has received eight earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside, for its current fiscal year.The company is positioned to expand further as the need for memory chips grows rapidly with the AI and self-driving vehicle revolutions set to heat up. Micron is also expected to continue to capitalize on the growing cloud computing industry, which the company noted is projected to see total capital expenditure jump from $50 billion this year to $108 billion by 2021.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

55,AMD,"Shares Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) surged 2.49% Thursday on the back of continued speculation that the chipmaker will release the much-anticipated update to its GeForce GPU line, sooner than later. Now the question for investors is should they consider buying NVDA stock now, ahead of any official GeForce announcement.GeForceBrand new reports surfaced on Thursday that suggested that Nvidia is stockpiling roughly one million GeForce GTX 11s in order to meet the demand for a Q3 or Q4 2018 launch. “It has been two years since the Pascal-based GeForce GTX 10 Series landed, so there is pent-up demand for this family's successor to fuel the 4K gaming craze,” Hot Hardware’s Brandon Hill wrote.A new GeForce line would help create even more demand for Nvidia’s widely popular graphics cards that help fuel the video gaming industry. The success of the company’s GeForce GTX 11 line will be hugely important for Nvidia because, despite the growth of its other segments, its Gaming division is still by far the company’s biggest revenue generator (also read: Nvidia Stock Gains as Rumors of Gaming GPU Launch Heat Up).Last quarter, Nvidia’s Gaming revenues skyrocketed 68% to hit $1.72 billion, accounting for roughly 54% of the company’s $3.21 billion in total Q1 revenues. Investors will also be pleased to note that Nvidia’s Datacenter revenue soared 71% to $701 million, while Automotive revenues climbed by just 4% to $145 million.Stock Price MovementNvidia’s massive year-over-year revenue growth is what has driven shares of NVDA up so high over the last few years. In fact, Nvidia has seen its stock price climb roughly 1,100% over the last three years, which destroys the S&P 500’s 31% growth, as well as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 290% climb and Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) 321% surge. Investors will note that over the last two years Nvidia stock has continued to skyrocket. With that said, shares of fellow semiconductor powerhouse Micron (MU  -  Free Report) have outpaced Nvidia over the last year, up 75% compared to NVDA’s 69% climb. It is also worth pointing out that NVDA stock currently sits roughly 10% below its 52-week high.ValuationNvidia’s impressive run hasn’t stretched the company’s valuation picture as much as some might assume. NVDA is trading at 33.1X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates at the moment, which marks a significant premium compared to its industry’s 11.2X average—this industry includes the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Diving a little deeper, Nvidia stock has traded as high as 57.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 44X. NVDA is currently trading just above its year-long low of 32.9X. Therefore, investors should be able to say with some confidence that Nvidia stock is hardly expensive and it might even appear relatively attractive at its current level.Growth OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nvidia second-quarter revenues to climb by roughly 39% to hit $3.11 billion. For the full-year, Nvidia’s revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion.Moving on, Nvidia looks as though it is set to post much bigger profits this year, with its adjusted Q2 earnings expected to expand by over 81% to touch $1.83 per share. Meanwhile, its full-year ESP figure is projected to reach $7.93 per share, which would mark a 61% surge. Bottom LineNvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. NVDA has also earned 11 upward earnings estimate revisions for Q2, against zero downward changes, all within the last 60 days. More importantly, during this same timeframe, Nvidia has received 12 earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside, for both its current fiscal year as well as the following year.Nvidia’s solid forward P/E, top and bottom line growth projections, and its positive earnings estimate revision activity, coupled with what could be a major product launch all signal that now might be a great time to buy NVDA.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

56,AMD,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) both surged on Monday, which helped buck a recent downward trend for the two chip makers. Both of the semiconductor powers are also currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks. So let’s dive into some of Micron and Nvidia’s current fundamentals to see if either stock looks more appealing at the moment.Stock MovementOne of the best places for investors to start when evaluating a stock is its price movement. Before today’s climb, Nvidia had seen its stock price soar 1,079% over the last three years, which outpaces Micron’s 185% climb. Over the last two years, the stocks are a little more evenly matched, with NVDA up 416% compared to MU’s 332% expansion—both of which crush Wall Street darling Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 135%  climb as well as fellow chip giant Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) 52%.Narrowing down our focus, MU stock has climbed above NVDA over the last year, up 85% compared to roughly 73% for its peer. Investors should also note that 2018 has not been as kind to either Micron or Nvidia. Still, Micron has seen its stock price surge roughly 32%, while Nvidia has jumped 24% since the start of the year.More recently, MU and NVDA have both sunk roughly 9% during the last month, with both sitting below their 52-week highs. This should be good news since both stocks could be purchased at a lower price than they have traded at recently. But investors also need to understand their current valuation picture.ValuationComing into Monday, Micron stock was trading at 4.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared the S&P 500’s 16.8X and its industry’s 11.3 X—which includes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Over the last year, Micron stock has traded as high as 6.8X, as low as 4.1X, and rocks a one-year median of 5.5X.At 33.1X, NVDA is trading at a significant premium compared to Micron, its industry, and the S&P. With that said, Nvidia stock has traded as high as 57.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 44.1X, and it is currently trading just above its year-long low of 32.9X Stepping out a bit further, investors should be able to see that it is not too much of a stretch to say that Nvidia stock appears rather attractive at this current valuation. Meanwhile, Micron stock looks like one of the stronger value plays on the market, especially considering its growth projections.OutlookNow let’s look ahead because there is little reason to buy stocks that don’t seem to present any real ability to keep on climbing based on expanding top and bottom lines.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues to hit $8.22 billion, which would mark over a 33.8% climb from the year-ago period. Micron’s fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to soar over 48% to reach $30.13 billion. Moving onto the other end of the income statement, the company’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 136% to reach $11.72 per share, while its Q4 EPS figure is expected to expand by 63% to hit $3.30 per share.Transitioning to Nvidia, the company is projected to report Q2 fiscal 2019 revenues of $3.11 billion, representing a roughly 39% jump from the year-ago period. For its current full-year, Nvidia’s revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion. The company’s adjusted earnings are expected to expand by just over 81% this quarter and 61% for the year.Bottom LineBoth Nvidia and Micron are currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, with MU sporting an overall “A” VGM score and NVDA rocking an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Investors will also be pleased to note that NVDA and MU have received a ton of earnings estimate revisions recently.Micron has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for the full-year, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. Likewise, Nvidia has received 12 full-year revisions against zero downgrades, over the last 60 days.Clearly, it is hard to go wrong with either stock at the moment as both are projected to experience strong top and bottom line growth. The companies also operate in a growth industry and have set their sights on new areas just starting to boom, from AI to self-driving vehicle technology. Still, at the moment, the advantage has to go to Micron because of its outstanding value.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

58,AMD,"Investors focused on the Computer and Technology space have likely heard of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Computer and Technology peers, we might be able to answer that question.Advanced Micro Devices is a member of the Computer and Technology sector. This group includes 630 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #8. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. AMD is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD's full-year earnings has moved 21.53% higher. This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend.Based on the latest available data, AMD has gained about 48.93% so far this year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Computer and Technology group have gained about 5.44% on average. This means that Advanced Micro Devices is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.To break things down more, AMD belongs to the Electronics - Semiconductors industry, a group that includes 35 individual companies and currently sits at #154 in the Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks in this group have lost about 0.95% so far this year, so AMD is performing better this group in terms of year-to-date returns.Investors with an interest in Computer and Technology stocks should continue to track AMD. The stock will be looking to continue its solid performance.

59,AMD,"Semiconductors stocks took a huge beating in Monday’s session following reports that the Trump administration is seeking to curb many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to that country.The Treasury Department is working on the rules to block companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in ""industrially significant technology.” The measures are expected to be announced by the end of this week and are intended to counter Beijing's Made in China 2025 strategic plan. Under this plan, China wants to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology, including information technology, aerospace, electric vehicles and biotechnology (read: Inverse ETFs Surge as Trade War Fears Escalate).The move will escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing that have been on a brutal trade fight. The Washington has already threatened an import tariff on $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, of which tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods are due to take effect on Jul 6. In response, Beijing has also announced an import tariff of “the same scale and strength” with penalties on American goods worth $34 billion to come into effect on Jul 6.Concerns over Chinese investment were raised at the time when its investment in the United States is already declining. It plunged more than 90% in the first five months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier, per a CNN report.Market ImpactChip stocks were the hardest hit by escalating trade tensions with Beijing. Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52% (read: 5 Sector ETFs Most Exposed to Trade Tensions).”As such, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.1% at the close on Monday. Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) stole the show, plunging 6.9%. This was followed by declines of 5.3% for Marvell Technology (MRVL  -  Free Report), 5% for Smart Global (SGH  -  Free Report), 4.7% for Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), and 4.4% for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report). Other chip stocks like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report) were also down more than 3% on the day.The terrible trading in the stock world also sent the semiconductor ETFs space into deep red on the day. In particular,VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF(SMH  -  Free Report), Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI  -  Free Report), iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXX) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD  -  Free Report) tumbled at least 3% each at the close. Below we profile these ETFs and discuss some of the specifics behind their recent slump:SMHThis fund provides exposure to 26 securities by tracking the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. It has moderated concentration across components with none accounting for more than 8.35% of assets. The product has managed assets worth $1.2 billion and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses (read: Why This Semiconductor ETF Lost Almost Half of its Assets).PSIThis fund tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, holding 30 securities in the basket with none making up for more than 5.1% of assets. The product has so far amassed $343.9 million in its asset base while charges a bit higher fee of 63 bps per year from investors.SOXXThis ETF follows the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 firms with none accounting for more than 8.3% share. It has amassed $1.6 billion in its asset base and charges 48 bps in fees a year.XSDThis fund provides equal-weight exposure to 35 firms by tracking the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index. The fund has accumulated $331.8 million in AUM and charges 35 bps in fees per year.Long-Term OutlookDespite the trade tensions, the outlook for the sector is solid. After witnessing highest growth in 14 years, the global semiconductor industry is on track to grow 12.4% this year, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS).Semiconductors are the most important drivers of overall technology growth as these are used in cars, electronic gadgets, planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies will fuel huge growth in the space.Additionally, the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) technology — the next wireless revolution — will likely create further opportunities. The waves of mergers and acquisitions will also provide further impetus to the space. Trump’s tax reform is another tailwind. Big semiconductor companies hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates (read: 5 Reasons to Bet on the Rebound in Semiconductor ETFs).Moreover, the above-mentioned products have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting that these will likely outperform the broader market for months.Given the solid long-term outlook but trade concerns, investors may want to consider staying on the sidelines for the time being. However, risk-tolerant, long-term investors may want to see this recent slump as a buying opportunity, provided they have the patience for extreme volatility.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

60,AMD,"Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) recently announced that Brian Krzanich has resigned as the CEO and also from its board of directors after the company learned about Krzanich’s “past consensual relationship” with an employee. The company’s CFO, Robert Swan has been appointed as the interim CEO.Intel verified the matter with an investigation through external and internal counsel. The scrutiny authenticated the violation of the company’s non-fraternization policy relevant to all manager level employees.The chipmaker accepted Krzanich’s resignation. Meanwhile, Swan said, “Intel’s transformation to a data-centric company is well under way and our team is producing great products, excellent growth and outstanding financial results. I look forward to Intel continuing to win in the marketplace.”The board is actively looking for a candidate to take over as permanent CEO. In this regard, a top executive search firm is aiding the procedure.Following the news, shares of the company declined more than 2%, yesterday. Notably, Intel’s stock has returned 58.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally of 57.6%.Krzanich’s Journey in IntelKrzanich joined Intel as an engineer in 1982. Krzanich was elevated to the position of CEO in May 2013. Krzanich’s efforts in diversifying the company’s product portfolio are commendable. Under his leadership, Intel expanded its footprint in artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing and other emerging technologies.During Kzranich’s term, the company bolstered machine learning capabilities and augmented its solutions in augmented as well as virtual reality.We remain hopeful that the new as well as the interim CEO will persist with the efforts in self-driving cars and emerging tech. However, work needs to be done on products to aid the chipmaker sustain the leading market share in GPU shipments.Raised 2Q18 OutlookRealizing the gravity of the matter, the chipmaker cleverly timed the resignation announcement with a revision in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 guidance. The raised outlook bodes well. Moreover, the company is optimistic to deliver “another record year” in 2018.Intel now envisions second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues to come in at approximately $16.9 billion, up from the initial projection of $16.3 billion. The projected figure is better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.3 billion, representing growth of around 10.3% year over year.Earnings are now anticipated to be 99 cents per share, considerably higher than the previously estimated 85 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 86 cents, translating to a year-over-year increase of 19.4%.The company will provide a revised guidance on fiscal 2018 when it announces second-quarter earnings on Jul 26.To ConcludeIntel, a comparatively late entrant in the autonomous driving industry, is increasing efforts in the space. The initiated testing of around 100 self-driving cars in Jerusalem deserves a special mention. Acquisition of Israel-based MobilEye, last year has been assisting the company a great deal. Recent collaboration with Mapbox, a mapping startup, also bodes well in this regard.Notably, autonomous driving backed by AI is expected to reduce accidents due to human errors. Per a recent report by Grand View Research, the ADAS market is expected to hit $67.43 billion by 2025. Given the alluring prospects, the company can make the most of this growth opportunity if the cards are rightly played.However, intensifying competition from Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) products, including second generation Threadripper CPU powered by Ryzen technology is a threat.Per a JPR report, although Intel continues to be a leader, its market share in GPU shipments in the first quarter of 2018 dipped from 67.4% to 66.6%. On the other hand, AMD impressively increased its GPU shipments and gained market share from 14.2% to 14.9%. Meanwhile, NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) maintained its market share at 18.4%.It is evident from the estimates that AMD’s gain is Intel’s loss, which remains a matter of concern.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is worth considering.  Micron delivered non-GAAP earnings of $3.15 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 and higher than the guided range of $2.83 (+/- 7 cents). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for Micron is currently pegged at 8.2%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

61,AMD,"Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) CEO Brian Krzanich was forced to resign after internal and external auditors discovered that he had a past consensual relationship with a direct reportee in contravention of the company’s non-fraternization policy for managers. It ended his 30+-year stint at the company that he joined in 1982 to eventually lead as COO and then for the last five years, as CEO.He may pick up as much as $44.5 million as a severance package, with around $37.5 million in stock awards and around $7 million on various accounts including deferred compensation, medical benefits and his pension plan.Intel stock dropped around 2.4% on the news.His leadership has been both good and bad for investors:For one thing, he oversaw the departure of several Intel veterans including data center chief Dianne Bryant who moved to Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) last year, CFO Stacy Smith who retired, former president Renee James who resigned in 2015 to set up her own company in competition with Intel, Justin Rattner, Dadi Perlmutter and Kirk Skaugen. But he also brought in Robert Swan as CFO, who is now operating as interim CEO.  Second, Intel lost its process lead during his tenure because of issues in moving to 10nm. The smaller process node would have enabled Intel to continue producing smaller and faster chips, as it has forever done in the past. But Intel has given up that lead to TSMC with Globalfoundries and Samsung likely to follow suit. This is perhaps the biggest disappointment, because it significantly skews competitive dynamics.   Third, Intel is seeing ever increasing competitive pressure from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) in both the data center and consumer (especially DIY) segments; from NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) in HPC, artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomous driving technology; and even Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has started nipping at its heels. To perhaps make matters worse, cloud customers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) are both testing competitors’ offerings and developing their own capabilities.This just isn’t the market that it used to be. To be fair, Intel hasn’t been napping, but has gradually expanded its served market to include not just CPUs but also FPGAs and memory to address the changing opportunities in the data center, PCs, 5G, IoT, autonomous vehicles, etc. It has also recently announced that it intends to have a GPU offering by 2020 (while the required talent is in place, whether it meets the timeline and is able to compete with AMD or NVIDIA at that time is of course unknown).Fourth, Intel has made a number of acquisitions over the past few years, some of the most significant of which were Altera, Nervana, Movidius and Mobileye. While that’s a lot to integrate and assimilate, the acquisitions have opened up new opportunities for Intel.Fifth, through all the uncertainties, Intel has grown revenue by an additional $15 billion and EPS by around 100% during his tenure. That was largely possible because the PC business continued to grow despite PCs themselves declining while the data center business also grew because of strong market drivers and the company’s leadership position. Intel’s share price has appreciated over 120%. Sixth, Krzanich has been a champion of women’s rights and diversity, allotting $300 million a year to induce it within the company and tying it up with executive compensation to speed up the process. This has set it apart from several other technology companies that haven’t been as forthcoming, for whatever reason.But he’s likely to be hard to replace.Intel historically elevates people to leadership positions with the goal of maintaining continuity in company culture, but there’s very little choice left internally. So one option would be Murthy Renduchintala who joined the company some years back. Another would be Navin Shenoy, who has worked himself up the ranks. Or it could also be Aicha Evans, Intel's chief strategy officer or even Bob Swan.Expert opinion is however in favor of fresh blood because of the new perspective that it is likely to bring and the fact that an outsider could perhaps be more realistic about Intel’s strengths, prospects and weaknesses and the need to trim some ambitions if required or spend more on certain other endeavors.These outsiders could be some of the people that left Intel in the last few years or Sanjay Jha who left Globalfoundries in March, or Pat Gelsinger (Intel’s first CTO) who now runs VMware, or a host of other people. The search for a new CEO is on they say.ConclusionIntel has taken a lot of measures to reposition the company for the new era and it is in the middle of bringing these plans to fruition. Whoever fills the leadership role will have his work cut out: deliver on somebody else’s plans with the world looking over your shoulder. All I can say is good luck!Intel shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

62,AMD,"Investors in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 22, 2018 $14.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, eight analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 10 cents per share to 12 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

63,AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) saw its stock price pop over 5% on Monday to hit a new 11-year high on the back of positive analyst sentiment, which also pointed directly to its ability to compete against chip giant Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).AMD stock touched $17.34 per share on Monday, a new 52-week high. The move comes after Cowen analysts raised their price target for AMD from $18 per share to $21 per share, citing opportunities in cloud computing. The analysts also reiterated their “outperform” rating for AMD. “Along with recent announcements of new server deals with Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report)/Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report) and the crystallization of our 7nm AMD versus 10nm Intel thesis, we are increasingly confident in upside to AMD shares,"" analyst Matthew Ramsay wrote in a note to clients last Thursday. “We’ve come away with a more entrenched and bullish view of AMD’s execution and potential share gains in PC/server CPUs.”Ramsay believes that AMD’s transition to its brand new 7nm AMD Radeon Vega GPU products, which are set to launch at some point in 2018, will be hugely beneficial. AMD’s second generation Ryzen Threadripper processors will debut in the third quarter of 2018.Earlier this month, AMD said at Computex that there will be 60 new Ryzen systems by the end of the year from manufacturers. The company is also hopeful that it can gain 40% market share from online retailers.For years Intel has grabbed a large share of the chip sales that power the desktop and notebook PC markets. Now, Intel’s dominance seems to be fading a little bit. Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard downgraded Intel stock to “underperform” on Monday and slapped a price target that fell 20% below INTC’s closing price on Friday.AMD investors should be excited to note that the reason for Richard’s bearish Intel take comes from a more formidable challenge from AMD. “The performance gap between Intel and AMD has narrowed substantially,” Richard wrote. “AMD is now well positioned to compete in desktop and notebook markets.”AMD’s gains turned out to be Intel’s losses. Intel saw its stock price sink 3.43% to close at $53.22 per share on Monday.Price Movement Now that we have discussed the reasons for AMD’s climb, it’s worth taking a look at its performance over the last few years, since it is pretty impressive. Shares of AMD have skyrocketed 562% over the last three years, which crushes its industry’s roughly 111% climb and the S&P 500’s 32% growth. Investors will notice that AMD stock has been somewhat turbulent over the past two years. With that said, shares of AMD have soared nearly 50% over the last three months, topping the likes of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report).AMD is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that is expected to see its quarterly revenues surge by nearly 41% to hit $1.72 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, its quarterly earnings are projected to jump from $0.02 per share in the year-ago period to $0.12 per share, which would mark a 500% climb.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

64,AMD,"Shares of Wall Street superstar Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened slightly lower on Monday, just two days before the company is set to release its third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results. So let’s take a look to see why the semiconductor giant looks like a strong buy stock that investors might want to consider scooping up before Micron reports on Wednesday afternoon.Recent News J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analysts reiterated their overweight rating for Micron stock on Monday, pointing directly to strong demand for memory in the cloud computing market. The analyst also reaffirmed his $82 price target, which marked a 41% upside from Friday's closing price of $58.23 per share.""Stay long Micron heading into earnings,” Harlan Sur wrote in a note to clients. “We see further upside in Micron shares as the team is executing well in an overall constructive S/D [supply/demand] memory environment… demand fundamentals likely to remain strong driven by robust cloud data center spending.""The banking power’s Micron update comes just a few weeks after Micron announced that it is set to produce and ship the “industry's first 4bits/cell 3D NAND technology” along with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). Micron also said it would repurchase $10 billion of outstanding common stock as part of a new plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders starting in fiscal 2019. “The data-driven economy will transform nearly every industry, and drive secular growth in demand for memory and storage,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement.Investors should remember that stock repurchase plans often indicate that a company’s executives and board members believe shares are relatively cheap or at least a solid deal at their current price.Stock MovementMicron stock has skyrocketed nearly 371% over the last two years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 34% climb. Shares of Micron have also greatly outperformed its industry’s roughly 105% surge, which includes the likes of Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Year to date, Micron stock has surged 41%, compared to its industry’s roughly 17% climb. Investors should note that MU has dipped 4.2% over the last three months, against its industry’s 6.5% gain. This recent dip helps make Micron stock look more attractive simply because it is cheaper, but that’s just the start.ValuationComing into Monday, Micron stock was trading at 5.5X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a huge discount compared to its industry’s 12.7X and the S&P’s 17.3X. If we dive a little deeper, Micron’s valuation picture looks even better. Over the last two years, Micron stock has traded as high as 32.5X and as low as 4.2X, with a two-year median of 6.2X. Furthermore, Micron stock looks like a steal compared to Nvidia’s two-year median of 38.6X. With all that said, investors should be able to say with confidence that Micron stock is a great value investment, and it looks even better based on its impressive growth prospects.OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s quarterly revenues to pop 38.3% to hit $7.7 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s full-year revenues are projected to soar nearly 46% to reach $29.62 billion.Transitioning to the other end of the income statement, Micron’s quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket nearly 94% to touch $3.14 per share. And if that growth projection didn’t impress investors enough, Micron’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 132% to reach $11.53 per share.Earnings Revision Activity Investors should also note that Micron’s earnings estimate revisions activity has been extremely positive recently. MU has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for its third-quarter, against zero downward changes, all within the last 30 days. This helped lift Micron’s Q3 estimate by $0.28 per share. Within this same timeframe, Micron earned the same upward revisions ratio for its full-year earnings, which lifted its estimate by $0.49 per share.Bottom Line Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” Grade for Value and “Bs” for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Investors should remember that not only does MU stock present great value at the moment, it also sits below its 52-week high. Lastly, Micron is expected to expand both its top and bottom lines in a major way, while looking poised to surge in a growth industry.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Per Allied Market Research, the GPU market is anticipated to reach $157.1 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2016 to 2022.We believe both AMD and NVIDIA are well poised to benefit from the strong demand of gaming PCs. However, AMD’s expanding GPU portfolio catering to every price points is well-poised to threat NVIDIA’s dominance going forward.Despite its late entry, AMD is attaining the position of a major player in GPU market. The company started small, targeting the low-end segment and gradually built a position for itself.JPR report reveals that AMD impressively increased its GPU shipments and gained market share from 14.2% to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2018. The gain can be primarily attributed to the robust adoption witnessed by the company’s expanding product portfolio for workstations and cryptocurrency mining.Furthermore, increasing adoption of AI techniques and machine learning tools in industries like gaming, automotive and blockchain are primarily responsible for driving GPU demand. AMD is benefiting from this demand.Although Intel’s market share dipped from 67.4% to 66.6%, the company continues to be a leader.

69,AMD,"Once just a popular brand among diehard PC gamers, Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) has stepped into the spotlight over the past few years and is now one of the most popular tech companies on Wall Street. The stock is an interesting option not only because its graphics chips are still a hot commodity to its core audience, but also because the emergence of several news businesses has created unlimited growth potential.Thanks to a variety of new applications for its GPU and SoC devices, the Santa- Clara, California-based processor manufacturer is now a major player in many high-growth markets, including datacenters, self-driving cars, and cryptocurrency mining.But of course, not all of these new businesses are made the same. While datacenter demand continues to rise and self-driving cars approach their commercial debut, cryptocurrencies have tumbled from their New Year highs and appear more volatile than ever.Still, cryptocurrency mining—a process that sees users rewarded with new coins or tokens when they volunteer their own computing power for blockchain maintenance—can be profitable when executed correctly, and miners continue to pick GPUs made by Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) to power the top-end computers needed for the task.Nvidia has been reluctant to acknowledge the new business it has seen from crypto miners, with management seemingly eager to guard itself from the volatility associated with cryptocurrency market. In fact, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress told analysts that cryptocurrency’s contribution to the company’s business was still “difficult to quantify” as recently as the Q4 2018 conference call.But that task has apparently gotten easier, or Nvidia has finally decided to pull the curtain back a little more. Speaking to analysts during the firm’s latest earnings conference call—in the wake of its solid Q1 2019 report—executives like Kress and CEO Jensen Huang were much more detailed with their answers to crypto-related questions.“Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million,” Kress said. “Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level.”Nvidia reported total quarterly revenue of $387 million in its OEM segment—up nearly 150% from the prior-year period—so the company is effectively saying that about 75% of this business came from crypto-specific processors.Nvidia’s decision to market crypto-specific GPUs speaks to the concern that demand from miners might cause supply issues for traditional customers like gamers. But with nearly $300 million in sales in the quarter—and likely more, since miners could still buy gaming GPUs—Nvidia is dominating its key competitor in this market, AMD.Christopher Rolland, an analyst from Susquehanna Financial, touched on these points in the conference call, eventually asking, “Is there a pricing dynamic that's allowing you to have such share there, or do you think it's your competitors that don't know what's actually being sold to miners versus gamers?”Huang fielded these questions, describing his company’s efforts to point miners toward Nvidia’s crypto-specific solutions and reminding analysts that fulfilling demand is “just not possible” but stopping short of speculating what Nvidia is doing better than competitors right now.But the numbers don’t lie. If AMD’s estimation that 10% of its sales in the most recent quarter came from crypto, that means the company saw about $160 million in revenue from that market. If Nvidia truly does control two-thirds of this market, it is clearly doing something right.Of course, just how big of an impact that two-thirds slice will have in the future remains to be seen.Want more market analysis from this author?

70,AMD,"Recovery in the server market, which began last year, has continued into 2018 as well, re-infusing optimism among server vendors. Per International Data Corporation (“IDC”), worldwide server revenues and shipment marked the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, after five straight disappointing quarters of decline.According to the data compiled by the research firm, worldwide server revenues jumped a whopping 38.6% year over year to $18.8 billion in first-quarter 2018, while overall shipment grew 20.7% to approximately 2.7 million units.IDC noticed growth in every segment, with revenues of volume servers rising 41.3% year over year to $15.9 billion, while the mid-range server registered growth of 31% to $1.7 billion. Also, high-end system revenues reached $1.2 billion, indicating a rise of 20.1%.Also, x86 servers retained the growth momentum during the quarter. IDC figured out a 41% year-over-year rise in x86 server revenues, reaching $17.4 billion, while revenues from non-x86 servers witnessed an increase of 15.5% to $1.4 billion.Demand From Various Segments, Increased ASP Drive GrowthThe research firm found that strong deployment by cloud-service providers, increased use of servers for software-defined infrastructure builds out and market-wide enterprise refresh cycle, drove the overall growth for the server market.This apart, availability of the latest CPUs such as Intel's (INTC  -  Free Report) Purley processors, and Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) EPYC processors also spurred demand for servers. It should be noted that hyperscale data-center service providers have waited a long time for these processors.Additionally, increased average selling prices (ASP), as a result of passing on some elevated component costs and richer configuration, bolstered server revenue growth.Sector Total Return %  Sector Total Return % |  QuoteDell Outpaces HPE in Market ShareWith respect to individual server manufacturers, on the revenue market-share front, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) jointly secured the first spot. However, if we look at the actual revenues, then Dell has outpaced HPE to hold the first position, with 19.1% market share. HPE ended the quarter with 18.6% market share. Notably, IDC calls it a statistical tie when the difference among vendors is 1% or less.Over the past four quarters, Dell has continuously registered year-over-year growth in server revenues and managed to drastically narrow down the market-share difference with HPE. In fact, it beat HPE in the last quarter. The reason behind this stellar market-share growth is that the company has been able to strategically capitalize on expanded opportunities from the EMC acquisition.Moreover, HPE is now focusing on the enterprise market and moving away from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. Nonetheless, its loss helped Dell grab market share in the hyperscale segment.The third position is a tie among Lenovo, International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report). If we look at the actual revenues, then Lenovo holds the third position with 5.8% market share, followed by IBM in the fourth spot, with 5.3% share, while Cisco comes fifth, with 5.2%.Furthermore, IDC provided revenues and shipment data for the ODM Direct group of vendors. These vendors continue to record huge year-over-year growth in revenues and market share, as large datacenters find it attractive to custom build their server designs at potential volume prices.In addition to the above, in terms of volume, Dell secured the top position, with a market share of 20.6%, while HPE holds the second spot with market share of 16%. Inspur, Lenovo and Super Micro occupied the third position, ending the quarter with market shares of 6.5%, 6% and 5.8%, respectively.Growth Across All RegionsRegion wise, IDC noted server revenue growth across every region. Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) witnessed the fastest growth, with a 51.7% increase. This was followed by Latin America, recording 41.1%, the United States 40.6%, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 35%, Canada 28.3% and Japan reporting 2.9% increase. China recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 67.4% in the quarter.Better Prospects AheadWe believe the global server market will continue to grow in the quarters ahead, mainly due to the further push of hyperscale server deployments by cloud-service providers. In our opinion, there is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server-infrastructure space, with more and more companies shifting to cloud-based storage.Also, Gartner’s latest forecast for IT spending (a 6.2% increase in 2018) depicts a favorable tech spending environment, which, we believe, will positively influence the overall server market in the near term.Looking at the improving IT spending and server deployment push by data-center service providers across different geographies, we expect that the overall performance of vendors will continue improving over the next few quarters.Currently, HPE, IBM and Cisco all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

71,AMD,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) both surged on Monday, which helped buck a recent downward trend for the two chip makers. Both of the semiconductor powers are also currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks. So let’s dive into some of Micron and Nvidia’s current fundamentals to see if either stock looks more appealing at the moment.Stock MovementOne of the best places for investors to start when evaluating a stock is its price movement. Before today’s climb, Nvidia had seen its stock price soar 1,079% over the last three years, which outpaces Micron’s 185% climb. Over the last two years, the stocks are a little more evenly matched, with NVDA up 416% compared to MU’s 332% expansion—both of which crush Wall Street darling Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) 135%  climb as well as fellow chip giant Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) 52%.Narrowing down our focus, MU stock has climbed above NVDA over the last year, up 85% compared to roughly 73% for its peer. Investors should also note that 2018 has not been as kind to either Micron or Nvidia. Still, Micron has seen its stock price surge roughly 32%, while Nvidia has jumped 24% since the start of the year.More recently, MU and NVDA have both sunk roughly 9% during the last month, with both sitting below their 52-week highs. This should be good news since both stocks could be purchased at a lower price than they have traded at recently. But investors also need to understand their current valuation picture.ValuationComing into Monday, Micron stock was trading at 4.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared the S&P 500’s 16.8X and its industry’s 11.3 X—which includes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Over the last year, Micron stock has traded as high as 6.8X, as low as 4.1X, and rocks a one-year median of 5.5X.At 33.1X, NVDA is trading at a significant premium compared to Micron, its industry, and the S&P. With that said, Nvidia stock has traded as high as 57.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 44.1X, and it is currently trading just above its year-long low of 32.9X Stepping out a bit further, investors should be able to see that it is not too much of a stretch to say that Nvidia stock appears rather attractive at this current valuation. Meanwhile, Micron stock looks like one of the stronger value plays on the market, especially considering its growth projections.OutlookNow let’s look ahead because there is little reason to buy stocks that don’t seem to present any real ability to keep on climbing based on expanding top and bottom lines.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues to hit $8.22 billion, which would mark over a 33.8% climb from the year-ago period. Micron’s fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to soar over 48% to reach $30.13 billion. Moving onto the other end of the income statement, the company’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 136% to reach $11.72 per share, while its Q4 EPS figure is expected to expand by 63% to hit $3.30 per share.Transitioning to Nvidia, the company is projected to report Q2 fiscal 2019 revenues of $3.11 billion, representing a roughly 39% jump from the year-ago period. For its current full-year, Nvidia’s revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion. The company’s adjusted earnings are expected to expand by just over 81% this quarter and 61% for the year.Bottom LineBoth Nvidia and Micron are currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, with MU sporting an overall “A” VGM score and NVDA rocking an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Investors will also be pleased to note that NVDA and MU have received a ton of earnings estimate revisions recently.Micron has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for the full-year, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 30 days. Likewise, Nvidia has received 12 full-year revisions against zero downgrades, over the last 60 days.Clearly, it is hard to go wrong with either stock at the moment as both are projected to experience strong top and bottom line growth. The companies also operate in a growth industry and have set their sights on new areas just starting to boom, from AI to self-driving vehicle technology. Still, at the moment, the advantage has to go to Micron because of its outstanding value.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

72,AMD,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened lower on Wednesday after two days of gains on the back of some major announcements, including a new deal with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). With that said, let’s dive into why the chip giant’s stock might be worth buying right now.Stock Price MovementMicron stock has skyrocketed 408% over the last two years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 31% climb. Shares of Micron also greatly outperformed its industry’s 99% surge, which includes the likes of Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), and more.Over the last year, Micron stock has soared 101%, compared to its industry’s roughly 35% surge. Furthermore, shares of Micron have climbed over 21% in the last three months, while its broader industry is up just 3.5%.Micron’s run of success might deter some investors since it could be hard to replicate this kind of growth. Still, despite Micron’s insane and sustained run, investors should note that the company closed Tuesday below its 52-week high. And there are plenty more reasons to be excited about Micron stock, including its growth prospects and current valuation picture.Recent NewsBut before we jump into growth, it is worth taking a look at some company updates. Micron and Intel announced on Monday that they will produce and ship the “industry's first 4bits/cell 3D NAND technology,” while also noting that they made progress on the development of the third-generation 96-tier 3D NAND structure—which provides a 50% increase in layers.The company also said it would repurchase $10 billion of outstanding common stock as part of a new plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders starting in fiscal 2019. “The data-driven economy will transform nearly every industry, and drive secular growth in demand for memory and storage,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.Furthermore, Micron upped its guidance and now expects current quarter revenues to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion, up from its previous guidance of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion.Growth OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates don’t necessarily reflect Micron’s updated quarterly revenue outlook just yet. But investors will be pleased to note that our current estimate of $7.44 billion, would mark a nearly 34% climb from the year-ago period. Looking a bit further ahead, the company’s full-year revenues are projected to soar nearly 44% to reach $29.22 billion.Transitioning to the other end of the income statement, Micron’s quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket roughly 81% to touch $2.93 per share. And if that growth projection didn’t impress investors enough, Micron’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 127% to reach $11.27 per share.ValuationNow that we have covered Micron’s recent business updates, stock price movement, and growth outlook, it’s time to move onto its current valuation, which is impressive, to say the least.Coming into Wednesday, Micron stock was trading at 5.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a massive discount compared to its industry’s 13.2X. Over the last two years, Micron stock has traded as high as 32.5X and as low as 4.2X. Micron stock has traded at a one-year median of 5.5X, against its industry’s 13.9X. Furthermore, Micron stock looks even cheaper compared to Nvidia’s one-year median of 45.6X. Therefore, investors should be able to say with confidence that Micron stock is a great value investment at the moment in a semiconductor market that is set to keep on booming.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

73,AMD,"Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) recently revealed two new security bugs, namely Speculative Store Buffer Bypass or Variant 4 and Rogue System Registry Read.The new flaws resemble the Spectre and Meltdown issues that had surfaced earlier this year. Intel had then witnessed a sharp decline in share prices. Spectre affected the functioning of chips developed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Per Microsoft’s blog, the new vulnerabilities carry low customer risk. As an advisory, the impacted users are asked to timely update both their software and hardware. Intel, (AMD  -  Free Report) and Red Hat have released advisories as well.Intel also reaffirmed that expanding their bug bounty program and other measures are likely to aid the industry counter upcoming threats. This will consequently mitigate the possibility of compromising cyber security.A couple of days before the tech stalwarts announced the bugs officially as part of Google Project Zero (“GPZ”), Reuters revealed in an article that BSI, Germany’s federal cyber agency had analyzed the flaws which they termed, Spectre-Next Generation. Per BSI, the risk could only be mitigated and not eradicated.Intel had then cited its ""coordinated disclosure"" policy, by which security researchers and companies are not allowed to release information about bugs until patches are ready.Earlier this month, Reuters had revealed in another article, that per a German computing magazine, c’t, researchers had found eight new flaws “in computer central processing units that resemble the Meltdown and Spectre bugs revealed in January.”Zacks RankIntel, Microsoft, Alphabet and AMD all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

76,AMD,"Shares of several major tech firms with huge semiconductor businesses, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), and Micron (MU  -  Free Report), all saw their stock prices surge on Wednesday. Let’s take a quick look why.Micron Shares of Micron surged 4.61% to close at $56.50 per share after RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage of semiconductor giant with an “Outperform” rating. RBC Capital Markets also slapped an $80 per share price target on Micron, which represents an upside of over 40% from Wednesday’s closing price.“Our bullish bias on Micron is predicated not on there being no more cycle but rather on our belief that the cycle(s) going forward will be more muted and less volatile,"" RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""Micron offers a unique way for investors to gain exposure to DRAM and NAND markets at what we view as attractive valuations.""Before today’s gains, Micron’s stock price had skyrocketed 86% over the last year and was up 20% during the last 12 weeks. Micron is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system. This is highlighted by Micron’s outsized top and bottom line growth prospects.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s full-year revenues to surge 43.5% to reach $29.16 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s bottom line is projected to skyrocket over 122.6% to hit $11.04 per share.Intel Intel stock popped 1.34% to hit $54.64 per share, inching closer to its 52-week high. The climb follows Tuesday’s announcement that the company submitted plans to expand its production in Israel. Intel will reportedly invest about $5 billion between 2018 and 2020, according to Israel's Finance Ministry.With that said, investors are also likely excited to see that the company’s Q2 revenues are projected to climb by 10.5% to hit $16.32 billion, based on our current estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted earnings are projected to surge nearly 20% to hit $0.86 per share.The company also remains an attractive value play compared to the “Semiconductor – General” industry as well as the S&P 500. Coming into Wednesday, Intel stock was trading at 13.8X forward 12-months earnings estimates. This marks a discount compared to its industry’s current average of 18.1X and also looks solid against the S&P 500’s 16.9X.AMDShares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed nearly 3% to close at $12.82 per share. AMD’s climb came after Susquehanna upped its rating from “Negative” to “Neutral.” Interestingly enough, the firm noted that Intel’s delayed chip production could positively impact AMD.“A more competitive process technology may increase the likelihood of share gains versus Intel over the next few years, a potential game changer,” analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “We also expect additional share gains to come from the ramp of Ryzen Mobile, and AMD's server product Epyc.""The Susquehanna analyst also upped his AMD price target from $8 per share to $11 per share, which actually represents a downside from Wednesday’s closing price.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

77,AMD,"The week before Halloween also happens to be one of the most crowded and important weeks of the third-quarter earnings season this year, as 180 S&P 500 companies report their Q3 metrics. One company that has potential to stand out is Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).Intel is set to report its Q3 earnings on Thursday. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has met or surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing 14 quarters. Yet, other, up-and-coming semiconductor industry giants—including Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) and AMD (AMD  -  Free Report)—have encroached on Intel’s market share recently.This has led shares of Intel to gain just 12.57% this year, which is close to the S&P 500 average but below the “Semiconductor – General” industry’s gain of over 60%.We expect Intel to post earnings of 80 cents per share and revenues of $15.71 billion in its third-quarter, based on our latest consensus estimates. These figures might sound solid on their face, but if these projections prove true, they would represent year-over-year growth rates of 0.4% and -0.42%, respectively.Nevertheless, our full-year projections paint a much more positive picture, with the company expected to post earnings growth of 10.7% and revenue growth of 3.3%.Of course, revenue and earnings aren’t all that investors care about, and luckily for Intel, many investors will also pay close attention to future-focused projects, such as its Internet of Things segment, to help determine where the company stands.Thankfully, we can check our exclusive non-financial metrics estimates file to help determine how some of Intel’s specific divisions might perform come Thursday.These important stock drivers are from our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. Learn more here>>>Intel has turned some of its focus towards the Internet of Things. This strategic move is aimed to help improve both the company’s top and bottom line, especially as the world of internet-connected products, from cars to refrigerators, proliferates.The semiconductor maker designs an assortment of IoT products used in the retail and transportation industries, as well as in the development of connected smart cities. Based on our latest consensus estimates, Intel’s IoT revenues are set to jump 12% to reach $772 million this quarter.Growth in Intel’s IoT sector might make investors who are worried about Intel’s possible overall Q3 revenue decline a bit less apprehensive.For more stock-moving estimates ahead of Intel’s Q3 report, check out our full guide: 3 Key Estimates for Intel's Q3 Earnings ReportAnd make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Intel’s actual results later this week!Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

78,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) plunged more than 3% in early morning trading Monday, extending what has been a turbulent month for the semiconductor maker and underscoring the recent industry-wide dip in tech stocks.After falling more than 3% last week, AMD shares kicked off the current week by slumping to a new one-month low of $11.86 early Monday morning. The trendy graphics chip manufacturer has now lost more than 10% over the past four weeks.Nevertheless, Advanced Micro Devices remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with excellent growth prospects. After AMD surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by two cents in the most recent quarter, estimates for the company’s upcoming fiscal periods have been trending upward; now, our consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of nearly 140% and sales growth of more than 15% in AMD’s current quarter.Investors should note the strength of AMD’s earnings results and estimates because it is not weakness in these areas that has sent the stock down in recent weeks. Instead, it appears as if heightened volatility has made life more difficult for some of the market’s most talked about stocks.Indeed, the CBOE Volatility Index has climbed nearly 50% so far this month, and tense political conditions—both domestically and abroad—look poised to deliver the VIX’s biggest one-month gain since August 2015.On the international front, last week’s deadly terror attacks in Barcelona and Finland have once again led to increased security concerns throughout Europe, and here at home, concerns about President Donald Trump’s unpopularity have made investors hesitant.After Trump’s controversial response to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville led to a mass exodus of business executives from his advisory councils, the White House’s flames were further stoked by Friday’s dismissal of Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.The chaotic week revealed widespread turmoil in the Trump-era GOP, leading some investors to question whether the Republican’s will be able to deliver their pro-growth economic policies on time. Add in the party’s inability to pass its Obamacare repeal, and it’s easy to see why some are losing confidence in the long-awaited tax reform and infrastructure investment deals.And with this increased volatility, we’ve seen the markets retreat a bit, especially in the previously red-hot technology sector. In fact, as the major indices have slumped, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has led the way, shedding nearly 2.75% over the past two weeks.  Want more stock market analysis from this author?

79,AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) recently unveiled its new Radeon RX Vega 56 and 64 graphics cards. We believe that this launch will provide AMD an edge against NVIDIA’s (NVDA  -  Free Report), GeForce GTX 1080 and 1070 cards, which were released last year.Though the reviews have been moderately positive, per PC Gamer power consumption is higher than the year-old GeForce cards. Nevertheless, with these cards, AMD is foraying into the high-end graphics card market.The newly launched cards were sold on Newegg and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).AMD stock has gained 11.4% year to date, substantially underperforming the 26.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.PC Gaming and Graphics Card MarketPer Gartner, PC shipments declined 2.4% in the first quarter of 2017. However, growth of the high-end PC market that includes gaming PCs was better than expected.Per Jon Peddie Research (JPR), with an increase in the number of people engaging in PC gaming, the related hardware market is experiencing a huge boost. Per the research firm, the market exceeded $30 billion mark in 2016 and is anticipated to witness compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% through 2019.Growth in the gaming hardware market is driving demand for graphics processors as well. Per Allied Market Research, the graphic processing unit (GPU) market is anticipated to reach $157.1 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2016 to 2022.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuotePer JPR, in first-quarter 2017, the graphics board shipments declined 29.8% sequentially and 19.2% year over year. NVIDIA managed to increase its share by 2% in the last quarter and continues to be a leader with 72.5% share. But AMD lost 2% and its market share was 27.5%.We believe that the launch of the new graphics cards will help AMD maintain its market share going forward.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAMD currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

80,AMD,"We expect Alibaba Group (BABA  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fiscal first-quarter 2017 results on Aug 17.The Chinese e-commerce goliath caters mainly to its native market. It operates as a platform for third-party sellers. It neither sells goods directly to merchants nor holds inventory.Last quarter, the company missed estimates, resulting in a negative earnings surprise of 17.02%.However, its surprise history has been impressive as it topped estimates in three of the last four quarters at an average beat of over 20.53%. Year to date, the stock has rallied 72.8%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 44%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Alibaba Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Alibaba has the right combination of two key components.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +4.11%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alibaba Group has a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with an ESP of +4.11% make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Alibaba has a huge (nearly 80%) share of the Chinese e-commerce market, one of the largest markets globally, and a market where consumers are increasingly turning to online channels to purchase quality products and global brands. China is Alibaba’s greatest strength and serving the Chinese customer is what has taken the company to the top. The company has been witnessing top-line growth of more than 40% for the past several quarters.But Alibaba isn’t resting on its laurels. This is because it isn’t just China but also other Asian markets that will see a rise in online shoppers. This has prompted it to invest in Lazada, a Singapore-based e-commerce company founded by Germany-based Rocket Internet. India is another big e-commerce market with several local players. Alibaba has bought stakes in these players, possibly preparing the road for a full-blown entry.Having been around long enough to establish logistical relationships through Cainiao, payments processing through Ant Financial and a solid core commerce model, Alibaba has been guzzling data that it is in an increasingly better position to use for improving customer experience and feeding its AI initiatives.Ant Financial, which runs Alipay, has a total of 450 million active users and processes 170 million transactions per day. Alicloud, which grew 103% in the last quarter, is also seeing enhancements. Alibaba is in the process of negotiations with ZTE for the purchase of its telecom gear-making subsidiary ZTEsoft Technology Co.All these factors are likely to have played a role in the very strong revenue targets management set for the year. Accordingly, management expects that e-commerce, cloud, digital media and entertainment, and of course international expansion will contribute to revenue growth of around 45-49%, or over $34 billion this year.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks, which you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.

81,AMD,"Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal third-quarter 2017 results on Aug 17.  Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.95%.The company’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average of 3.35%.Coming to share price movement, Applied Materials’ shares have returned 33.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 34.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayApplied Materials reported strong fiscal second-quarter results, with both the top and the bottom lines coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Applied Materials has a solid product line and management has stepped up investments to prepare for the ongoing transition to larger wafer sizes and smaller process nodes. The ramp up in FinFET, 3D NAND and new display technology will likely be the catalysts.Moreover, the company remains strongly positioned in China where it continues to see strong growth in semiconductor orders. Growing investments from Chinese domestic manufacturers will continue to be the main catalysts.There is also scope for share gains on the Display side of the business. New display technologies like OLED are opening up new market opportunities for Applied Materials. The available market opportunity is now more than 10 times that of traditional LCD.Developing trends in mobility, connectivity, video and wearable devices are fueling growth in the industry. This, in turn, is expediting advancement in mobile processors, solid-state storage and interactive displays.The company has focused its structure and talent around key areas of value creation. It plans to align its product portfolio in a way that it generates the best returns for clients.All these factors will likely lead the company to report decent results in the upcoming quarter. However, increasing competition, high fixed-cost structure and customer concentration remain major concerns.Applied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Applied Materials, Inc.

82,AMD,"Even as markets take a brief breather from a record run of gains, most investors are ignoring a hugely profitable trend. Stocks from the artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and machine learning arenas have been providing handsome returns through the year, in several cases significantly superior to the broader market. Tech bellwethers have caught onto this emerging trend and are making massive investments in these areas.Future demand for the industry is projected to rise exponentially given that a broad spectrum of industries is rapidly integrating such technologies into their core operations. Investing in stocks from the artificial intelligence and robotics domain would allow you to cash in on an exceedingly profitable trend.AI, Robotics Stocks Well Ahead of Broader MarketsThe success of such stocks can be gauged from the performance delivered by the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ and the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO  -  Free Report). While BOTZ is up 33.9% year to date, ROBO has gained 26% over the same period. In comparison, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are up 10.5%, 11.6% and 18% year to date, significantly behind the performance of these sector focused ETFs.In fact, a section of analysts believe that these sectors could outperform there larger peers in the long run, even beating the much-vaunted FANG stocks. In fact, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), all of which have gained between 20 to 50% this year, are expanding their footprint in the AI domain. This is why market watchers believe that the robotics-automation-AI trend is likely to be the next FANG-like trading opportunity.Prospects of a $50-Billion Market BrightenThe idea of artificial intelligence germinated in the 1960s, but only now has it become a lucrative investment proposition. Two catchphrases have caught the imagination of investors and companies at the moment, deep learning networks and machine learning. Both these concepts aim to make successful predictions after mining through large masses of data, a task which several intelligent humans would be incapable of.It comes as no surprise, therefore, that a Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) report released in November 2016 claims that companies from sectors as diverse as banking and healthcare are more or less likely to raise their AI expenditure levels. Such investments are essentially being made in pursuit of higher productivity levels which will lead to a smaller workforce. Also in the offing is an elusive strategic edge over competitors, gained from new insights delivered by AI enabled systems and processes.Such a trend could lead to a massive market for products and services from the artificial intelligence, technology and robotics domains. One estimate from research company Tractica puts revenue from artificial intelligence from AI at $59.8 billion by 2025. If such an optimistic forecast does come true, it would be a quantum leap over 2016’s level of a mere $1.4 billion.Our ChoicesThough several of the BOTZ and ROBO components are foreign stocks, several home grown companies are forces to reckon with the in the AI-automation space. With the attention this investing trend is receiving from tech heavyweights, what is now a niche investing theme could soon become a hugely popular investment trend.Buying stocks from these domains are likely to deliver strong performance, likely well in excess of the broader markets. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Brooks Automation, Inc. (BRKS  -  Free Report) delivers automation solutions to the global semiconductor and related industries.

83,AMD,"Investors in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 11th, 2017 $20.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Top 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 4 cents per share to 5 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

84,AMD,"Bitcoin soared to a new high above $3,400 today, more than tripling in value from around $997 at the start of the year. The digital currency now has a market value exceeding $55 billion. Total value of all cryptocurrencies is more than $116 billion now, per coinmarketcap.com.Bitcoin is up more than 22% over the past week, thanks mainly to a smooth split in the cryptocurrency into bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Other cryptocurrencies have also surged of late.Bitcoin’s closest rival ether has risen more than 37% over the past week and about 3,300% year-to-date. It has a market value exceeding $25 billion. The surge in cryptocurrencies has also boosted Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) and AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) stocks as their chips are used for cryptocurrency mining.Below is the year-to-date bitcoin price chart from CoinDesk: “Hard Fork” Creates Bitcoin Cash The two-year old conflict over how to expand bitcoin’s processing capacity in order to meet increased demand finally came to a resolution. On August 1, a new version of the digital currency--Bitcoin Cash-- was created after the so-called “hard fork” or split. (Read: SEC Reviews Bitcoin ETF—The Skyrocketing Cryptocurrency Explained)Bitcoin transactions are grouped into blocks limited to one megabyte in size, resulting in a limit of seven transactions per second.  This had slowed trading and resulted in higher fees.Bitcoin cash will be processed in eight-megabyte units and the network would be able to process more than 50 transactions per second. It has mainly been backed by some miners in China.Major exchanges have so far not supported bitcoin cash.  Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, initially said they would not support it but later announced that they are “planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.”After inception, bitcoin cash soared and then fell in a very volatile day of trading. It is currently trading around $269 and has a market value of $4.4 billion. (Read: Ethereum ETF?

87,AMD,"Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 72 cents per share, which surged 22% from the year-ago quarter but declined 8.9% sequentially. Earnings per share (EPS) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.The strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by 9.1% increase in revenues, which totaled $14.76 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.41 billion. Revenues were almost flat sequentially. After adjusting for the Intel Security Group (ISecG) transaction, revenues grew 14%.The robust year-over-year revenue growth came on the back of impressive results from the Non-volatile memory solutions group, Client Computing and Internet-of-Things groups, which contributed to almost 66.4% of total revenue.Earnings also benefited from improving unit costs with 14-nm ramp and gains from a sale of a portion of the company’s equity investments in ASML.Intel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Intel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation QuoteIntel revised its 2017 revenue and EPS outlook based on double-digit growth expectation from data-centric businesses, which accounts for more than 40% of total revenue. Further, anticipated improvement in cost structure and lower spending, primarily due to improving operational efficiency will aid in expansion of margins going forward. Additionally, aggressive share buyback will boost the bottom line in 2017.Intel has lost 1.4% of its value year to date versus the 14.8% growth of its industry. Despite intensifying competition in the data center chip market from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), we expect that these aforesaid factors will help Intel's stock to rebound in the rest of 2017.Segment Revenue DetailsClient Computing Group (55.6% of revenues) – Intel bundles PCs, notebooks, 2-in-1s, tablets and other computing devices under the Client segment, which helps comparison with the PC market numbers provided by IDC and Gartner.Revenues increased 11.9% year over year and 3% sequentially to almost $8.21 billion. The growth rate was encouraging as it continued to beat PC market trends. Despite some modest improvements in the PC consumption, management continues to expect a mid-single digit TAM decline for the full year.The company launched new Intel Core X-series processor family including a new Core i9 Extreme Edition processor during the quarter. Intel also began shipping its next-gen4G LTE modem (7480) to customers.

Cloud and Commercial service provider now comprise nearly 60% of DCG's revenues.Intel is on track to deliver end-to-end solutions that address the needs of the 5G market. The company noted that it is participating in five ongoing trials with global service providers, while15 more are in the pipeline.Recently, the company launched Xeon Scalable (formerly known as Skylake) which is more than 1.6 times faster than the prior-generation product. The new platform accelerates inference throughput for High Performance Computing (HPC), Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Notably, the company has already delivered 500,000 units of Xeon Scalable to over 30 customers.We expect Xeon Scalable to gain strong traction from cloud-based service providers like Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet, which will be a key catalyst for Intel.By 2021, management expects the data center to be a $65 billion opportunity. Intel currently addresses almost 40% of the market. Hence, there is substantial growth prospect as the company develops expertise in adjacencies like Ethernet, Silicon Photonics and 3D XPoint memory.Internet of Things Group (4.9% of revenues) – Revenues jumped 25.9% from the year-ago quarter but remained almost flat quarter over quarter to $720 million. The growth was backed by strength in industrial, retail, video and transportation applications.Intel plans to close the acquisition of Israel-based Mobileye, an autonomous vehicle technology provider, in the third quarter of 2017. The deal will help the company to penetrate the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services market.Non-Volatile memory solutions group (5.9% of revenues) – Revenues jumped 57.8% year over year and 0.9% sequentially to $874 million.

Segment wise, Client Computing group operating margin were 36.8% as compared with 26% in the year-ago quarter. The massive expansion came on the back of lower investments and declining costs (14 nm). However, on a sequential basis, Client Computing group operating margin contracted 120 bps.Data Center group operating margin was 38% significantly down from 43.8% in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was impacted by increased technology development costs and higher spending on AI and adjacency businesses. Sequentially, segment margin expanded 290 bps.Internet of Things group operating margin expanded 370 bps year over year and 470 bps sequentially. Higher volumes and ASPs were partially offset by continued investment in automotive.Non-Volatile memory solutions group reported loss of $110 million as compared with loss of $224 million in the year-ago quarter and $129 million in the previous quarter. The loss was primarily due to costs associated with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for the company’s memory capacity enhancement project.Balance SheetCash, marketable securities and fixed income trading asset balance at quarter end was almost $17.30 billion, up $200 million from the previous quarter.Intel currently has $20.65 billion in long-term debt as well as $4.63 billion in short-term debt, which has led to a net debt balance of $8.18 billion.During the reported quarter, Intel generated approximately $4.7 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends worth $1.3 billion and bought back shares worth $1.3 billion.Intel received approximately $900 million cash from the divestiture of its portion in Intel Security.GuidanceIntel guided third-quarter 2017 revenues of around $15.7 billion (+/-$500 million), almost flat sequentially and up 3% year over year excluding Intel Security Group business.

90,AMD,"During the first trading period after AMD’s (AMD  -  Free Report) impressive Q2 earnings announcement, graphics chip competitor Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) touched a new all-time high in morning trading Wednesday.Shares of Nvidia surged as high as $169.93 in morning hours, which marked a 2.78% gain from Tuesday’s close. The stock slumped back down a bit by early afternoon, but today’s price action underscores the strength of the graphics chip market—which was on display in AMD’s latest report.AMD surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings and revenue, notching year-over-year sales growth of 19% in the process. The highlight of the report was the company’s staggering 51% growth in its computing and graphics unit, and although this was boosted by sales of the new Ryzen GPUs, graphics demand was strong as well.(Also read: Strong Ryzen Sales Help AMD Post Q2 Earnings and Revenue Beats) “Our second quarter results demonstrate strong growth driven by leadership products and focused execution,” said AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “Our Ryzen desktop processors, Vega GPUs, and EPYC datacenter products have received tremendous industry recognition.”A strong graphics chip market should be encouraging news for investors as we head towards Nvidia’s second-quarter report in the coming weeks. Nvidia has shifted towards a machine learning and AI focus recently, but the company still brings in plenty of revenue on the consumer level, where it directly competes with AMD in the gaming market.While AMD’s success might mean that Nvidia has lost some market share, it is likely a positive indicator of rising overall demand. On top of video gaming, Nvidia and AMD have benefitted from the astronomical rise of bitcoin and ethereum over the past year, as more and more people build powerful machines—using high-end graphics chips—to “mine” these cryptocurrencies.Looking ahead, our current consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to post EPS growth of 60% and revenue growth of 37% this quarter. These impressive growth rates have helped the stock earn a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system, and they’ve contributed to Nvidia’s status as one of the most popular growth picks on Wall Street right now.NVDA has also been a scorching hot momentum stock, with shares gaining more than 190% over the past year. In 2017 alone, NVDA has soared nearly 60%, making it one of the year’s hottest stocks.Furthermore, the company has put together quite the earnings track record, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 27% in each of the trailing four quarters. This should give investors even more confidence in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock as we approach its earnings report date.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

91,AMD,"Over the past several years, the world’s most recognizable brands have shifted away from the consumer goods sector and into the technology sector. We tend to focus on the companies we interact with every day, and in the modern world, that includes social media giants like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report).With billions of users across several popular social platforms, Facebook has established itself as the outright leader in this still-growing industry, and the company looks poised to dominate the tech world for years to come.It’s also convenient that Facebook is led by a man like Mark Zuckerberg, who is both inspiring and polarizing—a combination that has created some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs. Since the earliest days of Facebook, when the site was being run out of a Harvard dorm room, Zuckerberg has not been afraid to butt heads with anyone.That attitude helped the college dropout create one of the most powerful business empires in the world, and along the way, his personal net worth swelled to more than $63 billion.Being the founder and largest shareholder of Facebook certainly helps with this, but Zuckerberg is an interesting rarity among the mega-moguls because he is not really known for his investing skills. Sure, Facebook has made a number of brilliant strategic moves over the years, but individual investors tend to turn to the likes of Warren Buffett for inspiration first.But is this fair? Has Zuckerberg actually given investors a solid game-plan for success?Indeed he has! Today, we’ll be digging through some classic Zuckerberg quotes to uncover the founder of Facebook’s three-step blueprint for investing success.1.       Take RisksEvery investor takes on risks—that’s just the nature of the beast. Some investors prefer to minimize risk, opting instead for stable returns with limited downside. Others see things differently, and Zuckerberg is definitely one of those people. It’s safe to say that if Zuckerberg were managing his own portfolio, he’d be taking a look at more volatile, high-growth stocks like AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Micron (MU  -  Free Report). 2.       Invest in Emerging MarketsAs an investor, there’s nothing more frustrating than hearing about a great emerging market just after the majority of its growth is done. Perhaps Zuckerberg is telling us to take a look at the Emerging Markets Index Fund (EEM  -  Free Report), or maybe we should target specific emerging markets like the India Index Fund (INDA  -  Free Report). 3.       Stability Takes TimeReputations are not earned in a matter of months. If you want to be known as a strong investor with consistently stable returns, that’s something that takes years and years to develop. For example, our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system has more than doubled the S&P 500 since 1988.Want to shape your own legacy as a successful investor?

95,AMD,"We are entering the heart of the second-quarter reporting cycle and 97 S&P 500 members, representing 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, have already reported their results (as of Friday, Jul 21).Total earnings of these companies are up 8.4% on a year-over-year basis (78.4% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue is up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis (72.2% of the companies also beat top-line estimates).Overall, second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 8.6% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 4.7%. This compares with 13.3% growth in first-quarter earnings on 7% higher revenues.Technology Earnings ExpectationsTechnology is one of the three sectors contributing significantly to second-quarter earnings. The other two are Finance and Energy.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software. Earnings for the technology sector are anticipated to be up 10.1%.A couple of semiconductor companies are slated to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 25. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. So, let’s take a sneak peek into how Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) are placed ahead of their releases.Texas Instruments is unlikely to beat expectations as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, as per our proven model, a company needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3  to deliver an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.However, we note that Texas Instruments beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 7.68%.We believe the company’s strength in auto and industrial markets will play an important role. Compelling product line, the differentiation in its business, investments in high margin areas, and lower-cost 300mm Analog outputare other positives.It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), remains one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices.(Read More: What's in Store for Texas Instruments in Q2 Earnings?)Texas Instruments has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the stock returned almost 12%, the index gained 10.7% over the same time frame.Similarly, Advanced Micro Devices is unlikely to beat estimates as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters and matched the same on the other two occasions. It delivered an average four-quarter positive surprise of 34.09%.We believe strong demand for GPU cards, expanding product portfolio (Ryzen Pro, Vega accelerator, EPYC server processor, Ryzen desktop processor) and AMD’s improving position in key markets like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), gaming and parallel processing are positives. (Read More: Can Advanced Micro Pull an Earnings Surprise in Q2?)Advanced Micro stock has gained 22.4% year to date, underperforming the 30.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. The underperformance reflects stiff competition from NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) in the GPU space and Intel in the consumer PC market.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The company has also benefited from strong demand of its GPU cards, which are now increasingly used to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteHowever, over the same time frame, the stock has underperformed the 30.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. The underperformance reflects stiff competition from NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) in the GPU space and Intel in the consumer PC market.Nevertheless, AMD’s improving position in key markets – like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), gaming and parallel processing – driven by the launch of Radeon and Ryzen chips is a key catalyst.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Advanced Micro is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Advanced Micro’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Advanced Micro carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

97,AMD,"Continuing with its upbeat performance for the fourth straight quarter, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) yesterday reported strong results for second-quarter 2017. Quarterly revenues came in at the higher-end of the company’s expectations, while earnings were above the guidance range. Moreover, the top and bottom lines, both, surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point’s adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.14 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Adjusted earnings also climbed approximately 18% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues, efficient cost management and a lower share count.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.26, higher than its guidance range of $1.17–$1.25, and marked a 15.6% year-over-year improvement.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. QuoteRevenuesSecond-quarter revenues came in at $458.6 million, up 8.5% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $455 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company’s guidance range of $440–$465 million (mid-point $452.5 million). Quarterly revenues were mainly driven by strong performance of its small and midsize-enterprise product lines as the company has been successfully able to penetrate through the midmarket and acquire new customers.Segment wise, the company witnessed sales growth of 11.9% in Products & Software Blades, and 4.4% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 27% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Geographically, the Americas contributed 49% to revenues and Europe accounted for 34%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 17%.Talking about deal size, the number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more totaled 63, flat year over year. Moreover, customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 71% to the total order value, which is equal to the second-quarter 2016 tally.Operating ResultsOn a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 8.1% to $405.7 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross profit contracted 30 basis points (bps) to 88.5%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 6.5% year over year to $180.8 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 80 basis points (bps) mainly due to efficient cost management.Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $224.9 million, up nearly 9.5% year over year. In addition, margins expanded 40 bps to 49% primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $191.3 million or $1.14 per share, up from $169 million or 97 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowCheck Point exited the quarter with cash balances of approximately $3.806 billion, slightly down from $3.797 billion at the end of the first quarter. During the first half of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $581.7 million. Additionally, Check Point repurchased about 4.9 million shares for a total cost of $496 million in the first two quarters of 2017.Share Price PerformanceDespite reporting robust quarterly results, shares of Check Point dipped 7% during yesterday’s trade as the company hinted that its third-quarter revenues might be hit slightly due to the very special Israeli holiday – Yom Kippur – coinciding with the last day of third quarter.Israel-based Check Point announced that the entire country will be completely shut down during Yom Kippur and so it won’t be able to operate any business activities. Notably, the company normally derives almost $30 million of revenues in the last few days of any quarter.However, Check Point expects to mitigate some of the impact during the quarter. Also, despite of all this, the company has maintained the outlook on full-year revenues, which signifies that it is optimistic about its long-term prospects.Notably, shares of Check Point have gained 27.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 21.2% rally.OutlookTaking into account the aforementioned factors, the company provided outlook for the third quarter. The company expects to generate revenues between $430 million and $465 million (mid-point $447.5 million). The mid-point of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $462.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.18–$1.28 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 15 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.14 per share.For 2017, Check Point continues to anticipate generating revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.90 billion (mid-point $1.875 billion). The mid-point of the guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the band of $5.05–$5.25 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 70 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.69.Our TakeCheck Point continues to report splendid quarterly results for the fourth consecutive quarter. The company’s top and bottom lines not only came ahead of the respective guidance ranges at mid-points, but also marked solid year-over-year improvement. Although, the third-quarter outlook is slightly disappointing, we believe that the company is well capable of mitigating the third-quarter revenue losses in the fourth quarter.Rapid adoption of Check Point’s data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support. The company’s focus on enhancing mobile capabilities will enable it to tap greater larger opportunities. Furthermore, Check Point’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is praiseworthy.Additionally, we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises, and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Nonetheless, changing customer spending behavior, intensifying competition, an uncertain economic environment and currency fluctuations remain headwinds.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company is likely to do well with its Fluke point-of-sale in India as well.The recent agreement of merging its automation & specialty platform with Altra Industrial Motion Corp is aimed to focus more on software and service exposure and increase its merger & acquisitions capacity, which is likely to strengthen its product portfolio.Moreover, the deal represents a tax efficient transaction which will be beneficial for Fortive’s shareholders.Additionally, continuous efforts on improving mobile lead generation conversion rate and reducing ELD campaign cost per click are likely to improve the market share of Fortive in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Fortive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Fortive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Fortive Corporation Quote What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

The company beat the Zack Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 10.18%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 59 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents but declined 22.4% year over year.

Non-GAAP operating margin is expected in the range of 6.5-7.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNETGEAR’s strong product portfolio is a key growth driver. The company’s Arlo home security products and Orbi WiFI systems continue to boost its top line.In the fourth quarter, the company rolled out new services across all three business segments, which are expected to drive results this quarter.NETGEAR expanded its Nighthawk offerings by introducing Nighthawk Pro Gaming Router and Nighthawk Pro Gaming Switch in order to cater to the high-end gaming market. This is expected to boost its Connected Home segment.  Moreover, the company partnered with Circle Media to bring Circle with Disney parental controls across the Nighthawk and Orbi WiFi routers and systems.It remains to be seen whether the company’s newly launched subscription offerings, Insight Basic for $4.99 per month and Insight Premium for $9.99 per month, can benefit its SMB segment.NETGEAR’s strengthening foothold in the North American market and improving penetration in the EMEA region is a positive.However, the service provider business continues to pose challenges with the company streamlining the segment.Also, expenses are on the rise due to the increase in headcount owing to the proposed separation of NETGEAR and its Arlo business, which remain an overhang on the bottom line.Further, declining revenues in the APAC region is also a concern.NETGEAR, Inc.

102,AMD,"Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26. The company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Western Digital surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.Due to expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital’s prospects look bright. Additionally, the company’s expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data, growing exposure to the SMB space and positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition are likely to act as catalysts for Q3 results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Western Digital is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $4.93 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter. Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation Quote What’s Behind This Overwhelming Expectation?Western Digital has been expanding in the SSD storage market, bothered by the declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices over the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs.Over the last few months, the company rolled out the world’s smallest 1 TB USB flash drive, voice activated media streaming via home devices, and a new series of high performance SSDs. With the rising need to capture and share rich content, lens technology and video streaming are becoming more immersive.For photographers and drone enthusiasts, the company also released My Passport Wireless SSD and SanDisk Extreme portable SSD. These devices feature a one-touch card copy that enables quick editing, as well as third-party app integration.Western Digital also unveiled the My Cloud Home device that displays new voice-activated media streaming features through smart-home devices.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio and aid Western Digital in gaining a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which, per the latest data by TechNavio, is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.Anticipating a potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is also investing heavily to deliver high-capacity storage devices which will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications.The company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, a broader portfolio of network attached storage (NAS) hard drives. My Cloud EX4 will help the company meet growing business needs, with improved flexibility and security, consequently boosting its top line.The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind. Further, the company’s expanding footprint in the automotive, as well as the connected home and industrial categories are likely to act as another key catalyst.Furthermore, Western Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company’s growth and helped it gain traction in SSD.  Additionally, it has enabled the company to step into the NAND products market which, owing to its strong demand, will drive revenues.Moreover, the company’s acquisitions of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio as well.Some Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Xilinx, Inc.

NANIUM is likely to have contributed to fourth-quarter earnings.Amkor continues to make efforts to channelize its resources in important growth areas like automotive.

112,AMD,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is anticipated to impress investors once again with its stellar performance in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results which it will report tomorrow after the market closes. Notably, for the last two years, the company’s quarterly revenues have been advancing at a rate more than 50%, earnings have tripled and shares have displayed more than six-fold growth, consequently.This Santa Clara, CA-based chip-making giant is well known for its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) used by PC gamers. However, for the last two years, NVIDIA’s strategy of applying its GPUs in the artificial intelligence (AI) models has helped it expand footprint in several fast-growing fields, including self-driving cars and datacenter.AI, which is a global rage these days, has long been touted as the next big thing in the technology sector, with its usage rising gradually with each passing day.Let’s delve deeper and find out how AI is supporting NVIDIA in other growing markets.Front Runner in the Self-Driving AI SpaceFor the successful operation of autonomous vehicles, a powerful AI supercomputing platform is required. And NVIDIA has successfully innovated the required GPU and became the front runner in providing technology for self-driving vehicles.It should be noted that NVIDIA forayed into the autonomous vehicle and other automotive electronics space by launching a computer vision system at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2015. It hasn’t looked back since then and has been continuously bringing in new and more advanced technologies in the space.At the beginning of 2016, NVIDIA launched DRIVE PX 2 — the world’s most powerful engine for in-vehicle AI. Later in September that year, the graphic-chip behemoth unveiled an AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Amsterdam.The company’s AI-enabled GPUs have helped it win several contracts from the auto and component manufacturers. At the CES 2018, the company announced that it has such contracts from more than 300 companies which show NVIDIA’s growing dominance in providing AI platforms which will power future vehicles.The company’s cutting-edge technology has helped it become the leading player in providing AI for applications to autonomous driving vehicles, outpacing other competitors, such as Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), in terms of growth.Continued contract wins have brought additional revenues. It should be noted that the company’s Automotive segment’s contribution to the total revenues was just $54 million at the end of fiscal 2015, but it is expected to reach approximately $575 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Automotive segment’s revenues will be approximately $150 million, representing year-over-year growth of 17%.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteDatacenter Remains the Fastest Growth DriverNVIDIA is also a leading player in selling its GPUs to datacenter service provider. Its client list includes Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft and Alphabet.Demand for NVIDIA’s datacenter-focused products has escalated due to an increase in datacenter production around the world, and management has successfully marketed its solutions to compete with industry leaders like Intel. Per the Consensus Estimate, the segment is likely to be up 85.5% from the year-ago quarter level and reach $549 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.Apart from self-driving and datacenter markets, increasing use of cryptocurrencies is also driving demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs, as it helps create digital currencies like Ethereum, Monero, Cash and bitcoin gold. As the craze for digital currencies has been growing rapidly, we believe the company will continue to witness demand for its GPUs from miners.Bottom LineAlthough past performances do not guarantee similar results in the ensuing year, we feel optimistic about the stock given massive growth opportunities in AI and related fields. A few months back, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s analyst, Vivek Arya, and Evercore ISI’s analyst — C.J. Muse — noted that NVIDIA is well poised to dominate the AI market. Arya, in a note written to clients, had mentioned, “Similar to other large successful tech industries, we expect the $30bn AI chip market to also feature one dominant supplier – we think NVDA.”Another analyst Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets stated that the company is well poised to get the “first-mover advantage” and will continue maintaining its sturdy presence in the AI training system.All this makes us optimistic about NVIDIA’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance where its strengthening capabilities in the AI space will be a crucial growth driver.NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

113,AMD,"Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 3.78%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 5.48%.Coming to the price performance, on a 12-month basis, the company’s shares have rallied 30% compared with the industry’s growth of 39.5%.Let’s find out what Fortive has to offer investors in this quarter.Portfolio Strength, Acquisitions: Key CatalystsFortive’s diverse product portfolio and expansion into the Cloud computing segment is quite encouraging. The acquisitions of eMaint Enterprises by Fortive’s subsidiary, Fluke, and the buyout of Global Traffic Technologies have allowed the company to enter into the rapidly growing cloud computing market.In the third quarter, Fortive closed the acquisition of Industrial Scientific and Landauer. These acquisitions are anticipated to contribute key product technologies and drive recurring revenues.We expect strong demand for the company’s products like Tektronix and Qualitrol, among others to continue driving growth in China.Further, the Tektronix 5 Series mixed-signal oscilloscope has gained significant traction since its release in June.Moreover, Fortive’s restructuring actions have been aiding the company to lower its cost structure. The company has also been focusing on products which generally carry higher margins. These actions are expected to generate higher gross and operating margins for the company in the to-be reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Moreover, our proven model shows that Fortive is likely to beat earnings due to the favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and +0.64% Earnings ESP.

114,AMD,"Amid widespread volatility, the Wall Street is back in the green territory for the year. The impressive run in the stocks last week has helped the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 index to attain this level. Meanwhile, gains for the Nasdaq Composite Index expanded, taking the lead this year, climbing 7.2%.Tech Sector BoostMost of the surge came from the technology stocks following the power-packed earnings. The market darlings, known as the FAAMNG group, which comprises Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) had slipped into deep correction territory in late March. However, these managed to bounce back and restore positive sentiments with better-than-expected results and optimism for future growth.Facebook shrugged off worries over the data-privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica that broke in mid-March, while Apple eased concerns over weak iPhone demand and greeted investors with a big capital return program plus Warren Buffett's increased stake in the firm. The fast-growing cloud computing business powered both Amazon and Microsoft’s growth story. Notably, Microsoft seems on track to record its strongest annual revenue growth for more than a decade. Netflix came up with blockbuster results while Alphabet’s numbers were also inspiring.Apart from these, semiconductor firms like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Intel INTC and payment companies including Visa V and PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) also fueled the rally and instilled confidence in the sector.Energy JumpsOil price has zoomed to the highest levels in more than three and a half years buoyed by potential export disruptions in Iran and falling production in Venezuela. Additionally, the historic output cut deal by OPEC, Russia and other producers to curb production is paying off, paving the way for a rebalancing of the oil market despite rising U.S. production. The rally in the commodity has lent major optimism to the energy sector, pushing many stocks to new highs.Other FactorsStronger-than-expected earnings are providing the biggest catalyst. Total Q1 earnings for the 444 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far are up 24.5% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, with 77.7% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates. Notably, the Q1 earnings season is on track to record its best quarter in seven years.Additionally, signs of easing trade worries between China and the United States as well as April inflation data raised the appeal for riskier assets lately. This is because soft inflation numbers have alleviated the month-long aggressive rake hikes concern.Given the improving macro backdrop, many stocks have been surging. Below, we have highlighted those five stocks that have been leading the way higher this year and are poised to continue their bullish trend given that these have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR  -  Free Report) – Up 784.7%This California-based audio technology company designs audio products for consumer, commercial and healthcare markets.

115,AMD,"After two tumultuous months, the technology sector is once again at the heart of the market rally given a deluge of upbeat earnings results. This is especially true as the ultra-popular Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) has gained 5.1% in a month versus gains of 2.2% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY  -  Free Report) and 4.7% for PowerShares QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report).Total earnings from 84.3% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index are up 29.4% on 12.1% higher revenues, with a 91.5% companies beating both earnings and revenue estimates. While the earnings beat ratio and growth rates are tracking above historical periods, revenue surprise is lower than Q1.The six key technology stocks, viz., FAAMNG — Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — which slipped into deep correction territory in late March, strongly restored positive sentiments with better-than-expected results and optimism for future growth. In particular, Apple led the impressive surge following upbeat results and Warren Buffett's decision to increase his stake in the firm (read: 6 Top-Ranked ETFs With Apple in Basket for Juicy Returns).Additionally, a string of reports from other tech players like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Intel INTC, Visa V and PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) also fueled the rally and instilled confidence in the sector.Coming to sector fundamentals, the twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax cuts and a rising interest rate scenario as well as the emergence of cutting-edge technology are acting as catalysts. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from reduced tax rates. These companies are also sitting on a huge cash pile and in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders.If these aren’t enough, the sector has a solid Zacks Rank in the top 44%, suggesting robust growth prospects in the coming months (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Given this, many tech ETFs have been hitting all-time highs in recent trading sessions, easily crushing the broad market by a wide margin in the past one month.

Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.91 billion, up 50% from the prior-year quarter.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteGrowth Majorly Stemming from Gaming SegmentThe company’s gaming segment, which also happens to be the largest contributor to its revenues, is anticipated to have been spurred majority of growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, this segment is likely to witness massive year-over-year growth of 61.4% and reach $1.67 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.The year-over-year growth expectation is mainly driven by the strong adoption of NVIDIA’s Pascal architecture-based graphics processing units (GPUs).For a thrilling gaming experience, one needs better visualization and speed, and NVIDIA has what gamers want, with its strong portfolio of Pascal architecture-based GPUs, which is considered the best by market experts. As gaming enthusiasts always intend to play games at the best graphic settings, they usually upgrade their PCs with more advanced GPUs.NVIDIA has been able to tap this opportunity by continuously rolling out more advanced GPUs, including GTX 1080, GTX 1070 and Titan X, over the past year. This move bore fruit as evident from the impressive year-over-year growth in the segment’s revenues, over the last four-five quarters.The latest monthly report of Steam also depicts strong adoption of NVIDIA’s GPUs. Per the report, NVIDIA’s GPUs have captured a larger market share during the period between December 2017 and April 2018, compared with the preceding quarter.Thus, this indicates that strong adoption of the company’s graphic cards continued into the first quarter as well, the benefit of which will certainly reflect in its results.Competition Likely to Have Muted Growth PartiallyIncreasing competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) might have hurt the fiscal first-quarter top-line performance, to some extent. Notably, with an insignificant presence in the high-end graphic-chip market til July 2017, Advanced Micro Devices enhanced its footprint by introducing the Vega series of GPUs — Vega 56 and Vega 64 — in August 2017. Therefore, we believe this might have hurt NVIDIA’s market share in the quarter under review, in turn impacting the segment’s top-line performance.Some Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are a few companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Asure Software, Inc. (ASUR  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +30.09% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Yelp Inc. (YELP  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +9.78% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

118,AMD,"Warren Buffett, one of the most influential and sought-after value investors, criticized cryptocurrency and its trading.Buffett, the owner of Berkshire Hathaway and its vice chairman, Charles Thomas Munger strongly criticized investments in bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting 2018. He believes that these will soon meet their end in a miserable way.Per Buffett, cryptocurrencies are non-productive assets. Hence, the cycle of investment might be pretty short, as it would require people interested to invest in such non-productive products. All this will lead to stagnation in the cryptocurrency industry in the near future.Volatility of CryptocurrencyThe lack of support from global central banks has made the acceptance of cryptocurrencies difficult in real-world transactions. Additionally, a number of fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) have made investors further apprehensive about the industry’s future.Owing to all these, the cryptocurrency industry looks highly volatile. We have seen companies like Alphabet and Facebook banning cryptocurrency ads on their platforms.China has also imposed a ban on bitcoin trade, while a number of other countries have tightened regulations. These in turn have negatively impacted cryptocurrencies like itcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin.As continued volatility and rising skepticism over the future of cryptocurrencies make investors nervous, we believe, to keep risks at bay, they can shift their focus toward the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrency -– blockchain.Blockchain Witnessing Widescale AdoptionBlockchain’s process of secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the technology. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible and is meant to provide unaltered information.The distributed ledger technology (DLT) makes tampering of data impossible as a number of people are involved and have access to it. This safe system lowers monetary losses with minimum chances of double counting and hacking.Notably, the technology has already been adopted by the insurance, banking, food supply and automobile industries among others. It is also being adopted in the shipping and freight industries, aimed at more transparency and simplicity in tracking shipments across borders and trading zones.With such impressive visibility, the companies offering solutions and products related to blockchain operations are looking to gain immensely going ahead. Adoption of the technology is projected to reach $7.6 billion by 2022 from $411.5 million in 2017 at a CAGR of 79.6%, per data from MarketsandMarkets.Let’s take a look at some companies that are well-positioned to benefit from rapid adoption of blockchain technology.International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) has a strong foothold in the blockchain industry with deals in multi-line insurance, bank guarantee, automobile industry, global food supplying industry among others.The company has also unveiled a blockchain-based banking technology aimed at aiding financial institutions to simplify and quicken cross-border transactions. The company also partnered with the largest container shipping firm in the world, A.P. Moller-Maersk, intended to deliver a secure and efficient industry-wide trading platform using blockchain technology.We believe that with a variety of blockchain deals and more in the pipeline, this company will gain from the increasing adoption of the technology. IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.95%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.International Business Machines Corporation Price International Business Machines Corporation Price | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteMicrosoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) has also been trying to expand its footprint in the blockchain market with deals involving a wide range of applications in different industries.Last year, the company unveiled Coco framework for faster and secure blockchain-based transactions. The company also introduced its blockchain solution on its cloud platform Azure, which is finding large scale adoption, given the flexibility in usage. It has clients like 3M, Webjet, Monetary Authority of Singapore and The Association of Banks in Singapore.With a Zacks Rank #3 and a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.96%, Microsoft is another company to make the most of the growth opportunity in the market.Microsoft Corporation Price Microsoft Corporation Price | Microsoft Corporation QuoteAccenture’s (ACN  -  Free Report) blockchain initiatives are backed by its motto of “Blockchain needs to adapt to an imperfect world.” Considering regulatory changes and human errors among other issues, Accenture provides Editable Blockchain and was awarded with a patent for the same last year.The company has also inked several blockchain based deals. Most recently, the company announced that it is developing a blockchain prototype along with DHL to track pharmaceuticals throughout the supply chain. This will be a huge step against tampering of drugs. Also, its blockchain technology, aimed at addressing global shipping issues, received approval in March.Though a late entrant in the blockchain market, Accenture with a patent for Editable Blockchain is expected succeed in the long run. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.Accenture PLC Price Accenture PLC Price | Accenture PLC QuoteIntel (INTC  -  Free Report) is one of the chip makers looking to gain from the rising demand for blockchain technology even if cryptocurrency faces headwinds. For enhancement of security in blockchain transactions, Intel is offering Intel Software Guard Extensions and Intel Xeon Scalable processors, which are anticipated to experience increased demand.This will eventually be beneficial for this Zacks Rank #3 stock’s financials. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.42%.Intel Corporation Price Intel Corporation Price | Intel Corporation QuoteNVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) also carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.25%. The company is a major supplier of GPUs related to blockchain operations and is probably the first choice in that respect.It is expected that this chipmaker will enjoy the growth prospects of the blockchain market with or without the existence of cryptocurrencies, which will eventually boost its revenues. NVIDIA Corporation Price NVIDIA Corporation Price | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) is poised to gain as well. The company is witnessing increased adoption of Vega-based GPUs and Polaris products in the blockchain industry and is expected to witness a surge in demand for these products going ahead.Advanced Micro has a Zacks Rank #3 and a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.75%.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteTo ConcludeWe believe that even if the seasoned investor Warren Buffett’s predictions and expectations regarding cryptocurrencies come true, the companies which are working with the underlying technology and its applications in various industries will not face headwinds. Hence, investments in the abovementioned stocks might provide good money making opportunities.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

119,AMD,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on May 10, after the market closes. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not the company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, the company has a stellar earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, pulling off an average positive earnings surprise of 40.8%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that NVIDIA is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.45%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter is pegged at $1.65, indicating a whopping rise of 94% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.91 billion, up 50% from the prior-year quarter. NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote What’s Behind This Overwhelming Expectation?The last few months have been turbulent for the company, thanks to the slew of disappointing news, like sluggish demand from cryptocurrency miners and Uber’s driverless vehicle test incident, which prompted NVIDIA to suspend test drives for all its driverless vehicles, dragging down its share price. However, we believe these to have had the least impact on the company's quarterly results.This is because Uber’s driverless-test mishap will lead to increased investment by vehicle makers to make driverless cars safer. Hence, demand for NVIDIA’s chips will remain unaffected, in our opinion. Notably, during the CES 2018, NVIDIA had stated that more than 320 companies, including Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Uber and Volkswagen, are working with it on developing self-driving technology. All these make us optimistic about the company’s automotive segment’s fiscal first-quarter performance.Moreover, sales generated from cryptocurrency miners contribute a meagre part to the company’s overall revenues, therefore, any slowdown in demand will be immaterial.The company’s gaming segment will likely be the largest contributor to its overall fiscal first-quarter revenues, and continue to witness growth. This segment is anticipated to have recorded year-over-year growth of 61.4%, and reach $1.66 billion in the quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Furthermore, the company’s data-center segment is projected to have maintained its massive growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter. Demand for NVIDIA’s data-center-focused products has escalated due to rise in data-center production, globally, and management has successfully marketed its solutions to compete with industry leaders like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). Per the consensus estimate, the segment is likely to soar 67.5% from the year-ago quarter level and reach $685 million in the fiscal first quarter.Furthermore, NVIDIA’s overall performance will likely have benefited from its growing strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. The company’s cutting-edge technology has helped it become the leading player in providing AI for applications to autonomous driving vehicles, outpacing other competitors, such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), in terms of growth.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

120,AMD,"Here’s a brief recap of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) earnings, questions concerning its manufacturing lead and its poaching away of Jim Keller from Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report).EarningsIntel’s first-quarter revenue of $16.07 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.03 billion by 6.7%. Revenue included around $462 million attributable to the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard, affecting the CCG and NSG segments. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 5.5% year over year and beat our estimate by 3.9%. Management expects around half the impact to be neutralized in the second half of the year.Intel’s diversification strategy is clearly playing out as the client business was contained at 51% of revenue, despite growing 3% on strength in notebooks, PCs and modems. The remaining 49% grew 25%, off the data centric products that Intel often sells in an integrated way but reports separately for clarity. And every part of that business (data center, IoT, memory, programmable) was up double digits with cloud adoption, communications buildouts and Intel’s product leadership being the biggest drivers.Intel’s opportunity lies in embracing the cloud computing, AI, IoT, autonomous driving automotive and 5G trends that will boost demand for compute, storage and networking hardware, and the company does appear to be delivering the goods. So today Intel is inside Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) test autonomous driving cars, and the Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) clouds.Intel’s per share earnings of $0.87 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.5%, driven mainly by operating leverage and a lower tax rate. The gross margin benefited from higher volumes and improving mix (customers preferred higher ASP products) as offset by higher costs related to still-low yields on 10nm. The company is on track to end the year at the 30% operating margin level it originally targeted for 2020.Looking forward to the rest of the year, Intel raised the revenue, operating margin, earnings and free cash flow guide by $2.5 billion, 1 point, 30 cents and $1.5 billion, respectively while lowering the tax rate a point.It was a classic beat and raise quarter but the push-out of 10nm volume production to sometime in 2019 likely increased investor uncertainty with a corresponding pressure on prices.Intel Losing Manufacturing Lead?This is the question on most investors’ minds as Intel delayed, yet again, the volume ramp of its 10nm chip while denying that there was anything at all wrong with the technology. As the company has explained and everyone already understands, it drives improved performance per watt at a higher node with successive generations of chips than the competition.So between 14nm and 14nm++, there has been a 70% improvement in performance and power putting its 10nm chips on par with 7 nm chips from its competitors. Plus the mature process has ensured high yields and stronger margins for Intel. So it has been good for both Intel and its partners.The part missing here is of course density, which can’t be improved without moving to a smaller node. However, since its manufacturing peers (foundries TSMC, Samsung, Globalfoundries) are on track to move to 7nm this year and next, Intel can no longer say that its manufacturing process is in the lead or even on par, meaning that it is in danger of falling behind in things like adding more features and driving costs further down for itself.Intel does have an answer to this, which kind of explains why it’s doing what it is. And why the journey along the learning curve to 10nm volumes can make sense for the company. This is what CEO Brian Krzanich says-“At 7 nanometers and beyond, we're really moving to a world where you're not going to look at any piece of silicon as being a single node. You're going to use what we're going to call heterogeneous techniques that allow us to use silicon for multiple nodes. So you may use cores from 7 nanometers and IP from 14 nanometers and even as far back as 22 nanometers for the parts that don't need the high performance. And we're able to put those together and make them perform and behave like a single piece of silicon in the package.”In other words, Intel is building/acquiring/collaborating with companies like rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) to bring different capabilities (CPU, GPU, memory, ASIC, programmable chips, etc.) into a highly sophisticated package so it works in unison.There are a number of reasons why this seems like a superior strategy-First, we are moving into an increasingly connected world, where a lot of functionality will be required in relatively small devices. Using discrete parts is going to take more space and work out to be more expensive for customers.Second, in case of autonomous driving cars, there’s going to be a huge amount of computing, communication, storage, retrieval and other processes going on in near real time to facilitate very quick decision making. Companies with discrete parts will have to collaborate to deliver the required functionality but Intel will be on top with its solutions.  Third, big cloud and data center players like Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) have increased investment in chip design that at times have felt like a threat to a company like Intel. But it could be only if Intel stuck to Moore’s law and didn’t improvise the way it’s doing now. Intel has been selling custom chips to big technology companies that its comprehensive strategy for the future could build on. So in essence, a custom package could include a design from any of these companies built to work with all the other Intel parts.If there was any chance of weakening demand, Intel would have been tightening capacity. But that’s not what it is doing at all. For example, here’s CFO Robert Swan telling us that “both yields and output in our Dalian factory continue to ramp ahead of schedule” and that “the transition to 64L 3D NAND is improving our cost while we invest in and expand our Dalian factory.”The only thing left is execution.Tesla Autopilot Head Joins IntelHere’s some more good news: Jim Keller is dropping the position of vice president of Autopilot and Low Voltage Hardware at Tesla to join Intel as its senior vice president leading the company’s silicon engineering operations. At Tesla, he was developing an AI chip for Autopilot.Keller has 20+ years of experience in chip design on both x86 and ARM technologies having helped AMD design its Athlon and Ryzen chips and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) design its A4 and A5 chips before that. He has experience on a wide range of platforms including PCs, servers, mobile devices and cars.""I had a great experience working at Tesla, learned a lot, and look forward to all the great technology coming from Tesla in the future. My lifelong passion has been developing the world's best silicon products,"" Keller said. ""The world will be a very different place in the next decade as a result of where computing is headed. I am excited to join the Intel team to build the future of CPUs, GPUs, accelerators and other products for the data-centric computing era."" RecommendationsIntel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

On the Nasdaq, advancers had an edge over decliners by 1.43 to -1 ratio. The CBOE VIX decreased 2.8% and closed at 15.49.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow decreased 0.3% with 9 of the 30-stocks in the index closing in the green while 20 traded in the red. During yesterday’s trading session, the blue-chip index was once down 1%, nearly touching its lowest close since April 2.Meanwhile, Fed’s two day policy meeting is in progress. Inflationary concerns and rising bond yields increased investor’s expectations that the central bank will raise interest rate very soon. This eventually led to the fall of the blue-chip index.The S&P 500 increased 0.3% led by 1.3% gain of the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). However, six out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. The index recorded 4 new 52-week highs and 19 new 52-week lows.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% as strong performance of technology stocks lifted this tech-heavy index. The index recorded 36 new 52-week highs and 72 new 52-week lows.Technology Sector Fueled Broad-based Rally The broader market rally was led by tech behemoth Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which was scheduled to report second quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings results after the market close on May 1. High expectations from investors lifted the stock price by 2.3%.Several other tech giants also put in strong showings. These include Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). Shares of those companies rose 1.6%, 2.2%, 1% and 2.3%, respectively.Trump Administration Extends Tariff Extension Period President Donald Trump has extended the exemption period for tariffs for top U.S. allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% tariff on aluminum were scheduled to be imposed on the above mentioned countries on May 1.The U.S. government has extended this date by one month to June 1. During this time, the trading partners can negotiate a new agreement to avoid the levies. Notably, in March, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China, Russia, Japan and others countries.Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s will visit China this week to negotiate for trade related disputes. Market will closely watch this high level trade negotiation.Economic Data The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that the U.S. manufacturing index for the month of April declined to 57.3 from a reading of 59.3 in March. The reading was also below the consensus estimate of 58.4.This was the lowest reading of ISM factory activity and represents the second month of declines. However, a reading of more than 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. Businesses have suffered on two fronts. First, higher input costs primarily due to imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum and second, shortages of skilled labor and a disruption in the supply chain.Moreover, the Department of Commerce reported that construction spending for the month of March plummeted 1.7%. The consensus estimate was for an acceleration of 0.4%. February data was revised to reflect an increase of 1% from the previously reported gain of 0.1%.Stock That Made HeadlineC.H.

127,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) opened more than 12% higher today after the company impressed investors with its latest quarterly earnings report on Wednesday afternoon, quelling fears that weaker demand from cryptocurrency miners and industry-wide cyclical trends would drag the trendy stock lower.For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, AMD reported adjusted earnings of 11 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. Total revenue came in at $1.65 billion, surpassing our consensus estimate by about $100 million and improving 40% year over year.AMD cited strong performance in its Computing and Graphics segment for the impressive quarter, with segment revenue of $1.12 billion marking growth of roughly 95% from the year-ago period. Operating income in the segment was $138 million, up from an operating loss of $21 million last year (also read: AMD Stock Surges on Earnings Beat, Strong Revenue Guidance).“The first quarter was an outstanding start to 2018 with 40 percent year-over-year revenue growth,” said CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “PC, gaming and datacenter adoption of our new, high-performance products continues to accelerate.  We are excited about our long-term roadmaps and focused on delivering sustained revenue growth and profitability.”AMD also said that it expects Q2 revenue to fall in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion, outpacing our most recent consensus estimate of $1.58 billion.Heading into the report, investors and analysts were concerned that weakness in the cryptocurrency market could lead to headwinds for AMD, which had benefitted from rising demand among digital coin miners that use its GPUs in high-end mining rigs.The company’s strong results and healthy guidance likely quashed those fears for many, but AMD remains a polarizing stock on Wall Street. Let’s take a closer look at what the market’s top analysts are saying in the wake of the report.Analysts ReactInterestingly enough, several major analysts took a cautious tone when reflecting on AMD’s report. For example, a team from Oppenheimer called the latest numbers a solid result but expressed concern that AMD will be able to compete against its rivals in the future.“Staring down more established competitors with larger R&D budgets, we believe high-end share gains against [Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) / Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report)] will prove challenging, keeping us sidelined here,” wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer in a note to clients.Oppenheimer currently gives AMD a “Perform” rating, and although the company did not necessarily cite issues in these areas, the firm believes that cryptocurrency mining and slower server market share gains are still risks.Similarly, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a “Market Perform” rating and $13 price target for AMD on Thursday morning. Rasgon argued that one of the keys to AMD’s report was its full-year gross margin guidance, which gained 1% and now sits above 37%. The analyst said that higher margin guidance and product traction could mean that AMD has reached an inflection point.“While the company appears to be suggesting that crypto is a relatively minor contributor to revenues, as well as guiding for a ‘soft landing’ (with Ryzen/EPYC ramps more than offsetting declines), there may still be a bit of risk if their estimate of exposure (which at several hundred million dollars feels a little light) is wrong,” Rasgon wrote.KeyBanc Capital Markets was another firm with a lukewarm reaction to AMD’s earnings report, maintaining its “Sector Weight” rating for the chip maker today. The firm mentioned that blockchain accounted for an estimated 10% of revenue in the quarter and acknowledged that strong Ryzen and semi-custom sales successfully offset slightly weaker mining demand.Led by analysts Michael McConnell and James Wang, KeyBanc suggested that “evidence of EPYC server processor design win traction will be required” for AMD to outperform the sector going forward.Still, despite this cautious tone, KeyBanc said that AMD’s strong guidance prompted higher estimates, which should become a trend soon. AMD is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but as earnings estimate revisions start to pour in, that ranking could change soon.Want more market analysis from this author?

128,AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) reported non-GAAP earnings of 11 cents per share for first-quarter 2018 compared with break-even reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents per share.Revenues increased 40% year over year to $1.65 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion.The accelerated adoption of the company’s products in the PC, gaming and data center industries primarily led to its impressive performance.SegmentsAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments — Computing and Graphics (focused on the traditional PC market) and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities).Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics segment revenues witnessed year-over-year increase of 95% to $1.12 billion. The increase can be attributed to accelerated sales of Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors.Operating income for this segment was $138 million against a loss of $21 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher revenues.Notably, the introduction of Ryzen desktop accelerated processing unit (APU) with a combination of Radeon “Vega” graphics architecture and “Zen” CPU cores is a huge positive for the company. Additionally, Advanced Micro launched its “2nd Generation Ryzen desktop CPUs”, which can enhance gaming performance by around 15%.Advanced Micro and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) announced a collaboration for providing support to Radeon FreeSync technology in Microsoft’s Xbox One S and Xbox One X consoles.Prominent PC providers such as Acer, HP (HPQ  -  Free Report) and Lenovo, which are part of Advanced Micro’s client base, recorded impressive sales during the quarter, which is encouraging. The release of Dell’s new notebooks and 2-in-1s earlier this month is a tailwind for the company.Management also stated that Dell, HP and Lenovo are planning to launch commercial notebooks powered by Advanced Micro.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomSegment revenues amounted to $532 million, down 12% year over year due to lower semi-custom revenues.Operating income for the segment was $14 million compared with $55 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The figure was higher in the year-ago quarter due to a licensing gain in the said time frame.The adoption of AMD EPYC processor-powered platforms continue to grow. During the quarter, Dell EMC launched “three new PowerEdge platforms powered by AMD EPYC 7000 series server processors.”Yahoo Japan Corporation and Packet were added to its list of clients. Additionally, Cray (CRAY  -  Free Report) announced the addition of “EPYC processors to its Cray CS500 line of HPC offerings.”Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

129,AMD,"With industry rivals AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) posting their latest financial results on Wednesday afternoon, investor attention will now shift to semiconductor titan Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and its first quarter fiscal 2018 report after the closing bell today. Concern that the strong run of the chip market could be nearing its cyclical end has lingered above the industry’s top players ahead of earnings season, but results and guidance have been decent so far.  AMD topped expectations on the top and bottom line while calling for Q2 revenues to fall well ahead of previous estimates. Meanwhile, Qualcomm posted its own double beat and guided for net sales to improve by up to 4% in the current quarter.So what should investors expect from Intel when it reports this afternoon? Well, the latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Intel to report adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share and total revenue of $15.05 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 7.6% and 1.7%, respectively. Of course, this is only part of the picture, and we can turn to our exclusive Zacks Consensus Non-Financial Metrics Estimates to better prepare for the report. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts. Intel operates through a number of key business segments, and investors will likely want to know exactly how the company is doing in each of these. The largest of Intel’s individual units is its Client Computing Group, which brings under one roof its platform products for notebooks, 2-in-1s, ultrabooks, desktops, tablets and phones. Based on our latest consensus NFM estimates, we expect Intel to report total Client Computing Group revenues of $7.83 billion. This result would represent year-over-year growth of 5.9%. Intel actually reported a slight decrease in revenue for this unit last quarter, so growth of nearly 6% would certainly be welcomed by investors. Intel’s next largest segment is its Data Center Group. This unit deals with servers, workstations, and other products for data center and cloud computing environments. Our consensus estimates are calling for Intel to post Data Center revenues of $4.82 billion, which would mark growth of more than 13.9% from the year-ago period. Finally, the company’s third biggest unit in terms of revenue generation has historically been its Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. According to our consensus estimates, analysts expect Intel to report segment revenues of $925 million in this unit, up modestly from about $866 million last year. Investors should note that Intel’s Internet of Things Group has also been a rapid grower and might surpass the NVMS Group soon. It is important to properly prepare for, and subsequently digest, massive earnings reports like that of Intel. As one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, Intel has its hands in nearly every corner of the chip market, and its segment results might help us understand what is hot and what is not in the industry. Want more market analysis from this author?

131,AMD,"The Q1 earnings cycle is in full swing, with a number of tech companies, including Facebook and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), slated to report their quarterly numbers this week.According to the Earnings Preview dated Apr 20, technology, along with the finance sector, will bring in more than 40% of the S&P 500 index’s total earnings this year. Per the report, Q1 total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 20.9% on 11.5% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from the rising demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.The sector is also poised to benefit from President Trump’s pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure. Furthermore, Gartner’s latest prediction on IT spending bodes well for the sector. The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to increase 6.2% year over year to $3.74 trillion this year, breaking the earlier highest ever mark of $3.71 trillion in 2014.Not All Companies Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all firms in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment, as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company might perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that the chance of beating earnings estimates is high when a stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s see what’s in store for these four tech stocks, all of which are expected to release quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), a broad-based technology provider, is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company is likely to beat estimates as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.90%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s revenues is pegged at $25.71 billion, representing a 9.1% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 85 cents, reflecting an increase of 16.4% from the year-ago reported figure.The company’s Azure Cloud Platform is expected to have majorly contributed to its growth. In the last few years, Microsoft has strengthened its position in the public cloud-service space through acquisitions and data-center expansions. Notably, revenues from Azure were up a whopping 98% in the fiscal second quarter, on a constant-currency basis. This trend is likely to have continued into the to-be-reported quarter as well. Additionally, strong adoption of Office 365 and Windows 10 is anticipated to have driven the fiscal third-quarter revenues. (Read more: Microsoft's Q3 Earnings to Benefit from Azure Growth)The world’s largest semiconductor company, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results. The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.74%.Intel’s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum, as investors have become increasingly concerned with this chipmaker’s competition. Of late, the company has been sensing pressure from the likes of NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Avanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report). Nvidia’s AI processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment.However, we anticipate the company’s impressive growth at the data-center group segment to have cushioned its top- and bottom-line performance in the quarter. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment’s growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices increases, along with the rise of AI and cloud computing, Intel’s data-center business will expand. (Read: Intel to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Intel’s revenues is pegged at $15.05 billion, representing a 1.7% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 71 cents, reflecting an increase of 7.6% from the year-ago actual figure.VeriSign, Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results. The company is likely to beat estimates as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.83%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VeriSign’s revenues is pegged at $298 million, representing 3.3% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.06, indicating rise of 10.4% from the year-ago reported figure.VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Per the company’s agreement with ICANN, the annual fee for a .net domain name registration has been increased from $8.20 to $9.02, effective Feb 1, 2018. We believe increasing domain-name registration, along with price hikes for domain names, to have bolstered revenues in the quarter. (Read more: What's in the Cards for VeriSign in Q1 Earnings?)Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 4 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.58%. However, the company’s top and bottom lines are anticipated to record significant year-over-year improvement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VeriSign’s revenues is pegged at $640.6 million, representing a 10.2% year-over-year gain. The consensus estimate for earnings is 69 cents, indicating 23.2% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Maxim’s well-diversified product portfolio is helping the company perform well in all its end markets, especially in the automotive and industrial sectors. Moreover, it is aiding the company to win clients and expand globally. However, weakness in the smartphone market and high dependence on Samsung poses significant threat to the company’s revenues from the consumer end market.

132,AMD,"Investors in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report)  need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 27th 2018 $8.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, the current quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate has seen one upward versus no downward revision. The net effect has taken the Zacks Consensus Estimate from 8 cents to 9 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

133,AMD,"The next few weeks are crucial for the semiconductor industry as major chipmakers are slated to report their financial results. The start of the period has been disappointing though, with leading Austrian chipmaker, AMS AG, issuing a weak operating margin projection.Additionally, last week, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) posted lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings and gave a weak guidance for the second quarter. However, all is not lost for semiconductor industry as some of its major sub-industries’ earnings growth projection for the current year are above the broader S&P 500.So it could be an excellent idea to invest in semiconductor stocks that are likely to outperform their respective earnings and revenues estimates.Strong Y-o-Y Semiconductor Sales Growth Boost HopeAMS has announced that its fiscal second quarter sales will decline by $220-$250 million, while its operating margin will come in at a negative 20-25%. Additionally, Taiwan Semi projected revenues between $7.8 billion and $7.9 billion for the second quarter, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.51 billion. (Read More: Taiwan Semi Q1 Earnings Lag Estimates, Revenues Up Y/Y)On the positive side, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), global semiconductor sales were $36.8 billion in the month of February, up 21% year over year. President and CEO of SIA, John Neuffer said the global semiconductor market has witnessed “substantial and consistent growth in February,” after posting year-over-year sales increases for 19 straight months.The major contributor to this strong year-over-year sales growth in February was the Americas, which witnessed a year-over-year increase of 37.7% to $8.26 billion in February. Given below are the other key contributors:Yearly Sales Growth  MarketFebruary 2017 (Billion $)February 2018 (Billion $)% ChangeEurope2.823.4321.7%Japan2.753.1815.5%China10.0511.7016.4%Asia Pacific/All Other8.7710.1916.2%Earnings Growth Prospects Remain UpbeatThe tech sector’s earnings performance has been strong over the last many quarters and is expected to maintain this momentum even in this earnings season.

134,AMD,"The Q1 earnings cycle is in full swing, with a number of semiconductor companies slated to report their quarterly numbers over the next few days. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the Earnings Preview dated Apr 20, technology, along with the finance sector, will bring in more than 40% of the S&P 500 index’s total earnings this year. Per the report, Q1 total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 20.9% on 11.5% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer for the past year. This sector has been benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned emerging trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter the loss of business due to the declining PC market which still consumes bulk of chips. Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017.It is expected that the semiconductor industry will continue to record growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a decent rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, representing growth of 7.7%.The industry is poised to benefit from the rising demand driven by the aforementioned trends in technologies, deployment push of 5G-broadband technology across the globe and President Trump’s pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment, as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s see what’s in store for these semiconductor stocks, all of which are expected to release quarterly figures tomorrow.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues is pegged at 9 cents and $1.55 billion, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a loss per share of 4 cents and revenues of $984 million. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.96%.Increasing adoption of AI techniques and machine-learning tools in industries like gaming, automotive and blockchain is primarily responsible for spurring GPU demand. The company continues to benefit from the robust performance of its product portfolio, comprising Ryzen CPU, EPYC and Radeon Vega GPUs.Additionally, collaborations with the likes of Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Tencent, Microsoft and JD.com are other positives for the company. (Read more: Advanced Micro Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards?)Another semiconductor company, Cavium, Inc. , is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results. The company offers software compatible processors that enable functionality in data-center applications, and network connectivity for server and switches. It should be noted that the company has entered into a definitive agreement to get acquired by Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL).The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +6.04%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 75 cents, indicating a 29.3% year-over-year increase. Revenues are estimated to be around $260 million, reflecting a 13.3% increase from the year-earlier quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s take a sneak peek at Xilinx, Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) which is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 figures. The rising demand for Xilinx’s high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices will likely prove beneficial for the company’s top line. We believe Xilinx is well positioned to tap the opportunities stemming from growth in adoption of AI technologies, 5G connectivity, autonomous vehicles and IoTs.Also, Xilinx’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel. Read more: Is a Beat in the Cards for Xilinx in Q4 Earnings?)The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 66 cents, indicating a 15.8% increase on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to be around $649.5 million, reflecting a 6.6% rise from the year-ago quarter.Lastly, Silicon Laboratories Inc. (SLAB  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter numbers. The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents for the first quarter depicts 20.6% growth from the prior-year quarter. The Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $199.7 million for the quarter under review, up 11.5% from first-quarter 2017.Analysts covering the stock believe the company will benefit from increasing demand for its IoT products across the automotive, industrial and consumer end markets. Nevertheless, stiff competition from NXP Semiconductors and Texas Instruments is a major headwind.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

135,AMD,"Tech stocks have been feeling the heat for quite a while now with all major players taking a beating. The latest prediction by Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) that iPhone sales will soften in the June quarter has further taken its toll on tech stocks. Last week, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM  -  Free Report) came up with a weak financial outlook, which also had a domino effect on the entire technology sector, especially on semiconductor stocks.Moreover, fears of a trade war with China, which undoubtedly will affect the tech companies the most, saw tech stocks plummeting. Tech stocks have been suffering since the beginning of March with Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) leading the rout after it was accused of a data breach. Worries further escalated after President Donald Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) to bash Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) about its business policies.However, tech stocks literally drove the markets in 2017 and also this year till February. Also, there’s high optimism around an exceptional earnings season from tech stocks. Moreover, the fundamentals which powered the ascent of tech stocks remain firmly in place. This is why it makes good sense to buy sector plays on the dip ahead of their next rebound.Low iPhone Sales Prediction, TSM’s Weak Outlook Add to WorriesTech stocks have been bleeding for quite some time now. Shares of all major tech companies have taken a hit over the last one-and-a-half month. And if this wasn’t enough Morgan Stanley last week predicted that iPhone sales will soften in the June quarter. This saw not only shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) trending down but other tech giants suffering too. Apple’s shares have declines 7.4% in the last five days.The week sales projection of iPhone follows a bleak financial outlook provided by Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. The company stated that its second-quarter 2018 revenues are likely to fall in the range of $7.8-$7.9 billion, lagging the consensus estimate of $8.5 billion. Consequently, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor declined 5.6%.The weak outlook took a toll on the entire tech sector, especially on the semiconductor stocks such as Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). Given that Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest chipset supplier to both Apple and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), shares of these too companies plummeted.Facebook, Amazon, Trade Fears Hit Tech StocksDespite having a brilliant run in 2017 and early this year, tech stocks started feeling the heat since the beginning of March. The initial fears were sparked after Trump announced tariffs on a wide range of products imported from China. This spread panic among investors which further escalated once China imposed retaliatory tariffs, igniting fears of a trade war. The tech sector will be one of the worst victims if a trade war happens. This dented the confidence of investors with shares of most tech companies sliding.Moreover, Facebook, which got embroiled in a data misuse scandal that affected the personal data of more than 80 million users, did its share of damage to the tech stocks. Facebook, which was one of the best performing tech stocks last year saw it market capitalization erase by $100 billion in just a week. Facebook’s data misuse scandal made the entire sector suffer on fears of a regulatory clampdown.And to add to the woes followed Trump’s series of tweets bashing Amazon for its tax treatment. Trump has time and again lashed out at Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos saying that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is losing billions of dollars every year by charging the likes of Amazon and others a pittance to deliver their packages. This once again saw the company’s shares suffering a blow.Our ChoicesGiven the bad phase for the tech stocks, investor concerns are only natural. However, this sector has been driving the markets this year and was one of the significant beneficiaries of a roaring rally last year.Moreover, trade war fears too somewhat seem to have eased for the time being. Also, the earning season is off to a strong start and there is huge optimism around tech stocks putting up a stellar show this time around like the last many.Given this scenario, it will not be too ambitious to expect a rebound in the near term. It does make sense now to buy value stocks from the technology space that could prove to be lucrative finds, going forward.

141,AMD,"Bitcoin plunged more than 6% on Apr 9, falling below the $7,000 mark. Such a dip has been attributed to selling and fears related to tax-filing even as the deadline to file taxes is fast approaching. Also, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a decline of more than 27% in the last one-month period.Bitcoin started off 2018, trading above $14,000 only to tank more than 52% to its current levels. In fact, according to Coinmarketcap, the virtual currency market as a whole has given up more than 50% of its market capitalization since the beginning of 2018.Further, Ethereum dipped to $391 to end the session on Monday after trading at $429.25 for most of the session. The virtual coin is battling hard to move above the $400 level since Monday. Markets for all major cryptocurrencies have tanked of late. Analysts believe that sell-offs related to tax-filing and SEC’s crackdown on digital currencies have pushed the entire cryptocurrency market lower.Throughout 2017, graphics processing unit (GPU) makers capitalized on demand created by an acute paucity of high-end graphic cards and the need for GPUs to mine faster. However, the tables have now turned and the recent weakness in the crypto market is reflecting on shares of such companies. So have cryptos lost their sheen? Let’s have a look.Cryptocurrencies Fizzle Due to Tax-Filing WoesHead of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Thomas Lee stated in a report on Apr 5 that households in the United States owe approximately $25 billion in capital gains taxes on their holdings of different virtual currencies. This is expected to result in massive selling of various cryptocurrencies and in turn a huge influx of U.S. dollars. All of this is expected to happen before the Apr 17 tax-filing deadline.Bitcoin, in particular, has declined more than 50% in the first quarter of 2018 and analysts blame it on “regulatory uncertainty.” The report also stated that on average investors realized a massive $1.04 trillion in capital gains from cryptcurrencies as well as stocks in 2017. This has been the most in terms of amount since investors gained about $924 million in 2007.Analysts have also estimated that despite the recent dip in cryptocurency prices, investors in the United States may still have tax obligations on capital gains. This is becasue of the huge gains in 2017 on the back of a stupendous cryptocurrency rally.Are Cryptos Set for a Decline?The going has been tough for the cryptocurrency market in the recent times. The plunge and the associated volatility have been attributed to a number of factors such as China’s ban on Bitcoin trade, even as a number of other countries have tightened regulations. These have affected not only Bitcoin but also other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and many more.The situation worsened after the world’s two largest online ad companies — Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) — announced that cryptocurrency ads were banned on their platforms.How a Crypto Revolution Sparked GPU Demand?The cryptocurrency boom had created an acute shortage of high-end graphics cards. Such an event led to financial windfalls for GPU makers such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report). Moreover, mining virtual coins require a huge amount of computing capability, which only GPUs can provide. This is what actually boosted revenues of GPU makers.As a matter of fact, NVDA reported revenues of $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily on the back of high demand for GPUs and other mining-related revenues, which increased steadily in the last quarter of 2017. Similarly, AMD reported stupendous earnings in the last three months of 2017, rising high on increased demand for GPUs.However, manufacturers of semiconductor products, memory solutions, including manufacturing memory chips used in the mining rigs as well as advanced hardware to smoothly run parallel processing have faced pressure from the decline of the cryptocurrency market. Such companies include the likes of Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.GPU Demand to Suffer as Cryptocurrencies Plunge?The recent weakness in this market also points to the fact that cryptocurrency mining demand has declined of late. This negatively impacts the GPU market. Also, the recent volatility in Ethereum has also weighed on the prospects of GPU, CPU and chip makers. Companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia that make chips and power cryptocurrency mining have felt the pressure emanating from such weaknesses.Further, over-dependence of GPU makers on cryptocurrency-powered demand leads to increased susceptibility to a complete crash when miners become wary of low returns amid rising prices of electric power.Many analysts have issued warnings regarding virtual coins. SEC is wary about its extreme price volatility in cryptocurrencies and liquidity in bitcoin-related funds. Several central banks have issued warnings against it.China had also put an embargo on all domestic cryptocurrency exchanges from dealing with the renminbi last year. The Chinese government also clamped down on initial coin offerings (ICO). This year, China plans to carry out of rectifications in crypto regulations.The Reserve Bank of Australia sees it as ""speculative mania"" and finds bitcoin more popular in the illegal economy, not among consumers. The governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand called it a ""classic case"" of a bubble.However, Cboe Global Markets, the first to bring about bitcoin futures, wants the SEC to permit cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. After this, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that it is mulling over a rule change that would allow bitcoin ETFs to be listed on exchanges.To ConcludeGoing by the recent trends, it would not be wrong to say that the digital currency market would fizzle out soon. Moreover, the rally that the space witnessed in 2017 was rather sentimental and thus momentary. In fact, the gains enjoyed last year might be one of the reasons why cryptocurrencies could witness steep declines in the near future.Also, crackdowns by various governments across the globe have made it virtually impossible for digital coins to be traded legally. Moreover, with rising costs associated to mining at a time when cryptocurrency prices have steeply fallen, virtual coins are increasingly losing their sheen. Such a decline cannot be called a correction and a rebound in prices is not likely anytime soon.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

142,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) sunk 1.6% on Wednesday, marking the continuation of a potentially alarming trend as investors assess just how much of AMD’s recent success was based on the cryptocurrency boom.Before Wednesday’s dip, AMD had seen its stock price tumble nearly 15% over the last month. This alone shouldn’t scare many investors as AMD’s decline coincides with a major market-wide selloff that took substantial chunks out of giants such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report). With that said, AMD might have a more serious, long-term problem on its hands.Cryptocurrency Dilemma The semiconductor firm became a fan favorite for cryptocurrency miners, who often preferred AMD’s GPUs to its competitors like Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report). Therefore, as cryptocurrencies became hugely popular demand for AMD’s powerful GPUs surged. In the near-term, this caused prices to climb due to a relative shortage of crypto-grade chips.The insanely quick demand for cryptocurrencies helped lift AMD and other chipmakers. However, the cryptocurrency market’s meteoric rise was nearly matched by its quick descent.AMD noted in its most recent 10-K SEC filing that reduced crypto-related demand for its GPUs could negatively impact the company. “The cryptocurrency market is unstable and demand could change quickly,” AMD wrote in an SEC filing.“For example, China and South Korea have recently instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading. If we are unable to manage the risks related to a decrease in the demand for cryptocurrency mining, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected.”Looking Ahead As investors can see, AMD’s stock price is down more than 20% over the last year, performing far worse than its industry’s average. However, the company also operates in the PC and gaming industry and had been successful prior to the rise of cryptocurrencies.In fact, CNBC’s Jim Cramer recently said of AMD that: “Straight down because of bitcoin? Straight down? I don't buy that. I think under $10 you want to pick up some AMD.” The company’s stock price currently rests at around $9.80 per share.Furthermore, our Current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for AMD’s quarterly revenues to soar by 57.6% to hit $1.55 billion. The company’s adjusted earnings are also projected to skyrocket 300% and reach $0.08 per share, after posting a loss in the year-ago period. Bottom Line The company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. But it seems like AMD might remain a wait-and-see stock for now. Luckily, investors have a few weeks to get a better feel for AMD before it posts its first quarter financial results.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

143,AMD,"Stocks can move heavenward or fall back to earth based on the latest rumors doing the rounds. Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) stock did a little back-to-earth movement last week after Bloomberg said it could lose a key customer. Here are the details-Will Apple Dump Intel?Intel shares plunged in response to a rumor that Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) was planning to replace Intel chips with its own ARM-based A-series chips code-named Kalamata as early as in 2020. The rumor came from Bloomberg this time, so investors reacted strongly.There appear to be good reasons for Apple to do so-First, according to data provided by IDC, Apple’s PC market share has grown to 8.2% in 4Q17 from 7.7% in 4Q16. Apple and HP were the only major vendors that saw meaningful growth in the fourth quarter. Apple could be looking to increase internal efficiencies by streamlining the entire manufacturing process, driving further margin improvements while improving customer satisfaction.Second, Apple is the only one among existing PC makers with the financial and other resources to develop its own chips. It has gradually built its internal production capabilities to move away from chip makers, the latest split being with Imagination Technologies.Third, Apple has a history of doing this with its iOS devices and the results have been positive for the company.Fourth, while PCs remain its largest revenue contributor, Intel is in the process of transitioning into a data-focused company. This may take several years, but in the meantime, it is broadly expected to adopt new manufacturing processes in its server production lines first.  Fifth, analysts agree that Intel’s process lead on Taiwan Semiconductor is practically negligible at this point, i.e., TSM’s first chips on its 7nm process are expected to be comparable with the first chips from Intel’s 10nm one.But Intel investors shouldn’t be overly concerned.First, Apple accounts for 4-5% of Intel’s revenue, so a total loss of Apple’s business would have a relatively small impact on Intel. Particularly so because Apple is expected to continue buying baseband chips from Intel, at least in the foreseeable future, so even if the processor business moves away, the baseband business will remain.Second, Apple is in a huge fight with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), so it’s banking on its relationship with Intel as the alternative source. This offers Intel some leverage.Third, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm are working onWindows 10 laptops powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processors and investors might be concerned that Apple going its own way perpetuates the ARM invasion on Intel. But note that that this doesn’t mean a total move away from Intel silicon. What it probably means is that there will be different versions of devices on the market. As Intel continues to launch new chips that are more powerful and energy efficient, its continued strength at the higher end appears assured, at least for now.    New Chips from ChipzillaContinued delays in its 10nm process have been a disappointment for Intel bulls, but the company has filled the gap with new chips every year that also included performance and power improvements on the mature 14nm, 14nm+ and 14nm++ processes.The latest in this lineup, dubbed the 'Coffee Lake' H series and U series were announced last week, along with the H370, H310, Q370 and B360 chipsets. It has also integrated its Optane memory with the new chipsets (except the H310) to support hard drive speeds that can match SSDs in some cases.Intel’s goal is very apparently to bring the very best performance to laptops no matter the size, purpose or price point. This will also see it competing better with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) on the low end.To that end, it has increased the number of cores in the new processors to four or six, in some cases doubling them, also increasing the number of threads to maximize performance. The Coffee Lake H series chips for instance bring 6 core processors to laptops for the first time (Core i7, Core i9, and Xeon models). The Coffee Lake U series on the other hand upgrade the Kaby Lake U series with improved graphics and power efficiency while doubling the embedded memory among other things to boost speeds.The Wind River SaleIn keeping with its goal of becoming a data centric company, Intel is trimming its operations where required. So the embedded software business it acquired back in 2009 for $884 million is now moving to private investor TPG Capital for an undisclosed sum. TPG also bought its McAfee security business last year for $4.2 billion. Intel shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

146,AMD,"Amid another brutal morning of trading for the newly-volatile tech sector, investors are focusing on the latest slump in shares of AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) after reports suggested that a decline in cryptocurrency mining demand could be negatively impacting the GPU market.According to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, falling Ethereum prices are starting to suck the life out of GPU demand. The popular digital coin dipped to nearly $370 last week after peaking at about $1,300 earlier this year.The entire cryptocurrency market has suffered from profit taking and increased regulatory pressure over the past few months, but volatility in Ethereum could be having a unique effect on GPU makers like AMD and Nvidia. The mining community for this coin, which remains the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of total market capitalization, continues to rely on these high-powered processors while miners of other digital assets and tokens have moved to more-expensive, purpose-built machines.And with prices at their current levels, the economics of mining Ethereum are starting to make less sense given the overhead costs associated with running these rigs—including device maintenance and electricity.Moore and Morgan Stanley see the lack of incentive to mine having an effect on the prices of GPUs. The top crypto-mining cards from AMD and Nvidia were once difficult to get one’s hands on, but now prices are starting to slump. According to Morgan Stanley, the cost of AMD’s Radeon 580 is down from $530 to $399 on Amazon, and the price of Nvidia’s GeForce 1060/6GB is down from $500 to $399.Moore did mention that the impact of sluggish cryptocurrency demand is likely to have a bigger impact on AMD’s business. The company recently said its revenue exposure to the crypto market was in the mid-single digits last year, and Morgan Stanley’s latest note estimates that this exposure climbed to about 10% in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, Moore said that Nvidia’s products witness lower hash rates and should therefore cause the company to have significantly lower exposure to the mining industry. Nvidia’s management has also been hesitant to consider cryptocurrencies a driving force behind its growth.“While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter. That said, our main focus remains on our core gaming market, as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile,” said Nvidia CFO Colette Kress in the company’s latest earnings conference call.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang doubled down on this sentiment, adding that his management team’s outlook models crypto “approximately flat.”Nevertheless, shares of Nvidia were down as much as 4% in morning trading Monday following Morgan Stanley’s note. AMD shares were down just over 3% in early hours.Want more market analysis from this author?

147,AMD,"On the first day of the “2018 Game Developers Conference,” NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) unveiled its ray tracing technology called NVIDIA RTX aimed at assisting game developers and content creators in incorporating a realistic rendering technique.Notably, through ray tracing technology, an image is generated by tracking back the light from a camera to the objects in the picture, thereby generating a natural effect. The technology has been widely used in movies, but due to certain challenges like “fast frame rates and low latency,”  it appeared to be too arduous for interactive real time games. NVIDIA’s Volta GPUs currently support the technology. The company has also partnered Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) for making the technology available through the latter’s DirectX Raytracing (DXR) API. Hence, Windows users will have easy access to the technology.Gaming companies like 4A Games, Epic Games and Remedy Entertainment are already conducting trials for NVIDIA RTX. The company also announced the availability of a “ray-tracing denoiser module” in the upcoming models of NVIDIA GameWork SDK, which will enable developers to form further life-like graphics with adequate shadowing and lighting.NVIDIA Corporation Price NVIDIA Corporation Price | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Other Players in the DomainApart from Microsoft’s DXR technology, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) is also a key player in the field of real-time ray tracing technology.AMD’s ray tracing SDK Radeon Rays, formerly known as AMD FireRays, is compatible with Windows, Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) macOS, and Linux operating systems. The company also recently unveiled an updated version of its ProRender software that is capable of ray tracing.Gaming Industry BoomIn a recent article, PCGamesN.com quoted Digi-Capital that stated that the gaming industry is anticipated to reach $230 billion by 2022 with PC Gaming emerging as one of the strongest segments.We believe that with the ongoing initiatives taken up by NVIDIA , the company is well poised to make the most of the growth opportunity and maintain its leading position in the gaming GPU market. This in turn will positively impact the company’s top line.NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

148,AMD,"Shares of Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) surged more than 2% to hit a new all-time intraday trading high on Monday. This is clearly good news for investors, but what exactly caused today’s gains? Let’s take a closer look.Movie Bump?Analysts at Jefferies think that Steven Spielberg’s upcoming futuristic action blockbuster Ready Player One has the potential to boost the stock price of companies like Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD  -  Free Report).Analysts claim that the premise of Spielberg’s latest film, which features a world where humans spend a large amount of their time living through virtual reality-based avatars, will lift sales of the company’s high-performance chips, known as graphics processing units (GPUs).“We believe that the movie will drive sales of VR headsets that require high-performance GPUs from NVDA and AMD,” analysts wrote.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis currently has a buy rating for Nvidia and sees its shares surging to $300 over the next year. This climb would mark more than a 20% jump from Friday’s closing price of $245.33 per share.“A lot of the demand for increased compute cycles is becoming parallel in nature, like neural networking, gaming, virtual reality and blockchain/cryptocurrency mining,"" he added.For many investors and consumers, virtual reality seems far off, but the technology has come a long way in a relatively short period of time. Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) Oculus headsets and Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) PlayStation VR both currently offer affordable virtual-reality tech, and a slew of other companies have joined the market recently.Ready Player One, which is geared towards kids, is set to be released on March 29. With that said, let’s take a look at a few more of Nvidia’s current fundamentals to help gauge whether or not the stock looks poised to continue its current hot streak.More Fundamentals  Nvidia reported record full-year revenues of $9.71 billion last month, which marked a 41% jump from the year-ago period. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are now calling for the computer chip giant’s first quarter fiscal 2019 sales to soar 50%. Nvidia’s bottom line is also expected to surge over 76% to hit $1.50 per share.Looking at the company’s current full year, Nvidia is projected to see both its top and bottom line jump by over 28%. Investors might also be happy to note that the company has beat or matched earnings estimates in 11 straight quarters. This includes posting an average earnings surprise of nearly 41% in the trailing four periods.Nvidia has also recently earned a large number of estimate revisions for its current quarter, next quarter, current year, and following year earnings, with 100% agreement to the upside.The company is also currently trading at 39.43x forward earnings. This might seem like a rather high figure for some value investors, but Nvidia’s median P/E was roughly 47.5 over the last two quarters. Investors have clearly been willing to pay a premium for Nvidia stock recently. But investors should also note that at its current P/E, Nvidia is relatively cheap compared to where it has been recently.On top of all of this, Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

149,AMD,"Investors in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 9th 2018 $10.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Bottom 11% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, eight analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 2 cents per share to 8 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

151,AMD,"After starting the day relatively flat, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) suddenly popped more than 8% in morning trading Wednesday. The sudden spike seems to be linked to an unsubstantiated rumor that the trendy chipmaker could be the subject of a takeover.Details about this supposed takeover chatter are sparse. Investors throughout the financial social media space seem to be crediting the rumor for today’s bounce, but no specifics have emerged yet. The chatter has garnered very little coverage from established media sources, although Seeking Alpha editor Clark Schultz said that the talks have started to “circulate around trading desks.”This is not the first time that AMD has been the subject of rumors based on thin evidence. A few months ago, a report suggesting that the company was working with Tesla (TSLA) on AI processors for self-driving vehicles led some to speculate that Elon Musk’s electric car giant could be interested in the semiconductor brand. However, confirmation that the two companies were even working together never came (also read: Investors Bullish on AMD's AI Partnership with Tesla).But unsubstantiated rumors are not the only reason to be optimistic about AMD on Wednesday. In a more verifiable report, DigiTimes said that Taipei-based motherboard manufacturer ASRock is planning to introduce a graphics card product using AMD Radeon-based chips as early as April.Meanwhile, even more rumors and leaks could be fueling AMD’s bullish surge today. On a South Korean tech forum, a user published leaked benchmarks for what could be a second-generation AMD Ryzen processor. The reported CPU speeds were impressive, and considering that the Ryzen brand is AMD’s strongest challenge to rival Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), a new high-end processor on the way soon is probably good news for investors.AMD is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), as well as an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s full-year earnings has moved four cents higher over the past 60 days, and we now expect AMD to witness EPS growth of nearly 124% this fiscal year.

152,AMD,"The fortunes of server vendors have returned it seems, as worldwide server revenues and shipments marked the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, that too after five straight quarters of decline, per International Data Corporation (“IDC”).According to the data compiled by the research firm, worldwide server revenues jumped a whopping 26.4% year over year to $20.7 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, while overall shipment grew 10.8% to 2.84 million units.IDC noted growth at every segment with revenues of volume servers rising 21.9% year over year to $15.8 billion, while the mid-range server registered growth of 48.5% to $1.9 billion. Also, high-end system revenues reached $2.9 billion, indicating rise of 41.1%, mainly benefiting from the launch of International Business Machines’ (IBM  -  Free Report) z14 in third-quarter 2017.Also, x86 servers retained the growth momentum during the quarter. IDC figured out a 24.7% year-over-year rise in x86 server revenues, reaching $17.5 billion, while revenues from non-x86 servers witnessed an increase of 36.4% to $3.2 billion.Hyperscalers Fuel Maximum GrowthPer IDC, this upsurge in the fourth quarter has been driven by strong demand from hyperscale data-center service providers which made a huge push in server deployment. According to the firm, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) continued their server deployment efforts to grab market share in the cloud service space.The second major reason outlined by IDC was the availability of Intel's (INTC  -  Free Report) Purley processors, and Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) EPYC processors. It should be noted that hyperscale data-center service providers have waited a long time for these processors.Dell Narrowed Market-Share Gap With HPEWith respect to individual server manufacturers, on the revenue market-share front, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) and Dell jointly secured the first spot. IDC calls it a statistical tie when the difference among vendors is 1% or less. Therefore, if we look at the actual revenues, then HPE holds the first position with 18.4%, while Dell has the second position with 17.5%.During the fourth quarter, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the market-share difference with HPE, as the company “continues to capitalize on expanded opportunities from its merger with EMC”, per IDC.Moreover, HPE is now focusing on the enterprise market and moving away from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. However, its loss helped Dell grab market share in the hyperscale segment.Moving ahead, IBM has secured the third position, with a market share of 13%. Notably, the company reported a massive 50.3% jump in server revenues backed by solid demand for its recently-launched z14 processors.The fourth position is a tie between Lenovo and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report). If we look at the actual revenues, then Lenovo holds the fourth position with 5.3%, while Cisco has the fifth position with 5.1%.Furthermore, IDC provided revenues and shipment data for the ODM Direct group of vendors. These vendors continue to record huge year-over-year growth in revenues and market share as large datacenters find it attractive to custom build their server designs at potential volume prices.In addition to the above, in terms of volume, Dell secured the top position with market share of 20.5%, while HPE holds the second spot with market share of 16.9%. Lenovo, Huawei, Super Micro and Inspur Electronics occupied the third position, ending the quarter with market shares of 6.4%, 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.4%, respectively.Growth Across All Regions Except Latin AmericaRegion wise, IDC noted server market growth across every region except Latin America. Canada and Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan and China) witnessed the fastest growth with 69.7% and 38.2% increase, respectively. This was followed by China recording 33.8%, the United States 29.6%, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 17.4%, and Japan reporting 4.3% increase. However, Latin America registered a year-over-year decline of 5% in the quarter.Brighter Prospects AheadWe believe the global server market will continue to grow in the quarters ahead, mainly due to the further push of hyperscale server deployments by cloud-service providers. In our opinion, there is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server-infrastructure space, with more and more companies shifting to cloud-based storage.Also, Gartner’s latest forecast for IT spending (a 4.5% increase in 2018) depicts a favorable tech spending environment, which, we believe, will positively influence the overall server market in the near term.Looking at the improving IT spending and server deployment push by data-center service providers across different geographies, we expect that the overall performance of vendors will improve over the next few quarters.Currently, HPE and Cisco carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

153,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) have been trending up, of late. Strong fundamentals and encouraging last reported results are some of the reasons which make AMD popular among the investors.AMD reported non-GAAP earnings of 8 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017 against a loss of 1 cent per share in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents per share.Revenues increased 33.8% year over year to $1.480 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.407 billion. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s product portfolio comprising Ryzen CPU, EPYC and Radeon Vega GPUs.Further, the company’s collaborations with Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Amazon, Tencent, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and JD.com are other positive.Portfolio Strength, GPU Demand Hold KeyThe company launched Ryzen mobile processors with Radeon Vega graphics, recently. Notably, the company’s Ryzen PRO-based offerings have already been adopted by prominent commercial PC providers including Dell, Lenovo, Acer and HP. The availability of Ryzen Thread ripper processors has enabled AMD to re-enter the high-end desktop market.The company also delivered robust growth in graphics driven by strength across graphics product portfolio. The company’s release of Vega-based GPUs and increasing demand for its Polaris products in both gaming and blockchain industries led to improved revenues. Launched during the quarter, Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs aimed at gaming enthusiasts has performed better than previous Radeon GPUs.Adding to the positives, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) recently launched the new iMac Pro, powered by AMD’s Radeon Pro Vega product.Solid demand for the expanded Ryzen processor family in the desktop market is also a tailwind.Solid Growth OutlookAMD provided encouraging first-quarter revenue guidance, primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s product portfolio comprising Ryzen CPU, EPYC and Radeon Vega GPUs. For first-quarter of 2018, management expects revenues to be roughly $1.55 billion (+/-) $50 million. This represents an increase of approximately 32% year over year.For fiscal 2018, the company projects double-digit growth in revenues.These factors bolstered investors’ confidence in AMD stock.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

154,AMD,"The Priceline Group Inc.  is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 27, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the online travel company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%.The surprise history has been good in Priceline’s case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average four-quarter positive surprise of 7.4%.In a year's time, shares of Priceline have gained 14.6% underperforming the industry’s 62.2% rally.Strong Agency Revenues to Drive International ResultsPriceline generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 16/77% in the third quarter.We expect agency revenues to increase in the to-be-reported quarter driven by strength across priceline.com and booking.com. While priceline.com is expected to benefit from room night growth, booking.com is likely to ride on vacation rental properties growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for agency revenues is pegged at $2 billion. In the third quarter, agency revenues had increased 51.1% sequentially and 21.8% year over year.Agoda and Rental Cars to Boost Merchant Revenues In the to-be-reported-quarter, merchant revenues are also expected to grow driven by strength across agoda.com and rentalcars.com. While agoda.com is likely to benefit from discounting in markets, rentalcars.com is expected to ride on continuous operational improvements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for merchant revenues is pegged at $455 million. In the third quarter, merchant revenues were up 37.4% sequentially and 10.3% from the prior-year quarter.ConcernsWeaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs.Also, for the fourth quarter of 2017, Priceline expects room nights booked to grow 8-13% and total gross bookings to increase 9.5-14.5% year over year (5.5-10.5% on a constant currency basis). Notably, this guidance indicated a slowdown in growth rates of room nights booked and total gross bookings, as it is the lowest compared to the last five quarters.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

Though Fitbit has incurred loss in the past quarters, the global wearables market is expected to improve at a compound annual growth rate of 18.4% through 2021, hitting 222.3 million devices according to IDC. Growth in the wearables market will help the company improve its top-line  figures.Also, Fitbit is taking other initiatives that are expected to pull out the company from slow growth.

156,AMD,"It is no secret that Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of Wall Street’s favorite stocks over the past two years. The graphics chip maker has exploded in value—and garnered significant investor attention—thanks to the continued growth of its core business and the emergence of several new businesses, and now it feels like Nvidia has its hands in nearly every corner of the modern technology world.This Santa Clara, California-based processor manufacturer has been a top choice among PC gamers looking to build high-end machines for years, but now the company is a major player in many other exciting markets, including datacenters, self-driving cars, and cryptocurrency mining.Interestingly enough, Nvidia’s rapid rise has come at the same time as a massive surge in the cryptocurrency market, so the fact that the company’s GPUs are often used in the coin mining process makes the whole story even more remarkable.Led by huge gains from the likes of bitcoin and Ethereum, cryptocurrencies have become all the rage in the financial sector as proponents and critics debate the merits of these digital assets. Naturally, this has also led to increased interest in cryptocurrency mining, a process that sees users rewarded with new coins or tokens when they volunteer their own computing power for the necessary blockchain maintenance that makes these cryptos work.Nvidia and competitors like AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) come into play here because their GPUs pack the punch needed to power the dedicated mining rigs that many are rushing to build. Nevertheless, Nvidia has been hesitant to consider cryptocurrencies a driving force behind its growth.“While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter,” said Nvidia CFO Colette Kress in the company’s latest earnings conference call. “That said, our main focus remains on our core gaming market, as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile.”Analysts in that conference call were clearly wanting to hear more about Nvidia’s perception of cryptocurrencies, but they were met with a bit of stonewalling from the company’s enigmatic CEO, Jensen Huang.Fielding a question centered on whether his management team’s outlook on cryptos has been “modeled more conservatively,” Huang responded simply by saying, “We model crypto approximately flat.”Of course, Nvidia’s balance sheet does not stonewall. We know that Nvidia witnessed total GPU revenues of $2.461 billion in its most recent quarter, up about 33% from the prior-year period.A vast majority of that revenue is coming from the businesses that Nvidia actually markets its products toward, and we should not discount the strength of its gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization segments.But as much as Nvidia management would like to shift the conversation away from cryptocurrencies, it is clear that coin miners are having some sort of impact on the company’s top line.Want more analysis from this author?

157,AMD,"All eyes will be on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) this week as investors continue to expect an overwhelming quarterly report from the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. For the last two years, this graphic chipmaker has impressed investors with its stellar performance, wherein the company’s quarterly revenues have been advancing at a rate more than 50%, earnings have tripled and shares have displayed more than six-fold growth, consequently.Although new markets, including datacenter, autonomous vehicle and cryptocurrency will continue to record increase in revenue contribution, the company’s gaming business remains the core segment on which its overall growth depends. Notably, the segment has contributed 59% to the third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues and registered year-over-year growth of 25.5%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, this segment is likely to witness year-over-year growth of 16.5% and reach $1.57 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuotePascal GPUs Driving Segment’s GrowthThe year-over-year growth expectation is mainly driven by the strong adoption of NVIDIA’s Pascal architecture-based graphics processing units (GPUs).For a thrilling gaming experience, one needs better visualization and speed, and NVIDIA has what gamers want, with its strong portfolio of Pascal architecture-based GPUs, which is considered the best by market experts. As gaming enthusiasts always intend to play games at the best graphic settings, they usually upgrade their PCs with more advanced GPUs.NVIDIA has been able to tap this opportunity by continuously rolling out more advanced GPUs, including GTX 1080, GTX 1070 and Titan X, over the past year. This move has paid well as highlighted by the impressive year-over-year growth in the segment’s revenues over the last four-five quarters.The latest monthly report of Steam also depicts strong adoption of NVIDIA’s GPUs. Per the report, NVIDIA’s GPUs have captured a much larger market share during the period between November 2017 and January 2018, when compared with the preceding quarter.Thus, this indicates that strong adoption of the company’s graphic cards continued into the fourth quarter as well, the benefit of which will certainly reflect in its results.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.Tough Y/Y Comparison & Competition Might Impede GrowthIt should be noted that the growth rate have been slowing down since the fiscal third quarter, when compared with the previous four quarters. The company has registered approximately 50% year-over-year increase during this period, while in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the growth rate slowed down to around 25%. We believe this is so because of tough year-over-year comparisons and the to-be-reported quarter is likely to see the impact of the same too.Apart from this, increasing competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) might also hurt the fiscal fourth-quarter top-line performance. Notably, with not much remarkable presence in the high-end graphic-chip market till July 2017, Advanced Micro Devices enhanced its footprint by introducing the Vega series of GPUs — Vega 56 and Vega 64 — in August 2017. Therefore, we believe this might had hurt NVIDIA’s market share in the quarter under review, in turn impacting the segment’s top-line performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils for NVIDIA’s Overall Performance?Our proven model conclusively shows that NVIDIA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

160,AMD,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Feb 8. This company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, over the preceding four quarters, NVIDIA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 33.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWidely known for its video-gaming chips, NVIDIA has pioneered the art and science of visual computing. With singular focus on this field, the company offers specialized platforms for the gaming, automotive, data-center and professional visualization markets. Its products, services and software deliver amazing experiences in virtual reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous cars.As usual, the gaming segment is anticipated to remain the largest contributor to the company’s overall fiscal fourth-quarter revenues and will continue to witness growth. This segment is likely to witness year-over-year growth of 16.5% and reach $1.57 billion in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, the major growth is likely to be contributed by the company’s data-center segment. Demand for NVIDIA’s datacenter-focused products has exploded due to an increase in data-center production around the world, and management has successfully marketed its solutions to compete with industry leaders like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). Per the consensus estimate, the segment is likely to grow 85.5% from the year-ago quarter level and reach $549 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.Furthermore, NVIDIA’s overall performance is likely to benefit from its growing strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. The company’s cutting-edge technology has helped it become the leading player in providing AI for applications to autonomous driving vehicles, outpacing other competitors, such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), in terms of growth.Notably, during CES 2018, NVIDIA revealed that over 320 companies, including Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Uber and Volkswagen, are working with it on developing self-driving technology. All this makes us optimistic about the company’s automotive segment’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance. Per the consensus estimate, the segment is projected to grow 17.2% year over year and reach $150 million at the end of the quarter under review.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that NVIDIA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.16, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 17.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $2.66 billion indicates around 22.4% growth from the prior-year quarter.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

161,AMD,"Benchmarks closed in the green on Wednesday after two straight days of declines. Boeing reached an all-time high after releasing upbeat fourth-quarter earnings results and a strong full-year projection, which in turn boosted key indexes. However, markets lost some of their gains after the Fed’s stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates. Although, key indexes finished marginally higher on the last trading day of January, all of them registered record gains for the month. While, the Dow and the S&P 500 registered their best monthly performance since March 2016, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its highest monthly increase since October 2015.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.3%, to close at 26,149.39. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,823.81. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,411.48, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 12% to close at 13.01. A total of around 8.05 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.18 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.14 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?Shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rose 4.9% settling at its best levels ever, after the aircraft manufacturer posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)For the full year, Boeing’s operating profit jumped 76% year-over-year to $10.3 billion. Net earnings for the company climbed 67% from 2016 to $8.2 billion in 2017. Also, the company’s commercial airplanes' 2018 delivery expectations are reiterated at a record level of 810 to 815 airplanes, which was higher than 2017’s total deliveries of 763 aircrafts.Upbeat fourth quarter earnings results and strong 2018 earnings and airplanes delivery outlook contributed to Boeing’s incredible performance. On Wednesday, Boeing contributed 114 points to the blue-chip index, Dow and was one of the best performers among all the S&P 500 companies.Additionally, Electronic Arts Inc.’s (EA  -  Free Report) shares advanced 7% after the gaming company reported fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $2.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18. (Read More)Advanced Micro Devices, Inc’s (AMD  -  Free Report) increased 6.8% after it posted fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.05 per share. Both the tech companies were biggest contributor to S&P 500’s gains during the day. (Read More)Fed’s Policy Statement in FocusOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25%-1.5% range. In its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that economic activity has increased at a “solid rate” and will continue to grow at a “moderate pace.”Additionally, per the statement, labor market remains strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The FOMC also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Rising rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March weighed on investor sentiment and limited some of Wednesday’s gains. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which was at 2.722% on Wednesday, hovering near its highest settlement in almost four years. Also, 2-year yield was at around 2.15%. High treasury yields also weighed on broader equity markets to a certain extent.According to ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payrolls report for January, 234,000 new jobs were created during the month, Further, December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, but still tallied at 242,000. Separately, according to the National Association of Realtors, pending home sales for the month of December increased 0.5%, better than November’s reading of a rise of 0.3%.Monthly RoundupFor the month, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 5.8%, 5.6% and 7.4%, respectively. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, last December contributed to January’s gains. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentimentMoreover during the month, the Senate gave its consent to pass a short-term spending Bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which include a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Stocks That Made HeadlinesQualcomm Beats Q1 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesQualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported strong financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018, with the top and the bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

162,AMD,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2017 wherein earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues fell short of the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, the company registered growth on both counts.Check Point’s non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) of $1.58 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 and came in above its guidance range of $1.45-$1.55. Non-GAAP earnings also climbed approximately 8% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by elevated revenues, efficient cost management and a lower share count.RevenuesFourth-quarter revenues came in at $506 million, up 4% year over year and marginally came in above the mid-point of the company’s guidance of $485-$525 million (mid-point $505 million). However, the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $509 million.Quarterly revenues were mainly driven by strong adoption of the company’s products, particularly its Infinity platform, which was launched in the third quarter. The company, during the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, hinted that its revenues have been affected due to significant changes made in the U.S. sales force which has not yet reached full potential. Notably, the company generates approximately 45% of its total revenues from the Americas.However, dismal performance in the Americas was more than offset by strong performance across the Europe and Asia Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa regions. Europe accounted for 39% of total revenues, while the Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 16%.Segment wise, the company witnessed sales growth of 2.8% in Product and Security Subscriptions, and 5.6% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported 18% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Talking about deal size, the number of new customers — who signed deals worth $1 million or more —totaled 110, up 11% from year-ago quarter. Also, customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 75% to the total order value, which is equal to the fourth-quarter 2016 tally.Operating ResultsOn a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross profit climbed 4.6% to $448.8 million. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 88.7%.Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 3.7% year over year to $156.7 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 200 bps mainly due to efficient cost management.Non-GAAP operating income came in at $292.1 million, up nearly 9.7% year over year. In addition, margins advanced 300 bps to 57.7% primarily due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income was $259.2 million or $1.58 per share, up from $247.2 million or $1.46 reported in the year-earlier quarter.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowCheck Point exited the fourth quarter with cash balances of approximately $3.848 billion, slightly down from $3.865 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter. During 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $1.09 billion.In addition to this, during the reported quarter, the company generated cash worth $248.1 million from operational activities — marking a 36% year-over-year improvement. The robust growth in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to strong collections from customers and a reduction in the tax advances paid to the authorities in Israel.Additionally, Check Point repurchased about 9.6 million shares for a total cost of $995.3 million in 2017.OutlookTaking into account the ongoing challenges related with the U.S. sales force, the company provided outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2018. However, Check Point’s revenues and earnings guidance for both periods remained below our expectations.For the first quarter, the company expects to generate revenues between $440 million and $460 million (mid-point $450 million). The mid-point of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.25-$1.35 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 14 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.33.For the current year, Check Point anticipates generating revenues between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion (mid-point $1.95 billion). The mid-point of the guided range is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the band of $5.50-$5.90 per share (mid-point $5.70). GAAP earnings per share are projected to be 62 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.74.Stock PerformanceShares of Check Point remained highly volatile during yesterday’s trade. Following the earnings announcement, the stock opened its trade at a price 2.3% lower than the closing price on Jan 30. However, by the end of the day, it recovered much of this loss and eventually closed trade below 1%.Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to over the past year. The industry has recorded growth of 12.4% during the period, while Check Point has gained a meager 5.6%. Our TakeCheck Point’s ongoing issues related with the changes it made in its U.S. sales force makes us skeptical about the company’s near-term performance. It looks like the recently-joined people are taking more-than-expected time for reaching their full potential. The same is reflected in the company’s outlook too. Although the issue is temporary, it is wise to stay away from investing in this stock right now until we get some clear visibility on its sales force execution in the United States.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

Management remains optimistic about this product with companies like Tencent and JD.com planning to deploy the company’s EPYC processors. Baidu and Microsoft also announced plans of deploying EPYC based products in their hyperscale environment, which is another positive for AMD.The company achieved record Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) revenues on the back of improved average selling price (ASP) and higher unit shipments compared with the year-ago quarter.Additionally, AMD started the shipment of AMD EPYC processor-powered HPE ProLiant DL385 Gen10 server to the high-end content creation market during the quarter.Notably, the company entered into a partnership with Baidu during the quarter to deploy AMD EPYC single-socket platformsin Baidu datacenters.The company is working with Qualcomm to integrate its Snapdragon LTE modem solution in Ryzen mobile processors.

Management noted that ramping up of high performance products will continue to have a positive impact on margins.Non-GAAP operating margin during the quarter came in at 6.9% compared with 2.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year expansion was primarily owing to higher operating income from the Computing and Graphics segment driven by higher revenue.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $142 million compared with $60 million in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAMD ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.185 billion compared with $879 million in the previous quarter.

170,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) gained more than 2.5% in morning trading hours on Monday, just one day before the trendy chipmaker is set to release its latest quarterly earnings results. Now, with the stock on the rise ahead of its report date, many investors will be wondering whether it is time to buy AMD or avoid the often-volatile semiconductor maker altogether.Based in Sunnyvale, California, AMD produces microprocessors, chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional graphics. The company operates under two segments: Computing & Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded & Semi-Custom.AMD has garnered significant attention over the past few years thanks to a rise in demand for many of its products and an influx of noteworthy competitors in its key businesses. The stock is up just a modest 24% over the past year, but investors can bet that Wall Street’s focus will be firmly planted on the company when it reports on Tuesday.Latest OutlookBased on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect AMD to report adjusted earnings of 5 cents per share and revenues of $1.40 billion. In the year-ago period, the company posted a per-share loss of one cent and revenues of $1.11 billion.Of course, total earnings and revenue are not the only items in AMD’s report that investors will be interested in. In fact, it is possible that AMD’s post-earnings momentum is inspired by its performance in key business units. To prepare for this, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.According to our latest consensus estimates, AMD is expected to report Computing & Graphics revenues of $839 million, up about 39.8% from the year-ago period. That growth rate would represent a noticeable cooling off from the 73.5% expansion witnessed last quarter, but strong demand for GPUs in like gaming and cryptocurrency mining should still lift results.Meanwhile, our consensus estimates are calling for AMD to post Enterprise, Embedded & Semi-Custom revenues of $562 million, which would mark year-over-year growth of roughly 11.1%. This result would also represent an improvement from the 1.3% slump witnessed last quarter. Analysts have cited strong adoption of the company’s EPYC server processors as a key growth catalyst in this division.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that AMD surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Just one day out from its report, AMD is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 12.75%. That is because the company’s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at 6 cents per share, meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus. This improved outlook is a good sign heading into the report.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of AMD’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices. To view the latest trends here, check out the company’s price and surprise chart over the course of its last three quarters:Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD’s earnings beat streak actually extends beyond the pictured quarters. The company has now met or surpassed earnings estimates in six-consecutive quarters. However, we can see that positive surprises do not always lead to strong share price surges. In fact, the stock dipped significantly after its Q3 report and would take more than two months to return to its pre-report levels.With that said, investors will need to consider that forward guidance can be the catalyst for the stock’s post-earnings momentum. Guidance can also be extremely unpredictable.One thing to remember is that most tech firms have been taking one-time charges related to the recent U.S. tax reform bill. These charges have resulted in a significant difference between adjusted and GAAP earnings results, but the overall impact of tax reform has led to favorable earnings guidance for the next few quarters.Want more analysis from this author?

The number is expected to further expand, driving revenues for the company.

Also, the company is willing to spend plenty of cash on its entertainment and media units, which management has identified as key growth drivers outside of its core e-commerce business.Also, increasing competition from companies like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Jd.com (JD), among others and deceleration of growth in the e-commerce market both domestically and internationally could impact results in the upcoming quarter.Moreover, the company was suspected for the sale of counterfeit products on its online shopping platform, Taobao.com.

Solid demand for the expanded Ryzen processor family in the desktop market is a tailwind.Notably, the company’s Ryzen PRO-based offerings have already been adopted by prominent commercial PC providers including Dell, Lenovo and HP.

These segments form the crux of Intel’s data-centric business model.The company has gained just 21.6% in a year, underperforming the industry's growth of 50.4%.What to ExpectIntel revised 2017 outlook based on double-digit growth expectation from data-centric businesses.Intel guided fourth-quarter 2017 revenues of around $16.3 billion (+/-$500 million), up 3% year over year excluding McAfee. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $16.30 billion. Earnings are anticipated to be 86 cents (+/- 5 cents) per share, up 15% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 86 cents.For fiscal 2017, management expects revenues of almost $ 62 billion (+/- $500 million), almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $62.02 billion and up $700 million from previous expectation. Earnings are now anticipated to be $3.25 (+/- 5 cents) per share, up from previous guidance of $3.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.25 per share.The company’s results will benefit from stable PC trends, anticipated demand for newly launched Xeon Scalable processors and newly added products. Moreover, Intel’s expanding presence in the rapidly-growing autonomous vehicle market along with continued focus on developing more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for self-diving cars are key catalysts.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autonomous Vehicles & AI: Key CatalystsIntel’s CEO Brian Krzanich during a ‘Prime Keynote’ in the CES 2018 talked about the company’s initiatives in driverless vehicles and powering AI technology through partnerships and strategic deals.Intel revealed a number of partnerships in the space. At the event, the company announced few important partnerships — with BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen AG, and Ferrari — which exhibit Intel’s growing dominance in providing AI platforms which will power future vehicles.It will also leverage Intel’s Mobileye-based mapping technology for improving self-driving cars navigation process.Intel also joined forces with SAIC Motor and NavInfo to extend crowdsourced map building to China. Additionally, Intel is also moving ahead in the virtual reality (VR) and and non-VR gaming space. It collaborated with Paramount Pictures for the next-generation VR andnon-VR Challenger League.Krzanich also added that Intel is collaborating with Ferrari North America to brings its AI technology to the Ferrari Challenge North America Series races to be held on six courses in the United States this year. The Ferrari Challenge will use Intel Xeon Scalable processors chips to enhance the experience to viewers online.Intel is also partnering with Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) Radeon Vega M GPUs with a purpose to utilize the GPUs in its next generation CPUs. All these efforts will contribute meaningfully to top-line growth in the upcoming quarter.Product Rollouts to Drive ResultsThe company recently announced Intel Stratix, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated with high bandwidth memory to accelerate workloads and keep pace with data explosion.The newly added product will expand the onboard memory pool and add more bandwidth. We believe that the launch will improve scalability, reliability, power and density requirements of future HPC deployments.Intel also announced substantial advances in its wireless product portfolio to accelerate 5G adoptions, alongside introducing Intel XMM 8000 series and Intel XMM 7660 series modems. The launch of Xeon Scalable, Core 8 chips, Myriad X and next-generation desktop processors are also key catalysts.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in data centers from cloud-based service providers like Amazon.com, Alphabet and Microsoft is a key catalyst for Intel. Moreover, the launch of Core 8 is expected to boost its PC market share.Intel’s Security Flaw Poses ChallengesIntel has encountered two major security issues that could let attackers to access security keys, passwords, and cached files of a device's kernel memory. The two security flaws called Meltdown and Spectre could allow programs to steal data including passwords stored in a password manager or browser, personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.The bug is apparently present in nearly every Intel CPU made within the last decade, and upcoming patches will negatively affect hardware performance. However, Microsoft, Apple and Linux programmers are rolling out patches to fix Linux and Windows kernels in order to address the vulnerability.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 but its Earnings ESP is -0.09%.

174,AMD,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) recently announced that Chery, a Chinese car manufacturer, would be using its self-driving solution that the company is developing in collaboration with Baidu Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report) and German auto supplier, ZF Friedrichshafen AG.Notably, the company has partnered with Baidu and ZF Friedrichshafen to build a “production-ready AI autonomous vehicle platform” specially designed for the Chinese market. The partnership will lead to the integration of NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier platform and ZF’s ProAI car computer into Baidu’s Apollo Pilot, which according to the company, is “an autonomous driving product targeted for mass production.”Chery will be the first Chinese automobile company to adopt this technology and intends to integrate the aforementioned AI platform in Level 3 automobiles, per Techcrunch. The company is well known for its lower-priced tech loaded vehicles. Though incorporation of Level 3 autonomous features poses challenges, a proper combination of these technologies might be beneficial for the company.The deal was announced at the North American International Auto Show, following the Customer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, where NVIDIA stole the limelight with its initiatives in driverless vehicles and powering artificial intelligence (AI) technology to build autonomous vehicles.In the last few years, NVIDIA has been trying to strengthen its capabilities in the space through several partnerships. We believe, this year will not be an exception as reflected from the collaborations it announced during the CES event.Apart from making partnerships with Baidu and ZF Friedrichshafen, the company announced a partnership with Aurora to build a “Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving hardware platform”, which will integrate its Xavier processor.These efforts have been benefiting NVIDIA as more and more companies have agreed to use its AI technologies for the development of autonomous vehicles. The recent additions to the list are Uber Technologies Inc. and Volkswagen AG as disclosed by the company at the CES event. Notably, the company is working with over 320 companies across the globe on automotive applications.The immense growth opportunity available in the space justifies NVIDIA’s efforts.Per BI intelligence, 10 million self-driving cars will hit the roads by 2020. Statista states that the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion, while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. Boston Consulting Group anticipates the autonomous car market to be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.Thus, the estimates provided by these firms make us optimistic on NVIDIA’s prospects in the space. The company has already outpaced competitors such as Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report).We believe that with continued focus on advanced AI technologies for self-diving cars, the company is well poised to gain from the growth opportunity of the market.Notably, NVIDIA stock has gained 113.4% the past year, substantially outperforming the 53.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

175,AMD,"So much happened at the annual Consumer Electronics Show 2018 at Las Vegas last week that it’s almost impossible to put it all together in one place. But here are the high spots-WhirlpoolWhirlpool announced that Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Watch users will be able to control their Whirlpool home appliances like washing machines, ovens and around twenty other gadgets through their Watches.Whirlpool smart appliances will also connect with Honeywell thermostats according to a freshly-announced deal between the two.Moreover, its 2018 range of appliances will respond to voice commands through both Amazon's (AMZN  -  Free Report) Alexa and Google's Home assistant.FacebookOculus, the VR company that Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) acquired in 2014, announced a hardware partnership with China’s Xiaomi. Using a Chinese brand in China should be beneficial for Oculus because the Chinese government doesn’t make it very easy for foreign companies to operate. Making China the manufacturing destination for the device will also help its global launch because China currently leads in both manufacturing cost and skill.From the looks and appearance of the Xiaomi Mi VR Standalone, it is a rebranding of the $199 Oculus Go announced earlier. Both devices will be manufactured by Xiaomi to run on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 SoC, a WQHD LCD screen and Xiaomi’s software and services platform. All Gear VR software and applications will run on the headsets.HTC announced an upgrade to its $600 Vive VR headset, but didn’t mention what it would cost or whether it would be a standalone device or require pairing with a more powerful computer.IntelIntel (INTC  -  Free Report) announced partnerships with a large number of automakers including BMW, Nissan, SAIC Motor, Volkswagen and Ferrari to help them bring their self-driving vehicles (Level 3 to Level 5) to market. Automated driving is a compute-intensive and therefore, necessarily a power guzzling exercise.So Intel has launched a new automated driving platform consisting of two Mobilieye EyeQ5 sensor processing chips paired with a new Intel Atom 3xx4 CPU that together provide 60% more performance at the same 30W power consumption as Nvidia’s new Xavier chip. BMW, Volkswagen and Nissan will also be deploying the EyeQ4 when it launches in the second half of 2018.Sample parts of EyeQ5 are expected to start shipping in 2019 with production parts by the end of 2020. Intel estimates that 2 million vehicles from these three automakers will use Mobileye Road Experience Management (REM) technology and knowhow from digital mapping company NavInfo to crowdsource data to build and rapidly update low-cost, scalable high-definition maps this year. Additionally, SAIC will develop L3 to L5 cars in China based on Mobileye technology.Intel also launched Intel Studios, a state-of-the-art studio for the production of large-scale, volumetric content (Intel True View technology will enable different kinds of immersive media experiences, both with and without VR). Paramount Pictures is its first partner in this endeavor. Intel will showcase its True VR technology capabilities by enabling the VR version of the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018. Intel and the official Rights Holding Broadcasters will together capture a record 30 Olympic events for live viewing and as video-on-demand.Intel and AMD have partnered to bring 8th Generation Core Processor with Radeon Vega M Graphics for notebooks and small PCs with the goal of offering high power computing and graphics in a smaller form factor. For the purpose, Intel will be buying custom AMD Vega chips and placing them along with the Intel processor on a single silicon wafer so companies like Dell and HP (which showcased the technology at CES) can create thinner and lighter designs. Intel does make its own integrated graphics, but has missed out on gaming and content creation opportunities. So this is a way for rivals Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Intel to take a stab at common enemy NVIDIA. PCs using the tech will ship this spring.CiscoCisco’s (CSCO  -  Free Report) software-defined network (SDN) architecture for a more connected vehicle will first be deployed by Korean automaker Hyundai in its premium models to be launched next year. First announced in 2016, the highly configurable software-defined vehicle (SDV) platform will enable end-to-end networking, sensor integration, and hardware and software integration as well as multi-layered security. This will facilitate the processing of more data inside the car, enable ""over-the-air"" software upgrades, and help communicate with smart parking meters, toll gates and traffic lights.It also launched its Infinite Video Platform, a video streaming platform that optimizes video (in terms of both resolution and speed) for any user device and even when changing between devices. Service providers can use the technology for high quality, secure video delivery to any consumer device from a single source. Cisco’s 20+ beta testers experienced ""benefits including the ability to implement private or public cloud deployments that offer capex and opex savings as well as increased agility and time to market.""The new Infinite Broadband Unlocked (IBU) licensing plan simplifies license acquisition and management for its cable operator customers using the Cisco Converged Broadband Router (cBR-8) platform. It is designed to help cable operators compete with fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) systems.GoogleAlphabet’s showing at the CES focused on the Google Assistant, which it is bringing to many more devices. In a separate blog post Google recently announced that it was uniting its Android Pay (for mobile payments and loyalty) and Wallet (for peer-to-peer payments) apps under a common umbrella called Google Pay that would make payments through Google less confusing once you’ve saved your payments information.Bloomberg speculated that Assistant is being built up to not just to help you with the different pieces of your daily schedule, but also to make purchases. So it isn’t much of a stretch to imagine that Google Pay is also being designed to make things easier for Assistant.The Assistant for Android Auto is designed to facilitate access to all the third-party Google Assistant services and control of smart home devices from the car. Assistant-based drink orders from Starbucks and parking space reservations through SpotHero are also in the cards.Assistant for Android Auto will be enabled through the updated Android Auto app and even if you don’t have an Android Auto-powered car. Google is also working with car manufacturers to integrate Assistant within their cars so it becomes easy to check fuel levels or lock the car with your voice, among other things.Google Assistant is also being integrated into a range of smart speakers through agreements with JBL, Altec Lansing, Bang & Olufsen and Klipsch.Another new category for the Assistant is Smart Displays, which are priced at $199 for an 8-inch model or $229 for a 10-inch model. The Smart Displays basically allow you to choose between voice or touch commands and do much the same things as Amazon’s Echo Show, such as consulting your schedule, checking the weather or playing music. But it also ""googlifies"" the experience with things like Google Photos and directions to work, both of which sync with Google’s Voice Match, so the results are customized for different people in the household.To make a video call, just download the Google Duo app. Search on the device is highly customized with results appearing as interactive graphics. You can also cast content (only from Google Play Movies and TV for now) to the screens the way you do with Chromecast. Current hardware partners for the Smart Displays are JBL, Lenovo, LG and Sony.The iHome iGV1 is a new $139.99 smart radio with Google Assistant integration and competes with Amazon’s $129.99 Spot. Google Assistant enables voice assistance, the ability to play music from streaming services like Google Play, Pandora, Spotify and YouTube Music, smart home control including compatibility with iHome's own SmartPlug devices and Google Cast support.The display only shows the current time and alarm and can be turned off at night. You can turn off the alarm by telling Assistant or smacking the alarm button the usual way. The iGV1 also syncs with Network Time Protocol (NTP) for clock accuracy when connected to your home's Wi-Fi.Google has also partnered with Lenovo to launch the Mirage Solo, an untethered VR headset that will go up against Facebook’s Oculus Go although it’s far more expensive at around $400. The headset is based on Google’s Daydream platform and enables better picture quality than other options, wearing comfort and mobility (allows for six degrees of movement).Product features include a 5.5-inch LCD display with a resolution of 2,560 pixels x 1,440 pixels and powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 VR platform. It also integrates Google’s WorldSense inside-out tracking software, which translates your real-world movements into digital, eliminating the need for additional sensors and cameras such as in the Rift, Vive and Sony’s Playstation VR headsets.Lenovo will bring a suite of apps that showcase the Solo’s standalone capabilities later this year, which can help adoption. The product will ship in the second quarter of 2018.The second product from the Lenovo collaboration is the companion 180-degree 3D camera called Mirage Camera for content creators. 3D video has so far been captured through 360-degree cameras but there are some difficulties in using those, such as the need to hide from the 360-degree footage.Since most VR cameras offer a 110-degree line of vision and most people don’t look behind them when consuming content, the 180-degree camera might be satisfactorily immersive for most. There’s also a bonus in the file size, which can be smaller, with content streaming requiring less bandwidth.NVIDIANVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) announced several self-driving partnerships, the most significant of which is likely the one with ride-hailing company, Uber. The deal expands on existing relationships which the two companies already have with Volvo that has had Uber using NVIDIA technology in the Volvo cars it deploys since late 2016. NVIDIA claims that its technology has already driven 2 million miles, with the last million happening in the just a 100 days as the rate of deployment accelerated. Under the just-announced deal, NVIDIA technology will be in Uber cars and also in Uber-owned Otto self-driving trucks.Its partnership with Volkswagen, which is using its Drive IX and Drive AR systems to develop software for ancillary services such as augmented-reality features, and gesture and facial recognition. But the companies showcased what they have been working on since Jul 2017: a revamped bus using NVIDIA technology.NVIDIA also announced partnerships with Baidu and ZF.There were also details on its functional safety architecture powering its AI-based NVIDIA DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform, which uses redundant and diverse functions to enable vehicles to operate safely, even when the operator, environment or systems err. NVIDIA said it now has 320 partners signed up for NVIDIA DRIVE, up from fewer than 200 at CES 2017.AmazonAmazon had a lot on offer this CES although the excitement was pretty much around its growing rivalry with Google, particularly in the way Alexa is getting front and center of the voice-controlled world.So now, Alexa is getting into HP, Acer and Asus computers running Windows 10. It’s hard to understand what’s driving Microsoft to do this since it already offers Cortana. But the leading software maker is probably looking at more choice for customers. At any rate, the PCs will ship later this year.With a focus on portable devices like hearables, headphones, smart watches, fitness devices, etc, Amazon announced the Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit toolkit. The kit will be available later this year.This is in addition to recently-announced partnerships with Bose, Jabra, iHome, Beyerdynamic, Bowers & Wilkins and others which will put Alexa into different Bluetooth audio devices.As rumored in the press a few days earlier, Alexa is also going to be inside $1,000 Vuzix Blade AR Smart Glasses that will also double as regular glasses. With Alexa, these glasses, in combination with a smartphone in your pocket or purse, will project directions, menus, weather reports, stock quotes, sports scores, social feeds and other hands-free alerts as an image in front of your eyes.It also won’t leave your bathroom alone. By virtue of a deal with Kohler, Amazon’s Alexa will make it inside what Kohler calls its Verdera Voice Lighted Mirror to control the lights with your voice, or catch up on the news, weather or traffic. That is, if you’re willing to shell out the $999 the smart mirror will cost when it hits the shelves in late March.And that isn’t all. Alexa is also getting inside Toyota and Lexus automobiles this year with additional models coming in 2019. In Toyota cars that currently have the Apple Siri-powered Entune infotainment system, Alexa will be pitched as an upgrade. Ditto for the Lexus cars that come with the Enform infotainment software.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

176,AMD,"Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) chip flaws, Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Avere purchase and the U.S. blocking MoneyGram’s sale to Alibaba’s (BABA  -  Free Report) Ant Financial were the top stories from last week. Here are the details- Intel Chip FlawMedia reports from last week shed light on a number of security issues with chips that put most smartphones, laptops, PCs, servers and other computing devices at risk. The two bugs/flaws could allow programs to steal data including passwords stored in a password manager or browser, personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.The first one, called Meltdown, affects only Intel processors and Intel is already providing software and firmware updates for 90% of devices that could slow down your machine somewhat, but would be mostly imperceptible for most users, according to the company. For tasks that aggregate data (like databases) or jobs that involve moving repeatedly between the storage and the processor, the patch can slow down the process by up to 30%. In addition to Intel, cloud vendors Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft and Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google, as well as OS provider Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) have already issued patches for this one.The second one, called Spectre, is much harder to fix and affects Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and ARM-powered devices, so practically every single machine.There appears to be some dispute about whether AMD chips are susceptible to the vulnerabilities or not. Of the three ways a system could be attacked, AMD says its CPU microarchitecture leaves it fully immune to the first, yields ""a near zero risk"" to another and while being vulnerable to the third method, software/OS updates that have ""negligible performance impact"" should fix the issue. A Google blog post stated the vulnerabilities ""affect many CPUs, including those from AMD, ARM and Intel.""Investors are, however, punishing Intel shares while boosting AMD, so they probably expect AMD to pick up some of the data center share it’s been targeting for so long. NVIDIA shares also rose possibly for similar reasons, although Intel’s CPUs don’t do exactly the same job as its GPUs.Microsoft Buys AvereAvere Systems, the network file systems (NFS) and server message block (SMB) file storage provider for Windows and Linux clients running in the cloud, hybrid and on-premises environments with customers like Sony Pictures Imageworks, the Library of Congress, John Hopkins University and Teradyne, has been acquired by Microsoft.Avere’s file system and caching technologies speed access to compute and storage resources in hybrid environments, which could therefore help the number two provider of cloud services in its battle with market leader Amazon AWS and number three, Google Cloud. Microsoft has said that Avere technology will help it run ""the largest, most complex high-performance workloads"" in Azure.The purchase price isn’t known yet, but the company has raised $97 million from Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Tenaya Capital, Western Digital Technologies and Google over the years. In fact, one advantage that Microsoft is likely looking for is Google’s removal from the scene so it is unable to influence the company or integrate it into its cloud. Instead, Avere CEO and President Ron Bianchini has said that Avere’s technology will be tightly integrated into Azure.Alibaba’s Ant Financial Can’t Buy MoneygramThe U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has blocked money transfer company Moneygram’s sale to Alibaba’s sister company Ant Financial. The rationale for the deal is obvious: Moneygram has approximately 350,000 remittance locations in more than 200 countries that would have helped Ant’s Alipay make inroads into several international markets including the U.S.But the U.S. government has taken a hard stand on trade relations with China and in this case, cited uncertainty about the security of private information of U.S. citizens to block the deal. Moneygram and Ant Financial have therefore agreed to work collaboratively in remittance and digital payments based on separate commercial agreements in key international markets such as China, India, the Philippines, other Asian markets, as well as the U.S.TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+3.4%+20.6%FB+5.9%+21.7%GOOGL+5.4%+16.7%MSFT+3.1%+26.0%INTC-3.0%+33.0%CSCO+3.2%+27.6%AMZN+5.1%+23.4% Other Stories-CorporateJimmy Iovine Leaving Apple: Jimmy Iovine, the co-founder of Beats Music that Apple acquired for around $3 billion, is leaving Apple in August, when the Apple shares he got in the buyout, vest. Beats has been important to Apple mainly because of the music streaming infrastructure it developed that helped Apple to quickly become the number 2 music streaming service behind Spotify. As of September, the service had 30 million subscribers, up 75% from the year-ago quarter.Apple also sells the Beats headphones, although they aren’t quite the quality or the hit Apple products usually are. While there aren’t any confirmations from Apple or Iovine himself, media reports suggest that there was also something of a culture clash between them that may have had something to do with the departure.Alphabet’s Cityblock Raises $20 Million: Cityblock, the healthcare spinout from Alphabet’s urban development company Sidewalk Labs, has raised $20 million. CEO and co-founder Iyah Romm has the vision of helping lower-income groups like the elderly and homeless with healthcare services.The company was formed on the idea that preventive measures are cheaper and more effective to keep these people healthy than hospital visits. So it has the goal of allotting a personalized care team of doctors, coaches, technology tools, follow-up nudges and a health plan to each member (for free if they have insurance).Cityblock is in the process of signing up insurance companies for the purpose. The service isn’t operational yet and the money it raised will be used to develop a technology it’s calling Commons and also to build or partner with community health centers in Brooklyn, and other urban centers.New Tax Law and Netflix Pay Raises: In response to the new tax bill that made executive compensation fully taxable, even if they were performance based bonuses, Netflix made changes in its compensation plan. The law earlier allowed companies a tax deduction on employee salaries if they constituted performance based payments.The law was framed to curtail exponential rise in executive salaries compared to the average worker. However, this didn’t have the desired effect and in fact made the situation worse as the bulk of top executive pay was then recorded as performance based payments.With the new law, there is no need to package compensation for maximum tax benefit, so Netflix (and some others) are rolling all payments into salary, which therefore looks like a massive hike in pay. The company’s new policy covers Chairman and CEO Reed Hastings, CFO David Wells, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, Chief Product Officer Greg Peters and General Counsel David Hyman.Cowen Downgrades Snap: Wall Street firm Cowen has downgraded Snap shares to underperform from market perform after its survey of 50 senior U.S. ad buyers found that they ranked it lowest among social media networks in terms of return on investment; targeting; and data, analytics and measurement.Moreover, 96% of advertisers preferred Instagram Stories to Snap with all those who spent money on Instagram Stories last year intending to repeat the spending in 2018. The positives for Snap were the continued increase in DAUs (expected 16% growth in the fourth quarter) and the increase in engagement (18-24 year-olds are using it for 53 minutes a day).Snap has 70% penetration among 13-34 year-olds in the U.S., UK, France and Australia and this is the age group contributing to its success, so analyst John Blackledge also felt that the “challenge for SNAP is whether the user base can age up.""Legal/RegulatoryGender Disparity Caches Up with Google: Google now faces a class action lawsuit after it was modified to narrow down the class of people suing Google. The class was earlier defined as all women employed by Google in California, which San Francisco Superior Court Judge Mary E. Wiss considered too broad a definition. The class was subsequently modified with more than 2 dozen specific job titles including software engineer, project manager and sales representative and the case refiled after the passage of a California law that prohibits an employer from asking an employee her former pay or using it as a basis for subsequent employment.The law was passed to prevent gender discrimination, which was perpetuated by these practices. The lawsuit alleges however that Google pays women less for equal or similar work and puts women on career paths with lower pay ceilings. The lead plaintiffs include Kelly Ellis, who worked for Google from 2010 to 2014; Holly Pease, who performed a variety of managerial roles at two Google offices from 2005 to 2016; and Kelli Wisuri, worked as a sales communications specialist and “brand evangelist” from 2012 to 2015, to which was added Heidi Lamar, a preschool teacher.Tech Companies May See UK Taxes Rise: The Theresa May government in UK is sore about technology companies collecting individual data to sell advertisers when they won’t share that same information with the government. In a recent interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, security minister Ben Wallace directly accused companies like Facebook and Google of irresponsible behavior. ""We should stop pretending that because they sit on beanbags in T-shirts they are not ruthless profiteers. They will ruthlessly sell our details to loans and soft-porn companies but not give it to our democratically elected government,"" he said.The government believes that hate speech and terrorist communications on social networks are leading to the spike in terror incidents. ""Because content is not taken down as quickly as they could do, we’re having to de-radicalize people who have been radicalized. That’s costing millions. They can’t get away with that and we should look at all options, including tax.""Technology companies have however been ramping up efforts to curb terrorism. Last year, Facebook, Google and Twitter joined together to limit Internet service access to terrorists. Facebook said on the UK issue: “Mr Wallace is wrong to say that we put profit before safety, especially in the fight against terrorism. We’ve invested millions of pounds in people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content. The Home Secretary and her counterparts across Europe have welcomed our coordinated efforts which are having a significant impact. But this is an ongoing battle and we must continue to fight it together, indeed our CEO recently told our investors that in 2018 we will continue to put the safety of our community before profits.”Google’s YouTube said, “Over the course of 2017 we have made significant progress through investing in machine learning technology, recruiting more reviewers, building partnerships with experts and collaboration with other companies."" The government’s concern stems from the fact that Islamic terrorism killed 33 people in the UK last year.Products/TechnologyApple Battery Fix Could Be Expensive: Apple reacted quickly to a series of class action lawsuits for deliberately slowing down older iPhones to prevent them from shutting down and encouraging users to upgrade their phones instead of going for the cheaper battery replacement. The company offered a $50 discount on battery replacement on select models, so customers could get them for a mere $29.Now, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz thinks that this move could have a significant impact on new phone sales. That’s because “even a small percentage [of customers] opting for battery replacement over upgrade could have meaningful impact on iPhone sales,” he said. The analyst estimates that around 519 million users are eligible for the battery, although only about 10% are likely to take the $29 offer. If just 30% of these people decide not to buy a new iPhone this year, it could eliminate 16 million iPhone upgrades.Instagram Testing WhatsApp Ties: Facebook is testing a feature that could allow the sharing of Instagram stories to WhatsApp status, just as is now enabled on Facebook. The feature could spur usage of WhatsApp status, allow end-to-end encrypted sharing of stories that still disappear after 24 hours and also improve Instagram versus Snap, the messaging service it copied.Alexa-Powered Smartglasses at CES: Amazon has confirmed that Vuzix smart glasses to be showcased at CES 2018, will be the first with Alexa integration, provided you’re an Amazon customer or decide to become one. Vuzix generally caters to the business-to-business segment and has partnerships with companies like Airbus, DHL and HP, so this could bring bulk sales of Amazon powered devices.The deal is evidence of the success of Amazon’s partner program that allows third-party hardware manufacturers to put the digital assistant into their products. We don’t know yet whether Amazon is making its own AR/VR hardware, but that definitely seems to be in the cards. The greater the number of devices with Alexa integration, the better the chances of selling more products on Amazon.com.Alibaba Supermarkets in Beijing: Alibaba started its Hema line of supermarkets a couple of years ago to support its omnichannel strategy in China. The company currently has 25 such supermarkets. Customers typically download the Hema app and connect with Alibaba's e-commerce platform and payment system. They also shop groceries for delivery or pickup, or order fresh food to be cooked by Hema chefs and delivered. Alibaba is now adding 30 such supermarkets in Beijing, where there are currently just five.Collaborations & M&AGoogle Invests in Chushou: Google led a series D funding round in Chinese online e-sports platform Chushou joining earlier investors Qiming Venture, Shunwei Capital and Alpha X Capital. The service has roughly 8 million streamers and 250,000 live streams a day, according to a joint statement by the companies. About 90 million gamers have registered to watch streams of more than 1,000 games, making Chushou one of the most active mobile gaming online communities in China. With this round, the startup has raised $120 million since its inception in 2015.Google May Sell Zagat: Google is reportedly looking to offload restaurant review guide, which it biught back in 2011 for $151 million. Google’s asking price isn’t known, but the deal would likely involve the Zagat brand name and website. This is most probably not a one-off decision, but part of CFO Porat’s cleaning spree, in which she has gotten rid of other non-core businesses like Boston Dynamics and Tokyo-based Schaft (sold to SoftBank Group) and Terra Bella (sold to Planet Labs).Some NumbersApp Sales in 2017: According to data company Sensor Tower, mobile app revenue, including both Android and iPhone apps and paid downloads and in-app purchases, but not mobile commerce purchases such as GrubHub orders or Uber rides, totaled $58.6 billion in 2017, up from $43.5 billion in 2016. Also, new installs grew 13.5%. While revenue growth was relatively even for Android and iPhone, app downloads grew 16.7% for Android compared to just 6.7% for iPhone, which the firm attributed to Android’s domination in developing markets.Amazon Retail Sales Leader: According to data from e-commerce analytics provider One Click Retail, Amazon accounted for 44% of U.S. ecommerce sales in 2017, or 4% of total retail sales. The firm attributes the success to millennials, as more of them grow up to get their own homes and settle down.Consumer electronics (laptops, headphones and other computer components) was the top grossing category, with Home and kitchen, publishing (which includes books) and sports and outdoors being other top categories. The fastest-growing segments were however luxury beauty (up 47% from a year ago), pantry items (up 38%), grocery (up 33%) and furniture (up 33%). Its private label ranges were also called out as great performers.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

177,AMD,"The technology sector is in focus this week with CES 2018 set to commence today and run through the weekend. Notably, it is an annual technology tradeshow conducted by the Consumer Technology Association every year in January in Las Vegas.Intel Corporation’s (INTC  -  Free Report) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Krzanich during a ‘Prime Keynote’ in the CES 2018 talked about the company’s initiatives in driverless vehicles and powering artificial intelligence (AI) technology through partnerships and strategic deals.Autonomous Vehicles & AI: Key CatalystsIntel revealed a number of partnerships in the space. At the event, the company announced few important partnerships — with BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen AG, and Ferrari — which show Intel’s growing dominance in providing AI platforms which will power future vehicles.It will also leverage Intel’s Mobileye-based mapping technology for improving self-driving cars navigation process.Intel also joined forces with SAIC Motor and NavInfo to extend crowdsourced map building to China. SAIC Motor will build cars of Level 3, 4, and 5. These vehicles will be powered by Mobileye technology, which means it will be able to handle most driving situations itself.Additionally, Intel is also moving ahead in the virtual reality (VR) and and non-VR gaming space. It collaborated with Paramount Pictures for the next-generation VR andnon-VR Challenger League.It is believed that the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium which aims at developing an ecosystem for connected cars to support emerging services such as intelligent driving, the creation of maps with real-time data and driving assistance based on cloud computing, bodes well for Intel.We believe that the company’s focus on the self-driving car market will boost sales of processing chips, sensor-chips, cloud software and many more, which will ultimately drive top-line growth.Krzanich alsoadded that Intel is shaking hands with Ferrari North America to brings its AI technology to the Ferrari Challenge North America Series races to be held on six courses in the United States this year. The Ferrari Challenge will use Intel Xeon Scalable processors chips to enhance the experience to viewers online.Other HighlightsIntel and Micron have also announced a mutual agreement to work separately in order to complete development of their third generation of 3D NAND technology. Intel and Micron will jointly develop the 3D XPoint at the Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (“IMFT”). The product, is expected to sample this year, and could enter production as early as 2019 at their joint facility in Lehigh, UT.Intel is also partnering with Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) Radeon Vega M GPUs with a purpose to use them in its next generation CPUs. Aiming at notebooks and small PCs, this new processor, the 8th Generation Core Processor with Radeon Vega M Graphics will be available starting in spring.Bottom lineWith continued focus on developing new and more advanced AI technologies for self-diving cars, we believe the company is well poised to rapidly penetrate the autonomous car technology market, currently dominated by the likes of NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report).Estimates provided by various research firms further encourage us about Intel’s prospects in the space. According to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self driving cars will be on the roads by 2020.Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion, while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.The company has also gained 34.7% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 28.6%.Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

178,AMD,"Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) yesterday crafted an all-time high of $225 as the company’s recent announcements ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018 made investors more optimistic on its autonomous vehicles opportunity.Even before the biggest tech show of the year officially commences, NVIDIA, during its Jan 7 press conference, revealed why it is poised to be the market leader and a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips which will power future vehicles.During the conference, NVIDIA reported that the long list of autonomous vehicle partners for its AI technology now also include Uber Technologies Inc. and Volkswagen AG. The company’s long list of partners includes Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) and Audi.NVIDIA knows it very well that for the successful operation of autonomous vehicles, a powerful AI supercomputing platform is required. Therefore, the company has also been making efforts to boost its AI capabilities. On this front, NVIDIA has joined forces with companies like Aurora and German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG.NVIDIA’s Journey in Driverless-Cars SpaceNVIDIA forayed into the autonomous vehicle and other automotive electronics space by launching a computer vision system at the CES 2015. It hasn’t looked back since then and has been continuously bringing new and more advanced technologies in the space.At the beginning of 2016, NVIDIA launched DRIVE PX 2 — the world’s most powerful engine for in-vehicle AI. Later that year, in September, this graphic-chip behemoth unveiled an AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Amsterdam.The company, during Sunday’s press conference, mentioned that now over 320 companies are using its DRIVE AI platform to roll out autonomous vehicles on roads. Also, the company stated that the first lot of its new Xavier processors will be delivered in the first quarter of this year.Huge Growth Potential of the IndustryAccording to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self driving cars will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion, while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.These estimates encourage us about NVIDIA’s growth opportunities in the space. With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced technologies for self-diving cars, we believe the company is well poised to capitalize on this opportunity.Bottom LineWith continued focus on developing new and more advanced AI technologies for self-diving cars, we believe the company is well poised to become a leading provider of technology for autonomous vehicles. In this space, the company is already a market leader, outpacing other competitors, such as Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), in terms of growth.NVIDIA remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. Notably, the stock has more than doubled in the last one year, significantly outperforming its industry’s gain of 49.9%.NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

179,AMD,"Some news reports are sensationalized for maximum following like the one from the Register saying that Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) Krzanich sold off a large number of shares because he was fully aware of major security flaws that could send Intel shares down.It’s true that the number of shares involved was significant: he exercised his option to purchase 644,135 shares at $12.985 to $26.795, subsequently selling them at a weighted average price of $44.05. He also sold an additional 245,743 shares to bring his total holding to 250,000 shares, the minimum amount required to be held by the CEO.But it’s also true that the share sale was preplanned in accordance with the 10b5-1(c) rule that allows management to sell a portion of their holdings according to a predetermined schedule without attracting insider trading charges. An SEC filing reveals that this is what happened in this case.Intel was apparently informed about the security gap back in June, which is why there is so much suspicion surrounding the stock sale.A BIG Security ProblemBut since millions of devices and parts of the cloud have been exposed to vulnerabilities, this is a serious matter. Moreover, the two bugs/flaws could allow programs to steal data including passwords stored in a password manager or browser, personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.The first one, called Meltdown affects only Intel processors and Intel is already providing software and firmware updates for this one that could slow down your machine somewhat, but would be mostly imperceptible for most users, according to the company.The second one, called Spectre is much harder to fix and affects Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and ARM-powered devices, so practically every single machine.We now know that chip companies like Intel, AMD, Softbank-owned ARM and some operating system providers are already collaborating on an industrywide solution to the problem. Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) has already said that it’s working on a patch, as is Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is also likely working on it.Intel Says…""Intel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed.""""Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.""""Intel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits.""""Contrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and for the average computer user should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.""Putting That Into PerspectiveIt is a fact that technology is developing as we use it and many of the systems that we are using today are going to get better tomorrow. This happens because of ongoing research and partly also because of efforts to eliminate the problems we face today.The fact that hardware needs to be secured was unknown a few years back. Most mobile devices didn’t even have security software until recently. So while this is a big concern, it’s heartening to note that there are no known cases of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Hopefully then, the top technology companies that we depend on will be able to find a solution before all hell breaks loose.   Price ActionChip makers NVIDIA and AMD are appreciating, as if the security flaw only affects Intel technology and not others. Of course, they still do have a few things going for them, such as cryptocurrencies, which benefits them both and potential in the data center, video game, AI and self-driving car markets, which is particularly beneficial for NVIDIA.Intel of course is taking a beating. Intel shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

180,AMD,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) advertising push, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Schmidt stepping down and a number of lawsuits against Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) for deliberately slowing down older iPhones made headlines as 2017 drew to a close. Here are the details-  Amazon Digital Advertising in 2018CNBC interviews with half a dozen ad buyers and technology partners revealed that Amazon has been honing its skills to make a splash in the advertising business this year. The company already generates about $1.8 billion from advertising according to eMarketer, which has garnered it around 2% market share. This is of course well behind market leaders Google and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which together account for the majority of digital advertising revenue.Amazon has over the years expanded its product range, including digital advertising entertainment options and is increasingly becoming the go-to place for product search. Over the years, a number of surveys and research reports have mentioned that most people start their product searches on Amazon.This position has strengthened because of its review system that helps people do their product research on the platform. Therefore it is a very good place to advertise. Since Amazon also sells the products, it can speed up conversions for advertisers, thus improving their return on investment.   So Amazon has been testing advertising tools across its platform and also outside it (a partnership with mobile advertising company Kargo for example helps it place TV and mobile ads sequentially). Video advertising is also in the cards, especially if it also goes ahead with the plan to launch a freemium video streaming service.Advertisers are no doubt thrilled with the idea of a strong third contender, especially if it’s Amazon, as this could bring down prices. Of course data sharing will be a sore point because Amazon is unlikely to be more willing to part with a key business secret than Google or anybody else for that matter. Still, some media reports say that Amazon is willing to share more data (it generates a treasure trove from all the transactions it processes).The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimates that the digital advertising market exceeded $209 billion in 2017 and expects it to grow another 13% this year. So Amazon has every reason to disrupt it the way it has every other business it targeted.Eric Schmidt Steps DownEric Schmidt is stepping down from his role as executive chairman of Alphabet but will continue as technical advisor (likely related to Sidewalk Labs, deep learning efforts, and healthcare spin-offs, Verily and Calico) and a member of its board. He first joined the company in 2001 as something of an adult member in the Larry Page-Sergey Brin team that founded Google.Schmidt has taken the company from an exciting startup to a tech behemoth of colossal size and has played a particularly important role in Washington. He has also been Google’s public face for long. While no one mentioned a reason for the change, it was described as a necessary transition in his role as decided by himself, Page, Brin and Pichai together.So Google is without a chaperone now and the new breed of managers, of which Pichai and Porat are the main, will take the company forward from here. Schmidt announced the decision in a tweet: “Day-to-day adult supervision no longer needed!” -- referring to a comment that Brin made when he was first hired.Apple Slows Down Aging iPhonesMore than 8 lawsuits have been filed in in U.S. District Courts in California, New York and Illinois seeking class action status to represent users of old iPhones. Another case has also been filed in Israel.The main issue, gleaned from the lawsuits is that Apple deliberately used software updates to slow down older model (iPhone 5, 6 and some 7) phones with underperforming batteries. Apple also didn’t inform users that the issue was with the batteries, instead encouraging them to upgrade their devices to newer, more expensive models.Apple’s apology was wanting. While it said that it “would never do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” all it offered was a one-off $50 discount on replacement batteries for iPhone 6 or later. While it promised to update its operating system to give users ""more visibility into the health of their iPhone's battery,"" it didn’t say it would stop the practice of slowing down the phones. Instead it said that the action was necessary to protect the components of older phones and prevent unexpected shutdowns.So Apple hasn’t extended warranties on its devices to two years like Samsung or Google, nor has it said that if such things happen in the future, it will again discount the batteries.One place where Apple could have been taken to task is France, where another case has been filed against the company. Since 2015, French law specifically makes planned obsolescence, i.e. deliberately reducing the useful life of products, a crime. But since the French law relates to products manufactured in France and most of the iPhone is manufactured elsewhere, Apple has enough room to wiggle out. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL-3.3%+17.9%FB-0.4%+18.9%GOOGL-1.5%+14.5%MSFT+0.0%+25.5%INTC-1.1%+37.9%CSCO-0.6%+22.2%AMZN+0.1%+22.6% Other Stories-CorporateiPhone X Demand Concerns: Following a Bloomberg report quoting Taiwanese newspaper Economic Daily about Apple planning to cut its second quarter (calendar first quarter) iPhone sales forecast  from 50 million units to 30 million units, there were a number of bearish reports on weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone X. But other analysts pointed out that Apple typically issued higher estimates when launching products to keep the pressure on its suppliers.Once supply and demand reached closer to parity these estimates were typically lowered. Moreover, investors shouldn’t be concerned about estimate reductions when even those lowered expectations are higher than the street. Also, since Apple’s valuation is reasonable compared to other leading technology companies, there’s little reason to start selling the shares on this account.   iPhone Price Rise in India: Apple has been in talks with the Indian government about tax and other concessions to start assembling phones in India, but the government doesn’t appear to have budged. On the other hand, on Dec 15, it raised the customs duty on imported electronic goods like TVs, phones etc from 10% to 15%.As a result, Apple, which only assembles the iPhone SE in India, raised the prices of all its other phones by an average 3.5%. So its 256 GB iPhone X model now costs 105,720 rupees ($1,646.61), while the 256 GB iPhone 8 costs 79,420 rupees. The X is up 3.6% and the 8 up 3.1%. All this at a time when its top sales executive in India Sanjay Kaul is leaving the company to be replaced by Michel Coulomb, who recently served as the managing director for Apple in South Asia. Kaul’s inability to negotiate deals with the Narendra Modi government may have had something to do with the change.Apple/Amazon Going to Saudi Arabia: Technology companies Amazon and Apple are in discussions with the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to invest in Saudi Arabia. Amazon has approached the region through AWS, which already has an operations center in neighboring Bahrain.Apple is in talks with SAGIA, Saudi Arabia's foreign investment authority, according to Reuters. There remain significant regulatory hurdles as the legal structure isn’t conducive to attracting foreign investment, but Prince Mohammed has made a lot of progress in that regard as he tries to reduce the country’s dependence on oil. Being something of a technophile himself, he has also joined with Softbank to create a $45 billion technology fund.     Analyst Positive on AMD: Macquarie Group analyst Srini Pajjuri has now turned positive on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) saying that the company is in a better position to charge higher prices for its GPUs and also that it could win back market share with its new line of server chips. He also raised his target price from $10 to $11.However he isn’t betting on its improved competitive position versus Intel (INTC  -  Free Report): “Additional gains will depend on the company’s future roadmap and execution, and we believe it’s too soon to give the company the benefit of the doubt given Intel’s strong product portfolio and entrenched position.”Google Stores in India: Google’s pop up stores in malls like High Street Phoenix in Mumbai and Select Citywalk, Promenade Mall of India in Delhi-NCR have done well. So well in fact that the company is now thinking of setting up “experience centers” across the country, as three people familiar with the matter have told the Indian English daily The Economic Times.The goal is to better showcase its Pixel product line, which is up against very stiff competition from a host of other players including Samsung (which has stores in every nook and corner) and China’s Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo. Google will also benefit from direct interactions with customers, which could help it close sales faster.Trump Wants Postal Service to Hike Rates: Trump has tweeted that he wants the Postal Service, which delivers around 62% of Amazon’s total packages, to hike rates for the items it delivers. Last November, the rates were hiked by around 2%. With rising pension and health care costs, the Postal Service is struggling.Since it has been losing money for 11 straight years, there is reason to be concerned. But Amazon is likely not the reason because its results show that online package deliveries is a business with better-than-expected results.  Amazon’s ‘Digital Day’ Sales Event: As if holiday sales aren’t big enough, Amazon has started a new tradition called Digital Day that was held in 2017 on Friday, December 29. As the name indicates, the focus is on digital sales with more than 5,000 deals covering eight categories including movies, TV shows, mobile games, apps, eBooks, and more. Digital Day was a huge success last year when it launched for the first time enabling it to generate record-breaking sales across digital apps, games and comics.First Alibaba Data Center in India: Alibaba’s (BABA  -  Free Report) first data center in India (33rd globally) will be operational this month. In addition to standard cloud computing services including storage and big data, it will be offering customers elastic computing, database, content delivery, networking, analytics, containers, middleware and security.The company has doubled its revenue every quarter this year and although most of this growth is coming out of China, it has ambitious plans to service customers all over the world, which is why it has data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Australia, the Middle East, Europe and the U.S. Management expects it won’t be long before it gets into direct competition with market leaders Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.Legal/RegulatoryGermany Finds Facebook Guilty: The German Federal Cartel Office has said that its 20-month review of Facebook practices found that the company had abused its dominant position. Facebook disagrees that it is the dominant social network in Germany and said that the characterization was inaccurate.The regulator also frowns upon its practice of monetizing the data of its 2 billion users worldwide. It has also taken exception to Facebook’s practice of collecting third-party data, i.e. data picked up from sites that have a Facebook “like” button that the social network then adds to the data it has already collected on the user. The company does this to build profiles of users for more targeted advertising.Products/TechnologyHuawei Phone Coming Soon: China’s Huawei will launch its flagship Mate 10 in the U.S. next month. The company is partnering with AT&T for the purpose and the two have been working on details over the past year. It will also spend more than $100 million on marketing since the brand remains largely unknown in the U.S. It is, however, well known overseas, with a global market share of 11% and behind only Apple at 13% and Samsung at 22%, according to IDC.Alphabet Debuts New Internet Access Tech in India: Along with local telecom company AP State FiberNet, Alphabet is using Free Space Optical Communications (FSOC) technology to bring connectivity to rural areas of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The technology uses beams of light to deliver high-speed, high-capacity connectivity over long distances, so it is particularly useful to connect remote areas. The project is aligned with the Indian government’s initiative to connect 12 million households to the Internet by 2019.AmazonTube Trademark: TechCrunch reports that TV Answer Man has found trademark applications from Amazon called AmazonTube and OpenTube describing a service providing “non-downloadable pre-recorded audio, visual and audiovisual works via wireless networks on a variety of topics of general interest.” This could be inviting litigation from Google, since the name closely resembles its popular YouTube service.Amazon and Google have been squabbling with each other since Google pulled YouTube from Amazon devices because of violations in its terms of service and later turned it on again briefly. Later, Amazon stopped selling Google video streaming devices. After talks appeared to fall through between the two, Google pulled its YouTube service yet again.Now there seems to be reason to believe that Google dropping YouTube from Amazon devices may have been less of a squabble and more of a strategic decision as the two move toward building their own walled gardens. The TechCrunch report also says that Amazon has registered the domain names AlexaOpenTube.com, AmazonAlexaTube.com and AmazonOpenTube.com.Collaborations and M&AFacebook Licensing Deal with Universal Music: Facebook now has a deal with Universal Music that focuses on copyright infringement. Accordingly, Facebook will no longer require users to take down music from Universal’s catalog for copyright infringement. This should encourage them to share more video.Facebook is also reportedly in talks with Warner Music Group and Sony Music Group, but deals haven’t materialized yet. Facebook has been doing all it can to become more of a destination for video sharing and watching as it attempts to take share from Google’s YouTube and also pull in some TV ad dollars. Its Watch tab was also created for this purpose.Some NumbersApple Smartphone Profit Share Falls: Counterpoint Research’s Market Monitor program for Q3 2017 shows that smartphone profit growth of 13% in the period was driven by Samsung and Chinese brands rather than Apple. Chinese brands have focused on gradually rolling out more premium devices that are priced just slightly lower than Apple and Samsung.They have also been streamlining the supply chain, which has helped them generate profits. So for the first time in as long as I can remember, Apple’s smartphone profit share actually shrank from 86% in the year-ago quarter to 60% this quarter. Samsung’s share went from 26% to 3%. Huawei, Oppo and Vivo accounted for 5%, 4% and 3% of smartphone profits, respectively.Apple Devices See Most Activations: Data from Flurry Analytics shows that Apple was the most popular device during the holidays with 44% of smartphone and tablet activations through the week leading up to Christmas and the end of Chanukkah, same as last year. Samsung’s share went up from 21% to 26%. Huawei took a 5% share with Xiaomi, Motorola, LG and Oppo taking a 3% share each and Vivo the remaining 2%.Older iPhone models (6 and particularly, 7) did better than newer ones, especially in international markets, likely because they were cheaper. Full-size and small tablet share shrank over the past two years, tablet shares grew from 27% in 2015 to 37% the following year and 53% last year. Medium phone share also shrank from 54% in 2015 to 45% in 2016 to 35% last year.Amazon Dominates Online Sales: GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives estimates that Amazon received 45-50% of holiday online retail sales this year, up from 38% during the same period last year despite a strong showing from Walmart, Target and Best Buy. In his words: ""While Walmart is emerging as Amazon's biggest sole competitor online, we believe customer overlap remains small today as Prime membership growth and Amazon's stronghold on e-commerce remain hard to penetrate as we expect this trend to continue to play out in the near-term heading into 2018.""Amazon said plenty of things that indicated it sold a ton of Alexa-enabled devices with the heavily discounted Echo Dot at $29.99 being the best seller.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

181,AMD,"Shares of Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) suddenly dropped more than 3% in yesterday’s trading session after the media reported that the company has encountered a major security issue.The security flaw could let attackers to access security keys, passwords, and cached files of a device's kernel memory. A hacker can access its platform and third-party information taking advantage of the system’s vulnerabilities, consequently posing a huge risk for users. The bug is apparently present in nearly every Intel CPU made within the last decade, and upcoming patches will negatively affect hardware performance.The “kernel” is a core component of the operating system that is tasked with managing the communication between hardware and software. The patches necessary to fix the bug will move the kernel into an entirely different address space, making the communication process more time consuming and less efficient.Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Linux programmers are rolling out patches to fix Linux and Windows kernels in order to address the vulnerability. The Register suggested that these patches will result in “a ballpark figure of five to 30 percent slow down, depending on the task and the processor model.”The company has also gained just 28% in a year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 53.2%.Impact on its RivalOn the contrary, while Intel’s shares went down, its closest rival  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) climbed more than 5% in morning trading session on Wednesday after the company stated ""near zero risk to AMD processors at this time"" by this major security bug.“AMD processors are not subject to the types of attacks that the kernel page table isolation feature protects against,” AMD engineer Tom Lendacky confirmed.Last WordsHowever, its never too late, and Intel’s current approach related to fixing the security issue is likely to help it regain customer confidence. We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in data centers of cloud-based service providers like Amazon.com, Alphabet and Microsoft is a key catalyst for the company.Intel has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 9.75%.Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

182,AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise more than 5% on the day.

183,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) climbed more than 6% in morning trading Wednesday after the company announced that its processors are not affected by a major security bug that has plagued chips made by competitor Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).According to a report from The Register, Intel and affected software developers have been scrambling to fix a hardware issue that could let attackers access security keys, passwords, and cached files. The bug is apparently present in nearly every Intel CPU made within the last decade, and upcoming patches will negatively affect hardware performance.The root of the problem is a fundamental design flaw that is forcing Linux programmers and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) developers to overhaul Linux and Windows kernels in order to “defang” the bug. In the context of computing, the “kernel” is a core component of the operating system that is tasked with managing the communication between hardware and software.The patches necessary to fix the bug will move the kernel into an entirely different address space, making the communication process more time consuming and less efficient.“Really, this shouldn't be needed, but clearly there is a flaw in Intel's silicon that allows kernel access protections to be bypassed in some way,” wrote The Register’s John Leyden and Chris Williams.Intel has attempted to keep the issue under wraps, but an embargo on the specifics of the problem is reportedly set to be lifted early this month. Microsoft is expected to release a patch next Tuesday, while a Linux patch date is less clear. The Register estimates these patches will result in a 5% to 30% slow down, depending on the task and processor model.Shares of Intel were down more 2.3% in morning trading hours Wednesday. Meanwhile, AMD shares popped more than 6% to continue a two-day surge that has watched the stock gain nearly 14%.“AMD processors are not subject to the types of attacks that the kernel page table isolation feature protects against,” AMD engineer Tom Lendacky confirmed.Interestingly, the news comes just one day after a collaboration between Intel and AMD grabbed headlines. On Tuesday, via a post on Intel India’s website, we learned that Intel’s highly-anticipated upcoming CPU with AMD Radeon graphics, the Intel Core i7-8809G, will feature AMD’s high-end graphics cores, as opposed to the lower grade “Polaris” GPU.The inclusion of AMD’s high-performance GPU underscores Intel’s intent to make the new processor a reasonable option for serious video gamers, who need top-of-the-line hardware to power e-sports games like League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive at competitive framerates.AMD’s recent surge follows an almost two-week downturn that coincided with volatility throughout the technology sector. Profit taking and portfolio rebalancing throughout the month of December cooled down some of the hottest tech stocks, but the space has started 2018 on a high note.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

184,AMD,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) were up more than 6% in early afternoon trading Tuesday. The surge, which follows a nearly two-week slump to end 2017, comes on the back of new details related the chipmaker’s collaboration with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).According to a potentially accidental post on Intel India’s website, Intel’s highly-anticipated upcoming CPU with AMD Radeon graphics, the Intel Core i7-8809G, will feature AMD’s high-end graphics cores, as opposed to the lower grade “Polaris” GPU.The news that the i7-8809G will pack a serious punch is encouraging for both Intel and AMD. Customers these days need top-of-the-line hardware to power e-sports games like League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive at competitive framerates, and it looks like Intel’s chip will be a legitimate option for serious gamers.Meanwhile, AMD was forced to respond to concerned gamers after an update to its Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition left some titles unplayable. The update was intended to fix a few of the program’s kinks, but instead, the driver caused critical errors on some older DirectX 9-based games, including Witcher and Command & Conquer.AMD nearly caused an uproar when an employee’s post on a company forum seemed to imply that the affected games were not important enough to be fixed.“This title [Command & Conquer] is from 2007, so we are unlikely to devote any valuable engineering resources to this issue, which is most likely caused by outdated API modules,” wrote AMD support engineer “Ray_M.”But the company was able to restore confidence after AMD Software chief Terry Makedon confirmed that the bug will be patched.“I am seeing some stories pop up about AMD not supporting some old games. That is absolutely not true, we are identifying the bug and working on a fix asap. C&C, Witcher, BfME, etc will be working again,” Makedon tweeted.After closing at $10.28 per share last week, AMD marched more than 6.8% higher to touch an intraday high of $10.98 early Tuesday afternoon. The two aforementioned headlines are likely not the primary catalyst for today’s gains, but they do underscore the chipmaker’s strong start to 2018.AMD is also benefitting from a rebound in tech stocks following a month of volatility throughout the sector. Tech stocks dominated Wall Street throughout 2017, but profit taking and portfolio rebalancing caused a noticeable pullback in some of the year’s hottest stocks throughout December.Nevertheless, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained more than 1.3% during the first trading period of the New Year.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

185,AMD,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has generated significant returns for investors last year and has the potential to exceed expectations this year as well. The stock has soared 81.3% in the past one year, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 46%.Let’s check out the reasons for this impressive surge in share price and consider why NVIDIA will continue its momentum in this year as well.Key CatalystsNVIDIA’s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs have kept it well positioned. Last year launch of GeForce NOW and SHIELD TV remained key growth drivers. The recently introduced TITAN V graphics processing unit (“GPU”) is another tailwind.The company is in the process of gaining market share among gaming service providers, thereby strengthening its position in the workstation-based gaming services in supercomputing segments. The advanced gaming cards also add value to PC manufacturers. NVIDIA has decided to license its graphics IP, which should generate strong revenues.Moreover, its chips meant for the industries such as artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, machine learning technologies, advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) as well as data centers are further positives as these industries have started gaining momentum. NVIDIA’s focus on GRID platforms can increase GPU adoption in data centers, giving it an advantage against its competitors.Furthermore, the company’s partnership with Japanese company — Komatsu — to bring in AI computing platform to the construction and mining equipment industry is a testament of its AI initiatives. Its alliance with Baidu for bringing in AI technology in cloud-computing services, self-driving vehicles and home assistance spaces will stoke growth going ahead.NVIDIA Corporation Revenue (TTM) NVIDIA Corporation Revenue (TTM) | NVIDIA Corporation QuotePositive Estimate RevisionThe stock has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity in the last 30 days. Estimates for the current quarter have risen from $1.13 per share to $1.15 per share, while for fiscal 2018 estimates have risen from $4.13 per share to $4.19 per share. It has also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 33.5% in the trailing four quarters.Notably, Semiconductor – General industry to which NVIDIA belongs currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 4 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to the other segments.Bottom LineNVIDIA remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. Given the accelerated momentum in AI, gaming, datacenter and automotive technology, we believe this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, with a long-term EPS growth estimate of 11.2%, will continue to rally in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Many might argue that NVIDIA, with its hefty forward P/E valuation of 46.2x, compared with the industry average of 19.4x, is a risky bet. Nevertheless, we beg to differ as high valuations and increasing share prices do not necessarily indicate that the stock does not have much upside potential left.NVIDIA has grabbed attention with striking performances on the back of impressive earnings results and strong growth projections.Furthermore, with its continued efforts toward attaining a leading position in several emerging industries such as AI, deep learning and driverless cars industry, NVIDIA has outpaced others in the space, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report), in terms of growth.Therefore, we believe investing in this stock will yield promising returns for your portfolio in the short term.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

186,AMD,"Shares of several of the investing social media world’s favorite stocks—including Energous (WATT  -  Free Report) and Longfin —moved higher on Wednesday morning. Check out why these companies, along with three others, had investors excited today!EnergousShares of Energous opened more than 80% higher today after the company said federal regulator approved its “WattUp” wireless charging device. The Mid Field transmitter is capable of sending power to electronic devices at a distance of up to three feet. Its approval marks the FCC’s first certification of power-at-a-distance technology.“Untethered, wire-free charging -- such as charging a fitness band even while wearing it -- is exactly what consumers have been waiting for. We are now in a position to move our consumer electronics, IoT and smart home customers forward at an accelerated pace,” Energous CEO Stephen R. Rizzone said in a press release.LongfinLongfin shares were up more than 8% through morning trading hours Wednesday. Last week, Longfin emerged as a cryptocurrency proxy stock after acquiring Ziddu.com, a blockchain company focused on micro lending and warehouse financing.Over the last several trading periods, we have seen stocks like LFIN respond to price movements in the major cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin has slipped more than 4% over the past 24 hours, while Ethereum has slumped about 1% and Litcoin has moved about 3.5% lower.Still, these cryptos have recovered from Friday’s massive sell-off, and Longfin’s subsequent rally could be a sign of renewed interest in crypto proxy plays.Blue ApronShares of struggling meal-kit delivery company Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) gained about 3.6% in morning trading. While there is no clear news inspiring today’s trading, investors should note that the company’s post-IPO lockup period ended yesterday.Lockup expirations tend to send young stocks lower, as employees cash out of their personal holdings and flood the market with new shares. However, with APRN at such a low price level right now, it is possible that the lockup expiration did not inspire mass selling, causing a slight rebound.Advanced Micro Devices Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) shares popped over 2% in morning hours Wednesday, continuing their trend of unpredictability. Prior to today’s gains, AMD had lost nearly 6% over the previous four trading periods. The stock appears to be testing a new support line near $10 per share, having dipped below this level briefly over the last month. Today’s bounce appears to be a rebound from just below $10.50.XPO LogisticsShares of logistics services giant XPO Logistics (XPO  -  Free Report) moved more than 4.5% higher on Wednesday morning. The moves comes on the back of reports that Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) has held internal discussions about an acquisition bid for the company over the past several months.XPO has reportedly been targeted by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) as a potential partner for its furniture delivery push, so Home Depot’s interest could be centered on keeping the logistics company away from the e-commerce king.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

187,AMD,"Investors in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19th 2018 $3.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Top 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 4 cents per share to 5 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

190,AMD,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) unveiled a new TITAN V graphics processing unit (“GPU”) for the PCs at annual Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Long Beach, CA. The new TITAN V is built on the NVIDIA Volta architecture-based GPUs.The all new Titan V desktop for PCs is particularly targeted at machine learning and artificial intelligence (“AI”), an area where the company has worked hard in order to establish itself in this space in recent years.Notably, the stock has been clocking solid returns of 109.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of about 46.8%.What’s the Specialty?TITAN V is integrated on the new TSMC 12-nanometer FFN high-performance manufacturing process. The 12GB HBM2 video memory card offers enhanced graphics capabilities is likely to enthral gamers.Per the company, the new TITAN V which is built on 21.1 billion transistors is capable of delivering 110 teraflops of performance, which is more than 9x times more powerful compared with its predecessor, the Titan Xp, which was announced in April, this year. The all new GPU is immediately available priced at $2,999.With the launch of TITAN V, NVIDIA can maximize user experience by offering high performance computing (“HPC”) capabilities. Further, these GPUs are touted to be more energy efficient than the earlier versions. Consequently, the launch of this product will enable the company to increase customer base and also help in garnering additional revenues.We also believe that this launch will provide NVIDIAan edge against Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (AMD  -  Free Report), new Radeon RX Vega 56 and 64 graphics cards, which were released in August this year. In fact, this launch is a testimony to NVIDIA’s foray into the high-end graphics card market.PC Gaming and Graphics Card MarketPer Gartner, PC shipments declined 3.6% in the third quarter of 2017. However, growth of the high-end PC market that includes gaming PCs was better than expected.Per Jon Peddie Research (“JPR”), with an increase in the number of people engaging in PC gaming, the related hardware market is experiencing a huge boost. Per the research firm, the market exceeded $30 billion mark in 2016 and is anticipated to witness compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% through 2019.Growth in the gaming hardware market is driving demand for graphics processors as well. Per Allied Market Research, the GPU market is anticipated to reach $157.1 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2016 to 2022.Per JPR, in third-quarter 2017, the graphics board shipments increased 29.1% sequentially and 21.5% year over year. NVIDIA continues to be a leader with 72.8% share, while AMD’s market share was 69.7%.We believe that the launch of the new graphics cards will help NVIDIA maintain its market share going forward.Bottom LineNVIDIA is the world’s biggest graphic processing hardware provider for PCs. The company’s efforts toward autonomous vehicle and the AI segment shows that it intends to be the largest player in the self-driving and machine learning arena too. Furthermore, the company will be able to reduce dependency on the PC industry by expanding business avenues, which is currently declining.Given the accelerated momentum in gaming, datacenter and automotive technology, we believe that this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a long-term EPS growth estimate of 10.3% will continue to rally.

191,AMD," Bitcoin skyrocketed to another new record high above $13,000 today. It is now up more than 1,200% this year while its market cap has risen to over $229 billion.The cryptocurrency has been surging of late thanks mainly to optimism generated by plans for bitcoin futures. Last week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) granted regulatory approval for listing of bitcoin futures on two of the world’s largest futures exchanges.The CBOE announced it would begin trading bitcoin futures on December 10. The CME would launch bitcoin futures contracts on December 18.Nasdaq has also joined the race and is planning to launch bitcoin futures as early as the second quarter of 2018.Launch of futures would be a major step in the cryptocurrency becoming mainstream, as derivatives will provide much needed liquidity and also legitimacy to it.Many traders and investors have avoided bitcoin due to its extreme volatility. Derivatives will provide them an easy way to bet on the price of cryptocurrency, both up and down, as well as hedge their exposure. Further, many institutional investors are prohibited from investing in bitcoin directly and derivatives would provide them a way to invest in it.Traders love volatility and with stock market volatility so low over the past few months, many of them may embrace bitcoin to make (or lose) money on its wild price swings.Bitcoin price may get further boost as it becomes mainstream. On the other hand, it will also provide an opportunity to skeptics of bitcoin to short it as making negative bets on it are not easily possible as of now.Futures are also expected to pave the way for approval of bitcoin ETFs. ETFs would provide investors a convenient way to get exposure to bitcoin.Earlier this year, the SEC had rejected bitcoin ETF applications including one proposed by Winklevoss twins but they are now reviewing the decision again.There were some filing for ETFs that track bitcoin derivatives.  However, they were withdrawn since the SEC does not review filing for a fund where the underlying instruments are not yet available.Launch of futures would definitely increase the chances of a bitcoin ETF.Four sponsors have recently filed for blockchain technology ETFs. Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

192,AMD,"The marvelous run of the semiconductor stocks that started in the second half of 2016 seems to be fading with one bad news after another. The industry, which is still reeling under the effect of Morgan Stanley’s Nov 27 report on NAND prices, received a new blow last Friday in the form of a corporate tax rate cut, which, analysts believe will hurt the entire technology sector.The House and Senate, on Dec 1, approved the government’s proposal of cutting the corporate tax rate to 20% from the current 35%. This is a huge achievement for President Trump, as he will be able to fulfill one of his most ambitious electoral commitments in nearly more than a year of his election.However, this does not go well with the technology stocks as the sector enjoys several tax benefits and therefore has lower effective tax rate. Citing the S&P Global data, Bloomberg stated, “Among sectors, the 18.5 percent effective tax rate enjoyed by the group is the third-lowest among U.S. large caps.”Analysts believe immediate beneficiaries of the recent tax reforms will be companies across sectors like finance, telecom, consumer discretionary and industrials which fall under the high tax bracket.In such a scenario, investors are likely to move their funds into sectors that will gain the most due to the latest tax reform. In fact, the process has already started, as reflected by the 2% decline in the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) value over the last two trading days.Semiconductor Stocks Worst AffectedAlthough tech heavyweights, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, witnessed fall on Friday’s tax cut news, semiconductor stocks have been affected the most.In the semiconductor space, some prominent stocks like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) have plunged nearly 7.9%, 7% and 5.9%, respectively since the news surfaced. Also, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) has lost approximately 3.5% of its value in the last two trading days.Cash In Before the Super Cycle EndsThe latest tax reform has also fueled the controversy about the end of the semiconductor super cycle, which first sparked in late November, when Morgan Stanley downgraded several memory chip makers on concerns of declining NAND prices and disappointing earnings growth projection for 2018.Some analysts also believe semiconductor stocks will witness massive corrections in share prices due to their hefty valuation. Investors are likely to pull back their investments from tech stocks and look for other sectors which have potentials of giving higher returns.Looking at the current scenario and hefty valuations of semiconductor stocks, it is wise to cash in your investment before the stocks start tumbling drastically.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

193,AMD,"The fortunes of server vendors have returned it seems, as worldwide server revenues and shipments marked the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, that too after five straight quarters of decline, per International Data Corporation (“IDC”).According to the data compiled by the research firm, worldwide server revenues jumped a whopping 19.9% year over year to $17 billion in third-quarter 2017, while overall shipment grew 11.1% to 2.67 million units.IDC noted growth at every segment with revenues of volume servers rising 19.3% year over year to $14.2 billion, while the mid-range server registered growth of 26.9% to $1.4 billion. Also, high-end system revenues reached $1.3 billion, representing growth of 19.4%, mainly benefiting from the launch of International Business Machines’ (IBM) z14 this quarter.Also, x86 servers retained their growth momentum during the quarter. IDC figured out a 20.4% year-over-year rise in x86 server revenues, reaching $15.4 billion, while revenues from non-x86 servers witnessed an increase of 15.1% to $1.5 billion.Hyperscalers, New Processors Availability Fueled the UpsurgePer IDC, the upsurge in the third quarter was driven by strong demand from hyperscale data-center service providers which made a huge push in server deployment. According to the firm, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) continued with its server deployment efforts which contributed to the majority of volume demand.In the quarter, IDC noticed that Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) ramped up their server deployments to grab market share in the cloud service space, which also boosted overall demand for servers.The second major reason outlined by IDC was the availability of Intel's (INTC  -  Free Report) new Skylake processors and “Purley” platform, and Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) EPYC processors. It should be noted that hyperscale data-center service providers have waited for months for these processors.Top VendorsWith respect to individual server manufacturers, on the revenue front, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) retained its leading position with 19.5% market share, followed by Dell’s 18.1%. During the quarter, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the market share difference with HPE, chiefly benefiting from “the strong synergy between its server team and the storage team incorporated from the EMC acquisition”, per IDC.Moreover, HPE is now focusing on enterprise market and “pivoting away” from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. However, according to IDC, this will help the company strengthen its position in the enterprise market. However, HPE’s loss has benefited Dell in grabbing market share in the hyperscale segment.Going forward, the third position was a tie between IBM and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report). This is because IDC calls it a statistical tie when the difference among vendors is 1% or less. Therefore, if we look at the actual revenues, then IBM holds the third position with 6.4%, while Cisco has the fourth position with 5.8%. Lenovo secured the fifth place, with a market share of 5.1%.Furthermore, IDC provided revenues and shipment data for ODM Direct group of vendors. These vendors continue to record huge year-over-year growth in revenues and market share as large datacenters find it attractive to custom build their server designs at potential volume prices.In addition to the above, in terms of volume, Dell and HPE jointly secured the top position, with market share of 18.8% each. However, if we look at the actual number of units shipped, Dell continues to lead with 503,000 units compared with HPE’s 501,400 units.Lenovo, Inspur Electronics, Super Micro and Huawei occupied the third position, which ended the quarter with market shares of 5.7%, 5.6%, 5.1% and 5%, respectively.Regional PerformanceRegion wise, IDC noted server market growth across every region, with Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan and China) witnessing the fastest growth with 30.6% increase. This was followed by China recording 23.9%, USA 19.7%, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 19.5%, and Canada 14.5% reporting increase. Further, Japan and Latin America registered improvement of 8.5% and 2.4%, respectively, during the recently-reported quarter.Bottom LineLooking forward, we believe the global server market will continue to grow in the quarters ahead, mainly due to the further push of hyperscale server deployments by cloud service providers. In our opinion, there is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server infrastructure space, with more and more companies shifting to cloud-based storage.Also, Gartner’s latest forecast for IT spending depicts a favorable tech spending environment, which, we believe, will positively influence the overall server market in the near term.Looking at the improving IT spending and server deployment push by data-center service providers across different geographies, we believe the overall performance of vendors will improve over the next few quarters.Currently, HPE, IBM and Cisco carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

194,AMD,"A successful investor understands the importance of retaining well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals. Though there may be some concerns regarding the stock but they are transitory in nature.Ambarella Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. It has rallied 52.8% year to date, outperforming 9.2% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Upbeat Q3 ResultsAmbarella reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2018, keeping its earnings streak alive for the 10th time in a row. In fact, the company beat its projections at every point — revenues and margins.The company’s fiscal third-quarter revenues of $89.1 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89 million and came toward the higher-end of management’s guidance range of $87.5-$90.5 million. Moreover, excluding sales to GoPro, revenues were up 7.2% to $70.6 million. Sales to GoPro significantly declined year over year from $34.6 million to $18.4 million.On per share basis, the company’s earnings came in at 75 cents, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryAmbarella has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 12.8%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 14.7%.Other Growth DriversAmbarella is well known for its market leading high performance video processing SoCs, which consume lowest power in this space. The company’s proprietary video and image processing SoCs are highly configurable, providing it a cost and power advantage against rivals, which use multiple expensive semiconductors in their video and image processing solutions. This makes Ambarella a suitable choice for wearable camera, IP camera, automotive dashboard cameras and drone camera makers.In a move to diversify business and lower dependency on GoPro, Ambarella has forayed into the VR camera space by launching H3 SoC in January this year. The company claims that the chip will work wonderfully for high-end drones and VR cameras. Although it will be very tough for Ambarella to compete against well established players such as NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro (AMD  -  Free Report), we believe that given its track record of innovation, the company has the potential to strengthen its position in the space.Risk RemainsNonetheless, the company’s disappointing guidance for the forthcoming quarter as well as downbeat revenue outlook for fiscal 2018 makes us increasingly cautious about its near-term prospect.Going forward, the company faces three main challenges, the risk of losing its largest customer, GoPro; weakness in the drone market and increasing threat from QUALCOMM (QCOM  -  Free Report), which is acquiring NXP Semiconductors to augment its presence in the same space.Other Key PicksCurrently, Ambarella carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.                                                                                                                                                 Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

195,AMD,"Bitcoin is touching new highs every week and this morning it reached the historic milestone of $11,000 for the first time. Once considered as a mysterious investment, Bitcoin has gained huge popularity this year, with more and more people expressing their interest in buying the cryptocurrency.But is it worth buying a digital coin for over $10,000, particularly when it has soared nearly 800% in less than a year? After all, the way it is crafting fresh highs every week, it depicts the very nature of a speculative valuation.Notable financial market experts have criticized bitcoins with Jamie Dimon, CEO of U.S. banking major JPMorgan Chase & Co., calling it a ‘fraud.’ Although we would refrain from using such harsh words, the sudden spurt surely indicates massive risk.Hence, we prefer to be cautious as far as investing in bitcoin is concerned despite its massive growth prospects. Instead, we recommend investing in stocks that have a diversified product portfolio, including exposure to cryptocurrencies. Although this strategy will not generate as much returns as bitcoins, it will likely provide a cushion once the bubble bursts.Smart investors should have a look at NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) which makes chips that power cryptocurrency mining. Notably, miners require advanced hardware to smoothly run parallel processing. Hence, they need powerful processors and chips. NVIDIA’s graphics processing units (GPU) are believed to be the best in creating bitcoin.As NVIDIA is well known for offering more advanced and fast GPUs — it is the first choice of most miners. However, revenues from sales of GPUs related to cryptocurrency, contribute a meager portion to the company’s total revenues.Therefore, any downfall in the cryptocurrency market will not have any material impact on NVIDIA’s revenues. The company has much more exposure in other fast-growing markets, including artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, datacenter and automotive, which are witnessing tremendous year-over-year growth for the past several quarters.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has rallied 97.4% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, outperforming the industry’s return of 45.9% to which it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another pick is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) which is also one of the leading manufacturers of GPUs. However, like NVIDIA, Advanced Micro has little exposure in the space and derives majority of its revenues from other fast-growing markets, including AI, gaming, datacenter and automotive. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 25.4% in the last year. Overstock.com, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) is our next choice, which through its subsidiary tZERO, is trying to utilize blockchain technology in the financial markets. Notably, blockchain is a platform on which bitcoin operates. The platform stores a decentralized account of all bitcoin transactions, and is updated by all network users.However, its main business is e-commerce, which will help the company recover from any drastic fall in the bitcoin market. The Zacks Rank #3 stock has soared 229.2% YTD, outperforming the industry’s gain of 65.1% to which it belongs to.Investors can also look for Square Inc. (SQ  -  Free Report), which is a provider of payments and point-of-sale solutions globally. The company has recently announced that it is testing support for bitcoin through its mobile application, Cash App. By adding this feature, it is offering a platform to its users for buying and selling bitcoin.Analysts believe Square is well capable of handling crypto transactions at the physical point of sale. We anticipate that the increasing acceptance of these payment modes across a wide spectrum of businesses will result in handsome earnings and revenue growth.However, if there is any downfall in the bitcoin business, the company’s other platform will mitigate most of the loss. This Zacks Rank #3 company has gained 212.2% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, outperforming the industry’s return of 34.9%, to which it belongs to.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

196,AMD,"Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) have been up more than 100% this year. This is a very good ride when, you, as an investor, intend to cash in on the gain. However, we would suggest you to think twice, as the stock has plenty of potential to ride higher and generate more solid returns over the next few months.Given the recent optimism surrounding the stock, we believe it is just a matter of some months that the stock will breach the $250 mark.In fact, the company, between its Q2 and Q3 earnings results (Oct 10 to Nov 9), gained approximately 25%. Therefore, given its splendid Q3 results, the $250 mark is still a conservative view, as this only represents a 15% upside from Friday’s closing price of $216.96.Shares of NVIDIA have gained a whopping 103.3% year to date (YTD). If you still haven’t taken advantage of this appreciation yet, this is the right time to add the stock to your portfolio. Notably, NVIDIA has substantially outperformed the industry to which it belongs to, which has gained 47.2% YTD. Bullish Analysts’ View to Aid the UpsideMajority of analysts have been optimistic about NVIDIA’s performance since the beginning of 2017 and raising their target prices quarter after quarter. The latest to join this group is Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets, which raised its target price to $250 from $240.Mitch noted that the recent upgrade in target price is in the wake of NVIDIA’s recently reported overwhelming third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. He believes the stock is poised to carry this bullish momentum ahead, in turn boosting the company’s share price. Mitch in his note, which was covered by Marketwatch, wrote, ""Overall, after a single quarter of out-performance the 2020 upside case increases by 10%.""Moreover, Mitch stated that increasing use of cryptocurrencies is driving demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs, as it helps create digital currencies like Ethereum, Monero, Cash and bitcoin gold. He believes the company will continue to witness demand for its GPUs from miners.Other investment firms, which also raised their target price recently, include B. Riley and Mizuho. While B. Riley increased its target price to $270 from $250, Mizuho raised it to $225 from $220.Most analysts believe NVIDIA will dominate the Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip market in the near future, similar to its performance in the gaming and data center markets. A few months back, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s analyst, Vivek Arya, and Evercore ISI’s analyst — C.J. Muse — noted that NVIDIA is well poised to dominate the AI market.Arya, in a note written to clients, had mentioned, “Similar to other large successful tech industries, we expect the $30bn AI chip market to also feature one dominant supplier – we think NVDA.” On the other hand, Muse noted that the company is well poised to get the “first-mover advantage” and will continue maintaining its sturdy presence in the AI training system.Bottom LineNVIDIA remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. Given the accelerated momentum in AI, gaming, datacenter and automotive technology, we believe this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, with long-term EPS growth estimate of 11.2%, will continue to rally in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Many might argue that NVIDIA, with its hefty forward P/E valuation of 52.6x, compared with the industry average of 20.3x, is a risky bet. Nevertheless, we beg to differ as high valuations and increasing share prices do not necessarily indicate that the stock does not have much upside potential left.NVIDIA has grabbed attention with striking performances on the back of impressive earnings results and strong growth projections.Furthermore, with its continued efforts toward attaining robust position in several emerging industries such as AI, deep learning and driverless cars industry, NVIDIA has outpaced other competitors in the space, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and STMicroelectronics (STM  -  Free Report), in terms of growth.Therefore, we believe investing in this stock will yield promising returns for your portfolio in the short term.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

197,AMD,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 19.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsAMD reported non-GAAP earnings of 10 cents per share compared with 3 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents per share.Revenues increased 26% year over year and 34% sequentially to $1.64 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 billion. The quarterly revenue figure was also the highest since 2011, primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s product portfolio comprising Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon Vega.Quarter DetailsComputing and Graphics segment revenues witnessed year-over-year increase of 74% to $890 million. The growth was backed by accelerated sales of Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors.Operating income for this segment was $70 million against a loss of $66 million in third-quarter 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues.Client computing revenues recorded strong double-digit growth from the year-ago quarter driven by solid demand for the expanded Ryzen processor family in the desktop market. Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 processors constitute around 40% to 50% of the desktop market share. Additionally, the accelerated ramp up of shipments by OEM customers prior to the holiday season has increased adoption as well.Ryzen 3 processor has expanded the company’s foothold in the mainstream segment. Moreover, Ryzen Threadripper processors have enabled AMD to re-enter the high end desktop market. Notably, the company’s Ryzen PRO-based offerings have already been adopted by prominent commercial PC providers including Dell, Lenovo, and HP.The company achieved record Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) revenues on the back of improved average selling price (ASP) and higher unit shipments compared with the year-ago quarter.The company’s release of Vega-based GPUs and increasing demand for its Polaris products in both gaming and blockchain industries led to improved revenues. Launched during the quarter, Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs aimed at gaming enthusiasts has performed better than previous Radeon GPUs.Additionally, AMD started the shipment of Radeon Instinct MI25 to major cloud data center customers and Radeon Pro WX 9100 graphics cards to the high-end content creation market during the quarter.Notably, the company entered into a partnership with Baidu during the quarter to focus on “optimizing” software for AMD’s Radeon Instinct GPUs in Baidu datacenters. Moreover, Amazon Web Services announced that it is powering Amazon AppStream 2.0 with AMD Radeon Pro technology, aimed at driving cloud delivery of virtual applications.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenues amounted to $824 million, almost flat year over year but up 46% sequentially. However, higher costs brought down operating income for the segment from $136 million to $84 million for the quarter.The sequential increase in revenues was based on an increase in semi-custom revenues. Management expects the trend to continue in the holiday season.The ramping up of EPYC datacenter processors sale to cloud and OEM customers has boosted server revenues. Management remains optimistic about this product with companies like Tencent and JD.com planning to deploy the company’s EPYC processors.Baidu and Microsoft also announced plans of deploying EPYC based products in their hyperscale environment, which is another positive for AMD.MarginsGross margin increased 400 basis points (bps) to 35% year-on-year backed by a favorable product mix in the Computing and Graphics segment and IP-related revenues. Management noted that ramping up of high performance products will continue to have a positive impact on margins.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $191 million compared with $103 million in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAMD ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $879 million compared with $844 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was $32 million.GuidanceNotably, fourth-quarter 2017 is a 13-week quarter while the year-ago quarter comprised 14 weeks. Management expects revenues to decrease approximately 15% sequentially (+/-) 3%. At the mid-point, revenue growth is expected to be 26% on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 35% while non-GAAP operating expenses are anticipated to be around $410 millionThe company expects 2017 revenues to witness a more than 20% increase, better than a mid-to-high teens percentage guided earlier.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimate flatlined during the past month. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower. VGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than growth investors.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

198,AMD,"The U.S. stock market witnessed a strong start to 2018 given that last year’s bullishness remained intact. The S&P 500 index topped 2,700 for the first time led by technology stocks.Investors are bargain hunting tech stocks after the recent sell-off given the high potential of growth in the sector. In particular, chipmakers are driving most of the rally in the New Year with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index surging 1.7% in its strongest two-day performance since June 2016.Fed minutes and upbeat manufacturing data also added to the strength. Although Fed officials remained wary over future inflation, they expressed growing confidence in the strength of the labor market and the economy.

199,AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) recently announced that Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s (HPE  -  Free Report) new ProLiant DL385 Gen10 server, which is powered by AMD’s EPYC processor has set new records across SPECrate2017_fp_base and SPECfp_rate2006.Notably, HPE Cloudline CL3150 server already uses EPYC processors. Enriched with 8-core to 32-core designing, eight channels of memory and support for high-speed I/O with 128 lanes of PCIe 3, AMD EPYC processors are well poised to cater to memory bandwidth requirement of this typical HPE server.We believe this to be a positive for AMD’s top line, which increased 26% year over year and 34% sequentially to $1.64 billion in third-quarter 2017. The quarterly revenue figure was also the highest since 2011.The ramp up of the company’s EPYC datacenter processors sale to cloud and OEM customers boosted server revenues during the quarter. Companies like Tencent and JD.com are planning to deploy the company’s EPYC processors. Moreover, Baidu and Microsoft also announced plans of deploying EPYC based products in their hyperscale environment, which is another positive for AMD. Growth DriversAMD primarily has two reportable segments — Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities) and Computing and Graphics (focused on the traditional PC market).The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment saw a 46% sequential increase, primarily driven by semi-custom revenues. The trend is expected to continue in the holiday season.AMD’s Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors backed Computing and Graphics segment’s third-quarter revenues that increased 74% from the year-ago quarter. Solid demand for the expanded Ryzen processor family in the desktop market was another tailwind. Notably, the availability of Ryzen Threadripper processors has enabled AMD to re-enter the high end desktop market.The company’s release of Vega-based GPUs and increasing demand for its Polaris products in both gaming and blockchain industries were positives for the top line as well. Additionally, better performance of the recently launched Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs aimed at gaming enthusiasts is anticipated to be beneficial for the company.Notably, the company entered into a partnership with Baidu during the quarter to focus on “optimizing” software for AMD’s Radeon Instinct GPUs at Baidu datacenters. Moreover, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Web Services announced that it is powering Amazon AppStream 2.0 with AMD Radeon Pro technology, aimed at driving cloud delivery of virtual applications.We believe these launches and partnerships will drive the company’s top line, thereby providing AMD with a competitive edge against peers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
