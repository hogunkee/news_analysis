15,EW,"Motivated by a goal to create meaning in his work, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) CEO Mike Mussallem pushed boundaries to follow his passion for helping people live their best lives.In the process, Mussallem and his team have transformed Edwards into the global leader in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease, as well as critical care and surgical monitoring.Mussallem believes the key to a leader's success is finding meaning in work.""When I talk to folks that are developing leaders, I strongly encourage people to find meaning in their work because it allows you to be your best and might even surprise you in terms of how much impact you can have,"" Mussallem told IBD.For Mussallem, the meaning in his work is ""to impact individual patients with life-changing and lifesaving technologies.""Such thinking has been the driving force behind Edwards' ""patient first"" culture and innovation strategy. And it's led to Edwards' introduction of lifesaving and life-sustaining therapies such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), rapid-deployment surgical heart valve replacement and noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring.But it took Mussallem some soul searching to identify his true calling.""Early on I worked to try to pull myself up; I helped to pay for my education by working in the steel mills,"" he said. ""At that time in my younger years, I was probably more focused on how big my paycheck was and how good the benefits were. It probably wasn't until I joined health care in 1979 that I started thinking about doing something that really mattered to people's lives.""Mussallem's leadership role at Edwards traces back to his career at Baxter International (BAX), where he started working in 1979. He held a number of posts there, including group vice president of its cardiovascular division from 1994 to 2000.Mussallem was part of a group at Baxter that in the 1990s proposed the cardiovascular division could innovate faster and better serve patients if it spun out as an independent company. That happened on April 3, 2000, when Edwards Lifesciences was established and began life as a public company. Mussallem is the first and only chairman and CEO Edwards has had as a stand-alone company.Thanks to ongoing innovation, guided by Mussallem's passion for helping improve and save patients' lives, Edwards' position in the medical technology industry has skyrocketed. Edwards is the leader in surgical and transcatheter heart valves, says Glenn Novarro, an analyst and managing director at RBC Capital Markets.The reasons: ""They have the best technology, and they invest the most of any med tech company in heart valves,"" Novarro told IBD. ""And they're always first to market.""Edwards and his team have propelled impressive financial growth and gained the attention of investors.In each of the last 10 years, Edwards' top line has grown more than 10%. Its stock price has gone from 3.438 (split-adjusted) at its IPO on April 3, 2000, to 136.67 on April 3, 2018, a gain of 3,875.3%.""I learned a lot over the years by doing,"" he said. ""More and more I found that having a great culture is what first and foremost underpins the success of the company, especially when the culture drives the real purpose of the company. I feel like it's the driver of a lot of our success, and it gives me great comfort that we are all aligned.""Edwards' culture is grounded in a patient focus, says Mussallem. Edwards has an opportunity to be close to patients. Each one of its heart valves has a unique serial number that Edwards can trace back to the people who handmade and inspected the valve. Edwards often has reunions for the patients and the teams who made their individual valves.""You can imagine what that does for our team,"" he said. ""It reinforces the importance of people's work.""Adds Novarro: ""This is his passion. He puts everything into this company. That's why he is a great leader. Most successful CEOs are passionate. Mike takes it to another level. It's not just Edwards that is his passion. What Edwards does for patients (also) is his passion.""Mussallem says the company doesn't try to solve every health care problem. ""We stay very focused on structural heart disease and critical care medicine. We feel like these patients could be better served than they are today, and there are big opportunities to apply technology to improve their care.""We like to focus on bold innovations, literally breakthrough technologies that are transformative to existing care. And when we get that right, we can add a lot of value for patients.""For Edwards, the big groundbreaker has been its pioneering efforts to bring transcatheter aortic valve replacement to market, which in turn, has led to a major transformation of the company.""It's abundantly clear that in the 18 years that Edwards has been a public company, Mike not only has thoughtfully reshaped the company's post spinoff portfolio by divesting and acquiring, but also has clearly demonstrated visionary insight about how and where to innovate — brilliantly — in the complex medical device space with the company's TAVR/structural heart initiatives."" Rick Wise, senior medical technology analyst and a managing director at Stifel, told IBD.Mussallem saw a big opportunity with TAVR, despite the fact it might cannibalize the company's existing leading products.""We were, and continue to be, the leader in surgical heart valves, and TAVR was such a radical idea and most of our customers would discourage us,"" said Mussallem. ""The rationale was that if someone was going to disrupt our core business, my feeling was that it must be us. We had to be the ones. No one else could pursue this radical idea.""We worked very hard to develop this therapy. It was not simple or linear. But we persisted because the promise for patients was so powerful. It was the first time in my career I had a chance to experience in a significant way what I call a triple win — improve mortality, improve the quality of life for patients and improve economics for the health care system.""The Edwards SAPIEN family of transcatheter aortic heart valves and their delivery systems are used to treat heart valve disease using catheter-based approaches for certain patients for whom traditional open-heart surgery isn't optimal, the company says. Delivered while the heart is beating, these valves can enable patients to have a better quality of life sooner than those receiving traditional surgical therapies.To motivate and guide employees, Mussallem and his team have developed a ""secret sauce,"" of principles. With an eye always on patient needs, Mussallem encourages his team to dream big, not be afraid of failure and learn from mistakes.Mussallem developed his leadership and management principles from many sources. While at Baxter, Mussallem gained confidence in his skills.""One of the lessons I learned was not to be afraid of difficult jobs,"" he said. ""Often if a job is not high profile or involves taking over an underperforming business or function, it isn't seen as glamorous. But it is an opportunity for someone to get significant responsibility and demonstrate their own ability to add value.""That lesson helped Mussallem support the decision to spin off as an independent company the cardiovascular division of Baxter, for which Mussallem was responsible. At the time, the cardiovascular business was the poorest performer in the Baxter portfolio, he says. It had a low growth rate, low profitability and an uncertain future.""We had a lot of hard work to do in those early years,"" he said. ""But the team stayed optimistic. And over time we were able to sharpen our strategy and seriously invest in new innovation. We were able to completely change the profile of the company.""Another element of the strategy that has been a priority is leadership.""We feel like we should try and be the best in what we do,"" he adds. ""I'm proud that over 98% of what Edwards sells is in the No. 1 global position.""Mussallem, 65, was born and grew up in Gary, Ind. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1974.After graduation, he worked at Union Carbide as a chemical engineer making Prestone antifreeze. But over time he realized he could be doing something more fulfilling — changing people's lives — and then went into health care.He developed many of his personal values and passion for innovation in his younger years.""I've never been one to be afraid to take on a challenge,"" he said. ""I was fortunate to have loving parents who, like others, lived their life to give their children a better life. I always felt a responsibility to do my best. I believe our company has many of those same ideas.""Transformed Edwards into the global leader and innovator for structural heart diseaseOvercame: Risky business decision to spin off Edwards from Baxter to develop complex therapies.Lesson: Find meaning in your work ""because it allows you to be your best and might even surprise you in terms of how much impact you can have.""

18,EW,"Boston Scientific (BSX) investors breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday after the medical technology player topped analysts' first-quarter expectations and lifted guidance — a day after rival Edwards Lifesciences (EW) came up short in a key segment.On the stock market today, Boston rose 3.2% to close at 29.42. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 30.03. Edwards stock, on the other hand, sank 3.8%, near 129.52.Boston is seemingly bucking the choppy earnings season, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a note to clients. In this environment, it feels as if most medtech stocks are expected to trade down after issuing their reports. But Boston's was ""as steady as she goes,"" he said.""Investor positioning possibly contributed to some of the move today,"" he said. ""Stepping away from the quarter, we think shares are fairly priced given the current growth outlook relative to similar high-growth large-cap peers and (that) causes us to remain on the sidelines.""Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

Total sales grew about 10% on a reported basis to $2.38 billion, also beating analyst views for $2.34 billion.Boston also raised its 2018 outlook to $9.75 billion to $9.9 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $1.37-$1.41 per share. Both metrics topped the consensus for $9.72 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share.Boston is ""riding the 'wave' amidst a choppy earnings season,"" Kumar said. Neuromodulator sales were a source of upside in the quarter. Revenue from the implantable devices, which treat chronic pain and neurological diseases, grew 19.3% on a reported basis and 17.2% operationally.That was helped by sales of the Spectra WaveWriter, a spinal cord stimulator used to treat chronic pain. The device gained approval in January and subsequently launched. Revenue from implantable cardioverter defibrillators also helped, growing by double digits, Kumar said.Cardiac rhythm management sales were in line, up 2.4% organically. Interventional cardiology grew 1.3% on an organic basis, below Kumar's view for 2.3% growth.Investors are likely nervous that Boston hasn't yet offered an update on its transcatheter heart valve replacement, or TAVR, device called Lotus. TAVR is a method of replacing a diseased heart valve by using a catheter rather than resorting to open-heart surgery.Boston voluntarily recalled its Lotus and Lotus Edge Aortic Valve Systems in Europe last year after discovering some issues with the system. In February, Boston said it planned to launch the Lotus Edge system in the U.S. and Europe in 2019.The Lotus products would compete against TAVR systems from Edwards and Medtronic (MDT), which have a respective mid-60%/mid-30% split of the market, analysts say.""If we had to nitpick, possibly the lack of Lotus update and better revenue flow-through at high end not translating into operating margin expansion come to mind,"" Kumar said.

Data released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute signaled a surprise 2.64 million barrel rise in weekly inventories, vs. expectations for a 1.1-million barrel decline.The 10-year yield was effectively flat at 3.02%. Bond markets have become a focal point for many investors, as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged above 3% on Tuesday. That was the first move above 3% in more than four years. Rising yields occur when bond prices decline. This typically indicates decreased demand for bonds, which isn't generally a negative for the stock market. In fact, when bond prices decrease and yields rise, stocks usually rise as investor capital shifts from one market to the other.Rising yields are a general indicator of the environment of rising rates created by the Federal Reserve's strategy to begin normalizing target interest rates for banks. The Fed began lowering those target rates from a peak of 5.25% in 2006. The target rates remained abnormally low — below 1% — between 2008 and 2017, following the U.S. economic recession. The Fed began hiking its rate target back above 1% in June last year. It has since implemented two subsequent increases. Markets expect three more increases this year.For consumers, rising rates means things like mortgages and credit card debt are more expensive. For companies, it increases the cost to borrow capital. But there are a long list of industries that benefit from rising risk environments, and it is a welcome change for most fixed-income investors.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Is The Bull Market Finally Over?Despite Today's Market, Baozun And Solaredge Technologies Join This IBD Stock ListApple Stock Falls For Fifth Straight Day As Wall Street In 'Full Panic Mode'Google Earnings Raise Questions On Amazon.com Rivalry, SpendingFacebook, Twitter, Boeing, PayPal, Visa Earnings: Action Plan

34,EW,"Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could engage in a bidding war to sweep Boston Scientific (BSX) out from under Stryker (SYK), an analyst said Tuesday following rumors the latter two could merge.A report emerged Monday that Stryker approached Boston with a takeover bid. Boston shares spiked on the rumor as Stryker toppled. But Canaccord analysts say Stryker could be far from the only medical device maker with interest in Boston.""If the headlines are substantiated and Stryker is in fact making a bid on Boston Scientific, we see a high likelihood that J&J could emerge as another potential bidder,"" they said in a note to clients. ""J&J had been bantered about as a potential Boston Scientific acquirer for years, and if a bidding war emerges, we'd place a high likelihood on J&J being involved.""On the stock market today, Boston stock dipped 1.4% to close at 33.84. Stryker shares plunged 4.3% to 162.54. Even J&J stock looked somewhat dim, easing by a fraction to 122.54.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe deal had analysts somewhat split on Tuesday.""Regarding the materiality of this report, we do not find the potential of such a marriage to be shocking,"" Canaccord analysts said. ""Indeed, we see merits to such a combination from the standpoint of product line synergies.""For Stryker, the acquisition would help it add products in sectors with higher potential for growth and in bigger markets. It would also help Stryker to differentiate its portfolio of technologies and compete with large companies like J&J and Medtronic (MDT).In Boston's case, the deal would cap a five-year turnaround, allowing it to ""end on a high-note,"" Canaccord analysts said.""In sum, we definitively think Boston Scientific is game to do a fair deal here,"" they said.But RBC analyst Glenn Novarro viewed the deal ""unfavorably,"" though acknowledged from a strategic rationale the it would make sense. It's also likely Boston won't OK any deal for less than $40 per share.""It would combine two of the premier growth companies in the (medical device) space, and there would be limited product overlap,"" he said. However, ""the bar for value creation is set high given the potential valuations of both companies.""A combined Stryker-Boston Scientific would have 2019 revenue of around $25 billion. It stands to grow at a sustainable 6% or higher compound annual growth rate in the medium term, Novarro said. It would have an enterprise value of about $61 billion.Canaccord analysts called the potential deal a ""merger of equals."" Stryker is only about a third larger than Boston. It could also lead to further med-tech consolidation.""If consummated, this would create four $100 billion behemoths in (medical devices) with Stryker/Boston Scientific joining Abbott (ABT), J&J and Medtronic,"" they said. ""We think Edwards Lifesciences (EW) could be the next potential major acquisition target, but also highlight Smith and Nephew (SNN) as being the last remaining 'pure-play' total joint operation on the market.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

55,EW,"AB Large Cap Growth (APGAX) is in an elite group of top mutual funds. It is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. That takes extraordinary consistency. For $6.3 billion Large Cap Growth and other U.S. stock mutual funds, the bogey they've beaten is the S&P 500. Across all categories, only 22% of eligible funds managed the four-time feat.More impressively, AB Large Cap Growth outperformed in all four time periods in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. How hard is it to gain entry to the winners' circle? Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.To become a top mutual fund like this, lead manager Frank Caruso, co-manager John Fogarty and senior research analyst Vinay Thapar have assembled a diversified portfolio that includes leading stocks in auto parts, health care, financials and technology such as Copart (CPRT), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Zoetis (ZTS), S&P Global (SPGI) and Nvidia (NVDA).Holding periods vary, but the stocks in the past 12 months have risen from 48% for Edwards to 49% for S&P Global, 55% for Zoetis, 63% for Copart and 116% for Nvidia.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Caruso and his team have been trimming one of those leading stocks because of a growing competitive threat. Below, Caruso describes which of those stocks he has reservations about and why.Meanwhile, overall finding stocks that persistently outperform the market depends, Caruso says, on finding ""idiosyncratic opportunities to invest.""Sixty-one-year-old Caruso and his colleagues — Fogarty, 48, and Thapar, 39 — discussed that and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from their offices in Manhattan.IBD: This portfolio is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. What does it take to outperform so consistently over periods as short as 12 months to 10 years?Frank Caruso: We focus on looking at businesses, not stocks. We are attracted to businesses with differentiated competitive positions, companies that produce higher than average levels of profitability, profitability that exceeds the fair cost of capital.Here's our secret sauce: we start by looking for good businesses, then we obsess over each company's idiosyncratic opportunities to invest and to earn high returns on capital.IBD: What exactly do you mean by 'idiosyncratic opportunities to invest'?Caruso: It is an investment opportunity that is company specific. It occurs when a company takes action that can put upward pressure on profitability. Take Nike (NKE). They've been chasing low-cost labor since the 1960s. We noticed patent filings that looked like new manufacturing technology. If they could build shoes with robotized machines, they could build plants closer to consumers, saving on tariffs, duties and shipping.IBD: The fund is fairly concentrated, with just 47 stocks as of Jan. 31. Why do you prefer a concentrated approach?Caruso: First, we think we're good at researching companies. And we want to get paid for research.Second, having around 50 names allows us to get exposure to some larger-cap companies and also seed the portfolio with sometimes younger and more exciting companies.Forty-seven is near the small end of our portfolio size range. We may have been in the low to mid sixties when we first took over this portfolio in 2012. We were still shaping the portfolio to our vision.IBD: Auto auctioneer Copart is one of your smaller names with a market cap under $12 billion. It has posted three straight quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration. What's the driver?Caruso: They're probably not the type of business in a lot of growth portfolios. They have high profitability, and they are high versus their cost of capital. Yet it's surprisingly stable. One secular trend that gives us confidence in the sustainability of their performance is that as autos become more complex, it leads to more attractive salvage rates. With more and more cars, it's too expensive to repair ones that get damaged. So Copart's supply of inventory gets bigger.IBD: You began your current stake in August. Why then?Caruso: Over a multiyear period, Copart's infrastructure did not perform efficiently to exploit new inventory when it arose due to (hurricanes). So the company invested money to upgrade its capabilities. In the August hurricane season, investors questioned whether Copart had done enough, lowering Copart's share price. We bought on that uncertainty.IBD: For the most part, you've been building your stake in Edwards Lifesciences. Why?Vinay Thapar: They pioneered development of transcatheter aortic valves. Before that, patients had to do through open-heart surgery and go on a bypass machine to have their valves repaired. Edwards got around that by engineering a product that could be inserted by snaking a catheter through an artery in the leg.It is far more minimally invasive and results in faster discharge from the hospital. The average patient cost is 10% to 15% less than the open-heart procedure. Yet the product has higher than average gross margins and operating margins. We expected an uplift in return on the company's invested capital (ROIC), and that has occurred. There's about an 18% ROIC, which is close to the upper echelon in other companies.The company forecasts the market to be about $5 billion-plus by 2021, and it's only $2.5 billion to $3 billion now. Beyond that, they're looking at using the same procedure for a different valve, the mitral valve, which would be a new market.IBD: Zoetis is another name in which you've been building your stake. What's fueling your interest?Thapar: They're the leader in pharmaceuticals for animal health. Our thesis is that after their spinout from Pfizer, they had an opportunity to improve their operating performance. They right-sized their number of SKUs (items for sale), they closed manufacturing facilities. Those improved their gross margin. And they committed to investing in higher returning R&D projects.Their single-digit top-line growth above the market growth rate, along with cost improvements, had led to higher returns. Going forward, their pipeline of products is yet to be reflected in their stock price. And they've committed to reduce their inventory balance, which will improve their return on invested capital.IBD: S&P Global is another holding whose EPS growth has accelerated. Why has that happened?Caruso: We're modeling annual revenue growth in the 6% area for the next four or five years, along with low single digit earnings growth.Their index business has been a big part of their success. And their ratings business is a best-in-class franchise. In a low-rate environment with a good level of volatility, the expectation is that if there's an increase around the world, their ratings business should benefit and maybe some parts of their index business.IBD: You've been in Nvidia a long time. Does this story have much runway left in front of it?Caruso: It's been in this portfolio since 2014. Their graphical chips have found new applications. Think AI (artificial intelligence), think hyperscale data centers, think VR (virtual reality), think auto vision.But Nvidia's GPUs are general purpose chips. And we think there are application-specific chips from early-stage companies that will become competitive for market share in the next 15 to 18 months. So we've been trimming our position.IBD: Booking Holdings (BKNG) is Priceline's new name. Why do you like that particular online travel agency?John Fogarty: They changed their name to reflect their primary assets in the online travel portfolio. Their appeal is their dominant position in Europe, where the hotel market is far more fragmented than in the U.S., where the industry is dominated by chains. Booking can take advantage of Europe's fragmentation, so they enjoy a higher commission rate as a result.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is a relative newcomer to the portfolio. Why did you introduce it?Fogarty: We began to buy it in the fourth quarter of 2017. The growth of PayPal is essentially riding the increased adoption of online payments and, in particular, mobile payments. We're attracted to their rising return on assets trajectory — not just their growth, but their increased profitability.IBD: Anyone want to add any comments?Caruso: John summarized our thoughts about PayPal. It's taking market share, we expect it to grow in the high teens over the next three years and it complements our Visa (V) exposure.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing trading environment.

66,EW,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

90,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) plunged late Tuesday after the firm reported third-quarter sales and profit that lagged expectations, but reaffirmed its 2017 sales guidance.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Edwards toppled 5.8%, near 107.70, after closing up a fraction, at 114.25. Shares have been forming a flat base since late July with a buy point at 121.55.Third-quarter sales grew 11% to $821.5 million, though that missed the consensus view for $834 million. Adjusted income of 84 cents per share lagged by 2 cents, though it grew 23.5%. Edwards said adjusted earnings would have been 88 cents a share based on the excess tax benefit estimated in prior guidance.During the period, transcatheter heart valve therapy sales grew 17.3% to $481.2 million. Edwards and its rivals make heart-valve replacements that allow a physician to fix a narrowed heart valve without resorting to open-heart surgery. U.S. sales grew 20.1% to $311.6 million.Edwards said in a statement it expects its transcatheter heart valve therapy unit to be a $5 billion-plus opportunity by 2021 based on continued strength both inside and outside the U.S.IBD'S TAKE: Edwards has an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms more than nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong performers in the Medical-Products industry group.Meanwhile, surgical heart valve therapy sales grew just 2.4% to $195.6 million.

91,EW,"Medtronic (MDT) surged to a three-month high Tuesday after the No. 1 medical devices-maker topped fiscal second-quarter earnings views and reported revenue from heart valve replacements grew by more than a third.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Medtronic surged 4.8% to close at 82.66. Meanwhile, shares of Edwards Lifesciences (EW) — Medtronic's key rival in what's known as transcatheter aortic heart-valve replacements — lifted 2.2% to finish the regular trading day at 109.52.For its fiscal second quarter, Medtronic reported adjusted income of $1.07 per share on $7.05 billion in sales. Revenue was in line with Medtronic's pre-announcement and beat views for $6.96 billion. Earnings crushed the consensus for 99 cents.On a year-over-year basis, both metrics declined 4%, Medtronic said in a release. Adjusting for foreign exchange rates, divestitures and the impact of Hurricane Maria, revenue and earnings would have climbed 4% and 5%, respectively.The firm's cardiac and vascular group posted $2.77 billion in sales, up 7%. This was helped by sales of transcatheter aortic heart valves, or TAVR, which grew by a ""high-thirties"" percentage. TAVR is a method of repairing a damaged heart valve without resorting to open-heart surgery.IBD'S TAKE: In the biotech sector, large-caps struggled during the quarter as smaller firms led the way, outperforming expectations. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on the quarter.Edwards rivals Medtronic in TAVR. Boston Scientific (BSX) doesn't have a product approved in the U.S., but is expected to re-enter the European market in early 2018 after recalling its product due to problems with its locking mechanism.Minimally invasive and restorative therapies groups split a $55 million to $65 million impact from Hurricane Maria, which bashed Puerto Rico during the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales from those groups grew 2% apiece.The firm reiterated its guidance for constant-currency sales growth of 4%-5% in fiscal 2018, and adjusted profit per share growth of 9%-10%.RELATED:How These Rivals Could Take A Chunk Of Medtronic's Heart-Unit SalesHow Electricity Could Replace Opioids In Treating Chronic PainEdwards Lifesciences Crashes After Heart Valve Sales Miss Lofty Views

92,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) crashed to its lowest point in six months after lagging overly aggressive expectations for its flagship heart valve replacement business, an analyst said Wednesday.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Edwards had plunged 9.6% to finish at 103.33, after earlier falling as much as 11.5% to its lowest point since April. Shares began forming a flat base in July with a buy point at 121.55.During the quarter, Edwards' domestic transcatheter aortic valve replacement, also known as TAVR, sales grew 20.1%, in line with that market. But that fell short of the Street's lofty expectations for what Canaccord analyst Jason Mills called an otherwise ""rock star"" business.TAVR is a method of fixing a narrowed or hardened heart valve without resorting to open-heart surgery. In the quarter, Edwards' transcatheter heart valve therapy unit brought in $481.2 million in sales, up 17.3%, with $311.6 million of that from the U.S. The consensus had modeled $316 million in domestic sales.""We think management's commentary insinuated that while the U.S. market remains strong, the market is beginning to incur the inevitability of the 'law of larger numbers,' "" Mills said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with earnings season by bookmarking Your Weekly Review for a quick rundown of which companies reported and how their stocks are moving.The attempt to rein in expectations for 2018 is a prudent move, he said. Analysts became overly aggressive in their TAVR predictions. Boston Scientific (BSX) looks to enter the U.S. market soon and Medtronic (MDT) is increasing access to more patients, which could create some headwinds for Edwards in 2018.But Edwards retained its guidance for 2017, which implies U.S. TAVR growth of 15% to 17% in the fourth quarter, Mills said. He expects the Street to recalibrate its expectations.""That said, we remain bullish about the market's potential, the (total addressable market), the relative underpenetration, and the potential for Edwards' growth reacceleration along with low-risk approval,"" he wrote.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro says conversations with investors suggest the Street would have been happier with $320 million in domestic TAVR sales. Growth in the third quarter slowed again (to 20.1%) from 38% in the first quarter and 28% in the second quarter, he wrote in a note to clients.Edwards is targeting a $5 billion-plus opportunity in this segment by 2021. Novarro expects more clarity on 2018 guidance to be given during Edwards' investor day in December.""While a midteens sales (compound annual growth rate) is sufficient between 2018 and 2021 for achieving Edwards' (transcatheter heart valve therapy) sales forecast for more than $5 billion by 2021, we believe a higher growth rate will be necessary for Edwards shares to maintain a healthy premium to large-cap medtech peers,"" he said.RELATED:Edwards Topples On Third-Quarter Misses, Soft GuidanceCould GlaxoSmithKline Scoop Up Pfizer's Over-The-Counter Unit?Biogen Dives Despite Topping Views; Lilly, Novartis Beat

Investors focused on Wednesday's mixed earnings reports and concerns about tax reform in Washington, largely ignoring positive durable-goods-orders data and a spike in new-home sales for September.Nike (NKE) soared 2.5% to lead the Dow, after CEO Mark Parker plotted a course of high-single-digit revenue growth and EPS growth in the midteens over the next five years. The gain punched Nike shares back above their 40-week moving average, and up the right side of a two-month consolidation.Boeing was the Dow's sinker, down nearly 3% despite reporting above-forecast third-quarter earnings and guidance. But revenue was lighter than hoped for, and a charge for its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program slimmed after-tax margins. The move pulled shares back from Tuesday's high, and set the stock on track for its first decline in four weeks.China-based names came under some heavy selling pressure, with Jupai Holdings (JP) diving 10%, Weibo (WB) down 6%, and TAL Education (TAL) falling almost 5%.

98,EW,"U.S. stock indexes stepped backward midday Friday after Q2 GDP results matched the Street's expectations and consumer data showed some bright spots.XThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Volume in the stock market today was running lower than in the previous session. Lower volume on a decline is what bulls prefer to see, if stocks must retreat.Q2 GDP came in at 2.6%, the best growth since the third quarter of 2016 and in line with estimates. Consumer spending in Q2 also matched views but with a 2.8% gain. The bright spot, though, was the revision in Q1 consumer spending. The initial reading of 1.1% was revised to 1.9%.The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for July confirmed the upward trend. It came in at 93.4 vs. expectations for 93.1.Stocks in the IBD 50, a list of some of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, were mixed. Those advancing in strong volume included: invisible braces maker Align Technology (ALGN), up 9%; software provider LogMeIn (LOGM), up 7%; chip equipment maker Ichor Holdings (ICHR), up 5%; and Facebook (FB), up 1% in a nice follow to Thursday's 3% gain.The day's losers in the IBD 50 included: contract manufacturer TTM Technologies (TTMI), down 7%; Dave & Busters Entertainment (PLAY), off 3% as it headed toward a sixth down day in a row; and medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW), down 2%.Edwards Lifesciences may have been hurt because of the defeat of the Republican ""skinny"" repeal of ObamaCare.

103,EW,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive.

Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry. Snap fell 1.35% to 13.89, hitting a new record low.PayPal dipped 0.55% to 58.26, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 55.24 flat-base buy point cleared earlier this month. The mobile payments firm expanded its reach via deals this month with Apple and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Chip-equipment maker Lam Research is in cup base just below a possible buy point.

116,EW,"MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) is revving its engine, improving its performance relative to its peers and the S&P 500. The $2.3 billion fund topped 64% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the 12 months going into Wednesday. It improved to 84% outperformance year-to-date and 91% in the past three months.Up 15.52% this year vs. 12.45% for its peer group and 9.47% for the big-cap bogey, manager Paul Gordon pins the improvement on the market rotating back toward the types of growth stocks favored by him and fellow managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel. ""Last year as people started to gain additional confidence in the economy, a lot more cyclical lower valuation companies started to rally,"" Gordon said. ""They had an extreme rally after the Trump election. But that's typically not an area we invest in. We look for long-term, not short-term, valuation opportunities. This year has been a reversal of that trend, back toward secular growth companies.""Holdings that have notched nice gains this year include graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 38% so far this year; chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), which is up 23%; and design-automation-software maker Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), which is up 40%.Nvidia is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Gains have left Nvidia, Monolithic and Cadence share prices extended, outside their buy ranges for investors looking for optimal entry points.Other holdings that have posted good gains are still within buy ranges.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), a maker of heart valves and other vascular disease products, is a stock in which Gordon's fund has raised its share count in recent disclosures. It has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD.""This medical device company has a product that is a better way of doing traditional aortic valve replacement surgery,"" Gordon said. ""It tends to provide better medical results and safety. We think the runway is long for them to continue to increase (the number of) procedures to be done this way going forward.""IBD'S TAKE: In addition to Edwards Lifesciences' sterling 99 Composite Rating, it has four consecutive years of annual earnings per share growth. See how its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.LogMeIn (LOGM) is another stock in which the fund has been building its stake. Earnings per share for the maker of business and videoconferencing software rose 22%, 22% and 143% the past three quarters. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect second-quarter profit to rise a very good 90% to 93 cents a share.""They have a nice market share within a niche market,"" Gordon said. ""They recently purchased an asset called (GetGo, whose products include GoToMeeting and related offerings) from Citrix Systems (CTXS). I think they have an opportunity to improve that business. For Citrix, it was not part of their core business, so it did not get (maximum) attention within a bigger company. Now it is very complementary to what LogMeIn knows and does.""Software maker SS&C Technologies (SSNC) is up 36% so far this year. Gordon said, ""They provide back-office software for financial companies. They're taking share from in-house and other third parties. This company sold off last year at the height of (investors') fear about a decline in hedge-fund growth. But this stock has recovered.""Five Below (FIVE) offers trendy, high-quality brands that sell for $5 or less in its 500-plus stores. It plans to open 100 more in 2017-2018.""What we like about Five Below is that it is a bit of a combination of Dollar Store and off-price store, so it sells low-priced items that change seasonally and are attractive to customers because they (require) a bit of a treasure hunt. They're a fun place to shop for fairly cheap, consumable items. The total store opportunity for the company is fairly large. The returns on new stores are very high. So they are able to get great footage growth at high rates within their cash flow, and we think they should continue.""Shares are up 30% this year. IBD readers would recognize that on Wednesday afternoon they were trading a shade below their 52.80 entry point.Gordon summarizes the fund's strategy as ""focusing on secular growth companies in which we have high confidence of long duration of above-average earnings growth.""If the market is performing a Trump Dump — rotating away from lower valued cyclical stocks that could benefit from Trump policies — that should provide the fund with only a small additional tailwind. Gordon said, ""It might provide some opportunities, but only on the margin to find additional names to add to the portfolio.""Over the past 10 years the fund's average annual return of 6.13% topped only 31% of its direct rivals. Managers Fischman, Gordon and Sabel joined the fund in 2008, 2011 and 2014 respectively.RELATED:A Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio: Trump-Era Stock Plays, Plus Stocks To Like No Matter Who's PresidentMFS Aligns Management Teams On Growth Fund And Mid Cap Growth

123,EW,"There could be upside to Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) 2017 guidance, but an analyst suggested Tuesday that investors are ""already paying for that"" and downgraded the stock on the likelihood of subdued demand in Asia.Canaccord analyst Jason Mills also sees Medtronic (MDT), known for making heart-valve replacements that rival those of Edwards Lifesciences (EW), as a stout competitor in surgery robotics in 2018-19.Year to date, Intuitive Surgical stock is up 44% after a ""phenomenal year"" in 2016, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills wrote in a note to clients. Intuitive ended the year with 18% sales growth, 26% earnings growth and $5 billion in cash.""As the health care sector has been a top performer so far in 2017, Intuitive Surgical has been leading the charge,"" Mills said. ""However, investors' exuberance about the company's strong performance over the past few years has driven the stock to unprecedented valuation levels.""Mills downgraded Intuitive Surgical stock to a hold rating from buy after two years, though he kept his 870 price target. At the close on the stock market today, Intuitive Surgical was up 0.5%, to 914.43.""While we expect Intuitive Surgical to deliver solid results in 2017 and 2018, we believe the risk/reward setup tilts too much to the former at the present,"" he said. The stock hasn't traded at this valuation since 2012 and is now at a 34% premium to its own five-year average.IBD'S TAKE: Intuitive Surgical stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. It's ranked fourth in IBD's 58-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) stock leads the group, with a CR of 98. For a look at the group setup, head to IBD Stock Checkup.Guidance has played a big role in Intuitive Surgical's stock, Mills said. The company typically offers conservative guidance that it easily outperforms, thus investors expect ""positive guidance revisions through the balance of 2017.""But that might not be the case. The Easter weekend tailwind in the first quarter will become a headwind in the second quarter, and outside-U.S. business is slowing, Mills wrote. Procedure growth is expected to be subdued in Japan and to moderate in China.""While we think there could be upside to current guidance, we think you're already paying for that,"" he wrote.In the meantime, competition is looming, he said. Intuitive Surgical makes robotics that assist in performing surgery. Medtronic reiterated on its earnings call last week its plan to launch its surgical robotics outside the U.S. before April 2018 and in the U.S. during fiscal 2019.""Medtronic's competitive approach seems to be centered on its ability to target the customer across myriad surgical spectrums, but we also deduce from our conversations with management they will target the cost side of the equation as well,"" Mills said.Though Medtronic might not become much of a competitor until late 2018 or early 2019, as its domestic launch creeps closer Intuitive Surgical investors ""may begin to account for the upcoming competition vis-a-vis the multiple afforded these shares,"" he said.RELATED:Robot Surgeon Maker Launches To Record High On Strong Q1

Analysts had modeled $1.31 and $7.86 billion, respectively.""Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to the fiscal year, with balanced, diversified growth across our groups and regions,"" Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak said in a statement. ""Fiscal year 2017 was a solid year overall for Medtronic.""Robust sales in the minimally invasive therapies group — which includes electrosurgical tools and advanced vessel sealing devices — helped Medtronic's total sales to beat views.

130,EW,"Boston Scientific's (BSX) Lotus heart valve proved superior to rival Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve in a yearlong trial by Boston Scientific, the medtech player said Tuesday — prompting shares to jump early.Lotus and CoreValve are transcatheter aortic valve replacements, or TAVR, in patients with hardened arteries who are not eligible for surgery. The process is less invasive than open-heart surgery, allowing the new valve to be inserted via catheter.At year one in Boston Scientific's study, its pair of Lotus valves showed superiority over two of Medtronic's CoreValves for primary effectiveness. The Lotus valves, which are not FDA-approved, also proved non-inferior on safety.The risk of death, disabling stroke and paravalvular leak — the result of insufficient sealing at the site of a replaced valve — was lower for Boston's Lotus, 16.7% to 29% for Medtronic's CoreValve, Boston said.Boston's Lotus also proved safer in that it had lower rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leaks, 2% to 11.1% for Medtronic's CoreValve. Most leaks following heart-valve replacement are minor, but large leaks have been linked to heart failure.IBD'S TAKE: Edwards Lifesciences is among the leaders in medtech with an IBD Composite Rating of 98, landing it in the third spot among the top companies in the Medical-Products industry group. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the other leaders.Separately, the rate of disabling stroke for Lotus patients was just 3.6% compared to 7.1% for CoreValve patients. The overall stroke rate was closer though, 7% in Lotus patients vs. 9.4% in CoreValve patients.A larger percentage of CoreValve patients died as a result of cardiac death, 9.8% of CoreValve patients to 7.7% of Lotus patients.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said the fact that Lotus achieved overall superiority in the study is linked to lower rates of paravalvular leak. He noted, ""It shouldn't be a surprise that Lotus had lower (paravalvular leak) rates — this is a key distinguishing feature of the valve.""In a separate study, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) Sapien 3 valve had a comparably low rate of leaks.At the close on the stock market today, Boston stock was up 0.2% to 26.48, after lifting as much as 1.3% earlier in the day. Shares topped a 25.75 buy point out of a flat base on April 25 and have lingered in a buy zone since.Medtronic stock was down a fraction to 83.94, while shares of Edwards were up 0.2%, near 113.65.RELATED:Edwards Rockets To 6-Month High On Strong U.S. Heart-Valve SalesDid Baxter 'Hoodwink' FDA Inspectors Or Is Probe Just 'Extraordinary'?Which Medtech Stocks Should you Buy Ahead Of Q1?

131,EW,"Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) and Dow component Pfizer (PFE) toppled to three-month lows Tuesday after sustaining a pair of downgrades, though Lilly grabbed a buy rating and Pfizer sank to a sell rating.At the close on the stock market today, Lilly stock was down 1.6% to 78.99, while Pfizer stock lost 1.6%to 32.60. Shares of both hit lows last seen in mid-February.Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin removed Lilly from her conviction list, replacing it with IBD 50 member Edwards Lifesciences (EW), ""another product story where we see potential for more upside."" But Lilly stock is still rated buy with a 92 price target.Lilly stock is up 9% year to date vs. the S&P 500, which has risen 7%. Though long-term fundamentals look strong, Lilly is facing near-term risk from a patent battle regarding chemotherapy Alimta. That decision is expected June 3.""It is a unique situation in that Lilly has already won at the District Court and appeals in the U.S. against the same patent,"" Rubin said. ""Usually (the district court) process follows (a patent review).""The likelihood of Lilly losing in the patent review process is low, but could result in earlier-than-expected generic competition vs. Alimta in the U.S. by the second half of 2018, Rubin wrote in a note to clients.Meanwhile, a Food and Drug Administration decision regarding rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant is weighing on Lilly stock, she wrote. Earlier this year, the FDA asked for more dosing and safety data on the drug, just two months after European officials signed off on it.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 59, out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms nearly six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags the leader, Zoetis, with a CR of 91. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-performing drugmakers.Longer-term, Rubin sees upside from diabetes drug Trulicity, breast cancer drug abemaciclib and migraine drug galcanezumab — though ""it could take time before Lilly gets credit"" for those on Wall Street, Rubin said.Pfizer, on the other hand, was cut to a sell rating from neutral at Citi, and its price target cut to 31 from 38. According to StreetInsider, Citi said Medicare Part D coverage of some of Pfizer's oncology drugs is at risk.Among those, Pfizer counts prostate cancer drug Xtandi, breast cancer drug Ibrance and lung cancer drug Xalkori.Citi analyst Andrew Baum says Pfizer, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, needs a deal to hit the consensus' view toward profits. The consensus expects Pfizer to report $2.40 and $2.55 adjusted earnings per share for 2017 and 2018, respectively.RELATED:Can Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To Market?Drug Stocks Rally On Relief After GOP Health Care Bill Wins In HouseWhy Roche's Cancer Failure Might Tank Bristol, Pfizer — But Not Merck

136,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) stock rocketed to a six-month high Wednesday after the medical tech player reported ""particular strength"" in U.S. heart-valve-replacement sales, following several quarters of ""ups and downs.""On the stock market today, Edwards soared 10.5% to 109.30 after earlier rising as much as 14.3% to a high last achieved in October.U.S. sales of transcatheter aortic heart valves, or TAVR, grew 38% to $299 million, Edwards said Tuesday during its first-quarter earnings conference call. That beat the consensus by $28 million, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said in a note to clients.""An unexpectedly strong quarter for U.S. TAVR sales, coupled with an upward revision to revenue and (earnings) guidance, sent Edwards shares up about 10% in after-market trading,"" Novarro said after Edwards' late-Tuesday report.TAVR is a method of replacing a diseased heart valve via catheter. This process has become more popular in recent years as it's less risky and requires a shorter recovery period than surgery. Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Sciences (BSX) are also working in this realm.For the quarter ended March 31, Edwards reported $883.5 million in sales, growing 26.7% and topping the consensus for $777 million, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills wrote in a research report. Edwards reported 94 cents adjusted earnings per share, up 32.4%, and beating by 12 cents.Mills is pounding ""the drum again on the three primary reasons to own Edwards,"" including the $5.3 billion total addressable market in TAVR by 2021. Edwards outgrew the market this quarter, increasing TAVR sales by 38%, vs. 26% for other companies.Edwards has about a 67% share of the TAVR market, Mills estimates.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific made an acquisition in December that could rattle Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic. Will it pay off? Head to Sector Leaders for the deep dive.""(The first quarter) validated our bullish view of the U.S. TAVR market in which we estimate a 575,000 target population in the U.S., penetration into which we model 21% by 2021 when we estimate a $3.3 billion U.S. market of which Edwards will hold a 64% share,"" he wrote.He also notes Edwards' strong earnings leverage and growing opportunities in transcatheter mitral-valve repair. The portfolio ""could positively surprise investors earlier than (2019)"" when its acquisition of CardiAQ is expected to drive material profit and loss contributions.Also Tuesday, Edwards boosted the low end of its yearly sales guidance and now sees $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2017 revenue. The company also raised its adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 to $3.43-$3.55 from $3.30-$3.45.For the second quarter, Edwards models $810 million to $850 million in sales, excluding Germany stocking sales, and adjusted earnings of 82 cents to 92 cents per share.Mills kept his 140 price target and buy rating on Edwards stock. Novarro boosted his price target to 120 from 116 and maintained his outperform rating on Edwards.RELATED:Which Medtech Stocks Should You Buy Ahead Of Q1?Boston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, EdwardsMedtronic Does Heart-Valve Study, And Rivals Reap The Benefits

137,EW,"XLate-session declines whittled Wednesday's moderate gains to a weak finish.Earnings disappointments were the leading culprit, gnawing away at the week's early momentum and grinding the Dow Jones industrial average's early 0.4% gain to a 0.1% decline. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also shredded their gains, the Nasdaq ending flat and the S&P 500 down less than 0.1%.All the indexes remained firmly positive for the week.Compared to busy sessions Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday's action was comparatively quiet, with preliminary data showing trade slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.At either end of the Dow industrials, United Technologies (UTX) rose nearly 2% and Procter & Gamble (PG) dropped 2%, both on quarterly results.

139,EW,"Baxter (BAX) stock fell Monday on worries related to a Department of Justice investigation into potential price fixing of intravenous fluids — allegations an analyst deemed ""extraordinary.""On the stock market today, Baxter stock fell 0.8% to 52.82 after the Justice Department sent a grand jury subpoena to one of Baxter's employees.The subpoena was received Friday and relates to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department's antitrust arm. It asks for documents and testimony related to manufacturing, pricing, selling and shortages of intravenous solutions, and Baxter's communications with rivals.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted that the price-fixing allegation isn't new. It stems from a 2-year-old investigation that began in New York and an ongoing class-action suit in the Northern District of Illinois related to supply shortages.The shortage was triggered by the flu season in 2013-14 and benefited manufacturers like Hospira, which in the third quarter of 2014 saw 43% growth in its unit that produces intravenous fluids, Kumar said. Hospira was acquired by Pfizer (PFE) in 2015.But the class action lawsuit alleges that manufacturers of intravenous fluids falsely created the shortage to justify spiking prices in 2014. Baxter, which has filed for a motion to dismiss the suit, called the allegations extraordinary.""The idea of a public company voluntarily creating supply shortage in the hopes competitors would similarly restrict output in order to raise prices seems a stretch,"" Kumar told clients in a note.IBD'S TAKE: Baxter stock trades in IBD's 120-company Medical-Products industry group which is led by Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in terms of market cap. Medtronic, Boston and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) compete in the heart-valve replacement market. Check out this edition of Sector Leaders to see how they stack up.FDA regulators regularly inspect manufacturing facilities, he noted. The class action lawsuit seems to imply that Baxter and other intravenous-fluid manufacturers were able to ""hoodwink"" inspectors to post shortage notices, he said.Baxter said in 2015 that it incurred about $150 million in costs to comply with increased FDA regulatory requirements and meet supply constraints. Meanwhile, price increases only contributed $70 million to $90 million in 2016 growth, Kumar said.In 2016, intravenous-fluid solutions contributed two-thirds of that segment's growth, implying that pricing was up 6% on average, Kumar said. Assuming a bag of intravenous fluid costs $1.50 to $2, this equates to increases of 15 to 20 cents per bag.Apart from price collusion, prosecutors will have to argue whether Baxter's earnings on increased intravenous fluid prices were reasonable. Kumar estimates that after hiking prices on intravenous fluids Baxter had 15%-16% margins on its earnings before interest and taxes.RELATED:Boston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, EdwardsMedtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': Analyst

141,EW,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) are medtech stocks to own going into earnings season, but several others could be put on buy lists on pullbacks, an analyst says.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said Wednesday that among large-cap medtech stocks, Johnson and Zimmer offer the best risk/reward into the first-quarter earnings season. Zimmer is the cheapest in its arena and Johnson has lagged the group.""While investor sentiment has turned more favorable for Johnson in recent weeks, we anticipate further multiple expansion on the back of strong first-quarter results, and consensus estimates moving higher throughout the year,"" he wrote in a research report.The consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) broadly expects Johnson to report $18.01 billion in sales, up 3% year over year, and $1.76 a share in adjusted earnings, dipping 1.7%.Johnson is also on the cusp of closing its acquisition of Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the second quarter. It and Sanofi (SNY) were locked in a battle late last year to take over the Swiss biotech. Johnson's $30 billion bid won it the company.For Zimmer, the company ""just has to hit consensus estimates for the stock to move higher,"" Novarro said. The consensus models 3% year-over-year sales growth to $1.96 billion and $2.11 adjusted earnings per share, up 4.5%.Novarro, however, says Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Boston Scientific (BSX), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Stryker (SYK) may be attractive on pullbacks. He sees all delivering solid results and reaffirming 2017 guidance. Investors will likely track ongoing litigation for Abbott with Alere (ALR), and heart-valve replacement sales for Edwards.Boston likely will comment on its voluntary recall of its Lotus heart-valve replacement. The company recalled the Lotus device after discovering a malfunction that resulted in the premature release of a pin during implantation.""Medtronic's (MDT) Onyx stent launch represents near-term challenges"" for Boston, but ""we still want to own Boston for 2018,"" Novarro said.In the small- and midsize-cap world, Novarro recommends NuVasive (NUVA), Wright Medical Group (WMGI) and K2M Group (KTWO). The potential for a takeout is likely baked into the stock prices for NuVasive and Wright, he said.IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Edwards has been listed as a best ""stock to own."" Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Edwards is holding strong.K2M remains his top pick in the small-and-midsize medtech group.""We expect K2M to play catch-up to the group as investor focus shifts to the company's impressive new product lineup and improving international sales growth after the company experienced some distributor issues in 2016,"" he wrote.Like Novarro, Needham analyst Mike Matson also prefers K2M and Zimmer, but also has strong buy ratings on shares of Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG). He sees the cardiovascular and orthopedic markets as slowing while the diagnostic market improved in the quarter.Matson models cardiovascular market growth as decelerating to 6.3% from 7.3% in the fourth quarter, and the orthopedic market advancing by 3.5%, vs. 4% growth in the prior quarter. In diagnostics, sales likely grew 3.6% from 2.1%, he said.But there were some standouts, Matson said. He models the transcatheter aortic valve-replacement market — where Boston, Edwards and Medtronic operate — as having grown 23%. In orthopedics, Matson models 9% growth for the extremities market.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, Edwards

143,EW,"Boston Scientific (BSX) said Thursday it plans to acquire Swiss firm Symetis in a $435 million deal in that will deepen its heart-valve rivalry with Medtronic (MDT) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW).Symetis offers several transcatheter aortic valve replacement products in Europe and internationally. This would add to Boston's Lotus heart-valve device which, in late February, was recalled due to mechanical issues.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, be earnings accretive in 2018 and hit 10% return on interest by the third year, Boston said in a presentation. Boston also reiterated its plan to launch its Lotus heart-valve device in the U.S. in 2018. The device is expected to return to European markets later this year.""We believe that this is an offensive rather than a defensive move,"" Needham analyst Mike Matson said. ""We do not believe this is a 'stopgap' to address the Lotus recall, shortcomings with Lotus or IP (intellectual property) issues.""Matson kept his buy rating and 29 price target on Boston Scientific stock. Boston shares finished regular trading down 1.1% to 24.45 on the stock market today following the announcement. Boston has been under pressure recently amid a patent battle with Edwards.Shares fell 2.7% on Feb. 23 after Boston voluntarily recalled its Lotus heart-valve device. The company discovered a mechanical issue that led to the premature release of a pin before doctors could implant the device. One patient died during an attempt to replace a Lotus heart valve.IBD'S TAKE: It's not the first time Boston Scientific has made an acquisition to help it in its battle against Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences, both of which already have transcatheter aortic heart valve devices in the U.S. Head to Sector Leaders to see how this rivalry is shaping up.Boston sees Symetis as complementary to Lotus and ""would have done the deal even if Lotus were not to have been recalled,"" Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a note to clients.""For investors concerned on whether Symetis' acquisition implies Lotus could be further delayed, this should provide reassurance,"" he said.Symetis is also unlikely to trigger more patent issues with Edwards, Kumar said. Per the patent, it doesn't appear Symetis works with supporting beams or locking mechanisms in its heart-valve replacements. Both are being contested by Edwards.RELATED:Medtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': AnalystBoston Topples On Heart Valve Bug; 'Woes' Boost Edwards, MedtronicMedtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The Benefits
"
144,EW,"Medtronic (MDT) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) stocks dipped Monday despite a series of bullish reports, including one that called the heart-valve replacement rivals ""stocks to own near term.""In midday trading,Shares of Medtronic ended virtually flat at 81.03 on the stock market today while Edwards closed up 0.3% at 95.87. But RBC analyst Glenn Novarro expects both to have strong catalysts in the near term.In a note to clients Sunday, Novarro said he sees Edwards, Medtronic, Stryker (SYK), Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) and K2M Group (KTWO) as ""stocks to own near term."" He calls Edwards and Medtronic the ""best ideas in cardiovascular."" Both work in heart-valve replacements.A recent study by Medtronic, showing that a new method of inserting a heart valve could be superior to open-heart surgery, is encouraging, Novarro said. The results could help stoke growth in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement market, he said.Check Out The IBD Best Mutual Fund AwardsFollowing Novarro's report, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar upgraded Edwards stock to a buy rating and raised his price target to 110 from 98.50. Needham analyst Mike Matson reiterated his buy rating and 91 price target on Medtronic stock.Matson expects Medtronic to maintain mid-single-digit sales growth and double-digit earnings growth after overcoming ""temporary"" product cycle and competitive issues in the fiscal third quarter.""We believe Medtronic's product cycle remains very strong and that it can effectively fend off competitive product launches despite investor concerns,"" Matson wrote in a note to clients.Medtronic competes against Edwards Lifesciences, a smaller outfit, in heart-valve replacements. Boston Scientific (BSX) also is looking to break into the transcatheter aortic valve replacement market in the U.S., but doesn't yet have FDA approval.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific is working to catch up with Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences via a strategic acquisition. Read on in Sector Leaders.Over the next 18 months, Medtronic has a number of launches that should help boost growth. The company sees strong growth in its emerging markets segment, which makes up 14% of total sales and has seen double-digit growth in recent quarters.""We believe Medtronic can sustain double-digit growth in these markets, driven by market development, channel optimization and public/private partnerships,"" Matson said. Saudi Arabia should see a return to growth soon.RBC's Novarro expects Medtronic to continue gaining share in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator market. The devices are used to manage tachycardia. He expects transcatheter aortic valve replacements and drug-coated balloons to perform well in 2017.Novarro calls for in-line to slightly better first- and second-quarter metrics for Edwards. He expects Medtronic's launch of its CoreValve Evolut-R to drive growth also for Edwards' Sapien XT.Both devices are transcatheter aortic valve implants for patients with hardened heart valves unable to undergo open-heart surgery. Novarro recommends owning Edwards stock going into the second half of 2017 on expectation for market growth.Evercore's Kumar notes that Edwards stock is a growth stock and therefore volatile by nature.""With lowered investor expectations, we believe Edwards shares are poised for a 'catch-up' trade and offer asymmetric risk-reward at current levels,"" he wrote in a research report. He sees 15% upside at current stock levels.Kumar was previously sidelined on Edwards stock with competition from Boston Scientific in international markets. But Boston pulled its Lotus valve off the market in late February, giving Edwards ""its first break in six months.""Still, the companies are likely at a patent standoff until the first half of 2018.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study, And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Wins In Patent Battle Vs.

"
145,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Boston Scientific (BSX) stocks got a boost Friday after Medtronic (MDT) published a study showing that a new method of inserting a heart valve could be a better alternative than open-heart surgery.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Edwards stock popped 1.6% to 94.40 as Boston stock followed, up 0.6%, near 24.43. Though Medtronic conducted the study, its exposure to the transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, market is smaller. Shares lifted a fraction, to 82.23.All three companies play in the market, but Boston is still testing its products in this realm. In patients with hardened valves -- a condition called aortic stenosis -- the procedure allows a new heart valve to be inserted via catheter, and the new device pushes the diseased aortic valve aside.The trial monitored 1,660 patients who received a heart valve replacement over two years. At the two-year mark, 12.6% of the patients who underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement had died or suffered a disabling stroke vs. 14% of patients who underwent surgery.Analysts had generally expected a 15%-17% rate of death or disabling stroke in patients who underwent the new method of heart valve replacement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific is looking to take on Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences with an acquisition in December. Will it be successful? Head to Sector Leaders for a look at the upcoming battle in medical technology.Surgery is much riskier and involves a longer recovery period. Medtronic met its goal of proving TAVR is not inferior to the surgical method of replacing a diseased heart valve. This could help push more doctors into using the newer method, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said.""We believe the positive Edwards (stock) reaction is due to the fact that a larger body of clinical evidence showing TAVR as safe and effective would convince more surgeons to consider TAVR as a viable option for aortic stenosis patients at lower surgical risk,"" he wrote in a note.Novarro forecasts the TAVR market to exceed $5 billion by 2020, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 20% over the next four years. He sees Medtronic getting FDA approval for its CoreValve TAVR platform in intermediate-risk patients in the next three to six months.RELATED:Boston Scientific Wins In Patent Battle Vs.

155,EW,"Boston Scientific (BSX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) could reach a cross-licensing agreement for designs on their heart valves, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar suggested Thursday after Boston triumphed in a German court on patent issues.The court ruled Edwards infringed on two of Boston's patents for a ""skirt"" and a ""sac"" to reduce leaks for transcatheter aortic valve replacements. But the court also ruled Boston infringed on one of Edwards patents for a structure within the heart valve known as the ""support beam."" It tossed out a second Edwards patent.The German decision puts Boston in ""a commanding position in its IP litigation with Edwards,"" Kumar wrote in a research report. He expects Boston to file for a court action that would prevent Edwards from selling its heart valve in Germany. An injunction is unlikely while Edwards' appeal is ongoing, he wrote.Thursday's ruling follows a U.K. decision last week in which a court ruled one Edwards' patents for a ""sac outside the anchor to provide a seal"" as valid and infringed. But a second patent for a fabric seal on its Sapien 3 valve was ruled invalid.Edwards said Thursday it's planning to appeal the German decision. The company expects court proceedings to continue in various locations over an extended period of time. The two med-tech giants also are battling it out in the U.S., France and Canada.Boston Scientific stock closed up 0.7% at 24.69 on the stock market today, and Edwards jumped 3.9% 93.06.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic are battling it out in the heart-valve market. Who leads? Head to Sector Leaders for a deep dive.Edwards is also appealing portions of the UK court decision, but precedence doesn't look good for the company, Kumar wrote. In an earlier patent battle with Medtronic (MDT) regarding heart-valve tech, higher courts upheld decisions in Germany and the UK. Medtronic and Edwards ultimately settled. Medtronic pays Edwards a royalty of no less than $40 million annually.Edwards has 65% of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement — a type of heart-valve replacement — market, Kumar wrote. Medtronic trails with 30%. Using the earlier settlement model, Edwards could end up paying Boston no less than $80 million per year, he said. Or, the duo could agree to license one another's tech.""In our scenario analysis, we had noted that in the event Boston Scientific wins and Edwards Lifesciences comes out with the poorer hand, it could potentially force the players to arrive at a cross licensing agreement,"" he wrote.RELATED:Edwards Stock Dips On Patent Loss In Lawsuit With Rival BostonMedtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, J&J, St. Jude RivalriesBoston Topples On Heart Valve Bug; 'Woes' Boost Medtronic, Edwards

The proposal would also repeal the medical device tax.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted the latter point would be a positive, in general ""as a majority of device companies have been reinvesting the benefit from the current temporary repeal of (the) device tax.""This could be a potential boon for med-tech makers like Medtronic (MDT), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which make heart valves.But the bill still has a long way to go before making its way to Trump's desk, Evercore analyst Terry Haines wrote in a research report. It will need near-unanimous support from House and Senate Republicans where Democrats will likely be in opposition.""We are only at the beginning of the legislative process on part of ACA reform,"" he wrote. ""We continue to think that the end of June is a realistic target.""The document released late Monday is merely the tax and revenue portions of the ACA repeal. Congress will use the budget reconciliation process — requiring only a majority in both houses — for this portion, Haines wrote.Broader ACA reform will probably not be finalized this year.""It will need some bipartisanship to succeed,"" he wrote.

160,EW,"Medtronic (MDT) stock popped Tuesday after the No. 1 medical-products maker topped fiscal Q3 expectations across the board in what Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar called ""the quickest comeback in large-cap land.""For its fiscal Q3 ended Jan. 27, Medtronic reported $1.12 earnings per share ex items on $7.28 billion in sales, up 3% and 5%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. The consensus saw $1.11 and $7.22 billion, Kumar wrote in a research report.The Q3 beat helped Medtronic stock lift 2.1% on the stock market today to 80.55, touching its highest point since a disappointing Q2 sales and 2017 guidance three months ago sent shares falling 8.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific made a key acquisition late last year that could help it in the battle against Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic. Read on in Sector Leaders for Boston's chances of overtaking Medtronic and Edwards in this key market.Q3 highlights included 7% growth in the cardiac rhythm/heart failure and brain therapies units. Medtronic's diabetes group grew 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter, leading 5% growth in patient monitoring and recovery.Medtronic reaffirmed 2017 guidance for mid-single-digit sales growth on a constant currency basis. For fiscal Q4, the company sees sales growing in the lower half of mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis.Medtronic competes closely against Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in the heart disease market, though Medtronic leads in terms of market cap, at nearly $109 billion compared with Boston's $34.6 billion and Edwards' $19.2 billion.RELATED:Medtronic Could Boost 2018 EPS On Potential $5 Billion DivestitureMedtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, J&J, St. Jude RivalriesEdwards Heart-Valve Guidance Lags On Medtronic, Boston Rivalry

161,EW,"Thursday's saw-toothed session left stocks lower for a second time this week as Facebook (FB) reversed its early gains and investors looked toward Amazon.com's (AMZN) quarterly report after the close — and to the January payrolls report coming up Friday morning.Preliminary data show volume tracking well below Wednesday's levels on the stock market today.Early data showing a jump in January layoffs, lower-than-expected weekly unemployment claims and a slowdown in fourth-quarter worker productivity contributed to the session's wobbly start. Bonds were steady ahead of Friday's jobs report. Oil closed down a 0.5% with West Texas intermediate at $53.54 a barrel.Facebook backed out of modest early gains to end 2% lower following its fiscal first quarter earnings beat late Wednesday. The stock closed 1% above a cup-with-handle buy point of 129.37.Amazon managed a 1% gain in regular trade, but quickly dropped 4% after the close. The e-commerce giant's Q4 results were mixed, with a better-than-forecast 55% jump in earnings and a 22% revenue gain, which missed analyst expectations. The after-hours decline put shares back below an 821.75 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Extended session gains and losses often do not carry through to the next session's regular trade.Amgen (AMGN), AthenaHealth (ATHN), Deckers Outdoor (DECK) and Visa (V) were among  other names expected to report after the close.Infant formula maker Mead Johnson (MJN) spiked 22% after confirming it was in discussions with U.K.-based Reckitt Benckiser to acquire Mead's outstanding shares at $90 each, valuing the deal at around $16.7 billion. Mead's Enfamil is the second-largest infant formula brand in the world. Reckitt Benckiser shares ended 4% higher on the London Stock Exchange.Merck (MRK) was the Dow's big winner, up 3% after mixed fourth-quarter results were affected by the launch of a resource planning system and patent expirations on several key drugs. Merck closed 9% above a December low as it climbs the right side of a two-month base pattern.Among IBD 50 stocks, Cadence Systems (CDNS) screamed 12% higher.  The design automation software developer reported late Wednesday fourth-quarter results that narrowly topped analysts projections. Management's first-quarter earnings guidance was in line with consensus views; revenue came in above expectations. The breakout gain left the stock at a new high and 6% above a flat base buy point of 27.14.Prestige Brand Holdings (PBH), also an IBD 50 stock, belted out a 6% gain.  The maker of Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Efferdent and Beano stomped analyst fourth-quarter expectations and tightened up its full-year guidance. The low-volume move cleared a 53.90 buy point in an imperfect cup-with-handle base.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) dropped 8.5% in heavy trade despite reporting better-than-forecast fourth quarter results late Wednesday. Q1 and full-year guidance was in line with analysts' views, but BTIG downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.  Edwards had been in an uptrend since early December, working to recover from a deep, two-month sell off.RELATED:Online Brokers Fall As Schwab Slashes Stock, ETF Trading FeesAmazon Mixed; Visa, Amgen Beat; Chipotle Profit Misses Late

162,EW,"As Medtronic (MDT) preps to dredge Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) share of the heart valve-replacement market, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Boston Scientific (BSX) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) are lining up in 2017 to gouge various pieces of Medtronic's business.Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences stocks rifted Tuesday on differing analyst views for 2017. In the stock market today, Medtronic stock fell 0.86% to 70.62, after a Morgan Stanley analyst downgraded the stock. Edwards stock rose 1.9% to a two-month high of 95.49.David Lewis, of Morgan Stanley, downgraded Medtronic stock to equal weight from overweight. He also cut his price target to 77 from 85. Shares closed 2016 down 7%, vastly below their 50-day moving average and will likely be muted on growth perspectives this year, Lewis said.Medtronic completed its $43 billion acquisition of Covidien, an Irish medical products and device maker, in January 2015 and margins disappeared in the aftermath of the acquisition, as expected, but ""organic growth served as a nice bridge,"" Lewis wrote in his research report.""But organic growth has decelerated each of the last two quarters,"" he wrote. ""We are not convinced we see a path to outperformance in light of topline headwinds until management can demonstrate more durable cost opportunities in fiscal 2019.""IBD'S TAKE: Late last year, Boston Scientific acquired Neovasc's tissue business in a deal that could hurt rivals Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences. Check out how these Sector Leaders are battling it out in the medical products field.Medtronic's 2017 growth will hinge, in part, on traction of its MiniMed 670G, a hybrid closed loop diabetes management system, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a large-valve indication for intermediate risk patients, expected in mid-2017.Lewis project 3%-4% organic growth if Medtronic's launches gain traction.Meanwhile, Medtronic will see increased competition in MRI safe launches from Boston. Boston and St. Jude are emerging rivals in deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's patients. Spectranetics will soon compete in drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatments, and J&J is getting into the minimally invasive procedure arena.Edwards stock, on the other hand, pulled in an upgrade Tuesday. Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale upgraded Edwards stock to a buy from neutral, and established a 120 price target. He says transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) expectations have ""come back down to Earth"" after a lackluster Q3.But there's still room for growth in the TAVR market, Pasquale wrote in his report. He estimates global TAVR sales for 2016 will come in at $2.545 billion, with Edwards bringing in $1.622 billion. Consensus estimates were 20% lower in January 2016, he noted.""It would have been hard to imagine this being considered a disappointing outcome a year ago, yet investor sentiment on both Edwards and the TAVR opportunity has soured somewhat in the wake of Q3 results that failed to show the kind of positive inflection many Street models forecast,"" he wrote.Analysts were exceptionally bullish after Edwards got an intermediate risk indication for TAVR patients in August, Pasquale noted. That, plus temporary capacity constraints at some centers and the natural ""ebb and flow"" of the market, likely led to the major Q3 disappointment.Pasquale estimates procedures still grew 40% year over year last quarter. He expects worldwide TAVR sales to double over the next five years — ""a trend that Edwards should be the primary beneficiary of even as competition increases,"" he said.RELATED:Edwards Heart-Valve Guidance Lags On Medtronic, Boston RivalryEdwards 2017 Guidance Likely Hinges On Rivalry With Medtronic, Boston
"
163,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) fiscal 2017 guidance lagged Wall Street for its heart-valve replacement tech amid fierce competition with Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX), but sales views were in line and shares neared a month high Thursday.On the stock market today, Edwards Lifesciences stock lifted 6.65% to 89.30. Shares are up 13% year to date, but remain down sharply following Edwards' Q3 earnings report on Oct. 25. Then, shares toppled 19% on sales that fell short.For fiscal 2017, Edwards guided to $3 billion to $3.4 billion in sales, up 10%-14%, and $3.30 to $3.45 earnings per share ex items. Sales guidance met with consensus for 12% growth and EPS was in line with analysts' expectations for $3.40, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in a research report.But transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) guidance lagged the consensus, Kumar wrote. The firm guided to $1.7 billion to $2 billion in sales, up 15%-20%. The midpoint of Edwards' guidance lagged analysts' views for 19%-20% growth.Kumar noted, however, that Edwards typically guides conservatively and ""ends up beating and raising."" The TAVR guidance miss comes amid mounting pressure from rivals Medtronic and Boston Scientific.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration looks likely to approve Medtronic for a large-valve indication for intermediate risk patients in mid-2017. And Boston Scientific could potentially enter the TAVR market before the end of 2017, Kumar wrote in a report Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific acquired Neovasc's tissue business earlier this year. The asset could help it take on Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences. See how these Sector Leaders are dealing with the ongoing rivalry.Meanwhile, Edwards and its peers are seeing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) sales lag as they try to get a handle on the transcatheter mitral valve replacement/repair market. Edwards entered the replacement side with its acquisition of CardiAC and recently acquired ValTech's Cardioband for repair.Following Edwards' disappointing Q3, Thursday's analyst day could be a clearing event, Kumar said.""Couple of factors that investors need to consider will be the assumptions around TAVR growth in U.S. and EU, and what the likely impact of competition could be,"" he wrote. ""This is important given that the market growth was below trend in 3Q.""Boston Scientific was unchanged at 20.50 Thursday.

193,EW,"IBD 50 companies of all kinds are expected to report solid quarterly results in the coming week, potentially an indication that the gears driving our tech, retail, auto, medical and defense sectors are moving more freely. Here's a look at what analysts expect.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) — the security chipmaker that helps keep your Apple Pay transactions safe — reports fourth-quarter results after the close on Wednesday.The Netherlands-based company, which recently introduced technology allowing drivers to lock and unlock their cars via their phones, owes much of its success to the immense popularity of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6, of which NXP is a supplier.Analysts expect NXP's EPS to springboard up 33% to $1.32 — the strongest gain of any of the IBD 50 stocks reviewed here. Revenue is seen increasing 17% to $1.51 billion.NXP shares emerged from a first-stage flat base this month but have rattled around near their 50-day line, where investors will often buy shares if they have faith in the company. The stock has ascended 82% since 2014.Shares slipped 0.7% on the stock market Friday but are still holding above a buy point and are in buy range.Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) reports on Tuesday. The company's artificial heart valve, Sapien, has helped keep gains aloft in recent quarters.Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 4% from a year earlier to 95 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 14% to $610.5 million.Edwards' Q3 results in October indicated to analysts that growth in the global transcatheter aortic valve replacement market continues to exceed expectations.The stock is up about 86% in the last year but in recent weeks has converged with its 50-day line. Shares fell 3% Friday to below that key level of support.As more business adapts to so-called omnichannel retailing — in which customers might use a combination of online and in-store outlets to buy products — Manhattan Associates' (MANH) supply-chain-management software helps them keep track of the orders.When the company reports Q4 results on Tuesday, analysts expect to see EPS rise 16% to 28 cents and revenue elevate 10% to $118.9 million.Since July 2012, the last time the stock spent any extended time below its 200-day line, Manhattan shares have risen more than 300%.Shares tripped up last November after trying to clear a cup-with-handle base begun in March. But they ricocheted up off their 50-day line in early January and have remained above it since.Car-dealer operator Asbury Auto (ABG) has thrived in recent years on the auto industry's rebound. Analysts expect the company, which reports Q4 results on Wednesday, to grow EPS by 15% to $1.01, though that would mark the slowest growth since Q3 2011. Sales are seen increasing 8% to $1.48 billion.Shares entered into a sixth-stage consolidation from July through November and have been seeking support at their 50-day line for most of January. The later the stage, the greater a stock's chance of topping out, IBD research finds. Still, shares are up 48% since 2014.O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) also reports Q4 results Wednesday. With more cars lasting longer, the company has benefited from part replacements. As the months get colder, O'Reilly could also see sales pick up from repairs to winter-ravaged cars.Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) — a company whose propulsion, fuselage and wing systems go into military aircraft and passenger jets — reports Q4 results Tuesday. Analysts see EPS increasing 17% to 76 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 12% to $1.674 billion.Spirit serves such companies as defense contractor General Dynamics (GD) and aerospace giant Boeing (BA), which this week both reported estimate-topping Q4 results.Spirit shares cleared a flat base and have found support at their 50-day line.Apparel retailer Under Armour (UA), whose 'athleisure' wear continues to attract the athletic and the leisured alike, reports Q4 results Wednesday after the close.Analysts see EPS escalating 30% to 39 cents and revenue rising 24% to $849.63 million, which would continue a slight deceleration in sales gains over the past three quarters.Citigroup this month upgraded Under Armour to buy, citing the company's domestic and international prospects. But that upgrade came a day after Jefferies downgraded the stock, citing ""few near-term catalysts and valuation that accurately reflects the company's long-term growth prospects.""Under Armour stock cleared a fourth-stage cup-with-handle base on Thursday but struggled for momentum Friday as they slipped 1%.

"
218,EW,"December is usually a quiet month for medical tech news, but this year will bring a few potentially stock-moving events worth keeping an eye on.As you digest your Thanksgiving turkey, here are the top five in chronological order:By Dec. 5, biotech Incyte (INCY) is looking to get an important expansion of the label on its sole marketed drug, Jakafi. As explained in the recent Incyte profile in The New America, Incyte and its partner Novartis (NVS) have been pulling in respectable income on Jakafi as a treatment for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. The FDA is pondering whether to add an indication for polycythemia vera, a milder but more common condition. While uptake for that condition is expected to be fairly slow, it's expected to help push Incyte into more consistently profitable territory next year.Two days later, hot medical-device company Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will hold its annual investor day, in which it is expected to give 2015 guidance for the first time. The company impressed the Street last month with its strong Q3 report and Q4 guidance, on the strong launch of its latest Sapien artificial heart valve. Currently, analysts are forecasting 2015 sales of $2.47 billion, up 7% from this year's estimate. Earnings per share are expected to rise 17% to $3.95.Then, sometime before Dec. 21 (which likely means Dec. 19), the FDA is due to issue its verdict on AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C combo of Viekirax and Exviera. The clinical-trial data was so good, the Street would probably be less surprised if a meteor hit Manhattan than if the FDA rejects the drug, but what has analysts all on pins and needles is what the price will be. A price significantly lower than Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) recently launched Harvoni, which costs $94,000 for a 12-week treatment, would help AbbVie gain market share and certainly please pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts (ESRX), which has been hoping to start a price war to drive down the suddenly high cost of hepatitis C treatment. However, most analysts are expecting AbbVie to price only a little bit lower. Also affected by all this will be Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which licensed a component of Viekirax to AbbVie.Speaking of hepatitis C, sometime before the end of the year the Street is expecting to hear phase one clinical-trial data on Achillion Pharmaceuticals' (ACHN) ACH-3422. The drug belongs to the coveted nucleoside inhibitor class, to which Gilead's mega-blockbuster Sovaldi (also a component in Harvoni) belongs, but which has otherwise shown enough safety issues that there are few left in development. Especially since Merck (MRK) acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for its ""nuc,"" speculation that Achillion could be the next target has driven up its stock price, but the Street has seen little real data about the safety and effectiveness of ACH-3422. The data would help analysts determine just how much the company is worth.Speculation exists about whether two aborted takeover attempts earlier this year will be re-upped. The Street seems to have mostly given up on the possibility that Pfizer (PFE) will make another bid for AstraZeneca (AZN) after the six-month cooling-off period mandated under U.K. takeover rules expired on Wednesday. Astra's CEO Pascal Soriot threw more cold water while appearing on CNBC Thursday, saying the deal would have fallen apart even if it had been made because of proposed restrictions on tax-inversion deals in the U.S. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro is still holding out hope for a union of orthopedics firms Stryker (SYK) and Smith & Nephew (SNN). Stryker didn't bid for the company, but since a news report leaked that it was working on one, it got slapped with the U.K.'s six-month cooling-off period anyway, which expired Nov. 28.""We believe a SYK/SNN deal could provide more recon (reconstructive surgery) scale, particularly in international markets, expand SYK's presence in trauma/sports medicine, and bring cost synergies,"" Novarro wrote in a note Friday.

Investors seem to feel more optimistic about job growth and manufacturing at home and less bothered by the picture of disarray abroad.SPY set a 2016 high of 202.81 Friday, a nice turnaround for the largest U.S. exchange traded fund.Last month, it was down about 15% from its 52-week high.

The cigarette maker brandishes four consecutive quarters of accelerating sales growth. Earnings grew 9% on average over the past three years.The stock yields 3.2%, making it a nice dividend play.

271,EW,"Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was rising in heavy trading Thursday after it received an upgrade based on a bullish outlook for its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bruce Nudell upgraded Edwards stock to buy from neutral and raised his price target to 88 from 86 based on last Friday's announcement that the FDA had approved a new study of the Sapien 3 in elderly patients who have severe aortic stenosis and have a low risk of death from traditional surgical valve replacement. Edwards launched Sapien 3 last year for high-risk patients, but the study could potentially expand its market, based on somewhat more lenient standards than expected, Nudell wrote.""Following FDA approval to initiate a Sapien 3 low-risk IDE (investigational device exemption) study with a one-year primary endpoint (vs. anticipated two-year follow-up), we've updated our TAVR market model to reflect this expedited timeline for label expansion into this substantial patient pool,"" Nudell wrote in his research note. ""Our estimate for the TAVR market increases from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $5 billion (in line with company projections) and from $6.3 billion in 2025 to $6.55 billion.""Currently, the TAVR market is split between Edwards' Sapien and Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve.Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy also raised her estimates for the same reason, while maintaining an outperform rating on Edwards stock.""Our updated model assumes — and conservatively so, we believe — just a modest uptake in low-risk patients, reaching 26% penetration in both the U.S. and Europe within two years of approval,"" Antalffy wrote in her research note Thursday. ""With a low-risk approval, we believe 10%+ global TAVR market growth is sustainable for the foreseeable future, with ramping volumes helping to offset what we model to be mid-single-digit to 10% annual price declines as new competitors enter the market, predominantly in the U.S.""Edwards is one of the leading stocks in the Medical Products group, with a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92. By early afternoon on the stock market today, Edwards stock was up 4.5%, near 79. Medtronic stock was up nearly 1%, near 75.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

272,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) 2017 guidance, slated for release at its analyst day event on Thursday, could be somewhat strangled on the likelihood of rivals Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) pressuring the U.S. heart valve replacement market, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said Tuesday.Kumar expects Edwards to issue a conservative transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) view for 2017 on tough comps and continued competitive pressure. The FDA is expected to grant Medtronic a large-valve indication for intermediate risk patients in mid-2017, and Boston could compete in the U.S. by year-end.That follows international pressure beginning in 2014 when Edwards' TAVR sales began to decelerate following the entry of Medtronic and Boston, Kumar wrote. Wall Street models 19%-22% growth in the U.S. in 2017, with FactSet polling at 11%-22% growth internationally.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific's acquisition of Neovasc could rattle Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences. Hit up Sector Leaders for the deep dive.Edwards will likely issue TAVR guidance at 15%-25% growth, the midpoint just missing broader analyst views, Kumar wrote. But Edwards has historically issued a conservative outlook and then raised it over the course of a year, he says.""Given these moving parts, we wouldn't be surprised to (see) the range widen,"" he wrote in a research report.Investors are likely to key in Thursday on Edwards' plan for dealing with competitive pressure in the U.S., Kumar said. Still, Edwards has a strong track record of outlasting rivals, with U.S. sales growing by half thus far in 2016 despite additional pressure.Meanwhile, TAVR sales are cannibalizing SAVR (surgical aortic valve replacement) sales, Kumar says. He also identifies TMVR (transcatheter mitral valve replacement/repair) as the ""single largest pipeline opportunity for Edwards Lifesciences and other cardio players over the next five years.""TMVR is especially important as there are two methods of treatment: replacement and repair. Edwards has traditionally played in the replacement arena, with its acquisition of CardiAC. The acquisition of ValTech's Cardioband opens up the repair side, Kumar says.Kumar sees Edwards touching on the TMVR market in its analyst day commentary.""While we thought this was a complementary acquisition, some investors have wondered whether this was a sign that Edwards Lifesciences was hedging its bet in this crucial pipeline opportunity,"" he wrote.He kept his hold rating and 105 price target on Edwards stock. At the close on the stock market today, Edwards stock was up 0.9% to close at 83.22 Tuesday, but it's down more than 30% from a record high near 122 touched in late September, plunging 17% in October on weak Q3 sales.

275,EW,"Medtronic (MDT) stock plunged to a nine-month low Tuesday after the medical device maker reported fiscal Q2 sales that missed Wall Street views — though earnings topped by a penny — and lowered its 2017 guidance.Medtronic stock closed down 8.7% at 73.60. Heart valve rival Edwards Lifesciences (EW) saw its shares tumble 4.7% to 85.04, an eight-month low.For its fiscal Q2 ended Oct. 28, Medtronic reported $7.35 billion in sales, missing analysts' views for $7.46 billion, up 4% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Medtronic's $1.12 earnings per share ex items were up 8.7%.""Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations,"" Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak said in the earnings release. ""We faced issues that affected our growth, including slower than expected revenue as we await new product introductions, particularly in CVG and diabetes.""IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 50, meaning it performs in the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Who's a better bet? Dig into IBD's Stock Checkup for more.Revenue for Medtronic's cardiac and vascular group (CVG) rose 4%, mainly on growth following the acquisition of HeartWare and growth in the aortic and peripheral vascular (APV) division. But sales from the coronary and structural heart (CSH) division were flat.The minimally invasive therapies group (MITG) grew 5%, largely due to 5% growth in surgical solutions. But that growth was partially offset in the U.S. by competitive pressure in reprocessing advanced energy tools and by timing issues in the Middle East.Medtronic slashed its 2017 guidance to mid-single-digit revenue growth vs. earlier views for higher-single-digit growth. The company now expects a $20 million to $60 million sales hit, assuming exchange rates remain the same.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted that Medtronic stock has pulled back recently as customers await new products. Large valves have been approved for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and should help in the second half, he wrote in a research note.Diabetes sales slowed to 3% growth in Q2 as customers await the MiniMed, which is set to launch in early 2017. The MiniMed 670G is the first hybrid closed loop system to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. It automatically adjusts delivery of basal insulin.""All in, this was a disappointing quarter from Medtronic,"" Kumar wrote. ""That said, we think the recent pullback (underperformed by about 7% vs. S&P 500) bakes in some of this.""Kumar kept a buy rating and 94 price target on Medtronic stock.RELATED:Edwards, Medtronic Rebound After Negative Report; Medtech Spiraling

276,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Medtronic (MDT) stocks rebounded Tuesday after a report suggested a key heart procedure could be deadlier than surgery, but the medical tech sector remains poised for a historically bad quarter, says Evercore.The iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF is up 7.7% for the year, but it dipped 1.1% on Monday after a German study of 5,997 patients treated for aortic stenosis from 2011-13 showed higher death rates for those treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) vs. surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).At one year, the mortality rate for TAVR patients was 17%, vs. 8.9% in SAVR patients. After adjusting for sickness level and age in patients, the mortality rates were 16% and 11%, respectively.On Monday, shares of Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic toppled 4.9% and 4%, respectively, on the news. The two are alone in the TAVR market. But Edwards Lifesciences rallied 2.7% on Tuesday to close at 88.91, and Medtronic rose 1.9% to 80.27 on the stock market today.IBD's 122-company Medical-Products industry group fell 0.73% Monday and added 1.9% Tuesday. The iShares medtech ETF climbed 2%.IBD'S TAKE: ETFs are a good proxy for broader sectors. Make sure to keep tabs on IBD's ETFs & Funds page for hot — and cold — sectors.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar says the TAVR patients were higher risk and doesn't put much stock into the report, presented at the American Heart Association conference. TAVR is an important, growing area and represents a $2 billion opportunity, he says. By 2021, that's expected to reach $5 billion.""We looked at AHA slides, and we believe that the TAVR patients were a high-risk pool relative to SAVR, and the comparison was apples to oranges,"" he wrote in a research report. ""As such, we do not expect the German registry data to have any impact on TAVR adoption.""That said, the medtech industry is in a downturn. On a relative basis, the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF is down 9% quarter to date vs. the S&P 500, which Evercore says would be the second-worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis. Shares ducked 10% in Q3 2010, the worst quarter.Kumar blames uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act following the election of Donald Trump. Trump campaigned on the premise that he would repeal Obamacare, but has since waffled, saying he likes pieces of the law — like the provision against denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.Prior corrections in medtech were pre-empted by periods of soft volumes and peak pricing pressure. That's not the case this time around, Kumar says. Pricing is currently stable, utilization has been strong, and new products are opening up a number of greenfield opportunities.Rather, ""the correction is implying the ACA goes away,"" he wrote.""We believe that medtech stocks are currently pricing in a (scaling) back in ACA that could lead to volume weakness,"" he wrote. ""As long as there are no new incremental negatives, fundamentally we think stocks are compelling here.""RELATEDZimmer Plunges On Lowered Full-Year Forecast, Weak Q3 SalesEdward Lifesciences Revenue Miss Jolts Investors

Samsung's cancellation of its Galaxy Note 7 phone after reports of explosions should help the iPhone. Apple cleared a 110.33 buy point on Sept. 14 and continued to move higher.

288,EW,"U.S. stock indexes battled to overcome turbulence midday Wednesday after a slew of issues suffered bearish gap-down moves at the open.The Nasdaq itself gapped down as much as 0.7% and then backfilled the gap to a 0.3% loss. The early dunking took the composite back to its 50-day line, where it found support and bounced up. The S&P 500 was flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%.Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher on both major exchanges compared to the previous session.An unusually high number of blue chip stocks suffered gap downs at the open. A gap down occurs when a stock opens and stays below the lowest price in the previous day's range. In the S&P 100, which is comprised of the biggest blue chips in the S&P 500, a dozen stocks gapped down. This is unusual for conservative stocks.S&P 100 gap downs included Simon Property Group (SPG), Apple (AAPL), and home-improvement chain Lowe's (LOW).Some of the early gap downs reversed to fill in all or part of the gap as the session continued.IBD'S TAKE: The gap downs ought to make individual investors think twice before buying a stock, but Northrop Grumman gapped up into a buy zone Wednesday.In some cases, the negative reactions seemed a bit excessive. Dow transports member Southwest Airlines (LUV) gapped down 11% in torrid volume despite earnings that topped the consensus estimate by about 6%. Revenue fell shy of expectations by 0.6%, and guidance was weak. The company said it expected Q4 unit revenue to decline 4% to 5%.A strong market might have shrugged off the negatives and focused on the earnings beat, or at least contained the damage.

291,EW,"Leading tech stocks tumbled last week as mutual funds sold shares in the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google. But the manager of $3 billion Franklin DynaTech Fund, an IBD Best Mutual Fund 2016 Award winner, isn't panicking.Judging by DynaTech's (FKDNX) lowly portfolio turnover rate of 31% and comments by lead manager Matthew Moberg on the power driving growth in several key holdings, the fund remains hitched in a big way to the market's leading stocks.DynaTech has an outsized bet on technology, with a 48% weighting as of June 30, according to Franklin Templeton.That sort of megabet on a single sector could make a fund volatile. But this fund's performance is consistent as well as strong. The fund was up 3.15% so far this year as of Oct. 31. The S&P 500 was up 5.87%. DynaTech's return topped 78% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 0.91% gain.The fund generated average annual returns of 8.42%, 13.2% and 9.26% the past three, five and 10 years.The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard. It was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all large caps and all growth funds.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersMoberg, 45 years old, has been shepherding DynaTech since 2004. He talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in San Mateo, Calif.IBD: Matthew, why does the fund have such a large technology weighting?Moberg: The fund focuses on innovation and growth.Our name, ""DynaTech,"" stands for dynamic technologies. We define dynamic as a force that stimulates change or progress. Innovation is where the bulk of wealth creation occurs. But we view this as a broad mandate. We're able to look for innovation anywhere.And we believe you need active management to invest in innovation. It's a part of the market that is often misunderstood. Some people believe it is too expensive, or too unknown. So that's an area we look through because those misunderstandings mean opportunities get overlooked.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: Is your current tech weighting typical for the fund?Moberg: It's been as high as 50%. But sector classifications change. Amazon (AMZN) is now classified as a consumer discretionary stock. Early on, it was tech.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are holdings. They're still considered information technology companies. But one could argue that they are financials.We look for innovation, which can be found in a lot of places.IBD: Health care was your second largest sector, with a 27% weighting. That's another hotbed of innovation, right?Moberg: It's not a great year for health care because of the election (and some candidates talking about price controls). But, yes, there's a lot of innovation there. You see it in possibly emerging treatments for diseases like hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, even cancer.IBD: What are some names you like in that space?Moberg: Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY).Click Here To See A List Of Biggest Mutual Funds Ranked By PerformanceIBD: Is the fund's performance consistent because it is diversified? Because it's exposed to other sectors, not just tech and health care? Why else?Moberg: Yes, we are diversified. And consistency is also due to our fundamental research. Sometimes we find stocks that the market doesn't appreciate how quickly they will come to market. The best example is Facebook (FB). They launched their mobile ads in Q2 2012. In the first quarter they only did $13 million in revenue. That was 1.3% of their total revenue. Two years and three months later, mobile was doing $1.659 billion. That's more advertising revenue than CBS' $1.63 billion in the similar quarter.Technology adoption is accelerating. The world is more global. Investors often don't appreciate how fast a new technology rises. So we try to think long-term. Our short-term performance is just a byproduct of how we think long-term.IBD'S TAKE: See how near Facebook and other highly rated stocks are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.IBD: What part of Facebook's story do you like the most now?Moberg: First, mobile usage. Mobile ads will be more effective than other ads, one could argue. Facebook probably has the best set of mobile applications. And there's a runway for growth there.Second, they're starting to monetize Instagram, where people share pictures. The next step is to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. Usage on them has been explosive. And there's a good chance that this goes into commerce (rather than remain solely a social activity).Finally, when you're thinking about what they could monetize five or 10 years out, Oculus (which makes a virtual reality headset) is another interesting acquisition. Facebook didn't pay much for it. And they can probably monetize it in five to 10 years. It has a long runway, like Messenger and WhatsApp.IBD: Edwards Lifesciences (EW) seems to be benefiting from a new management fiscal discipline and from a key new product, their transcatheter aortic value replacement (TAVR).Moberg: Yes, right now they're going through a very nice product cycle with TAVR. It had a rough start. But now TAVR is an example of a sensational innovation. It enables patients to avoid the need for open-heart surgery, cracking open your rib cage, making a giant incision. Instead, they put the TAVR in through an artery with a small incision. Patients spend less time in the hospital, go through less pain. And with each iteration, the valve gets smaller and easier to insert.That product cycle will last another five-plus years.They're also working on something for mitral valves, which are harder to reach. We hope and expect them to be the leader in that field as well. If they can do it, it would double their addressable market.IBD: Edwards had disappointing sales in Q3 and its stock plummeted. How has this changed your outlook for the company and stock?Moberg: We remain positive on Edwards Lifesciences. Edwards is still in the early stages of capturing the transcatheter aortic valve replacement opportunity (65% share of a $2.5 billion or so market that is only about one-third penetrated).  Its stock also fails to account for any potential for the transcatheter mitral valve replacement opportunity, and mitral valve disease is twice as prevalent as aortic valve disease.  It has faced missteps in new products before — again the world doesn't work as linearly as we would like — but we believe this is an excellent business.IBD: I'll make a wild guess that you are not one of those investors who finds Amazon's product experiments wasteful.Moberg: They're incredibly innovative. They're continually investing in new things. They've had three big successes. The first was Prime. They get money upfront (from consumers). And it drove up usage of Amazon significantly. The second was letting third parties sell on the website, with fulfillment by Amazon. It required no investment in inventory, and generated higher margins.In addition, they have Amazon Web Services, which is increasingly important. It's one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service companies ever.Amazon continues to invest, find new ideas. They've had quite a few failures along the way, but I understand you need to take risk to succeed. That attitude gives us confidence in their continued growth.IBD: Any concerns about Amazon's miss on Q3 results? Any sign of more weakness to come?Moberg: They have gone through many investment cycles in the past. Step-ups in investments don't always, in fact rarely, work within a quarterly reporting cycle. We understand that.  Over the long term Amazon has had very good returns on invested capital, prefers to grow organically and has a culture of innovation.  We didn't see anything in the quarter that suggests that is no longer the case.IBD: Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) is somewhat new to the portfolio. But it has seven straight quarters of slowing earnings. What's your thesis?Moberg: We like to invest in small positions, see how they do and try to hold on for the long-term. If anything fundamental changes and it's right, we add to it.Pioneer is one of the best positions in oil services. They are one of the lowest priced producers. We think oil will stabilize in the 50 to 60 per barrel range.IBD: Why do you like Chinese online gaming company NetEase (NTES)?Moberg: We believe the gaming space is a secular winner. NetEase has some games that have done well. And the secular trends on gaming are better in China than in the U.S., and it is very strong in the U.S. We will see more virtual reality and different kinds of games and ways for people to spend leisure time playing games.IBD: Do you still like Broadcom (AVGO) as much as you used to?Moberg: We don't believe it is as innovative as it used to be. Most of their accelerating earnings per share is due to consolidation. We prefer companies with innovation, which this was at first.Still, they are doing a great job buying companies, rationalizing costs, raising prices. Their CEO is incredibly well thought of in the (chipmaking) industry. He's executing on strategy extremely well. We're pleased that someone is taking the lead and starting consolidation in that industry.IBD: Nvidia (NVDA) is another relative newcomer to your portfolio. What do you like about their chipmaking?Moberg: They were viewed as a provider of graphics chips inside PCs. Then they expanded, making chips inside game consoles. Now they're broken free of that prison and making central processing units for virtual reality. They're also needed in cars, for autonomous driving. Also in hyperscale servers, they're used as co-processors. CAD-CAM, artificial intelligence — their total addressable market is exploding.We think there's a lot of sustainability to the company and a long trajectory for earnings growth.IBD: You have exposure to the pet care industry. What do you like there?Moberg: It's shocking how well we treat animals now vs. 20 or 30 years ago. Cancer treatment, CT scans — they were unavailable years ago. So we like the secular trend. The company we like most and have owned longer and have the largest position in is Idexx Labs (IDXX). Idexx is a particularly well-positioned business competitively, given its unique ability to single-handedly bundle both outsourced diagnostics and in-practice diagnostic instruments.  Idexx also offers superior information management capabilities regarding animal diagnostic reporting and record-keeping relative to competitors.IBD: What's special about Aspen Technology (AZPN), the software firm?Moberg: They do supply-chain management for process industries. This software is so important that even when companies go bankrupt, they pay their Aspen bill. It is the backbone for many companies.They have tremendous operating margin and profitability. There's some competition, but if you are a serious and large company, you need their technology. And customers are incredibly sticky.IBD: Tell me about your co-manager.Moberg: I am lead manager. The fund was founded in 1968. Rupert Johnson, my co-manager, was the fund's first manager. And as you may know he is also vice chairman of Franklin Resources.IBD: Matthew, people often wonder what portfolio managers do in their off hours. How about you?Moberg: I used to run 25 miles a week. I used to have hobbies. Now I have a 7-, 5- and a 1-year-old. They're my hobbies.And I forgot to mention that I'm an avid reader of history. I was a history major in college. I find that useful in looking at micro trends, adoption rates, periods of major and minor innovation, and pattern recognition of new technologies, as well as macro trends like low interest rates, Federal Reserve actions, periods and government responses.RELATED:Top Mutual Fund Manager Captures Solid Returns Without Messy EmotionsThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With GiddyapHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The Downturn

292,EW,"You've heard the old Wall Street saw countless times: A rising tide lifts all boats. So what's a mutual fund helmsman to do when it's hard to tell if the tide is rising at all?That's the challenge facing John Wilson, Peter Deininger and Tchintcia Barros, managers of $3.3 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund (GEGTX). Economic growth is slow and earnings growth is scarce, they point out in their most recent commentary. That could make it harder to execute their investment game plan: Find stocks whose earnings growth, they forecast with conviction, will be a lot stronger than most investors expect.Only it doesn't. ""We're not finding it more difficult (to find buys) today,"" said lead manager Wilson. It's actually been easier to make buys of growth-oriented stocks that were beaten down earlier this year, he adds.The fund added to health care names Biogen (BIIB) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) as well as consumer cyclical Alibaba Group (BABA) in recent portfolio reports.""Biogen is transitioning toward a new phase of growth,"" Wilson said. That's happening amid maturation in the market for the company's multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs. The company is looking more toward its pipeline of new treatments. And Wilson likes the company's newfound fiscal discipline, imposed by new managers.""The company is going through a management transition, which we're constructive on,"" Wilson said. ""They are trying to spend research-and-development dollars in a more focused fashion.""That focus makes their pipeline of new products interesting, he says, including possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease.Wilson and his colleagues also like developments at Edwards. ""They are very innovative, and have a lead position in a new market with their product that allows minimally invasive (heart) valve replacement surgery.""Edwards' transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) had been approved only for high-risk patients. Wilson says that in the last year TAVR was approved for use with intermediate-risk patients, which is a larger market. TAVR is an alternative to more expensive, less effective treatments, Wilson adds. TAVR treatment is still in the early stages of adoption by physicians and patients, he says.As for Alibaba, Wilson says he is not fazed by the stock's sell-off in recent days. That pullback reflects investors' concerns over weak economic data about China overall, not Alibaba in particular. ""We have a long-term view,"" he said. ""The company is well-positioned in terms of market presence and ability to monetize the emerging Chinese online consumer.""The company has several online sales platforms as well as a cloud services arm. Also, Wilson likes Alibaba's development of a new service that will offer live online demonstrations of products.Columbia Large Cap Growth's biggest sector weighting is in technology. It had 29% of its shareholders' money at work there as of Aug. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. That was overweight vs. both the fund's Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark and the S&P 500.""When you look at what's driving a lot of innovation, a lot of those drivers are in technology,"" Wilson said. The fund's holdings are spread among names related to the internet, semiconductors, cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SAAS), he adds.Holdings included Facebook (FB).Amazon.com (AMZN) (classified as a consumer cyclical by many investors) and Facebook were the fund's two top holdings overall as of June 30, accounting for nearly 8% of fund assets.The two are also on IBD's Leaderboard.IBD'S TAKE: See how near Facebook, Amazon and other highly rated stocks like them are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.Wilson likes the prospects for Facebook's Messenger app and WhatsApp (another messaging app) to some day feature advertising. He also likes Facebook's new Live, ""which basically uses the Facebook platform to broadcast live events."" All three services have monetization potential, which would boost Facebook's bottom line, Wilson says.Facebook's earnings per share growth has sped up for four quarters in a row. Most recently it was 94%.Amazon has racked up five straight quarters of triple-digit earnings per share growth. That reversed four stanzas of slowing growth.""The company has two businesses,"" Wilson said. ""The biggest is its retail operation. The second is its web services, which is providing the backbone for a lot of information technology systems in the cloud. Revenue is growing more than 50% annually. And Amazon is the leader in that space by a wide margin.""Portfolio positioning today determines how successful the managers will be in resuming their long-term outperformance. The fund's average annual gains of 11.05% and 14.75% ranked in the top 11% and 15% of their peers tracked by Morningstar over the past three and five years, going into Thursday.And for beating the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year spans that ended Dec. 31 -- a feat achieved by just 9% of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds -- the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner.Year-to-date, the fund's 0.90% gain trails 68% of its direct rivals as well as the S&P 500's 6.47% advance.RELATED:Why This IBD 'Best Mutual Fund' Bets On Amazon, Broadcom, PricelineEllie Mae, Red Hat, ServiceNow Flex Muscle In Leading Software SectorHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With Giddyap

293,EW,"Several IBD 50 stocks are working on bases ahead of their quarterly earnings reports. Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes heart valves, has retaken its 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base with an 83.53 buy point.

"
294,EW,"With stocks on track for their worst January since at least 2009, breakouts have been few and far between. But for a stock to break out, it has to form a base first.Here’s a look at five IBD 50 stocks that are building bases: Facebook (FB), Starbucks (SBUX), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Foot Locker (FL) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW).Facebook earns a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. The social networking giant reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday.Shares are trading about 12% below a consolidation buy point of 110.75. Last week, shares were able to find support at the key 200-day line. Facebook rose 0.3% on Tuesday.Starbucks, which has a 96 Composite Rating, also found support at the 200-day line last week. Shares are trading 8% below a 64.10 buy point. Starbucks rose 1.6% Tuesday.Last Thursday, the coffee giant beat quarterly earnings expectations but missed revenue views and issued weak guidance. Still, Starbucks says it’s bullish on its expansion in China.Ulta Beauty reported better-than-expected quarterly results in early December. The beauty products retailer has a 97 Composite Rating.Ulta stock is building a flat base with a 188.58 buy point and is trading 5% below the pivot. Shares are looking to retake the 50-day line in Tuesday’s session. Ulta rose 2%, above its 50-day.Foot Locker is trying to retake its 200-day line, but looks to be hitting resistance there. Shares are trading 14% below a consolidation buy point. They're up 2.6% today.The shoe retailer has a 93 Composite Rating.Edwards Lifesciences has a 94 Composite Rating. When the heart valve maker issues its quarterly results next week, earnings are projected to have risen 17%.Shares were able to retake the 50-day moving average just a few sessions after finding support at the 200-day line. The stock is now just 3% below an 83.53 flat-base buy point. But the stock fell 4 cents to 80.16.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Ross Stores (ROST) and Campbell Soup (CPB) are among other IBD 50 members working on bases.While breakouts provide buying opportunities, the current market environment warrants a cautious outlook.

297,EW,"Stocks exited a back-and-forth premarket session in a mixed open Thursday, but quickly settled into positive trade. The Dow Jones industrial average held tight to a 0.4% gain. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.3% and the Nasdaq added 0.2%.While some stocks saw heavy trade, early overall volume was week: down 18% on the Nasdaq and 23% lower on the NYSE, relative to Wednesday's early action.The stock market today felt some mixed early influence from overseas markets. Asia's markets posted broad losses for a second straight session, with the Shanghai Composite down 3.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ending 1.8% lower and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 taking a 2.4% hit. But stocks in Europe extended early gains into a solid rebound after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi followed the bank's vote to hold eurozone interest rates steady by saying the bank was preparing to increase its monetary stimulus efforts in March. The DAX in Frankfurt and the CAC-40 in Paris were up 1.3% apiece in afternoon trade. London's FTSE 100 gained 0.9%.Oil price declines eased to less than 1%, putting West Texas Intermediate just above, Brent crude just below $28 per barrel as markets awaited the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories data, due out at 11 a.m. ET.U.S. economic was a negative on opening trade. Weekly unemployment claims rose more than expected, and manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region continued to decline, although at a slower rate, according the Philly Fed Index.The Dow was two-thirds positive at the open. Home Depot (HD) led, up more than 2%. At the top of the S&P 500, natural gas producer Southwest Energy (SWN) soared 9% as energy-related stocks took seven of the index's 10 best opening gains. Chip developer Xilinx (XLNX) ran a close second, surging more than 7% out of the starting gate after reporting better than expected fiscal Q3 results late Wednesday.At the bottom of the list, railroad Union Pacific (UNP) slumped 7%. The Omaha, Neb., outfit reported Q4 earnings a dime below analyst forecasts and a larger-than-expected revenue decline. Carloads declined 9% as volume decreased in each of the transporter's business groups, save automotive.On the IBD 50 list, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) gapped up to a 2% gain in heavy trade. The maker of heart valves and monitoring devices announced it would report its fourth-quarter results after the market close on Feb. 2. The gain extended the stock's rebound from a test of support at its 200-day moving average. Edwards is eight weeks into a 13% deep consolidation.Nike (NKE) jumped more than 2% in better than double its average trade. Shares are working on a third gain since finding support at their 200-day moving average and eight weeks into a 17% deep consolidation.
"
298,EW,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

299,EW,"Stocks were still in the red in early afternoon trading Wednesday despite a big jump in crude oil prices, as weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data weighed.The Nasdaq led the decline with a 1.4% loss while the S&P 500 shed 0.7% and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%. Volume was tracking higher across the board in the stock market today vs. the same time Tuesday.Automakers, Internet content providers and car parts makers led the losers.

303,EW,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) were A-list headliners, but a slew of industrials, medicals, restaurants and more also reported. Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress.

Bonds continued to fall around the world, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to multimonth highs.In the September quarter, Apple earned $1.67 a share, down 15% year over year, on sales of $46.85 billion, down 9%.

In the current quarter, Gigamon forecast EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $92 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. consensus estimates of 33 cent profit and 29% revenue growth to $86 million. Analysts say AT&T (T) may be a new customer, joining T-Mobile US (TMUS).Gigamon shot up 16.1% Friday, hitting a record high intraday. Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC).

352,EW,"Medical-device giant Medtronic (MDT) was up in early trading Thursday after it beat fiscal Q2 earnings estimates and raised the low end of its full-year profit guidance.In the quarter ended Oct. 30, Medtronic made $1.03 a share, excluding one-time items. That's up 1% from the year-earlier quarter and 3 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales totaled $7.06 billion, in line with consensus and up 6% on a pro forma basis, adjusted for the acquisition of Covidien last spring and for foreign-currency headwinds.Medtronic guided full-year EPS at $4.33 to $4.40, raising the low end of its previous range by 3 cents. It affirmed previous guidance of 4% to 6% sales growth. This came despite the fact that Medtronic is expecting a stronger foreign-currency headwind than it did before, taking 45 to 50 cents off full-year EPS.Medtronic stock was up nearly 3% in morning trading in the stock market today, near 78. It's trading within 2% of the all-time high of 79.50 it hit on March 25.""EPS upside (was) driven by slightly better than expected expense control, a lower tax rate, and lower net interest expense,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in a research note. ""A lower tax rate contributed +$0.02 to EPS while lower net interest expense contributed another +$0.01.""We expect EPS growth to accelerate in fiscal second-half 2016 as cost savings from Covidien kick in. We forecast operating margins of 29%-30% in the second half vs. 27% in the first half.""Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy also saw potential upside from the Covidien integration.""While this underlying operational sales growth guidance falls basically in line with what we believe is the growth trajectory for cardio more broadly — notably Medtronic's primary competitors Boston Scientific (BSX) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) — we do believe this guidance could prove conservative as Medtronic continues to integrate recently acquired Covidien and potentially recognizes sales synergies, though it may be too early, with potentially more to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond.""Antalffy added that strong sales in Medtronic's Coronary & Structural Heart division indicated that the market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements is growing faster than expected, which bodes well for Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Medtronic's lone competitor in that field.Edwards stock, though, was down nearly 1% in morning trading Thursday.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

356,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) touched a new high for a second day, after the company early this week announced approval in Europe to expand the use of its Sapien 3 heart valve to certain intermediate-risk patients.Edwards Lifesciences stock was up 1.4% to 120.87 in the stock market today, and shares have jumped more than 50% for the company. Shares, though, are about 12% extended from a July 26 breakout from a cup-with-handle base, at a 107.69 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: When a company makes both the IBD 50, a ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks, and IBD Leaderboard, very top stocks at or near breakouts, that's a company to watch. Currently, only two companies make both lists: Edwards and Facebook.On Monday, Edwards said it had received CE Mark to expand use of its Sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve to treat patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at intermediate risk for open-heart surgery.IBD's 121-company Medical-Products group, meanwhile, was up a fraction Thursday and rose to near 2,899.

"
360,EW,"Shares of medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) popped Thursday afternoon after the FDA granted an expanded indication for its leading product that could boost its market by 50%.The agency approved the Sapien 3 and Sapien XT transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR) for patients with ""intermediate risk"" of death or complications from open-heart surgery. The valves, which can be implanted via catheter through a small incision in the patient's groin, were previously approved only for patients at high risk.The approval had been expected since early April, when the results of a large clinical trial of the intermediate-risk population drove the stock up 17% in one day. The results showed a significantly lower rate of death and stroke among patients who received the valve by the TAVR method compared to the surgical method.The TAVR line already accounts for more than half of Edwards' revenue and has been fueling its growth, as well as its rise on the stock market. In his June 8 initiation report on Edwards, Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale wrote that the intermediate-risk approval would increase the addressable U.S. market by half. It would also give Edwards an edge over its rival Medtronic (MDT), whose CoreValve TAVR's intermediate risk data isn't due until next year.Edwards stock closed 2% higher in the stock market today, to 114.95, a record closing high. Edwards stock hit its record high, 117.46, late last month. Medtronic stock was down a fraction.IBD'S TAKE: With its highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, Edwards Lifesciences is a longtime resident of the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks. It's also a regular on the IBD Big Cap 20 growth stocks selected for added stability. 
"
361,EW,"There are times in the life of every medical-device company when a single Food and Drug Administration ruling will have a pivotal impact on its future. Edwards Lifesciences recently got one such decision.The ruling came Thursday regarding Sapien 3, Edwards' (EW) transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR. It's an artificial valve implanted in patients with aortic stenosis, a disease brought about when the real valve starts to malfunction due to calcification. And the FDA's decision means it would instantly increase the potential market for its leading product by half.What makes Sapien different from other valves is the ""transcatheter"" part.Traditionally, aortic valves had to be replaced by, in medical vernacular, ""cracking the chest."" Not surprisingly, that's pretty traumatic to the patient, and especially risky when you're talking about an elderly population suffering from heart disease. A TAVR can be delivered by catheter through a small hole in the groin, making it much less of a shock.""In less than a decade since the first commercial TAVR cases were performed in Europe in 2007, the technology has proved not only to be an invaluable option for patients too sick or frail to undergo open heart surgery, but also a superior treatment strategy in a large swath of the traditional surgical population,"" wrote Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale in his June 9 initiation report on Edwards.However, the FDA and heart surgeons are naturally cautious about new technologies, given that you don't mess with a vital organ lightly. So when the first-generation Sapien was approved in the U.S. in 2011, it was only for patients at the highest risk of death from surgery. To expand to other patients, Edwards has had to conduct large clinical trials for each segment of the population to prove that Sapien's benefits outweigh the risks.In April, Edwards demonstrated exactly that through its 2,000-person study of patients with ""intermediate risk"" of complications from surgery. Within 30 days of the procedure, 1.1% of patients treated with TAVR died compared with 4% of patients who'd received surgical valve replacement. After a year, the death rate was 7.4% in the TAVR group and 13% in the surgery group. A similar contrast appeared in the prevalence of stroke.Investors knew what this meant: Edwards' stock leaped almost 17% the day after the news hit.""(The) clinical data presentations represent a 'best case' scenario for Sapien and the broader TAVR market,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in a research note at the time. ""The key debate will be on whether the FDA accelerates the approval timeline for an intermediate-risk label.""As it turned out, the FDA approved the indication this past Thursday, in line with management's recent guidance that it would come sometime during the third quarter. In a statement, Edwards called it a ""major milestone."" Shares rose 2% Thursday and another 1.3% in early Friday trading.The timing is significant not only because it helps Edwards' near-term financials, but also its competitive position. The only other TAVR player on the market is Medtronic (MDT), through its acquisition of CoreValve in 2009.CoreValve and Sapien both hit the European market in 2007, but Medtronic has lagged a bit behind Edwards in the U.S. timeline, getting CoreValve approved in January 2014. That was more than two years after Sapien.Medtronic also is conducting a trial of intermediate-risk patients, but results aren't due until next year.""While we expect some off-label use of CoreValve in intermediate risk patients once the Sapien label is expanded, penetration into this population is likely to accrue disproportionately to Edwards until Medtronic's SURTAVI trial reads out in 2017,"" analyst Pasquale wrote in his report.The stakes are big. There are 1.8 million aortic-stenosis sufferers in the U.S. alone, and as Sapien and CoreValve have grown, analysts have been seeing them not just displace surgeries but increase demand for aortic replacements in general. With every quarterly report, estimates of the overall TAVR market size go up.IBD'S TAKE: Edwards Lifesciences is one of the top-rated stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. Check here to find out when it's in a buying range.""To us, better-than-expected growth for now nine quarters in a row despite ramping competition both in the U.S. and Europe signifies that: (1) The TAVR market is clearly growing seemingly sustainably faster than expected, which we now expect to exceed $5.3 billion by 2021 (+22% over the 2015-2021 time frame); and (2) Edwards' Sapien 3 is best-in-class, particularly now with data demonstrating overwhelming superiority vs. surgery in intermediate-risk patients,"" Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote in a research note after Edwards' second-quarter report on July 27.The quarterly report pushed the stock to another new high, as revenue and earnings growth accelerated over the last three quarters. Earnings rose 33% over the year-earlier quarter to 76 cents a share, while sales were up 23% to $759 million. The strong financials and stock performance have kept Edwards a constant presence in the IBD 50 and the Big Cap 20 over the last few months.While the TAVR line was the growth driver, and now accounts for more than half of revenue, Edwards is continuing work in other heart-related devices. On Aug. 15 it rolled out its new Intuity Elite valve system, one of a number of products it makes for traditional surgical valve replacement.""We believe surgery will continue to have a vital role for patients even as TAVR expands,"" Edwards spokeswoman Heather Chambers told Investor's Business Daily in an email. ""There will be patients, including younger patients and patients with complex needs, who will continue to be well-served by surgery.""Chambers added that there are lots of other structural heart defects for which surgery is the best option.Some of those other defects are also ripe for the minimally-invasive approach. Transcatheter mitral-valve replacement (TMVR) has lately become a hot area in the cardiac device field, with Medtronic, Boston Scientific (BSX) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) all working on devices. Edwards has been developing an in-house TMVR called Fortis, but last year added to the program by acquiring privately held CardiAQ Valve Technologies for $350 million.""TMVR could turn out to be an even bigger opportunity than TAVR, given the higher prevalence of mitral regurgitation in the population and challenges treating many of these patients surgically,"" Pasquale wrote in his report.He added: ""Many questions remain unanswered, however, including which treatment strategy is optimal (repair or replacement), which disease morphology will benefit most from a transcatheter approach (degenerative or functional), and how prospective clinical studies should be designed to evaluate new technologies.""

365,EW,"Shares of device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped 14% in early trading in the stock market today after word got out late Friday that the company had won a court injunction limiting the sale of Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve artificial heart valve in the U.S.
"
366,EW,"Medtronic stock was down 3%.
"
367,EW,"CoreValve, which has been sold in Europe for several years, was approved by the FDA in January. But Edwards, whose rival Sapien product has been sold in America since 2011, has long fought CoreValve's entry with patent litigation. A jury trial found in 2010 that Medtronic had infringed Edwards' patent, and on Friday a federal judge granted an injunction limiting CoreValve's sale to patients at extreme risk, starting April 22. Medtronic said it will appeal.
"
368,EW,"The judge did say that the CoreValve seemed to be a safer product with better outcomes, and he ordered the companies to agree on a way to allow physicians trained in CoreValve implantation (currently at about 60 U.S. hospitals) to continue to use the product according to their own clinical judgment.
"
369,EW,"""Given how rare injunctions are in the U.S., we are surprised by the court's decision,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in a research note Monday.
"
370,EW,"Novarro sees three possible outcomes at this point. ""Scenario #1: MDT gains a stay before April 22 and there is no change to estimates. MDT then moves forward with an appeal of the injunction and it plays out in the courts for 1-2 years.
"
371,EW,"""Scenario #2: MDT does not win a stay, and EW enforces the injunction. We note that EW has a petition into the U.S. Patent and Trademark office to extend the Anderson patent into early 2016. Thus, under a worst-case scenario, MDT will likely be off the U.S. market until early 2016.
"
372,EW,"""Scenario #3: MDT does not gain a stay, but EW allows MDT to sell into the hospitals that are currently trained on CoreValve.""
"
373,EW,"Novarro maintains a sector perform rating on both stocks. CRT Capital upgraded Edwards to buy from fairly valued and JPMorgan upgraded it to neutral from underweight. Deutsche Bank maintained a hold rating on Edwards, but lifted its price target to 78 from 62. Edwards stock was trading near 83 Monday morning.

461,EW,"Sector rotation is pretty much a done deal, if the Big Cap 20 is any guide. Last spring and summer, the medical sector was providing a third to a half of the names in the Big Cap 20.The summer leaders' charts now look sad. Biogen (BIIB) is 40% off its high. Illumina (ILMN) is 33% off its high. (It plunged after hours on preannounced Q3 revenue and full-year guidance that missed views.) Regeneron (REGN) is 23% off its high.In Tuesday's Big Cap 20, only one medical stock made the list.Heart-valve maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is on the list, despite a couple of breakouts that offered meager gains. A breakout on March 16 yielded a 9% gain in five sessions, then the stock consolidated. A breakout in July yielded an 8% gain in about three weeks before the stock consolidated.Small gains do not give individual investors much of a chance to make money.Edwards is now forming a new consolidation, but is it good news? In Monday's IBD, the medical sector was No. 19 of 33 sectors after being in the top four most of the year through September.If the medical sector is finished as a leader, what has replaced the medical stocks? An investor might just as well ask what hasn't replaced the medical stocks.The Big Cap 20's leadership is now more diverse than it has been all year.Its stocks are from many sectors, including retail, software, tobacco and leisure.Many are in early-stage patterns, thanks to resets or breakouts that didn't advance 20% or more.A reset occurs when a stock's low undercuts the low of its previous base, which resets the count at one. A first- or second-stage base has a better shot at success than a later-stage base.The following Big Cap 20 stocks feature first-stage bases:Software sector play Salesforce.com (CRM) is working on a first-stage consolidation. The stock has regained its 200-day and 50-day lines, and is only 4% off a new high.Breakouts this year led to gains of 9% and 10%. The stock hasn't posted a gain of 20% from a breakout since August-November 2013.Retail sector stock Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is working on a first-stage pattern. The stock is 4% off its high and is battling to retake its 50-day line.Breakouts this year led to gains of 15%, 4% and most recently 4%.Tobacco sector stock Reynolds American (RAI) cleared a 44.24 buy point Monday, but strong volume was missing. A valid breakout usually delivers a volume spike of at least 40% above average. Strong volume is the mark of institutional activity.Food and meat stock Hormel (HRL) rushed past a 64.23 buy point Monday. Volume was 130% above average. The stock is defensive and seldom delivers big gains out of breakouts. Hormel's last big gain was a 44% pop out of a November 2012 breakout.

471,EW,"Health care ETFs pumped out big gains Tuesday amid a slew of solid drugmaker earnings. Their technology-focused peers, which lagged, could get a boost tomorrow as Apple (AAPL) stock advanced after the close on better-than-expected earnings and revenue.On a sluggish day for stocks, health ETFs rose amid strong reports from Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).New York-based Pfizer gapped up 2.4% on its earnings beat.

490,EW,"Key stock indexes made mild moves en route to a dull finish Tuesday, but some stocks swung sharply following their quarterly results. Under Armour was a case in point, going as high as 44.68 before reversing to a sharp loss after the sports apparel firm reported its first net loss in more than four years.The Nasdaq composite inched up nearly 0.2%, and the S&P 500 edged fractionally higher. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 0.1% lower. Volume grew sharply on both exchanges in the stock market today, according to preliminary data. Under Armour (UA) said it lost 12 cents a share in the second quarter, but its adjusted profit of a penny a share met Wall Street's consensus view. Sales jumped 28% to $1 billion, continuing the firm's record of solid double-digit top-line growth. In the prior four quarters, sales grew a respective 29%, 28%, 31% and 30%. Strong footwear sales helped, rising 58% on the back of hot demand for the company's Stephen Curry-endorsed basketball shoes.As noted in an earlier IBD story, Under Armour wants to bolster its prestige with a new flagship store in the space formerly occupied by FAO Schwarz, the famed Manhattan toy store that closed years ago.It may be a while, however, before Under Armour becomes a stock market leader. It has been digesting long-term gains since topping at 52.95 in September last year. Tuesday's drop sent the stock back to its 200-day moving average -- useful as a gauge of long-term price trends -- and this line has been sloping lower since May.Under Armour gets a middling 80 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. An investor will likely have more success with growth stocks that are breaking out while showing a Composite Rating of 95 out of a maximum 99 or higher.Meanwhile, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped after hours after it reported bullish Q2 results. The IBD Leaderboard member earned 76 cents a share on an adjusted basis, well ahead of the consensus view of 70 cents. Revenue rose 23% to $759.3 million, sharply beating the $724 million consensus view. The 23% jump stretched Edwards' trend of accelerating top-line growth to a third straight quarter, up from gains of 1%, 9% and 18% in the prior three periods, respectively.Edwards ended Tuesday's regular session up nearly 2% to 108.31, just past a 107.69 double-bottom-with-handle entry.Small and medium-sized business expert Ultimate Software (ULTI) reported Q2 non-GAAP profit of 76 cents, up 23% and meeting the consensus estimate, as revenue rose 27% to $187 million. The stock fell 0.4% to 221.83 in the regular session, extended from a recent 209.81 pivot point.Earlier in the session, JetBlue (JBLU) gained 8% to 18.67 in triple the average volume after the airline posted a 20% jump in Q2 earnings to 53 cents a share, above Wall Street's view, with revenue gaining 2% to $1.64 billion. The stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average but was still flying below its downward-slanting 200-day line. The stock has a lot of lost ground to recover before getting to within proper buy range.The Dow Jones transport average climbed more than 1% on Tuesday.Among IBD 50 names, LGI Homes (LGIH) continued to roll higher, rising 2% to 36.20 in heavy trade. It's now advanced nearly 5% past a new handle entry point of 34.60. Homebuilders rallied on the back of better-than-expected U.S. new-home sales in June to an annualized rate of 592,000, sharply past the Econoday forecast of 562,000.LGI has increased its earnings per share a respective 53%, 124%, 121% and 73% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Wall Street sees Q2 earnings up 35% to 89 cents a share -- a slowdown from the prior four quarters, but an increase that would still meet the minimum 25% gain as required by IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm.As seen in Monday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points. The market followed through on June 30.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

492,EW,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) is one of the year's top ETF Leaders as it rides some of the best parts of a mixed health care sector.This year, the medical sector has diverged, with some of its industries faring much better than others. Biotechs and other drugmakers are down roughly 20%. But IBD's medical products and equipment industry groups are up about 14%. Only the diversified medical companies are doing quite as well in 2016 in health care.Much of the outperformance in medical devices owes to superior results at some of the top manufacturers, where innovation has played a key role in igniting industry leaders.Of 47 stocks in the ETF, Medtronic (MDT) is the largest holding, with more than 12% of the portfolio. Shares have climbed as much as 12% from the 79.60 buy point of a breakout in April.The stock has performed decently despite the fact that earnings have been basically flat for five quarters. The outlook is improving, though: Analysts expect profit to rise 7% in the fiscal year ending in April and 11% the next year. At its investor day in June, Medtronic forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth as it develops its product pipeline and draws on its diversified markets.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is another stock that has shouldered the ETF's advance. Shares are near all-time highs. The main move this year was on April 4, after the company announced that its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement was shown to reduce deaths from heart attacks in patients at moderate risk from open-heart surgery. Shares soared 17% on the news.Medtronic's CoreValve competes with Edwards in heart valve replacements for patients not able to have open-heart surgery. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity remained bullish on the stock following the earnings report, saying it dominates the market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements and shows potential for market expansion.Shares of Stryker (SYK) -- which has the broadest range of orthopedics products among its peers -- have climbed as much as 34% this year, but fell sharply after its July 22 earnings report.

536,EW,"For the week, the IBD 50 climbed 0.9%, in line with the major indexes' gains.While growth stocks tend to be of smaller capitalizations, quite a few big caps in the IBD 50 are making the case that bigger is better — or at least just as good. The median market capitalization on last week's IBD 50 was about $6 billion. That's squarely in midcap range. About 10 of the 50 stocks have a market cap below $2 billion, what could be termed the small caps.But more than a dozen components topped $15 billion in market cap, and those big caps are performing just as well — in some cases better — than the minnows.Starbucks (SBUX) is trying to rise from a 59.06 buy point. Its fundamentals reflect a company still with spry legs despite already recording one of history's best stock runs. EPS growth accelerated in the past couple of quarters. Revenue gains also have accelerated at the coffeehouse chain.Measuring performance from breakouts, Nike (NKE) is one of the better-performing IBD 50 stocks. Shares are up about 10% from a 117.82 buy point.The athletic apparel maker's earnings report on Sept. 24, which beat expectations, sparked the stock's latest rally.Public Storage (PSA) is in buy range from a breakout on Oct. 5.

550,EW,"The two largest biotechnology ETFs are poised at a critical juncture in their troubled growth story. It may be too early to call a reversal in fortune, but they're certainly stock investment ideas once again.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) on Thursday broke out of a first-stage base, climbing to its highest level since early June as industry giant Biogen (BIIB) trounced analyst estimates for profit and sales growth. The stock jumped 8% in heavy trading volume after reporting global growth from its multiple sclerosis and hemophilia businesses.The largest biotech fund, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), could follow in XBI's footsteps this week by retaking its 200-day moving average. If it does so, and both ETFs manage to hold above that critical line of strength, it could suggest that investors are rekindling their love affair with biotech.Earnings this week will play a part in the success or failure of that attempt. Industry heavyweight Gilead Sciences (GILD) reports Monday, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) on Tuesday and Amgen (AMGN) on Wednesday. Celgene (CELG) steps up Friday.The SPDR biotech exchange traded fund is mired 31% below the price that investors were willing to pay for it a year ago. But it has rebounded 11% in the past month, outpacing virtually all other segments of the U.S. stock market.Jeffrey Loo, an equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, considers the biotechnology subindustry attractively priced after a sharp sell-off. That, coupled with Biogen's solid report, may be behind the recent rally, he suggested.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech exchange traded funds offer diversified exposure to a high-risk, high-reward industry, lowering single-stock risk. But fund investors should get to know the individual companies they own. To learn which stock is top rated in the biotechnology group, check out IBD Leaderboard.In a March report, Loo wrote that the biotech industry would sustain healthy growth over the next several years. Breakthrough drugs like Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni for hepatitis C are helping to drive sales. Loo also has a positive outlook on an issue of key interest to investors:""The industry pipeline is also solid as several drugs have blockbuster sales potential,"" he wrote.One potential headwind in the coming months: the November elections. In an email to IBD, Loo noted that ""the scrutiny over high drug prices"" since the fall of 2015 had weighed heavily on biotechnology companies. Now Hillary Clinton, whose tweet on ""price gouging"" triggered that scrutiny, is poised to become the official Democratic candidate for next president of the United States.IBB has seen assets shrink this year to $7.10 billion despite a net inflow of $357.7 million over the first six months of 2016. The fund holds 187 stocks and skews toward large caps such as Amgen and Celgene, as well as Gilead and Biogen.XBI has also seen assets diminish in 2016, to $2.14 billion. It has taken in $164.6 million in new investor money over the first half of this year. It offers more exposure to smaller-cap names than IBB, as well as a lower expense ratio.Their performance is neck-and-neck over longer periods of time. Both have produced an annual average 15% gain over the past 10 years.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500, a proxy for the broad market, averaged an 8% gain over the same period.

554,EW,"Like gamers descending on churches, shopping malls and national landmarks to nab a Pokemon, investors in exchange traded funds were on a single-minded hunt in the last month: for safe havens.Fortunately, their labors delivered more than little virtual monsters (no matter how freaky-cute the Zubat, Sandshrew or Squirtle).Investors saw mega portfolio returns from ETFs holding gold and gold stocks, dividend and low volatility stocks, and long government as well as high-grade corporate bonds in the month ended July 12. Amid rocky markets and an iffy growth outlook, haven assets like VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) remain ensconced as the best-performing ETFs of 2016 so far.Stocks dived late in June after Britons defied expectations and thumbed their noses at European Union bureaucrats and voted to leave the regional bloc. Then stocks snapped right back, following a bullish report on jobs growth and hopes for more global stimulus after the Brexit debacle. By June 30, the stock market was back in a confirmed uptrend.The benchmark S&P 500, blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average and small-cap S&P 600 index are now at or near all-time highs. Beloved names like Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) have more than clawed back heavy Brexit losses. Market-leading stocks like Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and NetEase (NTES) are clambering back into buy zones or have climbed out of them. Every S&P 500 sector is in the black for the year, except for financials.In the volatile month ended July 12, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), which holds U.S. large caps, pulled off a 2.6% gain.By comparison, iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) climbed 1.5% in that period, reflecting the U.K.'s greater challenges.

Two ETF investing experts tell IBD how they intend to play their favored Pokestops in the months ahead: emerging markets, value stocks and high yield.Duncan Rolph is managing partner at Miracle Mile Advisors in Los Angeles, an independent advisory firm and fiduciary with approximately $570 million in assets under management.We expect positive equity growth over the next six months due to low interest rates and improving earnings growth, which should benefit from a weaker dollar and higher energy prices.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility Emerging Markets (EEMV): After struggling in 2015, emerging markets are coming back to life on the back of recovering commodity prices and a softening dollar. Emerging markets have attractive valuations compared to U.S. equities, and they should reap the benefits of the Fed holding off on raising interest rates. Low-volatility emerging market ETFs provide exposure to less volatile emerging market stocks relative to a market-cap-weighted index. EEMV is also underweight China relative to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which is a benefit given the questions surrounding the Chinese economy. It has a relatively low expense ratio of 0.25% and a yield of 2.71%.IShares S&P 500 Value (IVE): Value stocks are in favor in 2016 after underperforming growth stocks in each of the last three years. Large-cap value ETFs should continue to perform well in the second half of 2016 as investors favor high-quality, low-volatility companies. IVE is outperforming its growth ETF counterpart, iShares S&P 500 Growth (IVW) by 3.7% this year through July 11. IVE has a yield of 2.5% and an expense ratio of only 0.18%.First Trust Preferred Securities & Income (FPE): With the global markets still dealing with the consequences of a British exit from the European Union, we don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates until at least December. Therefore, we expect high-yield fixed income to continue to outperform corporate and government fixed income. One area of high yield that we like is preferreds, hybrid securities with characteristics of both stocks and bonds. FPE has a solid yield of 6.0% and is up 4.5% through July 11. Even if interest rates rise faster than expected, 60% of FPE's holdings are fixed to floating-rate securities, which mutes its interest-rate sensitivity.Michael Krause is chief analyst at AltaVista Research, a Florida-based firm that offers fundamentally driven, forward-looking ETF analysis to financial advisors and sophisticated individual investors.Brexit, wobbly European banks, and lackluster corporate profits give the Fed all the excuses it needs to stay lower for longer. We think that leads to reflation in commodity prices and money flows back to beaten-up emerging markets in search of higher returns.ALPS Emerging Sector Dividend Dogs (EDOG): After a dismal few years, emerging markets rallied in the first six months of 2016, with certain commodity-driven markets roaring much higher. EDOG is based on the ""Dogs of the Dow"" theory -- a classic investment strategy where one invests in the 10 Dow stocks with the highest dividend yield at the end of each year and holds those stocks for exactly one year. However, EDOG selects the five companies with the highest dividend yield in each of 10 equity sectors from emerging markets, and weights each sector equally. This avoids the outsized exposure to financials (and Chinese banks!) that come with more popular funds like iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM). It also provides a tilt toward commodity-driven markets over the likes of China, South Korea and Taiwan, which dominate EEM.EDOG offers a yield of 4.1% based on consensus dividend-per-share estimates for fund constituents in 2016, vs. 2.8% for EEM.IShares MSCI USA Value Factor (VLUE): Growth stocks have far outpaced value for the last decade, but mean reversion may finally be taking hold. That makes sense given our anemic economic growth, and value may benefit more from any multiple expansion induced by lower interest rates. We like VLUE because its sector allocation mirrors that of the S&P 500, rather than tilting heavily to financials and utilities like many value funds. Ultra-low interest rates and a flat yield curve are no help to financials, while utilities' valuations are stretched after roaring 23% higher in the first half of this year.SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK): Though not as high as seen during this winter's correction, credit spreads remain elevated vs. the last few years, suggesting there is still value among lower quality bonds. We calculate a yield to maturity of 6.7% for JNK that, even if we assume losses based on historical defaults for bonds of similar quality and maturity, would result in realized yields of 3.1%, which compares favorably to most investment-grade corporates. Lastly, credit quality may also improve with oil prices back around $46 from roughly $30 at the February lows.

555,EW,"Major averages reversed higher after a soft start Wednesday, as the release of the minutes from the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting came and went without much fanfare.Biotechs like Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY) buoyed the Nasdaq 100. Facebook (FB) also outperformed. Facebook rose 2.4% to 116.70, closing above its 50-day line for the first time since June 10.After falling 0.8% early, the Nasdaq ended with a gain of 0.8%.

Merck rose 2%, Home Depot 1.7% and Cisco 1.4%.After touching an intraday low of $45.92 a barrel, benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil added nearly 2% to $47.43 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield was mostly unchanged, around 1.37%.The minutes from the June 15 Fed meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET. Before the Brexit vote, the Fed had signaled a couple of rate hikes before the end of the year, but that all changed after the U.K. decided to exit the European Union. Currently, futures traders see little chance of a rate hike this year. The 10-year Treasury yield was recently at 1.39%, up 2 basis points, after hitting an all-time low Tuesday.In the stock market today, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was a strong performer in the IBD 5o screen of leading growth stocks. Edwards Lifesciences reclaimed its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 4% in above-average volume. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) also did well, rising 3% in strong turnover.

Edwards Lifesciences rose 3%, while Ulta Beauty, Boston Scientific and Intuitive Surgical climbed about 1%.Meanwhile, the worst performers were dividend payers, such as AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and real estate investment trust Ventas (VTR). Each of the three feature annualized dividend yields of 4% or more. AT&T, Verizon and Ventas all had hit record highs in recent days as post-Brexit defensive plays.While bulls welcomed the shift to more growth-oriented stocks, there was no way to know if this represented a change or if it was merely a one-day, minor adjustment.The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 1.38% after hitting record lows earlier%.

Oil and mining issues posted the 10 worst early declines on the S&P 500.On the Philly chip index, Micron Technology (MU), ASML Holding (ASML) and SanDisk (SNDK) all dropped more than 3%.Adobe Systems (ADBE) reversed its premarket loss and bagged a 4% gain in early trade. The developer of desktop publishing and imaging software reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results late Thursday, although management trimmed its Q4 EPS guidance to below consensus views. The huge-volume gain punched Adobe shares back above their 10-week moving average and further up the right side of a tight, five-week consolidation.More than four in five IBD 50 stocks fell out of the starting gate. The few that advanced didn't go far, led by Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which rose 1%. Edwards has climbed off an Aug. 24 low but remains sandwiched between its 10- and 40-week moving averages.The declines weren't so bad, either. The biggest drops came from Avago Technologies (AVGO), which brooked a 2% loss, pressuring shares back toward a test of support at their 10-week line. The stock has been climbing off an Aug. 24 low, retaking support as it builds the right side of a three-month consolidation.Cognizant Technology (CTSH) slipped less than 2% but fell further below its 10-week moving average in the sixth week of a consolidation.

567,EW,"The recent sell-off left a lot of newly public companies gasping for air, but shares of portable oxygen concentrator maker Inogen (INGN) are floating even higher.
"
568,EW,"Shares of the Goleta, Calif.-based company have more than tripled since it went public at 16 per share on Valentine's Day in 2014 — perhaps a fitting day to start trading, since it was out of love and compassion that Inogen was conceived.

569,EW,"About 15 years ago, CFO Alison Bauerlein's grandmother was diagnosed with the progressive respiratory condition known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. The resulting oxygen therapy hampered her mobility greatly.

571,EW,"""When she got put on oxygen (therapy), it really limited how much she could get out of the house and do what she wanted to do,"" Bauerlein told IBD. Even making plans to go shopping or see a movie revolved around how many oxygen tanks were available and how long they would last. Concerns like ""What if there's traffic on the way home?"" or ""Do I need to save this tank for a doctor's appointment tomorrow?"" had to be taken into consideration.
"
572,EW,"Bauerlein, then only a sophomore at the University of California at Santa Barbara, mulled over the problem with a few classmates. They formulated a business plan to build smaller, lighter medical oxygen sources and entered it into their college's annual entrepreneurial competition for undergraduate and graduate students.
"
573,EW,"The plan won first place, and judges Kathy O'Dell and Steve Cooper liked the idea so much they became the first heads of Inogen.
"
574,EW,"Nine-Hour Supply
"
575,EW,"The company went on to develop portable oxygen concentrators (POCs), which use a chemical process to separate oxygen from nitrogen in the surrounding air — meaning that users do not have to rely on a finite supply in a tank. While a traditional oxygen cylinder doesn't last long (a normal-size tank provides air for two to three hours, said Bauerlein), Inogen's current models can last up to nine hours with a double battery, which can be recharged by when plugged into a typical outlet.

576,EW,"The technology has been around for a long time, she said, but ""we optimized it and miniaturized it.""
"
577,EW,"In October 2004, her grandmother received the first product off the line, weighing nearly 10 pounds.

578,EW,"""It was exactly what she was hoping for,"" said Bauerlein. Mae used her newfound freedom to take a weeklong cruise to Mexico with her family.
"
579,EW,"Inogen brought in $112.5 million in revenue last year — about 63% from sales and 29% from POC rentals. In 2014, the company sold about 33,200 units, up almost 73% from the year before, and ended the year with about 28,400 patients renting equipment, 33.3% more than in 2013, it said.
"
580,EW,"Its stock, which now has a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, is a member of the IBD Medical-Products industry group, which includes such leaders as Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Abiomed (ABMD) and Cambrex (CBM). The group is ranked 13th out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.
"
581,EW,"Inogen shares broke out of a flat base with a 45.85 buy point on Aug. 12, a day after the company beat analyst Q2 forecasts with a 55% earnings leap to 17 cents a share and a 45% revenue jump to $44 million.
"
582,EW,"The firm also boosted full-year sales guidance to $145 million-$149 million, up from $133-$137 million, on ""better-than-expected business-to-business revenue worldwide."" But Wall Street's current expectations run higher at $150.8 million for the year.
"
583,EW,"Following the release of Inogen's Q2 results, Leerink, JPMorgan and Stifel all raised their price targets on the stock.
"
584,EW,"Analysts appear bullish about the company's growth opportunities.
"
585,EW,"Home oxygen therapy is said to be a $3 billion to $4 billion market with a 7% to 10% per-annum growth rate. A mere 5% of oxygen is delivered through POCs right now, Stifel analyst Thomas Carroll told IBD. Leerink's estimate for POC penetration now is 8%.
"
586,EW,"""(W)e see significant runway for growth still from here in line with or better than our projected 15% (compound annual growth rate) over the 2014-2018 timeframe even after INGN put up a 51% growth year in 2014,"" noted Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in May.
"
587,EW,"European Sales Grow Too
"
588,EW,"In its Q2 report, Inogen said its domestic business-to-business sales climbed 80.5% from 2014, driven by ""growing reseller and private label demand"" for POCs, while international B2B sales rose 71.7% on European strength. The company increased its sales staff late last year and in the first half of this year, prompting direct-to-consumer sales to grow 35% from 2014.
"
589,EW,"Although Inogen's focus remains POCs, its singularity doesn't seem to be a terribly big concern.
"
590,EW,"""There'd be a risk if they were getting into a saturated market, but they're not,"" said Carroll.
"
591,EW,"And Inogen's newest products are viewed favorably.

595,EW,"Down the road, Bauerlein said the company plans to increase its sales rep staff and boost distribution worldwide.
"
596,EW,"Inogen's products have a presence in 45 countries but have ""very little penetration outside of the U.S. and Europe,"" she said, as expansion is limited by reimbursement markets.
"
597,EW,"Analysts have also set their sights overseas.

598,EW,"""Reimbursement for POCs is substantially higher in Europe (two to three times higher than the U.S.) and many health care systems there allow patients to choose between tanks and POCs,"" wrote Matson. ""Given this, we expect POCs to continue to sustain rapid growth in Europe.""

599,EW,"Headwinds include expected reimbursement cuts from Medicare. Domestically, demographics are ""playing in their favor,"" said Carroll, especially as a younger, ambulatory group become Medicare eligible.

601,EW,"Redefining Mobility
"
602,EW,"""Our definition of mobility is different from the standard oxygen (therapy) patient,"" said Bauerlein. ""We define mobility as going to the grocery store on their own and being able to attend a wedding or being there for the birth of a grandchild — not being homebound.""

625,EW,"Money manager Vladimir “Val” de Vassal holds the same kind of leading stocks that you probably try to buy. But can you say your portfolio has outperformed 98% of your peers?De Vassal of Glenmede Investment Management aims to remove messy emotion from his buy and sell decisions. That adds to his performance in the long run, he says.Through May 31, he and his colleagues, including co-manager Paul Sullivan, have steered $2.3 billion Glenmede Large Cap Growth Fund (GTLLX) to average annual gains that topped all but 2% of their large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past three and five years.Since de Vassal took the reins in early 2004, the mutual fund has scored a 9.16% average annual gain, while the S&P 500 averaged 7.26%.The fund’s star performance over both the long and short term make it an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIn an interview with IBD from his Philadelphia office, De Vassal, 56, shared some of his investing secrets. Here’s what he had to say about the techniques that allow his investing team to beat the S&P time and again:IBD: You have a quantitative investment approach. What does that mean, and how do you mix in fundamental research with that?De Vassal: I look at our process as a quantitative discipline based on fundamental insights. I worked with fundamental managers for 20 years. They were value-oriented, growth-oriented, small-cap, large-cap, even international. Basically, one of my responsibilities was objectively assessing their criteria in selecting stocks in their particular sectors or universe, and assessing what worked and what didn't.And I've tried to remove the emotion and subjectivity out of the process.So we've built a library of the factors that worked and that didn't. They're different for different sectors. If you talk with a tech analyst versus a utility analyst, they talk about very different metrics as to why a company is effective or not.So we've built models that are unique for each sector. Some factors may be similar, but when we look at stocks, we look at them relative to their peers in the sector in terms of their attractiveness. This is a continual process every year.We add each year of data to our analysis. And we'll test new ideas.We have dialogue with our internal portfolio managers and analysts. We also have dialogue with some leading Street research firms like Empirical (Research Partners), Bernstein, JPMorgan (JPM) and Citi (C).IBD: What type of market does your approach work best in?De Vassal: Our process works when valuations and earnings matter. We look to create a portfolio that is cheap with high cash flow versus its benchmark, but has strong consistent profitability. And the stocks we own are likely to have positive earnings and revenue surprises, and fewer negative earnings and revenue surprises, than the benchmark.Where the strategy can struggle is when investors are distracted by macro issues. In the financial crisis in the Great Recession, earnings didn't matter. Investors fled equities, and they didn't care at what price.In that situation, when investors are not focused on specific company fundamentals but are driven by macro and behavioral issues, our models have less efficacy.IBD: What about more recently?De Vassal: Other periods when the strategy underperforms would be risk rallies, like 2009, and we've had a pretty strong risk rally starting in March this year, when a lot of the riskiest names are outperforming, in the last couple of months.But in this risk rally, there's been a lot of price dislocation when you look across stocks within sectors, a lot of gap between high- and low-priced stocks measured on, say, price-to-book.So this year's risk rally is a good environment for active equity managers because there seems to be a large arbitrage opportunity between cheap and expensive stocks that maybe can be taken advantage of. Those create opportunities for future price appreciation.IBD: So you like the current market?De Vassal: Our indicators still suggest we're in a positive growth environment for the U.S. economy. We had two weak quarters in Q4 and Q1. But our models suggest we should expect a rebound. Most economists expect 2% to 3% annualized growth in GDP for this quarter and the next couple of quarters.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWe favor more cyclical sectors right now, like technology and consumer discretionary. We're underweight in interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities and REITs.IBD: Let's talk about how you put your strategy to work. How does Edwards Lifesciences (EW) fit in? All of my questions are as of your latest disclosure.De Vassal: We owned it as of Jan. 31. It had good return on equity, over 20%. More sell-side analysts were raising than lowering estimates for the year and next year. The valuation was not cheap. But the fact that more analysts are raising estimates and that it has strong profitability and momentum -- historically, strong earnings growth offsets a rich valuation. And that's why we included this stock.IBD: What other holdings were you attracted to for similar reasons?De Vassal: Other names we bought in January were Oracle (ORCL), Masco (MAS), Schwab (SCHW). Again, they were attractive based on our criteria, a combination of earnings growth and analysts' estimates.One stock we sold in January was H&R Block (HRB). It was in the bottom quintile of its sector. Fortunately -- it's down 40% since we sold it.If there's something hitting one of our downside screens, we force it out of the portfolio. No questions asked.It takes time for fundamental analysts and portfolio managers to fall in love with a stock. But once they put it into a portfolio, it's hard for them to let go. We try to remove that emotion out of the process. In the long term, that adds to our performance.IBD: How does your approach differ from a fundamentals-only fund manager's?De Vassal: We look for stock that is cheap and has positive growth metrics and (whose coverage) analysts are raising estimates. We just look at what criteria work best in differentiating stocks in a sector. If it's a health care company, we don't look at what's in their pipeline, for example. Our stock ranking model for health care emphasizes high free cash flow yield, low relative price-to-book, strong reinvestment rate and positive earnings and revenue estimate revisions.IBD: Facebook (FB) has three quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. How do you look at this holding?De Vassal: It's attractive in our models. Its valuation is not cheap. But its fundamentals and growth story are positive. So is the fact that analysts are raising estimates.There have been periods when we sold Facebook because it was getting too rich. Last year, the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, which is now Alphabet (GOOGL)) were just flying. But their valuations got too rich, and we wouldn't hold on. But at this point, Facebook would still be considered a buy in our models.IBD: You opened a stake in Lowe's (LOW) just last year. What was your thesis?
"
626,EW,"De Vassal: We started our stake in June 2015. It ranked in the top third of our stock-ranking models. It had positive (revenue and earnings) estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. Valuation was not too extreme. The price-earnings ratio on this year's earnings was under 20.Our stock-ranking models are based on 12-month periods. We look to turn over about 1/12th of the portfolio each month to maintain attractiveness. Every month we look to refresh and harvest losses to offset short-term gains in particular.IBD: Cadence Design's (CDNS) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. What's your quant view?De Vassal: It has had very positive earnings revisions. When we ran this in January, every analyst raised estimates for this company. Its P-E is not that expensive. It was 17.7 in January. It has done well and is now a little over 20.IBD: Thinly traded Mettler Toledo (MTD) is in an uptrend, but its EPS growth is slowing slightly. What's your view?De Vassal: It is still attractively ranked in our model. Estimate revisions are more neutral. But we showed positive for looking forward on analysts' estimates. It has very strong profitability, very high ROE. January ROE was over 40%. Some was contingent on book value. It's decelerating, but historically their growth has been over 10%. Looking forward, this still looks like double-digit growth, even if low double digits.IBD: You've been boosting your stake in Accenture (ACN). Why?De Vassal: It has a very attractive rank in the tech sector for us. Analysts at the margins are raising their estimates. It has high ROE and a good track record of dividend growth.IBD: What makes you different from other quant-oriented fund managers?De Vassal: The difference is in four principles.First, we believe in active management, and that stocks get mispriced. One issue with benchmark indices is that if a stock is overpriced, effectively it is overweighted. To address that, we ignore weights of individual stocks. We want to avoid the idiosyncratic risk of overexposure to a single name. If everything else is equal between a midcap and a mega-cap name, why wouldn't you invest in both instead of overweighting one just because it has a larger weight in the benchmark?Second, we treat each sector differently. I don't believe one model should be used for all stocks. Stocks in different sectors have different attributes and business models.Third, downside risk screens, including quality of earnings; avoiding companies with poor stock quality, debt and/or high idiosyncratic risk.Fourth, we differentiate stocks that are more likely to have positive versus negative surprises based on sell-side analyst behavior, company fundamentals and technical data.IBD: The idea behind your quantitative approach is that it homes in on the factors that identify stocks which outperform and it enables you to avoid being sidetracked by subjective factors that are, basically, irrelevant to outperformance, right?De Vassal: Yes, we build extensive back tests going back 20 years-plus, that identify which combinations of criteria would create a portfolio of stocks that outperform the average stock in the sector on a rolling 12-month basis, and which would be in the top 20%, the most attractive stocks.IBD: What about risk?De Vassal: We're looking for the most consistent excess return over rolling 12-month periods. So we're looking for the highest return per unit of shortfall risk. And shortfall risk would be any (stock) that didn't outperform the average stock by at least 200 basis points.We want to have upside, but we don't want to have much downside performance relative to the average stock.IBD: Some managers portray themselves as people who eat and sleep fund management, doing nothing else. But you've got at least one interesting hobby. Tell me about it, please.De Vassal: Well, one of my hobbies is genealogy. My last name is French. It's an old French name. We have a family tree going back more than 1,000 years. Apparently family members did a thousand-year reunion in 1987. We learned about it after the fact.We have a lot of documentation, interesting history. Our family went from France to the Ukraine in the early 1800s. We actually, this past Saturday, we saw relatives that we didn't know about. One, she was my third cousin. We got in touch through a Frenchman who was doing genealogical research on my family, and we ended up connecting for the first time.

627,EW,"The market has challenged investors in recent years as short rallies made it tough to build meaningful profits in your stock positions. And shallow corrections made it easy to get shaken out.
"
628,EW,"But some investors found success by taking smaller gains and cutting losses quicker. That led to the introduction of this column and a new product: SwingTrader.Let’s start with the basics of a swing trading strategy. The goal is not to hit a home run. If you can just get on first base, that’s a win. Rather than targeting 20% to 25% profits for most of your stocks, the profit goal is a more modest 10%, even just 5% in tougher markets.Those types of gains might not seem to be the life-changing rewards typically sought in the stock market. After all, how can you ever expect to score a huge winning stock if all you buy are bunts? This is where the time factor comes in.The swing trader’s focus isn’t on gains developing over weeks or months; the average length of a trade is more like five to 10 days. You put a string of base hits together and you will score just by advancing your runners. If you are happy with a 20% gain over a month or more, 5% to 10% gains every week or two can add up to significant profits.Of course, you still have to factor in losses. Progress on smaller gains can only be achieved if losses are kept small. Rather than the normal 7% to 8% stop loss, take losses quicker at a maximum of 2% to 3%. This will keep you at a 3-to-1 profit-to-loss ratio, a sound portfolio management rule for success. It’s a critical component of the whole system since an outsized loss can wipe away a lot of progress made with smaller gains.Swing trading can still deliver larger gains on individual trades. A stock may exhibit enough initial strength that it can be held for a bigger gain, or partial profits can be taken while giving the remaining position room to run.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) scored an outsized gain for SwingTrader during beta performance. The stock broke out of a short consolidation on April 1 (1). Volume was above average and the highest in nearly two months (2). A positive clinical trial led to a 16% move the next day. The stop was immediately raised to 10% above the buy price to protect the profit. Another strategy would have been to book partial profits at that point.The stock was removed on April 19, on a close below the 10-day moving average, with a gain of 18% (3).

629,EW,"This week's insider trades include sales from executives at Tesla Motors (TSLA), Schlumberger (SLB), Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Continental Resources (CLR).Vice President of Engineering Douglas Field disclosed on Thursday that he sold 1,000 shares for $230 a share, or $230,916.Field was recruited by Tesla in 2013 from Apple, where he served as vice president of Mac Hardware engineering, to head the electric vehicle maker's new-car development program.The tech giants have engaged in what some have called a ""poaching war,"" hiring each other's executives. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has even dismissed Apple as a ""Tesla Graveyard,"" saying the iPhone maker hires people that Tesla fires.Electrek in April reported that Apple had hired former Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Chris Porritt for a ""special project,"" further fueling speculation that Apple is developing its own vehicle.Tesla Motors shares closed down 0.8% for the week, erasing solid gains, on reports that safety regulators are probing Tesla's suspension and the company's nondisclosure agreements.The oilfield services giant's CEO, Paal Kibsgaaard, on Monday disclosed the sale of 32,857 Schlumberger shares for $2.63 million, amid a rally in oil prices.The energy industry has been hit hard as oil and gas prices plunged the last couple of years, prompting Schlumberger and rivals Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cut tens of thousands of jobs.But the uptrend in oil has brought drilling back to life, with the U.S. oil rig count rising in recent weeks.Schlumberger shares are up 3.8% for the week.Chairman David Aldrich reported Thursday the sale of 15,000 shares of the Apple chip supplier in a transaction valued at about $1 million.Prior to being named chairman in May 2014, Aldrich had served as the company's chief executive since Skyworks was formed in 2002 via a merger between Alpha Industries, where he was president and CEO, and Conexant Systems.Citigroup downgraded Skyworks Thursday, saying that rival Qorvo (QRVO) is better positioned to grow. Citi cut its fiscal 2017 earnings per share view on Skyworks to 3% below consensus of $6.18, which would be $6.Skyworks shares are down 2.1% this week.

653,EW,"U.S. stocks showed reluctance to move much in either direction Monday afternoon, and stock breakouts remain razor-thin. Gold stocks, meanwhile, appear poised for further decline as the underlying commodity is facing some headwinds.Those headwinds could get stronger if investors' consensus builds that the Federal Reserve shows more a willingness to raise short-term interest rates more quickly than originally thought. A hike in the fed funds rate at the U.S. central bank's June 14-15 meeting would indicate its belief that some belt-tightening is in order following stronger than expected increases in consumer-level prices and workers' wages lately.The S&P 500 was virtually flat in mid-afternoon trade, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite lifted 0.2%, helped by a strong Monday start by Apple (AAPL), still one of the largest companies in the U.S. market. Apple gained nearly 2% to 96.86 on news indicating that the tech giant sees robust sales of future iPhone 7 models.In the stock market today, leading gold stocks weren't making much of a move, but they are clearly losing some momentum with near-term gold commodity futures down more than 3% since the end of April. Spot prices for gold were at $1,248 an ounce, down 0.3%. Gold maintains strong year-to-date gains, up nearly 18% since Jan. 1.However, some of the largest gold miners by market cap took a beating last week and are not showing much strength today. Goldcorp (GG) is vying for a third straight gain, but has recouped only a small fraction of last Wednesday's 7.7% drubbing in heavy trade. It's trying to stay above its rising 50-day moving average. Wall Street has recently shaved its full-year profit estimates, but earnings are still seen rebounding 329% to 30 cents a share. In 2011, Goldcorp earned $2.21 a share.Goldcorp currently shows a solid 88 Relative Strength Rating. How do other gold miners fare? Compare them with IBD's proprietary research tool, Stock Checkup.South African miner Anglogold Ashanti (AU) is showing similar action, up slightly on Monday but still struggling to claw back above its 50-day line. Healthy leading stocks often trade so strong that they don't touch their 50-day moving averages for many weeks following a good breakout. Anglogold has posted a nice run since clearing a bottoming base at 10.05 in heavy trade on Feb. 4. Randgold (GOLD), down 1% in lackluster volume so far, has been subdued beneath its 50-day line since an 11% gap down May 4 following Q1 results the same day. Randgold posted a 12% rise in earnings per share on a 16% revenue boost, but net margin fell.Newmont Mining (NEM) continues to outperform the bunch, rising nearly 1%. The global gold producer has a relatively light debt load; its long-term debt to equity ratio of 54% at the end of 2015 compares favorably with that of Anglogold Ashanti (109%). Goldcorp boasts an LTD-to-equity ratio of just 21%.Following a mini-rebound in biotech shares last week, as seen in a 4% gain last week by the iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) ETF, the medical sector continues to gain headway on Monday. Edwards Lifesciences (EW), member of IBD Leaderboard and up 27% year-to-date, reclaimed its 50-day moving average with a 1.5% gain in nearly flat trading.WellCare Health Plans (WCG) burst 3% higher to 98.36 in volume running 27% higher than usual. The managed health insurer has an average daily volume of 436,000 shares. The stock has retaken a 94.31 buy point in a long cup with handle. Earlier breakouts on March 29 and April 30 failed to stick, reflecting the challenging environment for breakout traders. Plus, the stock has had trouble cracking through the 96-98 price level since March 2015.However, one good sign for WellCare is that recent movement had quieted down, showing less willingness among institutions to dump shares. The RS line is also moving sharply higher. WellCare recently reported a 100% jump in Q1 profit, following gains of 69% and 46% in the two prior quarters, on revenue increases of 1%-2%. While the Composite Rating is not hot at 81, the Street sees 2016 profit rising 34% to $4.65 a share.

654,EW,"Whether you're a novice or experienced investor, everyone makes mistakes from time to time.It's easy to get discouraged if your losses pile up faster than your wins. But contrary to conventional wisdom, it's possible to still achieve outstanding gains.How, you might ask?""The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you're wrong,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in his investment classic ""How to Make Money In Stocks.""Cutting losses short and locking in gains is key to investing success. Follow O'Neil's approach by using a 3-to-1 win-to-loss ratio by taking profits when you're up 20% to 25% in winners and cutting losses when you're down 7% to 8% from your purchase price. Do this, and you can often stay ahead.So staying disciplined is key. Let's say you've invested $25,000 in each of the four stocks in your portfolio, with one of those being Edwards Lifesciences (EW).The stock initially faltered after clearing a 83.53 buy point Feb. 4. It re-crossed the entry Feb. 16 in above-average volume (1). After rising as much as 8%, the stock gapped up and soared 17% April 4, past a 90.03 buy point. It's now trading more than 30% past the 83.53 entry. Investors could lock in some gains here, if they haven't already. But those with supreme conviction could let the stock ride a bit further.A $25,000 investment in Edwards at the earlier buy point would be worth $32,500, a $7,250 gain. That could offset three other $25,000 positions sold for a 7% loss each, totaling losses of $5,250. And if you can cut losses more quickly, even better. While the 7%-8% loss-cutting discipline is a good rule of thumb, it can be prudent to cut losses at 3% to 5% or even less, depending on how the broader market is acting. When the market is in correction or under pressure, more stocks are likely to fall then rise.So if you're seeing a lot of red flags, using the smaller numbers makes sense. But even when the market is rallying, you should never take more than an 8% loss.After studying stocks for years, O'Neil found that most leading stocks tend to advance 20% to 25% from a base breakout before pausing to correct or consolidate. This is why it's good to take profits in most stocks at 20%-25%. He also found that the best institutional-quality stocks rarely fall 8% from a proper buy point in a sound chart pattern.""If a speculator is correct half of the time, he is hitting a good average,"" famed Wall Street trader Bernard Baruch has said. ""Even being right three or four times out of 10 should yield a person a fortune if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly on the ventures where he has been wrong.""

655,EW,"Medical-device maker and IBD 50 stock Edwards Lifesciences (EW) beat analysts' Q1 estimates and raised guidance late Tuesday, sending the stock up a fraction in after-hours trading, after shares touched a new high in the regular session.Edwards made 71 cents a share in the quarter, excluding one-time items, up 25% from the year-earlier quarter and topping analysts' consensus of 66 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 18% to $697 million, vs. consensus of $665 million.Edwards lifted its full-year earnings guidance to $2.67 to $2.77, a dime above the guidance it issued in its Q4 report. It added around $100 million to its sales range, now $2.7 billion to $3 billion.The company also added $100 million to its guidance specifically for transcatheter heart valve therapy (THVT), whose Sapien line of valve replacements has driven much of Edwards' recent growth. It now guides $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion in sales, representing 25% underlying growth.Edwards said the market expansion of the Sapien was the main driver of the guidance increase. This month, the company's Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was shown to reduce deaths and strokes in treating aortic stenosis in patients with ""intermediate"" risk from open-heart surgery, boosting its stock 17% on April 4.The Sapien is only approved for patients at high risk, so adding moderate-risk patients would significantly broaden its market. On the company's earnings conference call with analysts Tuesday, CEO Michael Mussallem said Edwards will submit the data to the FDA in a few weeks and is modeling approval of the new indication early in Q4, though it could come earlier.""We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of transcatheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need,"" Mussallem said in a statement. ""We are confident in our outlook for strong sales growth, and we remain passionate about developing impactful therapies to help more patients around the world.""Edwards also guided Q2 above expectations, with EPS of 67 to 73 cents and sales of $700 million to $740 million. For Q2, analysts expected earnings of 67 cents a share and sales of $698 million.Apart from the THVT business, the Critical Care division grew 7% to $133.6 million, while the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy group declined 0.5% to $195.9 million. Edwards has been exiting some ""non-strategic"" product lines in the latter group, but said the number of surgical procedures is growing.Edwards stock has been on a roll this year, hitting a record high of 109.71 Tuesday before closing up a fraction, at 108.84. With an IBD Composite Rating of 97, it's No. 8 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.The strong recent performance might explain the small move the stock made after hours Tuesday.""Expectations heading into 1Q were elevated ... and Edwards did not disappoint investors,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar in a research note. ""If there was one thing we had to pick on, it is the underlying TAVR growth in International markets. While underlying U.S. TAVR sales were up 64%, the total TAVR growth of 38% implies International growth of 4%, a further deceleration from 4Q.""On the conference call, Mussallem said international THVT sales had actually grown 13%, but admitted that it has been losing market share abroad. The Sapien line has faced competition in Europe for longer than it has in the U.S., as Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve was approved there two years earlier than its U.S. approval in January.He said that market share has increased slightly in the U.S., however.Overall, Kumar said the quarter was very solid. Although expenses were up, he said R&D spending came in well below his expectations, while the gross-margin decline to 74% from 77% was already in his model.

659,EW,"There's been a lot of hand-wringing lately that the iconic S&P 500 has gone more than a year without marking a new all-time high.Don't despair. You're a smart ETF investor who spots opportunities even when others agonize that stocks are stuck in a rut.The geniuses at indexing shops don't just offer products that track a broad basket of assets, such as the S&P 500 for U.S. large caps and the Russell 2000 for U.S. small caps.They also slice and dice those indexes into finer segments with the aim of boosting returns or reducing risk. Sometimes they aim to do both.To achieve these aims, they may screen stocks for ""factors"" or characteristics such as low volatility or high quality.Several exchange traded funds tracking indexes based on the S&P 500 have scored all-time highs recently. They're not only outperforming the bellwether SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), but also attracting gobs of new investor money.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) and PowerShares S&P 500 Quality (SPHQ) made all-time highs April 27.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) did the same on May 10, with PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) following suit on May 11.SPHD ""cherry-picks the market rather than delivering the whole basket,"" according to industry research firm ETF.com. It invests in the 50 least risky, highest yielding stocks in the S&P 500. That indexing method skews it toward defensive sectors such as utilities.CenterPoint Energy (CNP) is a top-five stock holding. The stock is trading near a 52-week high as investors have favored the defensive cast and income potential of the utility sector this choppy year.This ETF has outperformed SPY both year-to-date and over the past three years. It's up 9.6% in 2016 through May 23 vs. a 1.2% gain for its better-known S&P 500 peer.SPHD also saw $805 million in net inflow over the first four months of the year. By comparison, SPY leaked $1 billion.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats holds 50 stocks from the parent index that have hiked dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years. It then equal-weights those holdings, which accounts for a big midcap stake.Irish medical device maker Medtronic (MDT) is one of the ""dividend aristocrats"" in the portfolio. The company makes heart valve products just as an IBD Leaderboard aristocrat, Edwards Lifesciences (EW), does.NOBL has advanced 6.4% year to date, while absorbing a net $633.7 million from January through April.Despite the ""dividend"" in its name, NOBL yields a relatively modest 1.9%. That's less than 2.10% for SPY and 3.33% for SPHD.

660,EW,"Well-trained, open-water swimmers learn to alter their techniques in order to deal with rough conditions. This means, among other things, sacrificing some symmetry and efficiency in order to flow with and punch through the chop.Stocks attempting to build bases in difficult markets show similar adaptations. One common result: the base-on-base pattern.From an investor's standpoint, a base-on-base can be an exercise in frustration. A stock forms a base, breaks out, then immediately falls back into a second consolidation. An ideal base-on-base sees the low of the second consolidation just touch the high point of the prior base.In reality, the stacked patterns can seem messy and disorderly.  But they generally are an indicator of a strong stock, struggling to advance against a stubborn market. This is one of the reasons why the M in CAN SLIM stands for market conditions. Stocks fighting a weak market are clearly trying to swim upstream.Rather than showing the typical 20%-plus gain that separates distinct bases, leading stocks in choppy markets may rise only a few percentage points before pulling back. Often, they will form a flat base after a breakout from a cup, and use that as a platform from which to advance.When a base dips well into a prior base, this is generally called a base-beside-a-base pattern. It is still a valid structure, but doesn’t normally carry the firepower of a base-on-base. Facebook (FB) has staged an awkward base-beside-a-base pattern since November, yet is still advancing in price. Universal Display (OLED) and Prestige Brands Holdings (PBH) offer somewhat more tidy examples.In some cases, particularly in consolidating markets, a new base will dive back below the low of the prior base. This decline resets the stock’s base count. The new base is considered a first-stage formation, suggesting that the stock may have additional room to advance. Priceline Group (PCLN) and Citrix Systems (CTXS) demonstrate recent base resets.Constellation Brands (STZ) has traded tightly for a fourth straight week, and the recent price movement rests just at the high of its prior base. If it holds for another week, the pattern becomes a flat base-on-base.Maybe the best recent example comes from Edwards Lifesciences (EW). A leading maker of heart valve replacements, Edwards has stacked up a series of base-on-base and base-next-to-a-base patterns beginning early last year. Its first breakout – from a cup-with-handle base in July 2015 – rose for less than two weeks before turning down into another cup-with-handle (1).Investors would not have wanted to hold through this 21% deep consolidation. But the trick is to keep the stock on a watch list. Those who jumped in at this second breakout, in late October, took a little longer ride, rising about 8% in less than six weeks. Then, another consolidation. Shares corrected 13%, cleared an 80.95 handle buy point in heavy trade Feb. 2 (2), then dropped 6.9% below the pivot -- stopping just short of a sell rule (please see a daily chart at Investors.com). Edwards retook the buy point in a three-day run up in mid-February.The stock rose 11% in two weeks before stalling into a flat consolidation. Unlike the prior consolidations, this pattern dipped only 7% and held comfortably above its 10-week moving average. The breakout this time around was a killer: up 17% in powerful trade on April 4 after positive trial results on its Sapien heart valve.True to character, shares rose another 7% over the next three weeks, then pulled back for what may well become another consolidation. But stay tuned....

Also, most have climbed since their earnings press releases came out during the past couple of weeks.The medical sector, which has the largest share of the Big Cap 20, accounted for several earnings winners.Gilead Sciences (GILD) gapped up after it reported sales and profit that exceeded expectations for Q2. It also raised full-year guidance. The $3.15 a share beat analysts' consensus by 44 cents — one of the largest margins of victory in the earnings race.The stock has risen almost every day since the July 28 report and is forming the right side of a base.Better-than-expected sales and earnings also helped Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) break out of a base on July 23.Illumina (ILMN), however, was one medical leader that tumbled.The gene-sequencing company on July 21 beat earnings estimates but missed revenue expectations.

"
741,EW,"AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund's (PGWAX) performance ranks in the top 5% of its peer group tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past one year and 10 years. But that certainly does not entitle the $795 million fund's managers -- Scott Migliori, Karen Hiatt and Raphael Edelman -- to a free pass around the market's challenges.Those include market volatility that the managers expect will continue until there is more clarity about global growth prospects, especially in China and Europe. Other challenges are disappointing U.S. growth, ongoing geopolitical tensions, a recession in Europe and slower-than-expected growth in China.So what are they doing about it? Focused Growth's managers think U.S. large-cap growth stocks are where they'll find most of their opportunities.""They have a long-term track record, visible cash flow and flexibility, consistent payouts and they're multinational in exposure,"" Hiatt said.And we're entering a period where there is much less of a rising tide to lift all boats, so only good stock-pickers should outperform. ""This is a time for active managers to shine vs. what we've seen in recent years,"" Hiatt said.Four of the fund's 10 largest holdings as of March 31 had Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s and 90s. Three of their four top new buys had very strong Comp Ratings of 87, 97 and 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings.Facebook (FB) was the fund's top holding as of March 31. Its Comp Rating is 99.Earnings per share grew 16%, 33%, 46% and 83% the past three quarters. Those latest results, for the first quarter, came out on Wednesday. On Thursday, shares gapped up over their 117.09 buy point. They briefly dipped below that entry on Friday but held up amid a weak broad market.One negative for the stock: It has a weak Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D. That indicates that deep-pocketed institutional investors like mutual funds aren't participating wholeheartedly in buying shares. That could change if the stock's up-on-volume days start outnumbering its down-on-volume days.
"
742,EW,"The number of daily active Facebook users has topped 1 billion. Facebook's growing mobile platform is bringing in the bulk of the company's total ad revenue. ""The shift to digital advertising continues,"" Hiatt said. ""And this company has not only Facebook itself but also Instagram and early-stage companies they can monetize.""
"
743,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is a new top buy. Its Comp Rating is 99.The medical devices maker is a member of the IBD 50. It beat analysts' first-quarter estimates for earnings and revenue and raised its guidance late Tuesday.The developer of treatments for cardiovascular disorders gapped up 17% on April 4 after reporting positive clinical data for its newest heart valve. ""That heart valve replacement will be a clean, new option for intermediate risk patients,"" Hiatt said. ""The clinical trial allows our analyst to bring up expectations of how quickly the valve can be launched and what its total market can be.""
"
744,EW,"Trading around 107, shares are extended from their 90.03 entry.Constellation Brands (STZ) is another top new buy. Its Comp Rating is 87.Hiatt and her colleagues see it as an unusual consumer staple. ""It sells at a modest premium to staples overall, but it grows at twice the rate,"" Hiatt said.In the short run, earnings have been hurt by the company's construction of brewing plants and bringing bottle molding in-house. ""But we should see a significant increase in free cash flow when we get through this next year,"" Hiatt said. She also sees lots of room for increasing market share.Going into Friday, the fund, which carries an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, was down 1.26% for the year. But it is up 1.43% over the past 12 months, outperforming 95% of its peer mutual funds and the S&P 500’s modest 0.33% gain.
"
745,EW,"Stock market myths abound and, unfortunately, many of them keep investors from reaping big profits in the market.A big one says to avoid stocks with high P-E (price-to-earnings) ratios because they’re too expensive. Many ask, ""Why buy a stock trading near a high with a P-E of 50 when you can buy one near a low with a P-E of 10 or 15?""Think of a high P-E stock like a car. You could pay $5,000 for a used car with 149,000 miles on it or you could ante up and pay $40,000 for a high-quality new car. Which one has the better chance of giving you more bang for your buck? The latter of course.It works the same way in the stock market. Many low P-E stocks are damaged goods. They’re on the bargain rack for good reason. Conversely, high P-E stocks are the premium merchandise in the stock market. In many cases, big earnings and sales growth is fueling big market-share gains, so these stocks command a premium valuation.So contrary to conventional wisdom, stocks with high P-E ratios can deliver explosive gains. But they can be risky -- a slight earnings and sales miss, or lukewarm guidance, could result in a sharp sell-off. So losses on every stock investment must be cut at 8% or less.A stock's trailing P-E ratio is based on past earnings and its forward P-E is based on earnings estimates for the current or next full year. The average trailing P-E of stocks in the S&P 500 was recently 18. Compare that to the average trailing P-E of 28 in a recent IBD 50 screen. Faster-growing firms are found in the IBD 50, so it makes sense that the average P-E ratio would be higher.There are better times than others to own high P-E stocks. One scenario in which they have a good chance of working is after a meaningful market correction. A big enough pullback is often enough to shake out every last seller in the market. That paves the way for new institutional money to come in from the sidelines. Growth-fund managers aren’t afraid to pay up for a stock, especially if there’s a bona fide growth story.The markets team at IBD doesn’t let a high P-E ratio get in the way of a decision to add a stock to Leaderboard, accessible via Investors.com. The Leaders List has yielded some big winners in recent years, when market pundits were calling them “expensive.” Edwards Lifesciences (EW), added to IBD Leaderboard in February just before it gapped up over a 90.03 buy point, has been a standout performer. Its P-E ratio at the time was 37. Expensive? Sure, but the market is optimistic that its Sapien 3 heart valve is still in the early stages of growth.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) got the nod for Leaderboard when it soared out of a base in late May 2014. At the time, it had a trailing P-E ratio of 187. Pricey? Sure, but it more than doubled in price in less than a year thanks to huge earnings and sales growth, and expanding market share in the network security software space.Facebook (FB) joined Leaderboard when it broke out powerfully in July 2013. At the time, it was selling at 45 times trailing earnings, but there was a major growth story going on at the time and optimism about future growth. Facebook more than doubled in price over the next year. Its growth story is still very much intact.

754,EW,"Some pockets of the health care sector are ailing. Others have perked right up.IShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI) bounded to a 52-week high of 129.93 Thursday as it eyes a fourth straight weekly gain.Its relative strength line -- a gauge of its performance vs. the S&P 500 -- is bolting higher in defiance of the overall stock market mood. The market uptrend has come under pressure this week.IHI is a targeted bet on a health care niche. It invests in 47 U.S. companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is a top-rated IBD stock within this industry group, based on measures of technical and fundamental health such as earnings and sales growth.IHI counts Edwards among its top 10 holdings and gives it a 4.4% portfolio weighting.Edwards' stock has jumped 39% in the past three months. The California-based company is battling for the top spot in the heart-valve market. Its Sapien 3 received FDA approval for treatment of high-risk patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. Its chief rival is Medtronic (MDT), the No. 1 holding in the IHI portfolio.Edwards will report quarterly results April 26 after the close. Wall Street stock analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters expect an 18% gain in earnings for the quarter and 17% for the year.
"
755,EW,"Two major stocks held by IHI reported this week.Late Tuesday, surgical-robot maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) beat Q1 earnings estimates and the stock hit a new high Wednesday after receiving a series of price target hikes. On Wednesday, orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) also beat expectations and raised guidance.Both Stryker and Intuitive stocks have fallen since then in volatile trade.IHI also has smaller weightings in Cantel Medical (CMN), Steris (STE) and Cynosure (CYNO) -- device specialists with top-notch IBD Composite Ratings of 99, 98 and 97, respectively.Steris provides products to prevent infections and control contamination. It reported a 31% jump in sales in its latest reported quarter, helped by the buyout of U.K.-based Synergy Health.Small-cap Cantel Medical is also in the infection control and prevention business. Cynosure develops treatment systems for hair removal and skin rejuvenation.IHI has a Relative Strength Rating of 75, which means it's outperformed 75% of other stocks and ETFs in the IBD database over the last 12 months. An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+ points to healthy institutional demand for the shares.The ETF saw $92.3 million net inflow in the first quarter. Assets have grown 23% this year to $928.5 million.Year to date through April 21, IHI has advanced 5.3% vs. 1.6% for the broadly diversified Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV).XLV, the largest health care ETF, has been hurt this year by its hefty 61% combined stake in the underperforming pharmaceutical and biotech industries.Over the past five years, XLV produced a 17.9% annual average gain vs. 14.7% for IHI.

The goal, typically, is to either boost portfolio returns or adjust portfolio risk.""The new funds follow some of the rules of active management, and it worked,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence.He described Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), Legg Mason (LM) and John Hancock as ""well-established asset managers"" whose stock-picking skills are now packaged in ETF wrappers.Big mutual fund companies are looking to make inroads in the $2.1 trillion ETF industry. With more and more investor dollars flowing towards passive, index-based investments, the writing is on the wall for active managers.Rosenbluth was intrigued that four mutual fund firms launched ""similar-sounding strategies almost around the same time"" last year. So he decided to look more closely at their new ETFs' performance. He was surprised to find that virtually all beat SPY in Q1.Only 315 large-cap actively managed mutual funds out of 1,185, or 27%, managed to beat the S&P 500 over the same period, according to Morningstar Inc.Rosenbluth believes the low-cost ETF structure likely gave the new funds an edge. Actively managed mutual funds tend to have much higher expense ratios, which can be a drag on returns.Of course, a single quarter's performance only means so much. However, Rosenbluth believes these new ETFs are solid choices for successful investing.""If investors like the concept of screening stocks based on multiple, fundamental factors, these products all offer that,"" he said. ""They're well-structured, relatively cheap and backed by firms likely to be in the ETF space for the long haul.""It’s rare for an ETF to achieve that asset haul in just seven months. The ETF issuer's strong ties with institutional investors helped, Rosenbluth said. GSLC was also competitively priced for a smart beta ETF, with a 0.09% expense ratio.Its 433 stock holdings include heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and less well-known names such as Edwards Lifesciences (EW), a heart valve maker and top-rated IBD Leaderboard stock.GSLC gained 1.5% in Q1 vs. 1.3% for SPY.JPUS has a 0.29% expense ratio. It gained 3.6% in Q1, pulling well ahead of SPY as well as its new peers.JHML holds $27.2 million in assets and has a 0.35% expense ratio. It also launched in September and rose 1.3% in Q1, in line with SPY.UDBI has $2.7 million in assets and an 0.30% expense ratio. It debuted in December and added 3.4% in Q1.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Sometimes, this means focusing less on aggressive growth, small-cap names and more on liquid, large-cap names found each week in the Big Cap 20.

824,EW,"Starbucks has notched a seven-week win streak and looks about as firm as any leading stock.One of the appeals of big-capitalization stocks is their resilience to market sell-offs. On that account, some Big Cap 20 stocks could have done a better job. Losses on the list ranged as much as 4.7% Monday as the broad market tumbled. Most declines were about 2% to 3%.But volume in the 20 stocks was not excessive for most. Some had trading totals that were well below normal, while others had increases of about 40% to 50%.Considering the massive selling in the market, that was significant but not massive.Medical leaders such as UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) continued forming bases and held near new highs.Facebook (FB) had a modest decline and closed below the 86.17 buy point of its most recent pattern. Volume was 45% above its norm.But the loss wasn't alarming.Illumina (ILMN) also dipped back toward its buy point, closing just above the 210.55 buy point it cleared a couple of weeks ago.Nine of the Big Cap 20 stocks are in health care, which speaks to the strength of that sector. That's been a pattern present among not just the big-cap leaders but in other areas of the market. The IBD Sector Leaders also have a fair share of medical stocks.Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell below its 116.93 buy point, but there's no sell signal for the biotech so far.Volume was 11% above average — not exactly an avalanche of sellers, but more than 12 million shares nonetheless.A few big-cap leaders slid to their 50-day moving averages, where institutional investors could step in to buy on dips. Watch for rebounds from the line for evidence of that.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is one to watch in this regard.The chipmaker came down to its 50-day line in nearly double its average volume. That's not exactly the gentle pullback that chart readers look for, but Skyworks could find itself back in favor if it can rebound quickly and in strong volume.Walt Disney (DIS) shares had been making new highs, but that streak came to a stop Monday.The stock erased what had been a small gain from its 113.40 buy point, and is back near that entry.Compared with the stumbles some other leaders took, the entertainment colossus came out of the day's proceedings with relatively minor damage.Starbucks (SBUX) gave its shareholders about the best they could hope for.Shares fell 2% in volume below average.

866,EW,"Leading medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped Monday, a day after its artificial heart valve passed a hurdle that could greatly expand its market.Edwards conducted a large clinical trial comparing its transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), Sapien 3, to traditional open-heart surgical valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis, or shrinking of the aortic valve of the heart, who were characterized as ""intermediate risk"" for open-heart surgery. The study followed up on patients 30 days after surgery and again a year later, and it found that deaths and strokes were both significantly lower in the Sapien group.Sapien 3, which is delivered via catheter through a small incision in the patient's thigh, was approved in June 2015 for patients who were at high risk if they had open-heart surgery. Adding the intermediate-risk population to the patient pool led several analysts to hike their sales estimates for the product.""We estimate the patient population could increase 50% to 150,000 to 200,000, including intermediate-risk patients,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills in a research note, as he raised his price target on Edwards Lifesciences stock to 113 from 95. ""We increase our Edwards 2016 sales estimate to $2.796 billion from $2.779 billion and pro forma EPS forecast to $2.72 from $2.68. For 2017, our top-line projection increases to $3.1 billion from $3.06 billion and pro forma EPS to $3.21 from $3.09.""Edwards stock rose 17% on the stock market today, closing at 105.08 and hitting a new lifetime high of 106.10. The stock was already doing well, ranking at No. 23 on the IBD 50 and also rating a spot on IBD's Leaderboard. It's 27% over an 83.53 buy point, and thus in the profit-taking zone.The news also led analysts to lift their estimates for the entire TAVR market, which is currently split between Edwards' Sapien and Medtronic's (MDT) CoreValve. Leerink's Danielle Antalffy raised her estimate for the global market in 2021 to $4.8 billion from $4.4 billion.""With Edwards' Sapien 3 likely the only valve available in the intermediate-risk patient population for at least the next 12 months, we assume the majority of the incremental market opportunity benefit falls to Edwards,"" Antalffy wrote in her research note, in which she raised her price target on the stock to 115 from 93.BTIG analyst Sean Lavin upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, with a price target of 115.Medtronic stock rose 1.2% Monday, to 76.30.

869,EW,"Last Monday afternoon, Entertainment Weekly posted a story in its Books section with the ominous headline: ""Hugo Award nominations fall victim to misogynistic, racist voting campaign.""Within a few hours, the headline changed to: ""Correction: Hugo Awards voting campaign sparks controversy.""That's some correction. So what happened?Both versions of the EW story were about the annual Hugo Awards given out to science fiction and fantasy writers. In the original version, EW's Isabella Biedenharn claimed that ""misogynist groups lobbied to nominate only white males for the science fiction book awards,"" urging their followers to ""cast votes against female writers and writers of color.""Turns out that the slate of authors recommended by one of the groups, at least, did include women and minorities. Several of them, in fact.The group's campaign, in fact, had nothing to do with women or minorities, but an effort ""to get talented, worthy, deserving authors who would normally never have a chance (to be) nominated for the supposedly prestigious Hugo awards,"" according to Larry Correia, who along with Brad Torgersen, started the ""Sad Puppies"" campaign to bring more ideological diversity to the Hugo nominations.""I started this campaign a few years ago,"" Correia wrote on his blog, ""because I believed that the awards were politically biased and dominated by a few insider cliques. Authors who didn't belong to these groups or failed to appease them politically were shunned.""But since the EW reporter didn't bother to reach out to Correia, or anyone else involved, to check her facts, she apparently didn't know this.This story, like the now-completely discredited Rolling Stone ""campus rape"" article, shows the dangers of an increasingly biased mainstream news media. Stories that fits reporters' and editors' ideological predispositions get rushed through into print with little skepticism or careful review, and apparently with no actual fact checking.(h/t to the always vigilant Instapundit for highlighting this story.)Follow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.

889,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation’s (EW  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.22 while reported EPS was 96 cents.The adjusted EPS figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 by 10.9%. Moreover, adjusted earnings improved 29.8% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the transcatheter heart valves business.Sales DetailsFirst-quarter sales improved 1.3% to $894.8 million but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $930.2 million by 3.8%. Underlying sales increased 9.3% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in the nation chose to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by Critical Care product line.Segmental DetailsIn the first quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $551.6 million, reflecting 2.3% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the United States, THVT procedures grew in mid-teens year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well as continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter totaled $179.5 million, down 10% from the prior-year quarter. This includes a sales return reserve for conversion to a consignment inventory model. However, Edwards Lifesciences continued to witness solid uptake of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system along with strong demand for the latest INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in the United States. Further, the company’s latest products drove underlying sales growth at a rate which surpassed the total procedure growth rate. Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteCritical Care sales were $163.7 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 13% from first-quarter 2017. The upside can be attributed to solid growth across all product categories, largely led by HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform  along with solid growth in the United States and the Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the first quarter, gross margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 73.9% owing to adverse currency movements and continued operational investments. However, this was partially offset by more profitable product mix led by growing sales of transcatheter valves.SG&A expenses rose 11.5% year over year to $256 million on account of sales and personnel-related expenses, as well as strengthening of euro in comparison with the dollar. R&D expenditures increased 11.3% year over year to $143.2 million owing to continued investments in the transcatheter aortic valve and mitral valve program along with expenditures on clinical trials. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 570 bps to 29.3%.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.50 billion compared with $1.34 billion at the end of 2017. Long-term debt in the reported quarter totaled $456 million versus $438.4 million at 2017-end.Cash flow from operating activities was $151.3 million in the first quarter. Excluding capital spending of $43.2 million, free cash flow was $108.1 million. During the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding totaled 215.1 million.2018 Guidance RaisedEdwards Lifesciences raised its 2018 adjusted EPS expectations to $4.50-$4.70 from the previous $4.43–$4.63. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $4.52, near the low end of the company’s guided range.However, the company continues to maintain sales expectations at the high end of the previously projected range of $3.5-$3.9 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is $3.85 billion, within the guided range.For the second quarter of 2018, the company projects sales between $950 million and $1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $964.6 million, within the company’s estimated range. The company forecasts adjusted EPS between $1.05 and $1.15. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is $1.16, which is above the company‘s forecasted range.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the first quarter on a mixed note. Strong transcatheter valve sales in the domestic market as well as overseas is a major positive. The raised 2018 EPS guidance buoys optimism.Management expects to gain traction in the ever-expanding TAVR market based on increasing preference for transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidence, leading to strong adoption of THV therapy. However, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to raise concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEdwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Abaxis, Inc.

891,EW,"Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.(CSII  -  Free Report) expects fiscal 2018 first-quarter revenues to be affected by the devastating Harvey and Irma hurricanes. Earlier, the company had estimated revenues in the range of $52.6-$53.6 million for the quarter. However, taking effects of the hurricanes into account, the company anticipates a drop in first-quarter 2018 revenues from the previously guided range.According to Cardiovascular Systems, more than 15% of the company’s revenues are generated from the Houston and Florida.The hurricanes have dented procedure volumes in the greater Houston area and throughout Florida. Moreover, fiscal first quarter revenues are more heavily weighted in September because procedure volumes start to pick up from summer levels. Thus, the company is not confident about meeting the previously guided range for first-quarter revenues.Though management expects the short-term performance to be affected, the long-term prospects are likely to be untarnished. In the majority of the last year, Cardiovascular Systems has been trading above the broader industry. Currently, the stock has gained 18.5%, higher than the 10.3% gain of the broader industry. However, the stock lost 7.4% after the announcement on Sep 18, 2017.Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend has been unfavorable for the company. For the current quarter, no estimates moved north compared with one movement in the opposite direction over the last two months.

892,EW,"The transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market, which is projected to witness CAGR of 18.3% between 2017 and 2022 (per a report by Azoth Analytics published on ReportsnReports), has been constantly under the radar of market experts, courtesy of the stir caused by one of the forerunners within this space — Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report).Last February, the company voluntarily recalled all its core Lotus Valve devices, including Lotus with Depth Guard. This dragged down its shares by 9.4% in the pre-market trading session (per an article on Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry).Sadly, again in November, Boston Scientific announced a further delay in the re-launch of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System after it failed to meet the committed timeline, hurting shareholder sentiments even more. Per an article on the Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry, the company had opted out from the Piper Jaffray healthcare conference in New York on the same day, pulling down the stock by 7.5%, which was followed by a decline in its market cap by around $2.9 billion.Meanwhile, rejoicing at this situation is Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), a leading player in the TAVR market. Encouragingly, the company’s shares have soared 45.4% since Lotus Valve devices’ recall last February. Let’s take a sneak peek into what’s brewing in this market for investors who are keen to effectively put in their money in the healthcare space.The BackdropBoston Scientific has been consistently dominating headlines on developments in the Lotus Valve devices, though for all the unpleasant reasons. Last February, the company had to call back all Lotus Valve devices due to issues related with the premature release of a pin which connects Lotus Valve to the delivery system.  However, this was not the first time when the company had to face such a situation.Earlier in 2016, the company had to retract the Lotus Edge Valve system on similar grounds. Even in 2014, it had to face the brunt of the FDA’s order and withdraw 278 units of Lotus Valve from circulation in Europe, due to the Lotus Valve getting unlocked from the delivery system during release.The company has also been disappointing investors by continuously delaying the filing of the premarket approval (PMA) with FDA for the Lotus Edge Valve system.Currently, the company expects LOTUS Edge to be back in the European market not before 2019. It also intends to roll out the same in the United States in the same year.Nevertheless, some major market analysts believe such numerous product missteps have always ended up tarnishing the brand image, along with deviated customer and clinician interests.Edwards Lifesciences - Seizing the OpportunitiesWhile Boston Scientific hit a rough patch on issues surrounding its Lotus Valve devices in 2017, Edwards Lifesciences reaped the maximum benefits from its solid Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) platform. During the company’s annual investor conference, its chairman and CEO Michael A. Mussallem noted, ""As we come to the end of 2017, our performance and accomplishments this year significantly exceeded our expectations, and we expect 2018 to be another strong year for Edwards Lifesciences.” “The primary factor driving the company’s global growth is the prospering transcatheter aortic valve therapy business,” he further asserted.In this regard, management currently projects sales of $2.1-$2.4 billion in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy in 2018.Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences expects the global TAVR opportunity to be more than $5 billion by 2021. And to make the most of it, the company has been firing on all cylinders, lately.In line with this, Edwards Lifesciences has its near-term product pipeline on track. It expects that the new SAPIEN 3 Ultra system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in the United States and Europe later this year. Also, the company anticipates to begin the U.S. pivotal trial for the CE Marked CENTERA valve system in 2018. Furthermore, Edwards Lifesciences expects results from its PARTNER 3 trial of the SAPIEN 3 valve to be presented at ACC 2019, followed by the FDA’s approval later that year.We note that some market speculators believe Edwards Lifesciences’ solid global presence, particularly in high-potential regions like Europe and Japan, along with delay in the comeback of some key competitive products like Boston Scientific’s Lotus Valve, will help the company further cement its hold in the highly potential TAVR space.Other Major Players Riding the Gains Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), with its CoreValve Evolut TAVR platform comprising the CoreValve, CoreValve Evolut R and the CoreValve Evolut PRO systems, has well maintained the company’s position as a formidable player in the TAVR space. Per an article by Reuters, shares of Medtronic had inched up 1% on Boston Scientific’s announcement of the withdrawal of Lotus Valve devices, last February. Notably, the company recorded TAVR growth in the mid-20s in the United States and low 40s in international markets, in the last reported quarter.Furthermore, post the acquisition of St. Jude Medical in 2017, Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) integrated the popular CE Marked Portico TAVR of the former into its Structural Heart portfolio and is expected to gain momentum in this space.Boston Scientific — A Rebound in the Cards?As Winston Churchill had rightly said,“All men make mistakes, but only wise men learn from their mistakes.”Unwilling to let go of the bountiful opportunities in the TAVR market, Boston Scientific acquired Symetis SA, a structural heart company focused on minimally-invasive TAVR devices, in 2017. The company has started selling ACURATE neo Aortic Valve in Europe. It is also working on designing the ACURATE neo 2 Aortic Valve System equipped with an enhanced outer sealing skirtfeature.Moreover, Boston Scientific is looking forward to leveraging on its existing LOTUS infrastructure to enhance the ACURATE neo AS Valve system through better field support, geographic expansion and next-generation products. The company plans to invest in the United States and Japan trials as well.Will ACURATE Replace Lotus?However, several opinions have been making rounds in the TAVR space, of late.  Some market experts believe the company will eventually replace the Lotus Valve devices with the Symetis’ portfolio, while others speculate that the deal has been clinched to cushion it from the jitters which might stem from the Lotus Valve devices’ withdrawal. A few analysts are also of the opinion that Boston Scientific expended the huge amount on the Symetis buyout deal to use it as a contingency plan in case the Lotus Valve device issue remains unresolved.Nonetheless, dismissing all such speculations, Boston Scientific has been consistently emphasizing on the Symetis acquisition as a move to broaden its TAVR suite and not a replacement of Lotus Valve devices.To end all speculations, let’s wait and watch to find out whether or not Boston Scientific’s Lotus (valve) will find the right weather to bloom again.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

893,EW,"In a bid to strengthen its position in predictive analytics, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), has recently announced the approval of De Novo request from the FDA for the Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) software. Notably, the company plans a targeted launch of the product in the United States.This CE Marked, adjunctive predictive cardiovascular indicator as designated by the FDA, comes with the minimally invasive FloTrac IQ sensor. The advantage of Acumen HPI software is that it assists in improved decision making for high risk surgical patients using software algorithms to predict his/her future cardiovascular events through evaluation of cardiovascular vital signs.  Furthermore, the Acumen HPI feature goes well with Edwards' minimally invasive, hemodynamic monitoring solutions.A Glimpse of the Critical Care BusinessThe Critical Care portfolio includes pulmonary artery catheters, disposable pressure transducers and advanced monitoring systems.

Edwards Lifesciences announced the receipt of FDA approval for aortic and mitral valve-in-valve procedures, using SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in June.

895,EW,"On Sep 18, we issued an updated research report on leading manufacturer of proprietary life science and materials research systems, Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report).Over the last three months, this Billerica, MA-based company has gained 7.1% as compared with the industry’s 4%. The company’s impressive second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenue growth has bolstered market confidence leading to a further rally in its share price.Of late, the company has been witnessing growth in its Nano Surfaces business on restructuring and cost-reduction actions. The portfolio also got a boost from the acquisition of Hysitron nano indenting products at the beginning of 2017 along with improved results at the AXS business. Moreover, we are upbeat about thecompany’s recent launch of D8 VENTURE BIOTOOLS for laboratory macromolecular crystallography which will be part of the AXS segment within Bruker Nano. Additionally, the company gained traction in the semiconductor metrology markets along with certain industrial and applied end-market segments.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been consistently introducing products in its portfolio. The company recently unveiled the D8 DISCOVER Plus X-ray diffraction (XRD) system at the Japan Analytical Scientific Instruments Show (JASIS). We are also encouraged by the launch of EIGER2 R 500K — the latest generation of Hybrid Photon Counting (HPC) pixel detectors — by Bruker and DECTRIS. Notably, built by DECTRIS, the EIGER2 R 500K detector has been integrated into Bruker’s D8 ADVANCE and D8 DISCOVER instrument platforms to enhance several X-ray diffraction (XRD) applications.We are also impressed with Bruker’s latest product developmental activities under the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy business. The company’s line of launches includes the AVANCE NEO platform, a next-generation NMR console and S8 TIGER Series 2 spectrometer. Management also claims to have made technical and quality progress with its high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes. Management expects HTS to boost its ultra-high field 1.2 gigahertz NMR business in 2018 and beyond. We are also upbeat about the company’s receipt of FDA approval for adding 144 new species to its MALDI Biotyper-CA system for efficient microbial identification. Notably, MALDI Biotyper is the company’s latest revolutionary approach for the analysis of microorganisms.Of late, Bruker has been working on chalking out strategies to improve its financial performance. These initiatives include the divestiture of certain non-core businesses, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities and transferring or ceasing of operations at certain facilities. Meanwhile, the company’s raised revenue guidance raises optimism.On the flip side, Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, adverse currency fluctuations continue to result in losses for the company. Moreover, headwinds such as unfavorable economic conditions and intense competition continue to pose threats.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report).  Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Amedisys and IDEXX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.

896,EW,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Pleasanton, CA-based The Cooper Companies (COO  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Cooper have outperformed the industry year to date. The shares of the company have increased 40.7%  compared with the industry’s gain of 14.0%.Additionally, the company’s earnings estimates have moved north in the current year, reflecting analyst optimism. Over the past month, current and next earnings estimates have increased 10.2% and 6%, respectively. Moreover, Cooper reported earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 4.4%.The company’s leading position in the markets of specialty lenses was also supported by highly exclusive products of Biofinity and Clariti. In fact, its flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the coming quarters. The company has also initiated the process of introducing MyDay lenses in the domestic market. It is already available in Europe and has gained significant traction within a short span of time. Clariti lenses also hold significant growth prospects for the company.The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. A fall in dropout rate of contact lens wearers and further market penetration, especially in developing nations, is expected with continuous improvisation in the technology. Growth in international markets is something that contact lens manufacturers are banking on. Furthermore, user preferences are shifting from low-feature commodity lenses to more expensive single-use and specialty lenses, such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses (silicone hydrogels).We believe that Cooper is well positioned to address this shift in customer preferences based on its expansive product portfolio. The company recently introduced Biofinity Energys’ contact lenses, which is targeted at group of users who frequently complain of discomfort arising from prolonged usage of smartphones, tablets, laptops, in-car displays and other devices. The company is a leader in the high-margin toric lens market. It offers multiple designs of toric lenses across a wide range of parameters, unlike some of its competitors, who offer the same lenses in limited designs. This is expected to further boost its top-line growth going forward.On the flip side, macroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending. Also given its significant international presence, Cooper remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks include IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EW in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for EW, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.29% heading into earnings season.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

898,EW,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) has recently announced a major investment in Santa Rosa, CA-based Millipede, Inc., to augment its position in the field of mitral regurgitation (MR). Millipede is the developer of IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for the treatment of severe MR.Per the terms of the agreement, Boston Scientific has purchased a portion of Millipede for $90 million. The company has also kept an option to acquire the remaining shares of Millipede at any point of time prior to the completion of a first-in-human clinical study that meets certain parameters.Also, Millipede has the option to compel Boston Scientific to purchase its remaining shares upon the closure of the clinical study. The full buyout of Millipede needs additional $325 million payment by Boston Scientific and a further $125 million will be paid upon achievement of a commercial milestone.In this regard, management noted that MR occurs by a leaking mitral valve causing blood to regurgitate from the left ventricle to the left atrium of the heart. This condition can gradually lead to heart failure and heart rhythm problems. Patients with severe MR often complain of compromised heart functions and  cannot tolerate open-heart surgery for the repair or replacement of the leaking valve.Management is optimistic  about the large patient population in this space, which is  unfortunately underserved at the moment. Hence, this area represents a lucrative market to be tapped into. This patient population could benefit from a fully-percutaneous transcatheter procedure that can fix the dilated mitral annulus and reduce regurgitation without undergoing surgery.Encouragingly, the Millipede IRIS annuloplasty ring claims to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state. This device is supplied via a transcatheter-transseptal delivery system and follows the standard surgical approach to mend and decrease the size of a dilated mitral annulus.On a positive note, the global transcatheter mitral valve replacement market is growing stupendously at a CAGR of approximately 22% over 2016-2020, as per the data provided by Technavio.Apart from Boston Scientific, other major players in this field are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

899,EW,"On Nov 27, we issued an updated research report on Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Edwards Lifesciences’ third-quarter 2017 performance was disappointing with revenues and earnings lagging the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Natural disasters impacted third-quarter sales to the tune of $2 million. Also, higher operating expenses continue to be a drag. The stock’s valuation remains stretched on huge investments related to continuous launch and promotion of products. Stiff competition, currency headwind and reimbursement issues are other challenges. Over the last three months, this leading molecular diagnostic company has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has lost 1.7% against the broader industry’s 6.5% gain during the period.On a positive note, in the third quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (“THVT”) sales growth of 17.3% over the prior-year quarter. This upside was led by a strong continued adoption of the therapy across all geographical regions. Per management, THVT adoption in the quarter grew consistently on robust performance of its SAPIEN 3 valve.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteWe are also encouraged by the company’s long-term growth strategies and its recent progress in technology pipeline. As far as transcatheter heart valve (THV) is concerned, Edwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership position in the global Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) market.Also, the company’s focus on building its pipeline to strengthen foothold across all operating businesses bodes well. Edwards Lifesciences has also witnessed growth in its emerging portfolio of mitral and tricuspid repair therapies.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) and Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report). While PetMed and Myriad sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Luminex carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

901,EW,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Sunnyvale, CA–based Accuray Inc. (ARAY  -  Free Report), a leading developer and designer of radiosurgery and radiation therapy systems for the treatment of tumors. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Accuray has had an unimpressive run in the bourse of late. A glimpse at the recent price performance reveals that its shares declined 8.0% over the past month, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 1.3%. The company has a dismal track record characterized by consecutive earnings miss in all the trailing four quarters.Accuray witnessed low product margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (ending Jul 31), down 80 basis points (bps) in to 36.4%. In fact, dismal performance by the product segment caused an adjusted loss of 6 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of a penny.Additionally, unsatisfactory performance by the CyberKnife and the Tomotherapy systems in Japan and Asia Pacific was a headwind. Unfavorable product mix and more replacement sales to the CyberKnife’s existing customer base caused the drag. Moreover, one-time employee severance related expenses and other one-time part costs dented the service margin in recent times.Accuray’s top line is highly dependent on CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems sales. However, both systems require high capital expenditures which act as a deterrent for healthcare providers.On a positive note, we are particularly upbeat about the company’s extensive product portfolio, growing customer base (especially in EIMEA region) and international expansion initiatives that are poised to drive growth. Moreover, the receipt of 510(k) FDA approval for the Radixact Treatment delivery platform is likely to boost product revenues over the long haul.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).

902,EW,"The Q3 earnings season had kick-started last week with results from 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) having been reported so far. We observed the S&P 500 index to have made a pretty good opening with respect to both earnings and revenue growth. Per the latest Earnings Preview, till Oct 20, 2017, total earnings for these members went up 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues.With 180 S&P 500 members lining up for releasing their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish about the equity market scenario, gradually demonstrating an improvement from the sequentially last quarter.A Look at MedTech Space Within Medical SectorWhile overall growth has been steadily accelerating from the preceding few quarters’ performances, investors are concerned about the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) that has seen a lot of struggle during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.This lack of visibility befuddles the favorable trend this sector was maintaining over the past few quarters. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate is standing at 2.2% on 4.8% revenue growth projection. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate of second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Needless to say, that the current crisis in the U.S. MedTech industry, integral part of the broader Medical sector, shows no signs of abating. MedTech space was earlier hopeful about the change of power within the White House. However, it is currently fussing over the total failure of the Republicans’ ObamaCare repeal and replacement. Considering the prevailing uncertainty over the implementation of the health policy, any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely.Political turmoil and the health policy related battle apart, majority of the stocks’ bottom line within this space is likely to be hurt in the third quarter on escalating costs induced by the consecutive hurricanes and Mexico earthquakes.Given this gloomy backdrop, investors interested in the MedTech space will keenly await the earnings reports of key MedTech companies namely, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and C. R. Bard, Inc.  on Oct 24.Per our quantitative model, when stocks with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) are combined with a positive Earnings ESP, then chances of beating estimates are always high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A Sneak Peek at Both StocksSimilar to the sequentially-last quarter, Edwards Lifesciences seems to be gaining from its strong Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) segment. Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographical regions with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well as a continued strong therapy implementation across all regions in the last quarter. Also, with the receipt of an expanded FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 valve in early June, the top line at the THVT segment is expected to get a further boost this yet-to-be-reported quarter. (Read: Will Edwards Lifesciences Gain on THVT in Q3 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $496 million reflects an increase of 20.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $322 million shows an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter revenues are projected at $833.89 million. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the United States of $467 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.8% in the trailing four quarters. While Edwards Lifesciences has an Earnings ESP of -2.32%, it carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 87 cents per share being revised a penny downward over the last seven days. However, it has shown a rally of 26.4% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $834 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, an 11.5% improvement from the year-ago reported number of $748 million.In this regard, we also anticipate the company’s arch rival in transcatheter heart valves space, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), to fare well in the business this third quarter. Boston Scientific is slated to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 26, before the market opens.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Edwards Lifesciences Corporation price-eps-surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote Looking into C.R. Bard’s recent performance trend, we believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by an accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the United States. We expect this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter. (Read: Can CR Bard Spring a Surprise This Earnings Season?)Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.03% in the trailing four quarters. While C.R. Bard has an Earnings ESP of -0.09%, it carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $2.95 per share being revised a penny downward over the last 30 days. However, it has shown an improvement of 15.6% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $992 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter as compared to the year-ago reported figure of $932 million, reflecting a 6.4% gain.In this regard, we note that C.R. Bard is slated to be acquired by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) for $24 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017.

903,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 24, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.7%. It is worth noting that Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to gain from strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions in the last reported quarter. Moreover, with the receipt of expanded FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 valve in early June 2017 is expected to further boost the top line at the THVT segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $496 million reflects an increase of 20.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $322 million shows an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter revenues are projected at $833.89 million.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteHere are the other factors that might influence Edwards Lifesciences’ third-quarter results:In the domestic market, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to continue with its strong performance based on strength in THVT and two other segments — Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care.The company witnessed strength in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy on the back of strong uptake of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system. Progressing in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, the company received FDA approval for INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves in July 2017. On the other hand, growth in Critical Care group was led by double-digit growth in Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, especially in the United States.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the United States of $467 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Edwards Lifesciences earlier raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to the high end of the previously provided range of $3.2-$3.4 billion.Moreover, we note that the company projected total sales between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents to 90 cents for the third quarter.On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to challenge the company.We also believe that unfavorable foreign currency will affect the company’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, management expects the third quarter to be the seasonally lowest quarter, which adds to the concerns.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Edwards Lifesciencesdoes not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP forEdwards Lifesciences is -1.83%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Edwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 87 cents reflects a 27.9% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

904,EW,"On Sep 26, we issued an updated research report on Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last six months, this leading molecular diagnostic company has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 15.3% in this period, higher than the broader industry’s 11.5% gain. The recent FDA approvals for several products including SAPIEN 3 THV for valve-in-valve procedures and INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve seem to be bolstering investors’ confidence on the stock. Also, the raised guidance for 2017 hints at brighter prospects. In fact, the outlook raise was backed by strong performance of all of the company’s three product lines. We are encouraged by the company’s long-term growth strategies and recent progress in its technology pipeline. As far as transcatheter heart valve (THV) is concerned, Edwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership position in the global Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) market.Also, the company’s focus on building its pipeline to strengthen its foothold across all operating businesses bodes well. Edwards Lifesciences has also witnessed growth in its emerging portfolio of mitral and tricuspid repair therapies.On the flip side, foreign exchange headwinds continue to mar the company’s international business. Also, a competitive landscape in the overseas market weighs on the company’s prospects.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks in the medical sector are Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report), Owens & Minor, Inc. (OMI  -  Free Report) and OraSure Technologies, Inc. (OSUR  -  Free Report).

905,EW,"Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) Ellipse implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recently gained FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR) conditional labeling. This should solidify the company’s footprint in the Rhythm Management space.Post-approval, patients implanted with an Ellipse device and Durata or Optisure leads will be able to undergo MRI scans. Moreover, Ellipse will now be available to patients suffering from severely high heart rhythms and in need of an ICD along with a MRI scan. Thus, we believe that this latest regulatory approval will expand the company’s customer base and drive its top line.Moreover, Ellipse is embedded with features known as Abbott's TailoredTherapy and is capable of directly, securely and wirelessly forwarding all therapy and related data to a patient's physician through the Merlin.net Patient Care Network.Continuing with its efforts to expand the MR-conditional labeling enabled devices, the company received FDA approval for MR-conditional labeling for Assurity MRI pacemaker and Tendril MRI pacing lead. Also, the company has received certain prior MR-conditional labeling approvals in Europe.Meanwhile, Abbott had applied for FDA approval of MRI-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D) products and Quartet family of left ventricular leads.Interestingly, the company witnessed softness in its Rhythm Management segment majorly due to tough competition in the MRI-conditional category of products. The market is dominated by some well-established players like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), among others.Abbott’s strategy to gain traction in the Rhythm Management sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

906,EW,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) recently launched an advanced Resonate family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems featuring the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic.Notably, these devices are FDA approved for conditional use in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment and help physicians improve heart failure (HF) management through personalized care. The devices combine the company's SmartCRT Technology with EnduraLife Battery Technology. This allows physicians to customize device settings according to individual patient needs, without draining the battery or having to go through unnecessary replacement procedures.HeartLogic Diagnostic alarms doctors about worsening HF conditions by combining data from sensors assessing heart sounds, respiration rate and volume, thoracic impedance, heart rate and activity.All CRT-Ds in the Resonate family of devices are enabled with SmartCRT Technology. This helps physicians modify where, when and how to pace the lower chambers of the heart using the Multisite Pacing capability for multi-electrode pacing.The company recently initiated enrolment of patients in the MANAGE-HF study to further assess HeartLogic Diagnostic. Boston Scientific recently announced positive clinical trial data from the Multisensor Chronic Evaluation in Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (MultiSENSE) study. The study (based on 900 patients) was conducted to examine the performance of HeartLogic Diagnostic for prediction of possibilities of HFdecompensation. The study demonstrated that HeartLogic Diagnostic increases the ability to classify patients at high or low-risk of experiencing an HF event.In the last reported second quarter, Boston Scientific’s Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) segment reflected a 2% year-over-year increase in sales. Meanwhile, the company has been consistently focusing on product development to strengthen its position in this niche.According to a report by GlobalData, the heart failure market is estimated to reach a value of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is strategically placed.However, the company is facing tough competition in the global cardiac monitoring and rhythmmanagement devices market from established players like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

907,EW,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp recently announced the successful closure of the acquisition of Chiltern International Group Limited, a specialty CRO (contract research organization). Earlier, the company had entered into a definitive agreement with Chiltern’s shareholders to purchase the company for an all-cash transaction valued at roughly $1.2 billion.LabCorp expects Chiltern to generate 2017 revenues of roughly $550 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $95 million. Excluding transaction related one-time costs and cost synergies, LabCorp expects this deal to boost adjusted earnings and free cash flow in the first year and help earn cost of capital by the third year.Post acquisition, Chiltern will form part of LabCorp’s Covance Drug Development segment. Per management, Chiltern will be a major partner serving the top 20 biopharma segments and helping LabCorp focus on the high-growth emerging and mid-market biopharma segments. Per LabCorp, the buyout is expected to strengthen its position in innovative diagnostics and drug development solutions.We encouragingly note that the new combined entity will have approximately 11,100 employees in the Americas — 7,100 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 2,400 in the Asia Pacific.LabCorp has been consistently on the headlines owing to the Chiltern buyout deal. Earlier, the company had announced that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has granted its request for early termination of the waiting period for Chiltern’s buyout under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act).Moreover, apart from the substantial buyouts like Covance, LabCorp has been consistently enhancing and adding capabilities via strategic mergers. In this regard, the company recently announced plans to acquire the analytical testing services business of ChromaDex Corporation (CDXC  -  Free Report). The company also announced the renewal and extension of agreement with Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. (IDXG  -  Free Report) aimed at boosting its cancer portfolio.Moreover, over the last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. Over this period, the stock has rallied 12.6% as against the industry’s 2.6% decline.

908,EW,"On Sep 1, we issued an updated research report on GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report), a leading global specialty retailer of products for health and wellness, including vitamins, minerals, herbal supplement, sports nutrition and diet. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, GNC Holdings has been underperforming the broader industry. The company has lost 60%, as compared with the 13.1% decline of the broader industry over this period. Weak margins and significant decline in revenues on a year-over-year basis raise concern. Tough competition, changing consumer preferences along with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations continue to pose challenges.Moreover, this Pittsburgh, PA-based company exited the second quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note with revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although earnings exceeded the consensus estimate, the year-over-year decline on both the fronts was dampening. The decline can be attributed to lower sales in the company’s U.S. & Canada and manufacturing/wholesale segments.On a positive note, during the second quarter, management witnessed positive response for its New GNC Plan under which the company had started incorporating transformational changes in its operations. Also, management is currently working on product pricing and innovation. Moreover, new consumer enrollment under the myGNC Rewards Program and launch of GNC storefront on Amazon buoy optimism.GNC Holdings is developing products and formulas to address unmet customer needs and is also expanding customer brands like Beyond Raw, Mega Men, Women’s Ultra Mega and GNC Probiotics.Also, the company’s prospects in the international business and strong cash position are encouraging. Management expects to continue capitalizing on international revenue opportunities through the addition of franchise stores in existing markets, expansion into new high-growth markets and growth of product distribution in both existing and new markets.During the second quarter of 2017, the company’s international business drove a 1.3% increase in revenues and 14.3% rise in operating income. Apart from the strong e-commerce business in China, the company witnessed improvement in trends in Mexico, South Korea and Hong Kong.Meanwhile, the nutritional supplements industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions. This apart, GNC Holdings’ international competitors include large pharmacy chains, major supermarket chains and other big U.S.-based companies with global operations.Management fears that in the face of stiff competition, the company may fail to function effectively and its attempts to do so may require price reduction, which in turn may hurt margins.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

These divestitures are part of the company’s plans of selling 30 hospitals and generating funds to minimize its debt level. The hospitals divested were Yakima Regional Medical & Cardiac Center in Yakima and Toppenish Community Hospital in Toppenish.  A long-term softening in admissions has hit hospital companies. Community Health Systems is burdened with high level of long-term debt. Naturally, the company is taking resort to divestures to pay off its debts and focus on a more sustainable portfolio of hospitals and networks. Community Health Systems aims to reduce its debts by 2018. As of Jul 7, 2017 the company’s long-term debts stood at $14.25 billion. In the second quarter, Community Health Systems received $1.147 billion from the sale of its 20 hospitals. The company utilized $951 million from the sale proceeds to pay off its term loans.   Earlier, Community Health Systems had shown interest in divesting 30 of its hospitals, on which it had incurred comparatively lower bad-debt expense. The divestitures are estimated to generate $1.95 billion in proceeds.  In fact, the company announced that it would expand its divestiture program. It is planning to divest hospitals that account for at least $1.5 billion of net revenues and mid-single-digit EBITDA margins. Community Health Systems wants to focus on those hospitals that may generate volume growth, higher EBITDA margin, and better cash flow. The company has been aggressively divesting its assets, in a quest to reduce its long-term debts. In July 2017, the company entered into an agreement with HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) to sell the Weatherford Regional Medical Center in Texas.

Over the past few quarters, the THVT business has been a major contributor to the top line. Further, management continues to be bullish on the business. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $575 million reflects an increase of 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.In recent times THVT is on a strong growth trajectory in the United States.

The latest development is likely to enhance the company’s prospects in Europe.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THV sales outside the United States of $212 million reflects a 11.7% drop from the year-ago quarter.

This upside was driven by an increased utilization of the company’s growing installed base of sequel systems, also known as the PacBio Sequel system.However, instrument revenues dipped 29.8% to $9.2 million, on year-over-year basis.Other Factors at PlayPacBio Sequel System Drives GrowthPer management, Sequel-generated revenues grew more than eight-fold in the fourth quarter, representing a whopping 80% of fourth-quarter revenues. Additionally, BGI China ordered 10 Sequel Systems, making it one of the primary growth drivers of Pacific Biosciences.Since the past year, a number of studies have been using or planning to use the PacBio whole-genome sequencing with a goal to increase cure rates of genetic diseases. These studies include Stanford University School of Medicine; the European Solve-RD Consortium, performing a 500-individual rare disease study; and Novogene, which has announced plans to sequence 1,000 Chinese genomes.The platform has also witnessed a series of developments lately. The flagship PacBio Sequel is currently being used by the Alabama-based HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, to support the goal of dramatically increasing the diagnostic success rate in challenging pediatric clinical cases. Moreover, Beijing-based Annoroad Gene Technology has recently placed a purchase order of 10 PacBio Sequel Systems, which is expected to increase Annoroad’s large-scale genomic service capabilities across various fields.View MixedFor the first quarter of 2018, revenues are expected to be slightly lower than the reported count in fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to seasonality. Banking on a better-than-expected fourth-quarter show, Pacific Biosciences expects its 2018 revenues to grow 20% from the year-ago figure, translating to approximately $112 million in total revenues.Shrinking Service Revenues & MarginsIn the last reported quarter, revenues in the Service and Other segment fell 18.3% on a year-over-year basis to almost $21.8 million. For full year of fiscal 2017, revenues in the segment deteriorated 4.3% compared to full-year 2016.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues in the first quarter is fixed at $3.31 million, down 8.6% year over year.On the other hand, gross margin in the quarter was 38.1%, down 610 basis points year over year, while the company incurred an operating loss of $20.5 million, wider than a loss of $17.8 million in the year-ago quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Although Pacific Biosciences carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it does not have a positive Earnings ESP  needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Pacific Biosciences is 0.00%.

However, this market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.9%, in contrast to the broader industry’s decline of 1.2%. The company has also outperformed the 0.8% fall of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

922,EW,"The Cooper Companies Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $2.64 in third-quarter fiscal 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents and improving from $2.30 in the year-ago quarter. We believe that the upside was driven by robust revenue growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Revenues increased to $556 million from $515 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552 million. Solid top-line performance was driven by innovative products like Biofinity and daily silicone hydrogel lenses.Revenue SegmentsThe Cooper Companies has two business segments – CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI).CooperVision Segment: CVI revenues increased 8% at constant currency (cc) to $437.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenues continue to gain from the company’s silicone hydrogel lenses led by solid prospects in the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment, robust performance by Toric (31.6% of CVI revenues), Multifocal (10.7% of CVI revenues), Single-use sphere lenses (26.5% of CVI revenues) and Non single-use sphere lenses (31.2%) propelled solid growth.Multifocal revenues rose 7% at cc to $46.8 million, while Toric revenues increased 11% at cc to $138.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Single-use sphere lenses sales climbed 14% at cc to $115.8 million, while sales of non single-use sphere lenses inched up 2% at cc to $136.4 million year over year.Geographically, CVI revenues increased 2% in the Americas, while revenues from the Asia Pacific and EMEA rose 13% year over year at cc.CooperSurgical Segment: CSI revenues jumped 4% at cc to $118.7 million on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the CSI segment, the fertility category witnessed a 6% rise (at cc) in sales in the reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, totaling $65.5 million. However, the office and surgical products category at the CSI segment inched up 1% at cc to $53.2 million.Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteMargin DetailsAdjusted gross margin in the reported quarter was 65% of revenues as compared with 64% registered in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin improvement was fueled by favorable product mix within the CooperVision segment, improved margins at CooperSurgical segment, and favorable foreign exchange.Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 26% in the fiscal third quarter flat on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceFiscal 2017: For fiscal 2017, total revenue is expected in the band of $2,129–$2,142 million, up from the previously issued range of 2,110–$2,135 million.Revenues at the CVI segment are estimated between $1,670 and $1,680 million, up from the previously guided range of $1,645 million and $1,665 million, while CSI revenues are projected in the range of $459 - $462 million, a little lower from the previously guided range of $465–$470 million.Meanwhile, adjusted earnings are anticipated in the band of $9.66–$9.76, up from the previously provided range of $9.50–$9.65 per share.Fourth Quarter: The Cooper Companies expects revenues in the range of $552 million to $565 million. CVI revenues are expected between $435 million and $445 million, while CSI revenues are anticipated between $117 million and $120 million. The company expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.70.Our TakeThe Cooper Companies ended third-quarter fiscal 2017 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both lines. The company has always seen impressive results at its CooperVision business segment. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the third quarter, buoyed by robust Toric performance. The company provided strong guidance for fiscal 2017. However, the dampening outlook for the CooperSurgical segment indicates looming concerns. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the contact lens space will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company.We also note that The Cooper Companies has completed the acquisition of a small specialty contact lens company named Procornea earlier this month. This added a leading ortho-k technology to the company’s lens portfolio. The acquisition marked the company’s foray in the emerging myopia controlled markets.Considering the outstanding performance of the stock, we expect The Cooper Companies to scale higher in the coming quarters. In this regard, positive long-term growth of 10.8% holds promise.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

925,EW,"PerkinElmer, Inc.’s (PKI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, expected to release on Apr 30 after market close, are likely to show steady growth in the core Diagnostics business. While this might prove to be a major driver, declining revenues in all other segments might mar overall results.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Meanwhile, revenues were approximately $641.6 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617 million.

Revenues in the segment rose to $193.4 million, up 23.3% from $193.4 million a year ago. This also reflects an improvement of 6% organically. The segment has been fortifying the company’s market position in terms of exclusiveness of services in the respective markets.For the Diagnostics market, the company offers products that are used to detect genetic disorders. PerkinElmer also provides digital x-ray flat panel detectors and infectious disease testing solutions in its Diagnostics portfolio. The first-quarter results are likely to indicate strong growth in the Diagnostic revenues.In the last-reported quarter, operating profit margin for the segment, as a percentage of revenues, was 30.8%, up 20 basis points (bps) year over year.It is also encouraging to note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Diagnostics segment is at $235 million, up 21.5% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayEUROIMMUN Buyout: A PositiveThe divestment of medical imaging business and the acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG have been major drivers for the segment. PerkinElmer announced the completion of the EUROIMMUN buyout for approximately $1.3 billion in cash in December 2017. EUROIMMUN is an autoimmune testing company and an emerging player in the infectious disease and allergy testing space.Per management, the EUROIMMUN buyout has expanded PerkinElmer’s capabilities and helped it gain considerable traction. It has led to an increase in Diagnostics employees by more than 3000, strengthening the company’s R&D platform. The company is optimistic about increasing its R&D spending by 30% in 2018 from 2017 which is likely to account for 8.7% of product revenues.In the fourth quarter, EUROIMMUN contributed revenues of approximately $360 million, representing growth of 13-15%. It is also likely to add 100 bps to PerkinElmer’s organic growth.Discovery & Analytical Solutions (DAS)Revenues from DAS totaled $448.2 million in the fourth quarter, up 9.3% from $409.9 million in the year-ago quarter. PerkinElmer has been focusing on finalizing the organizational changes associated with the life sciences business under DAS.Lately, the company has collaborated with Helix to develop and commercialize exome sequencing-based tests that will help consumers take proactive health management decisions.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is at $381 million, down 15% sequentially.Guidance SolidThe company issued adjusted earnings guidance for 2018.

These include product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, promoting the Invisalign brand name and boosting international growth.The company has also been focusing on increasing the Invisalign utilization by orthodontists.

Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteStrength in Scanner and Service BusinessAlign Technology has also been witnessing strong revenue growth from the Scanner and Service business over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has been witnessing increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to reflect in the company’s first-quarter results as well.At the same time, Align Technology has been focusing on expanding workflow options of iTero scanners. In this context, last November the company signed an agreement with Glidewell Dental to distribute the iTero Element intraoral scanning system with the latest glidewell.io In-Office Solution in North America.Align Technology had also signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental to make available its iTero Element intraoral scanning system as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada.Solid Global Prospects Align Technology had introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in 2017. These are indicative of the growing popularity of its dental products in the international market.Further, over the recent past, Align Technology reported strong international Invisalign Technology volumes on continued strong performance in both EMEA and APAC regions.In the last reported quarter, EMEA, volumes were up on continued adoption of Invisalign Technology in core markets like the U.K., Spain and France, as well as rapid growth in smaller markets like Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. In the Asia-Pacific region, the company witnessed an impressive volume growth led by China, Japan and Australia. We expect to see a similar trend in the yet-to-be-reported quarter result as well.Overall, Align Technology projects EPS of 94-98 cents on revenues of $400-$410 million in the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $408 million in first-quarter 2018 indicates a rise of 37.4% from the year-ago quarter.What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank #2, a combination that suggests the company to likely beat on earnings this quarter.

927,EW,"There are over 800 companies reporting earnings this week but the focus will really be on the hot big cap stocks, including some Dow components.  While FANG stocks like Amazon and Facebook will take up a lot of oxygen, investors shouldn’t overlook a dozen big cap stocks that are also on everyone’s radar.Many of these companies have beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently over the past 5 years. That’s not easy to do.Several of them are also trading near new multi-year highs. Are they too hot to handle?The Hottest Earnings Charts This Week1.    Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report) has only missed one time in the last 5 years. That’s an impressive track record. Shares have busted out to new 5-year highs heading into the report. Can it keep the momentum?2.    Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has missed only once in 5 years but shares were going nowhere until they soared in 2017. Shares have pulled back after hitting new highs in January 2018. Can they get their mojo back and return to new highs?3.    Visa (V  -  Free Report) has one of the best charts on The Street. Period. It hasn’t missed in over 5 years and shares continue to trade near all-time highs. Will another beat put it in a new level?4.    PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) hasn’t missed since the 2015 IPO when it was spun-off from eBay. Worries over revenue now that its agreement with eBay has changed have kept the shares in a narrow trading range in 2018. Can it appease investor fears this quarter?5.    Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) beat last quarter but shares still trade near 5-year lows. It’s really about same-store-sales with the restaurant chains. Last quarter, for the first time in several years, it posted strong SSS numbers. Will it build on that momentum this quarter? Is Chipotle “back”?Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Revenues in the segment totaled $363.5 million, up 3.2% year over year. Per management, the upside can be attributed to growth in licensed software. Moreover, for the full year, System Sales revenues grew 7% and margins increased 6% from 2016.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pinned at $338 million, up 5.6% year over year.Other Factors at PlayEHR ProspectsCerner’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform has majorly triggered growth. Lately, the company witnessed a slew of developments in its EHR platform. The Cerner Millenium EHR has been chosen to be implemented through the new Cerner IntegratedBehavioral Health deployment model by Texas-based The Menninger Clinic.Cerner was also selected by the Illinois Rural Community Care Organization (“IRCCO”) to implement Cerner HealtheIntent, across its accountable care organizations. Notably, the HealtheIntent played a significant role in driving Cerner’s earnings in the last reported quarter. The company ended the year with 144 HealtheIntent clients. Resultantly, population health bookings grew 42% and revenues rose 20%.Furthermore, in the last reported quarter, the company witnessed record bookings growth of more than 50%, which can be attributed to the latest EHR deals, with 22% of the bookings coming from outside core Millennium installed base.Support, Maintenance & ServiceIn the last reported quarter, this segment accounted for a whopping 70.2% of total revenues.

Full-year adjusted earnings per share are estimated in the range of $2.57-$2.73.New business bookings in first-quarter 2018 are expected in the range of $1.250-$1.450 billion.Declining Margins & High DebtIn the last reported quarter, operating margin came in at 20.5%, which contracted 280 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. The downside was caused by a 9% year-over-year surge in operating expenses. The rise was driven by personnel expenses related to revenue-generating associates and non-cash items.Additionally, long-term debt amounted to $527 million at the end of the quarter.Our quantitative model does not conclusively show a beat for Cerner this earnings season.

929,EW,"athenahealth Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, after the market closes. The company’s strong product portfolio, solid network expansion strategies and unique business model are key tailwinds at the moment.Last quarter, athenahealth posted adjusted earnings of $1.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents. Further, earnings increased a whopping 79% on a year-over-year basis. The company posted revenues of $329 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $323 million. Revenues increased 14.2% year over year.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $318.5 million, reflecting a rise of 11.6% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 73 cents, indicating an increase of 128.1% year over year.athenahealth, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  athenahealth, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | athenahealth, Inc. QuoteWe expect athenahealth to witness steady growth in Business Services sales — one of the major revenue components. While this is projected to drive first-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in Implementation and Other segment will also help the company generate impressive results.Considering these, the question lingering in investors’ minds is whether athenahealth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact the company’s first-quarter 2018 results.Business Services in FocusBusiness Services contributed 97.7% of net revenues in the last quarter. For the upcoming quarterly result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Business Services is pegged at $312 million, reflecting a rise of 12.2% year over year.Applications like athenaClinicals, athenaClinicals-Streamlined, athenaInsight, athenaCommunicator, athenaOne, athenaCollector for Hospital and Health Systems and the brand promise of ‘Unbreak Healthcare’ comes under athenahealth’s business services segment.The segment has been fortifying the company’s market position in terms of exclusiveness of services in the respective markets.athenahealth’s unique business model makes it a strong niche provider of revenue cycle management (RCM) services to small physician practices. Meanwhile, per a research report by Markets And Markets, the global revenue cycle management market is projected to reach $7.09 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 11.8%.The upcoming results are likely to indicate strong growth in the Business Services unit.Other Factors at PlayImplementation and OthersImplementation and Others contributed 2.4% of net revenues in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Implementation and Others is pegged at $7.3 million, reflecting a rise of 2.8% year over year.The segment includes Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record implementations.Of late, athenahealth has been hogging the limelight on its cloud-based big data network — athenaNet. Recently, the company launched a machine-learning model to automate faxes.Developments like these in the Implementation and Others are likely to drive athenahealth, which are likely to be reflected in first-quarter 2018 results.Strong Product Portfolioathenahealth’s portfolio comprises a wide array of products that include electronic health records, revenue cycle management, medical billing, patient engagement, care coordination, population health management and Epocrates. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, athenahealth launched its first machine learning model to automate faxes. The company piloted services like authorization management, which has been planned to expand the company’s client base throughout 2018.athenaInsight, an online news hub that reports on U.S. healthcare activities and trends of healthcare providers and ‘de-identified patients’ has also been a major contributor.In 2017, athenahealth rapidly expanded its patient record sharing capabilities with CommonWell and Carequality.The upcoming quarterly results will reflect benefits from the company’s strong product portfolio.Aggressive RivalryOn the flipside, athenahealth’s EHR solution faces significant competition from the likes of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions and others.Competitors such as Cerner offer long-standing seamless products integrating inpatient and ambulatory-care systems.This might dampen the company’s prospects, which will reflect on first-quarter 2018 results.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for athenahealth this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

930,EW,"Only a handful of S&P 500 players have released their numbers so far this earnings season. We expect the first quarter to see strong revenues as reflected by the solid upward trend in estimate revisions.Meanwhile, three back-to-back events in the quarter have rattled the global economy. The first was the U.S.-China trade war chaos, then came the tech backlash stemming from Facebook’s (FB) data fiasco, and finally, the chemical attack in Syria paving ways for fresh troubles between America and Russia.Furthermore, apprehensions related to further rate hikes by the Fed continue to do the rounds.Is Medical Device a Safe Haven?It is said that the stock market runs on sentiments and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a ripple effect on others. Going against this notion, the Medical-Device sector within the broader Medical universe has proven to be a refuge for investors. Shrugging off the ongoing tensions, the sector has returned 2% year to date, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s return of 1.1%.This is because, Medical-Device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition.In fact, our latest Earnings Preview gives an encouraging picture with the broader Medical space expected to register year-over-year earnings growth of 7.8% on revenue growth of 6.3%.So, it would rather be interesting to see how the Medical-Device companies are placed ahead of the reporting cycle and what are the major factors shaping up the releases.Growth DriversGoing by a CISION report, the United States is the largest Medical-Device market in the world, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. It has been a very profitable investment space of late.Considering the ageing population, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, the Medical-Device sector appears to be in pink of health. Here are the latest headlines from the space:Taxes Abolished!A bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect on Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based Medical-Device manufacturers, instilling investor optimism in them.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.Digital Revolution Takes MedTech by StormThe latest trend of robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space have been gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Evidently, companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits of Medical-Device companies of late.Buyout RushLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key Medical-Device players have expanded customer base, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. This has also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts (ESRX) by Cigna, which follows just three months of drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS) announcement of plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna, is important. Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX) takeover of C. R. Bard is also worth a mention.Zacks Methodology to the RescueGiven the existence of a number of players in the Medical-Device industry, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings banking on the above factors might quite an intimidating task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you.One can narrow down choices by focusing specifically on the ‘medical instruments’ and ‘medical product’ stocks (specialized chunks under the Medical-Device subcategory), that sport the desirable combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Going by this criterion, we hereby present four stocks that are poised to beat estimates this quarter.Our PicksEdwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Irvine, CA, Edwards Lifesciences deals in products and technologies aimed at treating advanced cardiovascular diseases, especially structural heart disease in critically ill patients.The company’s strong pipeline of products and solid performance delivered in the TAVR market bolster our confidence in the stock. Although Edwards Lifesciences’ higher operating expenses might have made investors apprehensive, it is a respite as the funds were used for adopting advanced initiatives to drive overall sales.Edwards Lifesciences will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after the market closes.We believe the company is set to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.36%.Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Bedford, MA, Hologic develops, manufactures, and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products which cater to the healthcare needs of women. The company is focused on mammography systems for breast examination and osteoporosis assessment.The company will release results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on May 2, after the market closes.  Hologic’s Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.94% raise possibilities of a beat this quarter.Meanwhile, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker is one of the world’s largest Medical-Device companies operating in the orthopedic market.Mako is Stryker’s robotic-arm Assisted surgery platform which provides a predictable surgical experience when performing joint replacement surgery.Recently, Stryker launched the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with the Mako System. Notably, this is the first and only robotic technology which can be used for total knee, hip and partial knee replacement procedures. Notably, Mako Total Knee utilizes both Stryker’s robotic platform and Triathlon Total Knee System, guided through CT-based 3D modeling of bone anatomy. The system also allows for intra-operative planning and assists in bone resectioning procedures.Stryker will report first quarter of 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.  We believe Stryker is poised to trump the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it has the encouraging combination of a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.16%.Teleflex Incorporated (TFX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Wayne, PA, Teleflex develops, manufactures, and supplies single-use medical devices for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications worldwide.The company’s strong focus on High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (HFNCT) is likely to lend it a competitive edge in the niche space.Solid growth in the preloaded anti-microbial and anti-thrombogenic VPS PICCs platform is likely to strengthen the vascular platform. In the surgical segment, new products like EFx and Ae05 fortify the company’s foothold. Finally, the company’s flagship LMA unique product strengthens its Anasthesia product line.The company is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.We expect an earnings beat for this stock which has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.71%.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

931,EW,"I've written about large-cap gold miners like Barrick Gold (ABX  -  Free Report) many times over the years for the Bear of the Day feature.The steadily eroding earnings outlook for these companies is no surprise, even as the price of gold rallies.Since a summer of 2016 peak for the yellow metal near $1375, it has fallen to support at $1125 and rallied back to $1350.Meanwhile, Barrick Gold shares have fallen over 40% from $23 to $13, and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX  -  Free Report) fell 26%.One look at the earnings picture for ABX from the Zacks proprietary Price & Consensus chart will explain why...What you see is EPS on the left-hand scale with each colored line representing the changes in annual estimates over time.The right hand scale is the stock price, showing a steady decline as earnings growth never really showed up the past two years.The top line isn't much better with this year's expected $8.03 billion revenue haul posting as a 4% decline over last year -- and this when the average price of gold is holding higher than 2017 and looking technically robust.The Monetary Myth of the Barbarous RelicThe cost of producing an ounce of gold is over $800 for the majority of miners. And one element besides the high cost of production that always hurts the miners is past hedging.If a miner has obligations via futures, options, or OTC forward contracts to sell gold at say $1300, $1200, or even $1100, then rising spot prices don't have the direct margin leverage one would think.And I remain bearish on gold, believing nothing in monetary policy or the inflation outlook will much help it get back to $1500 and above.In October I wrote a special report for Zacks Confidential titled The Monetary Myth of Gold where I explained why the barbarous relic was soon doomed in the high-tech age of fiat currencies, digital finance, and artificial intelligence.Instead, I recommended investors put their money into real economic growth stories like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), and Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report).That report has my detailed thesis on all the dynamics for gold, including the dollar, inflation, and the relativity of currency fluctuations in a global economy.I even suggested that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were proving the digital era would offer more important economic innovations to extract than anything we could dig from the ground.Barrick Gold may indeed be worth something near $15 billion but I wouldn't pay that now for cash flow that is headed the wrong direction, and could be for a while.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and BABA for Zacks TAZR Trader and shares of EW for Zacks Healthcare Innovators.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

932,EW,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) has underperformed the industry in a year's time. The company’s shares grew 1.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 8.9%.Also, sluggishness in the AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”) segment is a concern. AmerisourceBergen continues to witness headwinds, thanks to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics. Further, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth is expected to mar the bottom line.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted earnings slipped 0.5% to $6.48 per share in the past two months. The company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates expectations of underperformance in the near term.Thus, here we take a detailed analysis on the factors that have been plaguing AmerisourceBergen.What’s Plaguing AmerisourceBergen?Recently, AmerisourceBergen received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about its lab testing of a certain type of syringe made in its PharMEDium lab in Memphis.The Memphis-based lab is the company’s largest highly-automated production facility. As a result of the subpoena, AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all of the products from the facility that had yet to expire. In fact, officials from FDA also visited this facility for the same reason, recently. Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company’s specialty distribution segment over the long haul.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the segment's results were marred by PharMEDium, wherein the company reportyed lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution. Per management, PharMEDium's contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in fiscal 2018 will be lower than expected, due to certain ongoing incremental expenses.AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly-competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors include Cardinal Health, McKesson along with national generic distributors and regional distributors.Time to Offload?Considering these headwinds, investors might find it to be the right time to dump AmerisourceBergen.In this regard, our VGM Style Score model can turn out to be helpful. This is a comprehensive tool that helps investors screen winning stocks from the broader sectors. Further, the score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can drive it higher.Unfortunately, AmerisourceBergen has a VGM Style Score of D, indicating it as one of the worst performing stocks in the MedTech space, at least for now.In fact, our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Key PicksA few better-ranked players in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank of #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

933,EW,"Cardinal Health, Inc’s (CAH  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 results are scheduled for release on May 3, before the market opens. While results are likely to show a decline in the core Pharmaceutical segment, growth across other segments is likely to make up partially.In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share, up 12.7% from the prior-year quarter and also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. Revenues came in at $35.19 billion, up 6.1% on a year-over-year basis, outpacing the consensus estimate of $34.69 billion.Notably, Cardinal Health has a negative average earnings surprise of 0.3% for the trailing four quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.51, reflecting a decline of 1.3% year over year. The same for revenues is pinned at $33.58 billion, indicating growth of 5.5%.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteLet’s delve deeper.Pharmaceutical Segment in FocusIn the last reported quarter, this segment accounted for an enormous 88.5% of the company’s revenues. Revenues in the segment came in at $31.15 billion, up 4.7% on a year-over-year basis.The segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and also gained a huge number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers.However, it saw a 4% drop in profits to $514 million, thanks to generic pharmaceutical pricing and the recent investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics program performance. Per management, growth in the segment was further impeded by the expiration of a large mail order from Prime Therapeutics.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in at $29.63 billion, down 4.9% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayGuidance LiftedConsidering the benefits from the slashed federal tax rate, Cardinal Health raised the fiscal 2018 outlook. The company expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.25-$5.50, as compared with the previous range of $4.85-$5.10.Medical SegmentIn the fiscal second quarter, this segment accounted for 11.5% of the company’s revenues. Revenues in the segment grew 18.6% to$4.04 billion, primarily driven by the Patient Recovery acquisition. Medical segment profits increased 38% to $220 million, courtesy of higher contributions from new and existing customers and acquisition of the Patient Recovery business.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the segment is pegged at $4.07 billion, up 0.7%, sequentially.Medical Gloves UnitCardinal Health offers a robust portfolio of medical gloves including surgical gloves, exam gloves and clean-room gloves. The company has been lately facing challenges in the exam-glove sub-segment.

934,EW,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) announced positive clinical trial data from the Multisensor Chronic Evaluation in Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (MultiSENSE) study. This study (based on 900 patients) was conducted to examine the performance of the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic to predict impending heart failure (HF) decompensation.The study demonstrated that HeartLogic Diagnostic iincreases the ability to classify patients at high or low-risk of experiencing a future HF event. Presently, physicians recommend blood test to diagnose HF or determine disease severity. However, this method is less reliable as the assessment loses relevance when patients’ conditions change. The MultiSENSE trial data showed that HeartLogic Diagnostic expanded the ability of a baseline blood test to identify patients at a high risk of a HF event.Notably, the HeartLogic Diagnostic is already CE Marked and FDA approved and will be available commercially later this year under the Rhythm Management segment.In the last reported second quarter, Rhythm Management was the second largest contributor to Boston Scientific's top line, which includes Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) and Electrophysiology. CRM reflected a 2% year-over-year increase in sales in the reported quarter.According to a report by GlobalData, the heart failure market is estimated to reach a value of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is a strategic fit.Over the past year, Boston Scientific has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has risen 23.1% over this period, as against a 9.5% gain of the broader industry.Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend has been favorable for the company.

938,EW,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently has initiated a U.S. pivotal clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a modified version of its AMPLATZER device. This device is designed to correct a common congenital heart defect in pre-term infants. The device is same as the larger sized AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II product. The clinical study will be conducted on 50 patients at up to 10 centers across the United States.According to Abbott, Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a life-threatening vascular pathway or duct in the heart that remains open due to the failure of the fetal duct to close after birth. In some cases, the PDA fails to close spontaneously in premature babies leading to difficulty in breathing and feeding.Pharmaceuticals can be used at times to close the duct but are less effective in pre-term infants. Current treatment options for pre-term infants who are not responsive to pharmaceuticals are limited to surgery. However, surgery is not always possible and leaving the duct open can lead to fatal outcomes for infants. Breaking the conventional treatment, Abbott is developing the AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II Additional Sizes (ADO II AS) device to provide physicians with a nonsurgical treatment option for addressing the PDA defect in newborns and pre-term infants. ADO II AS is already approved for use in Europe.If the study is successful, the U.S. trial results will support Abbott's application for FDA approval for pediatric use in the country.We note that Abbott has been consistently trying to expand its vascular business under the Medical Device segment that is on solid growth trajectory of late. In the last reported second quarter, the Medical Devices business sales spiked 89.2% on a reported basis.Also, the recent developments include the receipt of FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3Left Ventricular Assist System (also known as an LVAD). The HeartMate 3 system enables physicians managing advanced heart failure patients in need of short-term hemodynamic support.Abbott also announced CE Mark and first use of the new Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM). This is the world's first smartphone-compatible ICM which helps physicians identify difficult-to-detect cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF).According to a report by Markets and Markets, the global pediatric interventional cardiology market is estimated to see a CAGR of 9% from 2013 to 2018. Looking at the bountiful opportunities in this niche space, we believe the company’s latest development by is a strategical fit.Over the last three months, Abbott has been trading above the broader industry.

Adjusted EPS also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents.

While nutritional specialty products grew 14%, sales from vaccines increased 8%, principally on volume growth of products for poultry and swine industries.However, sales at Medicated feed additives (MFAs) and Other fell 3% primarily due to volume declines.Domestic net sales of MFAs and Other declined $7.4 million due to reduced volumes of medically important antimicrobials. International net sales increased by $5.2 million, driven by growth in the Asia-Pacific region, which is partially offset by declines in Brazil due to economic conditions.Net sales at the Mineral Nutrition segment increased 5% to $52.8 million on increased volumes and higher average selling prices resulting from underlying raw material commodity price increase.  Net sales at the Performance Products segment increased 6% to $13.4 million.

940,EW,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Radnor, PA-based VWR Corporation  which offers laboratory products, services and solutions. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We are eagerly waiting for the closing of VWR’s $6.4 billion acquisition by Avantor, a global supplier of ultra-high-purity materials for life sciences and advanced technology industries.Post-closing (expected in the fourth quarter of 2017), the consolidated entity should create a major consumables-focused solutions and services provider to high-growth life sciences and advanced technologies industries. The buyout will build on Avantor’s strengths, including its cGMP (current good manufacturing practice) processes, a significant exposure to the emerging markets and VWR’s vital position across both Americas as well as Europe.The combined company will therefore be serving a global customer base in all areas of activities from research through production, thus reflecting a unique advantage in a fast-growing marketplace.From shareholders’ point of view, this potential merger with Avantor seems a beneficial move at the moment. The consolidation deal has been fixed at $33.25 per share in cash of VWR common stock, representing an enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. The purchase price represents an approximate 17% premium to the unaffected closing stock price as of May 2, 2017, the day before market speculations over a potential sale of VWR started.VWR Corporation Price and Consensus  VWR Corporation Price and Consensus | VWR Corporation QuoteNotably, the stock price has already inched closer to Avantor’s offer price while investors wait for the merger’s closure.

(MDRX  -  Free Report) recently launched Allscripts Real-Time Health System, an exclusive work-flow solution to optimize the clinical and financial impact of medical prescriptions and enhance prescription price transparency.With the latest launch, Allscripts aims at providing clinicians and patients with complete information including medication price, cost of alternative therapies, and competitive prices of the prescribed therapy at different pharmacies. Notably, Allscripts is the first major healthcare information technology player to come up with such a solution.Undoubtedly, Allscripts Real-Time Health System will boost consumer knowledge and satisfaction. Per management, the company will embed prescription pricing information into the work-flow system with the help of leading pharmacy benefit managers and technology partners in the nation.In this regard Management at Allscripts is hopeful about the company’s partnerships with DrFirst, GoodRx and Surescripts to deliver real-time benefit and price information.Earlier this month, Allscripts announced that its dbMotion Solution platform has been selected by South Western Sydney PHN (SWSPHN) to deliver integrated care. Notably, dbMotion Solution is Allscripts’ proprietary Community interoperability platform. The dbMotion Solution will support SWSPHN’s goals of improving clinical excellence and promoting quality care. It will also help SWSPHN collaborate with internationally recognized dbMotion sites in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Israel.Stock Performance Lacks LusterAllscripts has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company has had a discouraging run on the bourse over the last one year. The stock represented a return of just 4.5%, comparing unfavorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 16.5%. Further, the current level is lower than the broader industry’s return of 9.6% over the same time frame.Notably, Allscripts expects a modest increase in operating expenses during the second half of 2017 to support business growth. The company’s products have a long sales cycle which involves decision making at different managerial levels. This increases the company’s operating expenses and might even result in cancellation of orders. Our TakeAllscripts’ management is focused on various restructuring initiatives, research and development plans and launch of exclusive products. Management has also been trying to streamline operational efficiency and cater to client needs with the introduction of products.We believe favorable demographic trends, reinforced by a supportive regulatory environment, are expected to sustain growth in demand for the company. Higher client demand for the company’s population health management solutions should drive long-term growth.

Per the last trading price, the stock has gained 9.6%, higher than the broader market’s gain of 1.9% over that time frame. The company continues to see strong growth in pharma and biotech backed by solid market fundamentals and planned growth strategy. The raised 2017 guidance is also encouraging.The company’s acquisition activities to drive growth inorganically also raise hopes. We are particularly upbeat about the company’s foray into the into the high-potential contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) space through the recent acquisition of Patheon N.V. for $7.2 billion. Moreover, the takeover of FEI Company has started to contribute to Thermo Fisher’s analytical instruments portfolio.

In the second quarter of 2017, the company recorded solid contributions from China, India and the Middle East. We are also upbeat about the company’s recent opening of a Center of Excellence for electron microscopy in Saudi Arabia.Additionally, Thermo Fisher has a strong cash balance that enables it to adopt attractive share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives majority of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency. Management currently estimates unfavorable foreign exchange to have a negative impact on its top line in 2017.The landscape has become intensely competitive, thanks to changing technology and customer demand that require continual research and development.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

The collaboration is expected to enhance the company’s patient care techniques, especially in cases of Cystic Fibrosis, gastrointestinal illness and respiratory tract infections.Meanwhile, shares of Luminex have inched 0.3% up following the news release. However, over the last month, the stock has lost almost 7.6%, much wider than the broader industry’s decline of only 0.1 %.Per the terms of the deal, Sutter Health will be leveraging on Luminex molecular diagnostic systems, which include xTAG Cystic Fibrosis, ARIES HSV and VERIGENE Respiratory Pathogens Flex panels.

Per Frost & Sullivan, the niche space is currently seeing a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 12.5% and is estimated to reach a worth of $6.5 billion by 2021. We believe collaborative agreements like these will expand Luminex’s customer base and bolster its foothold in the niche space.Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is a leading player in the molecular diagnostics space. In an initiative to strengthen the company’s laboratory products and services revenue segment, Thermo Fisher recently acquired Patheon N.V. , a leading contract development and manufacturing organization.Favorable Estimate Revision TrendThe company’s recent earnings estimates have been robust. The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past thirty days, while next year estimates have seen four up and one down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus has risen 11.1% in the past month, while next year estimates have increased 2.2%. Owing to the favorable estimate revisions, Luminex sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), signifying probabilities of outperformance in the near term.Other Collaborative Agreements at a GlanceApart from the latest deal with Sutter Health, Luminex has collaborative agreements with several companies which should help expand the use of its products/technology.

946,EW,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.3% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsEdwards Lifesciences reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.88 by a wide margin of 22.7%. Adjusted earnings also improved a stupendous 42.1% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the company’s transcatheter heart valves business.Excluding one-time items, net income in the second quarter came in at $186.1 million or $0.86 per share, up 46.9% or 48.3% year over year, respectively.Sales DetailsEdwards Lifesciences’ second-quarter sales improved 10.9% to $841.8 million. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. Underlying sales increased 15.3% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in Germany elected to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by the other two product lines across all regions.    Segments DetailsFor the second quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $487.5 million, reflecting 16.5% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., THVT sales in the quarter were $316.3 million, up 28.4% year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance results being delivered by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $207.1 million, up 4.2% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and the supply recovery in mitral valve sales, partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valve.Critical Care sales were $147.2 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 3.7% from second-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by double-digit growth in the company's Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, mainly in the U.S and Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the second quarter, gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 74.9% owing to a more profitable product mix, led by growing sales of transcatheter valves. This was however partially offset by adverse foreign exchange.SG&A expenses rose 6.6% year over year to $243.8 million on account of sales and personnel related expenses, primarily in the Transcatheter Valve (THV) segment. On the other hand, R&D expenditures increased 19.5% year over year to $134.4 million owing to continued investments in the company’s transcatheter mitral valve and mitral valve programs, including expenditure on clinical trials. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 160 bps to 29.9% as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.13 billion, compared with $918.9 million at the end of the first quarter. Long-term debt in the quarter totaled $1.02 billion, compared with $847.9 million reported previously.Cash flow from operating activities was $197.7 million in the second quarter, compared with $128.3 million in the previous quarter. Excluding capital spending of $58.0 million, free cash flow was $139.7 million. During the quarter, management repurchased 0.8 million shares for $73.8 million to offset dilution associated with its Valtech Cardio acquisition and stock-based incentive compensation. Updated 2017 GuidanceBanking on a solid second-quarter performance, Edwards Lifesciences has raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to the high end of the previously projected range of $3.2–$3.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is $3.35 billion, near the high end of the guided range. Adjusted EPS expectations have also been raised to $3.65–$3.85 from $3.43–$3.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $3.52, within the company’s guided range.For the third quarter of 2017, the company projects sales (after adjusting for the effect of Germany stocking sales) between $810 million and $850 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $816.1 million, within the projected range. The company estimates adjusted EPS between $0.80 and $0.90. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is $0.83, which is also within the company‘s forecasted range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

947,EW,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Sunnyvale-based Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) – manufacturer of the da Vinci surgical system (an advanced robot-assisted surgical system) and related instruments and accessories. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Among major positives, Intuitive Surgical has had an impressive run in the bourse of late. A glimpse at the recent price performance reveals a favorable return of 43.9% over the past year, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 4.1%. The company has a solid track characterized by consecutive earnings beat in the trailing four quarters.In recent times, Intuitive Surgical reported stellar performance mainly due to the growing adoption of the da Vinci system among physicians and overall growth in global procedures. The da Vinci surgical system enables minimally invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. Performance was also aided by growing volumes, courtesy to general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures.Intuitive Surgical continuously introduces technologies for surgical systems. The company also plans to launch an upgrade – da Vinci X – to its flagship Vinci Xi technology. In this regard, management confirmed the submission of documents for CE Mark approval of Vinci X. Furthermore, the company expects availability of this device in Europe by the end of 2017. In the long haul, extensive expenditure on product pipeline and expansion in international markets like Europe should drive growth for the company.On the flipside, the company expects procedure growth rate to slow down a bit outside the United States in the coming quarters. The long sale and purchase order cycle of the da Vinci system has added to the woes. Also, expenses on research and development (R&D) increased significantly in the first half of 2017, reflecting high spending on advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

The company has also announced that it will provide patient training for this new indication later this year and in 2018.System One has been a flagship platform of NxStage contributing significantly to the company’s top line. The latest development in the System One platform is exclusively formulated for both new and existing System One patients to reduce transportation costs, re-hospitalization rates and provide dialysis care on site. In fact, solo home hemodialysis eradicates the need of a care partner during the treatment procedure. Notably, the company got the first and only home nocturnal hemodialysis clearance way back in 2014.Per management, globally, a number of patients failed to opt for home hemodialysis to date due to the absence of a care partner to help them during the process. The latest regulatory go-ahead is likely to lend NxStage a competitive edge and expand its patient base with solid access to the clinical benefits associated with home hemodialysis.NxStage Partners Dialyze Direct for On-Site DialysisThe latest regulatory progress closely follows another solid development in NxStage’s Dialysis platform. Earlier this month, the company announced that its subsidiary NxStage Kidney Care is partnering Dialyze Direct for supporting the needs of patients who need on-site skilled-nursing facilities (SNF) for dialysis treatment in Ohio. NxStage will now leverage on its System One platform and Dialyze Direct’s unique model for treating geriatric SNF patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).NxStage to Be AcquiredEarlier this month, German dialysis provider Fresenius Medical Care (FMS) signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of NxStage for $30 a share. The transaction has been valued at $2 billion and is subject to close by 2018, on approval of NxStage stockholders and other customary conditions. We note that NxStage has been gaining prominence in the market of late with products like NxStage PureFlow SL Dialysis Preparation System, Nx2me Connected Health and NxStage System One.Market Trends Buoy OptimismData from Markets And Markets reveal that the global hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis market is expected to reach a worth of $83.89 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 6.0%. NxStage’s continuous effort to bolster its Dialysis unit is likely to be benefitted by the bountiful prospects in the niche space. Furthermore, an increased rate of ESRD cases enhances probabilities of NxStage outperformance in the niche space in the near term.Share Price Moves UpOver the past one year, NxStage has added 22.4%, comparing favorably with the S&P 500’s 11.9% over the same time frame. Furthermore, the current level was way higher than the broader industry’s gain of just 5.5% over the same time frame.NxStage carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

950,EW,"On Mar 27, we issued an updated research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report). The company boasts strong international operations and has witnessed consistent growth in the Asia-Pacific and emerging markets. However, the company’s earnings have been affected by unfavorable foreign exchange over the last few quarters. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading scientific instrument maker has been outperforming its industry in the past year. The stock has rallied 34.2% compared with 21.9% gain of the industry.Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher has been witnessing solid growth globally on strong expansion.  The company plans to continue to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, such as China and India, and other regions such as South Korea, Russia and Brazil. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the standout contributors were China, India and South Korea.  China led the way with growth in the high teens. The company opened two customer demo centers in the region, reflecting the company’s leading position in the electron microscopy and precision medicine space. The company has also invested significantly in its digital capabilities. In India, the company is currently working on tapping into growth opportunities in biopharma, healthcare and food safety markets.As part of its strategy to effectively deploy capital, Thermo Fisher has undertaken several acquisitions in the recent past. Apart from boosting revenues, these deals have driven the operating margin while also resulting in tax synergies. In this regard, Thermo Fisher’s acquisition of FEI Company has started to boost its analytical instruments portfolio.Also in 2017, the company spent $7.8 billion on acquisitions, adding leading biopharma contract development and manufacturing services through Patheon buyout. Significantly enhancing the company’s value proposition for biopharma customers, Patheon has started to contribute to Thermo Fisher’s laboratory products and services segment.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives a huge portion of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency.

952,EW,"Medical Instrument bigshots — Abiomed Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) and STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) — are pitted against each other in the prospective U.S. MedTech space, which is estimated to reach $343 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 4.6% (per Lucintel). Notably, these companies benefit from R&D innovation, increasing consolidation and the recent tax abatement.Having similar business models, it often becomes difficult to decide which investment option is better. Further, as things stand now, the scales apparently look evenly balanced as the companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Thus, here we take a detailed look at the fundamentals of these companies to determine which stock is currently positioned better in the Medical Instruments space.Detailed AnalysisWith a market cap of $13.3 billion, Abiomed is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing of medical products, designed to assist or replace the pumping function during heart failures.STERIS develops, manufactures and markets infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction, as well as surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services. The company has a market cap of $8 billionMeanwhile, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Price Performance: While the companies have outperformed the industry (up 15.4%) in the past year, Abiomed’s shares have fared better. In fact, Abiomed’s price performance is expected to improve as the latest developments signify probabilities of the company's penetration into the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market.Abiomed’s shares surged 136.2% in the last 12 months, higher than the 34.5% rally of STERIS.Consequently, Abiomed wins over STERIS when price performance is to be considered. Earnings Growth Projections: For Abiomed, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is pegged at $2.29 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 95.7%. The stock has long-term expected earnings growth rate of 31.5%. For STERIS, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.13 for fiscal 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 9.8%.Abiomed wins another round.Sales Growth Projections: For Abiomed, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $168.9 million for the next quarter, reflecting 27.6% rise from the prior year. For STERIS, the consensus estimate for sales is projected at $646.7 million for the next quarter, indicating a rise of almost 6.4% year over year.Abiomed has an edge here as well.What’s Driving Abiomed?Abiomed’s extensive product portfolio and robust demand for its Impella line of products will continue to serve as key growth catalysts over the next several years.Impella, Abiomed’s flagship product line, has consistently been a growth driver. Impella is the world's smallest heart pump. It is a support system of percutaneous, catheter-based devices offering hemodynamic support to the heart.The platform reflects stellar performance in the third quarter. In the United States, the PCI and cardiogenic shock indications established new quarterly records. The company’s Impella adoption increased a total of 9% of the 121,000 high-risk PCI and 100,000 emergency patients. It was driven by the company’s clinical benefits and previous FDA approvals.Outside the United States, revenues from Impella heart pumps totaled $17.3 million and was up 94% year over year, predominantly from Germany, which recorded $11.4 million, up 71%. Additionally, the Company recorded $1.1 million in revenues from Japan.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company delivered some breakthroughs in terms of record earnings and revenue growth. Per management, operational excellence and discipline helped the company achieve the highest gross and operating margins to date.ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus | ABIOMED, Inc. Quote STERIS: A Solid ContenderThe bulk of STERIS’ revenues are obtained from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Growth in these industries is primarily driven by aging global population, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years.Further, these industries are dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies and general economic conditions. With increasing global life expectancy, a larger aging population increases the demand for medical procedures. This, in turn, translates into higher consumption of single use medical devices and surgical kits processed by STERIS.Considering the consistent success achieved by the company in offering varied medical equipment to its customers, we believe that STERIS holds huge potential to expand its foothold in these industries.The current macroeconomic environment across the globe has affected STERIS’ financial operations. Governments and insurance companies continue to look for ways to contain the rising cost of healthcare.This might put pressure on players in the healthcare industry, STERIS being no exception. Increases in prices or lesser availability of raw materials as well as oil and gas might impair STERIS’ procurement of necessary materials for product manufacture.The company competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several players that have robust product portfolios and global reach as well as a number of small companies with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries.STERIS plc Price and Consensus STERIS plc Price and Consensus | STERIS plc Quote To ConcludeOur comparative analysis indicates that Abiomed is positioned better than STERIS, considering price performance, earnings growth expectations and sales expectations.Key PicksA few other top-ranked players in the broader medical sector are Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).Abaxis, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.1%.Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.1%.

Last quarter, the company’s earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%. Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 9.9%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to gain from strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the first quarter of 2018 as well.The company is expected to continue to gain from strong clinical performance from SAPIEN 3 in the United States, as well as strong therapy implementation across all regions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $471 million shows an increase of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Outside the United States, the underlying growth rate was solid. Double-digit procedure growth in Europe was maintained last quarter. The company also continued to see strong TAVR therapy adoption in Japan driven by SAPIEN 3.Overall, first-quarter total revenues are projected at $931 million, up 5.3% from the prior-year quarter.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote Here are the other factors that might influence Edwards Lifesciences’ first-quarter results:Edwards Lifesciences is expected to continue with its strong performance based on strength in two other segments — Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care.The Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group delivered strong performance last quarter driven by encouraging performance of new products along with strong uptake of aortic valves across all geographies. Moreover, buoyed with the continued strong adoption of INTUITY Elite valve system, management expects INTUITY Elite valve system sales to remain on track to account for 25% of global aortic sales in fiscal 2018.Per management, in January 2018, the company had rolled out INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves in the United States. Edwards Lifesciences also informed that the planned 2018 launch of INSPIRIS RESILIA in Japan is on track and progressing well. TheZacks Consensus Estimate for Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product sales of $210 million reflects a rise of 5% from the year-ago quarter.We are also upbeat about Critical Care product group sales witnessing solid growth across all product categories driven by strong growth in the company's core products, mainly in the United States and China.Also, Edwards Lifesciences aims to strengthen its hold in the Critical Care technologies with the ongoing rollout of HemoSphere monitoring platform and expansion of Enhanced Surgical Recovery programs. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Critical Care product group sales of $157 million shows an increase of 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.For the first quarter of 2018, the company projects sales between $900 million and $950 million and adjusted EPS between $1.04 and $1.14.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

954,EW,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) recently launched Velocity 4.0, a new version of its flagship Velocity cancer imaging platform. The system will enhance patient-specific 3D imaging and radiation dosimetry for targeted cancer therapy.Velocity 4.0 is designed for patients with liver malignancies and includes Rapidsphere — a module for Y90 Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) dosimetry analysis.We believe that Varian Medical’s strategy to target the radiation-dosimetry market is a timely one, considering higher profits in the niche space. Per a report by the Business Wire, the global market for radiation dosimeters is projected to witness a CAGR of 5-5.5% by 2022.Notably, Velocity 4.0 and the Rapidsphere module have received 510(k) clearances from the FDA, earlier.Shares UpVarian Medical’s shares have rallied 1.5% following the announcement and closed at $119.93.In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company outperformed its industry in a year’s time. Precisely, the stock has returned 48.9%, comparing favorably with the industry’s rally of 26.8%. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500’s Index’s gain of 23.5%.Varian Medical’s Velocity Unit Driving GrowthVarian Medical’s Velocity platform is a major contributor of revenues, growing strong double-digits in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Velocity oncology imaging informatics system is a vendor neutral software solution that collects and integrates oncology data pertaining to medical imaging, treatment and metadata helping the patient for ready data access.The system allows clinicians to measure changes over time, enable tumor delineation and evaluate cancer treatments using medical imaging data.After the inclusion of Rapidsphere software, Velocity will now provide the ability for cancer care teams to study tumor response and normal-tissue toxicity for individual patients receiving SIRT.Market Prospects BrightWhile the latest development focusses specifically on the liver-cancer space, Varian Medical has been a global leader in developing and delivering cancer care solutions of all types.A research report by Mordor Intelligence projects that the global liver cancer therapeutics market is expected to register a CAGR of 7- 12% from 2018 to 2023.However, aggressive rivalry in the niche markets is a headwind. Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies such as Siemens and Philips as well as with smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Accuray.Key PicksA few better-ranked players in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Abaxis, Inc.

956,EW,"On Mar 27, we issued an updated research report on Accuray Inc. (ARAY  -  Free Report). While this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is focused on acquisitions and partnerships, stiff competition is a major concern.The buyouts of TomoTherapy and Morphormics in the past have helped Accuray expand its product offerings and capabilities. Meanwhile, the collaboration with Christie InnoMed will help its products gain better visibility in Canada.Accuray recently announced an agreement with the Neuro Spinal Hospital in Dubai, UAE. Per the agreement, Neuro Spinal Hospital will acquire the company’s proprietary medical systems consisting of a CyberKnife M6 System and a Radixact System.  The tie-ups with Premier and Amerinet are expected to help the company gain significant traction in hospitals and oncology centers. On the flip side, Accuray is exposed to intense competition in the radiation oncology market, which is characterized by rapid technological changes. The company competes with the likes of Varian Medical, Elekta AB, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, ViewRay and BrainLAB AG in this market.Accuray’s top line is highly dependent on CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems sales. However, both the systems require high capital expenditure, which is a deterrent for healthcare providers.Price Performance Lacks LusterThe company has had an unimpressive run on the bourses of late. A glimpse at the recent price performance reveals that its shares have lost 11.7% over the past month, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s decline of 0.6%. We believe cutthroat competition and weak international sales have led to the downside.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

The company has a solid track characterized by consecutive earnings beat for the four trailing quarters.The company has strengthened the recurring part of its revenue mix with significant growth in subscription revenues in recent times. Moreover, launches of the Veeva Vault and the Veeva Commercial Cloud platforms are encouraging. The company is also supported by considerable strength in its CRM platform.Veeva’s industry-specific focus gives it a significant leverage, in our view. This is aptly demonstrated by its strong sales growth aided by new business gains, better pricing and product innovation. The company’s knowledge on different components of the life sciences industry is helping it to build targeted products. Notably, product like Veeva OpenData provides customer data to all healthcare professionals (HCP), healthcare organizations (HCO) and affiliations across life sciences’ major markets.Looking ahead, Veeva is optimistic about its product pipeline that includes an exclusive range of products on its flagship Vault and Commercial cloud platforms. These products include Vault CTMS, Vault PromoMats Dam, CRM Engage Meeting and CRM Engage Webinar.A glimpse at the last reported fiscal second-quarter results reveals strong revenues and adjusted earnings. The top and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Additionally, solid year-over-year subscription revenue growth has enhanced the recurring part of the company’s revenue mix.However, on the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency is expected to hurt earnings in the near term. Also escalating costs and expenses are weighing on its margins. Last month, a comparative study of Veeva’s forward P/E (forward 12-month basis) multiple reflected that the stock has been quite overvalued.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

The combined entity will have approximately 11,100 employees in the Americas — 7,100 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while 2,400 in Asia-Pacific.With the closure of the transaction, Chiltern will become a part of LabCorp’s Covance segment.

961,EW,"I've written about large-cap gold miners like Barrick Gold (ABX  -  Free Report) many times over the years for the Bear of the Day feature, and most recently in April right before the company reported earnings that fell in line with analyst estimates. Here's what I wrote on April 18... The steadily eroding earnings outlook for these companies is no surprise, even as the price of gold rallies. Since a summer of 2016 peak for the yellow metal near $1375, it has fallen to support at $1125 and rallied back to $1350. Meanwhile, Barrick Gold shares have fallen over 40% from $23 to $13, and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) fell 26%. (end of April 18 Bear of the Day excerpt) Since then, ABX has actually held its ground at $13 while its yellow metal has dropped over 8% as US interest rates rise and the dollar has rallied 6%. But analyst EPS estimates for Barrick have fallen over 7% from 83-cents to 77-cents for the full year 2018. And the continuation of this longer-term trend is on full view in the Zacks proprietary Price & Consensus chart...  What you see is EPS on the left-hand scale with each colored line representing the changes in annual estimates over time. The right hand scale is the stock price, showing a steady decline as earnings growth never really showed up the past two years. The top line isn't much better with this year's expected $7.8 billion revenue haul posting as a 6.7% decline over last year -- and this is down from April's $8.03 billion sales projection for 2018. Current consensus estimates for next year show at least a 3% drop on both the top and bottom lines is expected. The Monetary Myth of the Barbarous Relic The cost of producing an ounce of gold is over $800 for the majority of miners. And one element besides the high cost of production that always hurts the miners is past hedging. If a miner has obligations via futures, options, or OTC forward contracts to sell gold at say $1300, $1200, or even $1100, then rising spot prices don't have the direct margin leverage one would think. And I remain bearish on gold, believing nothing in monetary policy or the inflation outlook will much help it get back to $1500 and above. In October I wrote a special report for Zacks Confidential titled The Monetary Myth of Gold where I explained why the barbarous relic was soon doomed in the high-tech age of fiat currencies, digital finance, and artificial intelligence. Instead, I recommended investors put their money into real economic growth stories like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), and Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report). That report has my detailed thesis on all the dynamics for gold, including the dollar, inflation, and the relativity of currency fluctuations in a global economy. You can email Ultimate@Zacks.com to request a copy. I even suggested that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were proving the digital era would offer more important economic innovations to extract than anything we could dig from the ground. Barrick Gold may indeed be worth something near $15 billion but I wouldn't pay that now for cash flow that is headed the wrong direction, and could be for a while. Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and BABA for Zacks TAZR Trader and shares of EW for Zacks Healthcare Innovators. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

962,EW,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is a prospective name in the global MedTech space. The stock has returned 30.7%, comparing favorably with the industry’s gain of 11.2% in a year’s time. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500 Index’s rally of 10.9%.With a market capitalization of approximately $10.7 billion, the stock has met earnings expectations in each of the past four trailing quarters. However, the company has been grappling with a few issues at the moment. Cutthroat competition and persistent softness in the markets for freestanding clinics are likely to hamper the company’s prospects. Thanks to this somewhat mixed trend, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a detailed look on the company’s performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold on to this stock.What’s Favoring Varian Medical?Varian Medical’s impressive performance in the Oncology business, improving margins and the launch of Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system are the key highlights at the moment.Favorable revenue opportunity from various Oncology and Imaging Component products, growing adoption of Proton Therapy, strong overseas presence, particularly in emerging countries, as well as new partnership deals are positives.The company has been a strong player in Latin America. Varian Medical announced the opening of a new facility in Jundiaí, Brazil, which extends its global manufacturing and training footprint in the region. Through the partnership with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, Varian Medical aims to bring greater access to advanced radiotherapy treatment in that country and to greater Latin America.We believe that the Brazil-based facility will provide access to advanced radiotherapy treatment in Latin America. In this regard, a research report by Market Data Forecast shows that the radiotherapy market in Latin America was worth $654 million in 2016 and is estimated to witness a CAGR of 6.5% to reach $897.7 million by 2021.Considering the bountiful prospects, Varian Medical is likely to grow manifolds, leveraging on its Oncology segment. Per an estimate by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization, annual cancer rates around the world are projected to increase from 14.1 million in 2012 to 20 million by 2025.We believe that higher demand for Varian Medical’s products from China, India and Brazil will continue to drive international revenues in the long run.For 2018, the company expects revenues in the range of 4-7%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the band of $4.24-$ 4.36, while cash flow from operations are projected in the range of $475-$550 million.What Are the Probable Headwinds?Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies such as Siemens and Philips as well as with smaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers like Elekta and Accuray.In the emerging proton therapy market, the company faces competition from Hitachi, Ion Beam Applications, Mevion Medical Systems and Sumitomo. Intense competition is anticipated to increase R&D expenditures in the nascent proton therapy market, which will keep margins under pressure. Moreover, pricing pressure in traditional radiotherapy is a major concern.Further, lackluster performance by the particle therapy segment has been a concern. Revenues in this segment declined 4% on a year-over-year basis to $29 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Why Should You Still Hold?Unhindered by the persistent issues, analysts are optimistic about Varian Medical.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is pegged at $4.31 per share, showing an increase of 1.2% in the last three months. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $1.03, reflecting a rise of 5.1%.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteThe uptick can be attributed to Varian Medical’s products and solutions, which have been experiencing rapid adoption. This is evident from the company's impressive top-line performance in first-quarter 2017. Revenues totaled $678.5 million, which increased 12.8% year over year.Varian Medical has a VGM Style Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Notably, the VGM Score is a comprehensive tool that helps investors screen winning stocks from the broader sectors.

Revenue (TTM) | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteIn ConclusionCurrently, investors might want to hold on to the stock, courtesy of its prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.Despite the temporary sluggishness, the company has been successful on the R&D front, which is evident from year-over-year expansion in its top line. We believe that Varian Medical’s innovative product pipeline will continue to drive overall growth over the long term.Key PicksA few better-ranked players in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Abaxis,Inc.

963,EW,"Surmodics, Inc. (SRDX  -  Free Report) recently announced promising clinical trial presentation of data from PREVEIL early feasibility study (EFS) of the company’s SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB) at the Vascular Interventional Advances (VIVA) 2017 Conference.According to the company, PREVEIL is a multi-center, single-arm trial designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of paclitaxel DCB — SurVeil. It is used for treating subjects with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) due to de novo lesions of the femoral and popliteal arteries.Surmodics’ shares have outperformed the broader industry in the past three months. The stock has gained 10.4% in the period, compared to the industry's 1.5%.The current level is also better than the S&P 500's return of 2.7%. The positive SurVeil results, closely followed by regulatory approval for the same platform, reflect Surmodics’ solid surface technology for muscular devices, particularly in the drug delivery space.Coming back to the news, the six-month data was based on 13 patients who were treated at three clinical sites. The study showed that 100% of subjects secured positive outcomes demonstrating the trial’s “acute success measures of safety.”The company aims to use lower drug dosage to enhance drug transfer and impact on the arterial wall along with reducing the amount of drug reaching tissues outside the area of treatment with the SurVeil DCB.Meanwhile, the company anticipates an increase in R&D expenses in the second half of fiscal 2017. This is because of increased investments related to the SurVeil DCBtrial and other proprietary products.Estimate Revision TrendThe latest estimate revision trend has been favorable for the company. For the current year, one estimate moved north compared with no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings has increased 28% to 32 cents per share.Our TakeAccording to a report by Market Research Future, the global peripheral artery disease market is expected to reach a worth of $3.47 billion at a CAGR of 6.5% in the 2017-2023 period.

965,EW,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) successfully continues to make way through the company’s strategy to strengthen footprint in the fast-growing spine market. Following last week’s announcement of Vertera Spine buyout, the company is once again in news, courtesy the commercial launch of its LessRay software technology system. Per NuVasive, this LessRay system is based on a propriety software algorithm and hardware components. It particularly works to help address overexposure to radiation in hospital operating rooms (O.R.), mostly in the case of minimally invasive spine surgery (MIS).Per study results provided by the company, spine and orthopedic surgeons receive lifetime occupational radiation limit within the first 10 years of their career. Statistics reveal that cancer rates and contraction of cataracts associated with radiation exposure are nearly double compared with other surgery practices.NuVasive claims that LessRay system’s proprietary image enhancement technology improves low-dose, low-radiation fluoroscopy images to derive similar diagnostic capabilities as those of conventional full-dose fluoroscopy. This will accordingly reduce radiation emission and exposure in the O.R. while retaining the high resolution of a full radiation dose shot.NuVasive considers this breakthrough an important milestone in healthcare facilities as it begins to sell capital equipment and brings in technology advancements to the hospital O.R. Apart from curbing radiation exposure, this LessRay system enhances imaging capability to improve spine surgery productivity and eventually, predictability.Taking into consideration the healthy pipeline of interests from customers, NuVasive expects a huge customer adoption rate following the launch of LessRay system.Notably, NuVasive is leaving no stone unturned to capture the rapidly-evolving spine market. During the recently-reported second quarter of 2017, the company’s core U.S. spinal hardware business maintained the bullish trend by reporting 3% growth. The upside was driven by a strong consistent adoption of ReLine posterior fixation system within the company’s iGA platform. The company also witnessed a steady uptake of its recently launched expandable interbody cages and base TI interfixated within the ALIF procedure.With the latest acquisition of Vertera Spine, NuVasive aims to market and distribute Vetera Spine’s FDA-approved COHERE Cervical and COALESCETM Lumbar Interbody fusion devices in the United States. This deal will also lend the company with a three-dimensional porous interbody technology across both polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium materials.Over the past three months, NuVasive has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has sunk 26% in contrast to the 1.6% gain of the broader industry during the period. We expect the company to bounce back with the slew of latest developments within Spine space.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

966,EW,"The iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF (JKH  -  Free Report) was launched on 06/28/2004, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $275.60 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap GrowthMid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability.Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. When you consider growth versus value, growth stocks are usually the clear winner in strong bull markets but tend to fall flat in nearly all other environments.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.40%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 31.70% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Servicenow Inc (NOW  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.56% of total assets, followed by Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW  -  Free Report) and Red Hat Inc (RHT  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 12.51% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskJKH seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Mid Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Morningstar Mid Growth Index measures the performance of stocks issued by mid-capitalization companies. The Morningstar index methodology defines mid-capitalization stocks as those stocks that form the 20% of market capitalization between the 70th and 90th percentile of the market capitalization of the stocks eligible to be included in the Morningstar US Market Index.The ETF return is roughly 8.97% so far this year and was up about 20.14% in the last one year (as of 06/26/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $180.53 and $226.72.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 14.49% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 213 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, JKH is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (IJK  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (IWP  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF has $8.06 B in assets, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF has $8.80 B.

967,EW,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past. Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry’s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.Here are a few major developments:Abolition of MedTech Tax The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.M&A Uptrend ContinuesApart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actelion.PBM-Health Insurers ConsolidationLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.Digital Revolution and MedTechLatest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.Trade War Fears Grip MedTechThe 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products, Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems.We rank all 250-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each.The Zacks Industry Rank is #70 (top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries) for Medical Info Systems, #84 (top 33%) for Medical - Dental Supplies, #108 (top 42%) for Medical - Instruments and #189 (bottom 26%) for Medical - Products. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it can be said that apart for certain medical product stocks, the near-term outlook for the aforementioned Medical device subsectors is overall positive.Price PerformanceThe price performance of two major Zacks categorized sub industries, are as follows:Over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.2%, the med instruments space has risen 3.6%. Some of the stocks within this space that have been trading above the S&P are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).While the Medical Product subsector’s industry rank indicated a bearish tone, the sector has increased 2.9% in this period. Some players from this space are Haemonetics Corp. (HAE  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report).Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

968,EW,"The FOMC is poised to raise the Fed funds target rate by a quarter point in about an hour. And this is with over 95% certainty as this morning's PPI inflation data came in hotter than expected.But what market players will be most focused on is the ""dot plot"" of the pace of future hikes. Will they show that two more rate increases are more likely this year?Or will they show that some committee members think the economic growth and inflation data warrant 3 more hikes?In the video that accompanies this article, I go over the market psychology of large investors and why any fear-driven stock market sell-off about the Fed's views should be seized as a buying opportunity.In addition to explaining the things that investors are worried about, like a flattening yield curve and rising inflation data, I give my 3 probability-weighted scenarios for the stock market's reaction.I also share some wisdom from one of my favorite economists, Brian Wesbury of First Trust.While I have been an astute Fed-watcher for a couple of decades, I'm leaning on Brian here to help us navigate what level of interest rates this economy can handle and still support expansion and investor optimism.I come away completely confident in my conclusion to buy whatever sell-off unfolds over the coming days, or weeks.And some of my favorite stock targets will be Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Centene (CNC  -  Free Report), and Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report), the latter two which have been making great new all-time highs this month.I may even add some more CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP  -  Free Report) as the fear about ""gene editing gone wrong"" gets over-done.Disclosure: I own BABA and LRCX shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio and CNC, EW, and CRSP for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.

969,EW,"Shares of Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) gained 7.4% to close at $34.32 on Jun 11, 2018, following a speculation that the company's rival Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) might consider a bid for acquiring the former. This news is per a Wall Street Journal report.Trading in both stocks was temporarily paused during Monday's session on the NYSE. Per yesterday’s close, Boston Scientific’s market cap was $47.5 billion as compared to Stryker's $63 billion.Following the above, a Reuters’ report stated that it is still unclear whether Boston Scientific is open to a potential buyout proposal by Stryker. The prospective acquirer too declined to comment on the report.Meanwhile, a Benzinga report wrote, “Any bid would have to surpass $40 per share, according to Stifel Nicolaus, and Wells Fargo predicted shares could be valued around $42, based on the Becton Dickinson-CR Bard deal, according to Bloomberg.”Previous BSX-Stryker AllianceSignificantly, this is not the first time that Stryker and Boston Scientific have come up for strategic collaborations. Back in 2010, the orthopaedic devices giant bought Boston Scientific’s Neurovascular unit for $1.5 billion. That time, the rationale behind this divestment decision by Boston Scientific came as part of the company’s aggressive restructuring initiatives. More specifically, the neurovascular division, one of the company’s non-core businesses, was struggling with depressed sales.Rationale Behind Latest Rumored DealWhile Boston Scientific’s position on the prospects of the possible sell-off rumor is still unknown, some analysts believe that the reason behind the company’s contemplation over a probable sell-off might lie in its interest to gain a further competitive edge in the medical device space.It is important to note that post the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report)-St. Jude Medical over the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needed to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.If the merger gets to materialize finally, considering both Boston Scientific and Stryker’s present market cap, then the consolidated entity will have a combined market cap of more than $110 billion. According to Wells Fargo Securities, this is a position only behind Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson in terms of total device revenues.Reacting to this widely speculated buyout bid, retired Twin Cities med-tech stock analyst Thom Gunderson said that it  “makes perfect sense to me. Go big or go home is the rule of the day.""The analysts seem optimistic about the alleged deal and believe that if it finally works out, Boston Scientific will score a vantage point in the fast-growing competitive heart valve replacement market where it is currently trailing behind Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report) and Medtronic.Also, this merger is expected to reduce costs for the combined company at a time when the healthcare industry is already battling against severe pricing pressure.Share Price ComparisonOver the past year, shares of Boston Scientific have rallied 22.9%, ahead of Stryker’s 20.3% increase. While the broader sector remained much below with a 2.2% rise.Both Boston Scientific and Stryker currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

971,EW,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on Mar 28.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.79%. It is noteworthy that Walgreens Boots has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.43%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsOver the recent past, we have observed Walgreens Boots’ Retail Pharmacy USA division to witness comparable prescription growth and benefit from strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market.Meanwhile, during first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company exceeded 1 billion scripts on a 30-day adjusted and rolling annual basis for the first time, touching a new milestone.Furthermore, the company’s efforts to boost its digital capabilities have started paying off. In this regard, more than 20% of the company’s retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels with the Walgreens' mobile app, having been downloaded in excess of 50 million times since the launch.We are also encouraged by the increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International segment. Furthermore, the company has been gaining on account of the company’s strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote Meanwhile, strong market growth in certain emerging markets drove the company’s Pharmaceutical Wholesale division’s solid performance in the first-quarter fiscal 2018. We expect these trends to get reflected in fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $31.99 billion reflects an 8.6% rise on a year-over-year basis.Also, we are upbeat about the company expanding its global footprint with its decision to acquire 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (GuoDa), a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On completion, this investment should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Notably, Shanghai-based GuoDa is a large national pharmacy chain in China. It is the retail pharmacy platform of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (""CNPGC"").Moreover, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell part of its investment in its Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for huge cash returns buoys optimism.We are also upbeat about Walgreens Boots’ plans to expand its existing group purchasing efforts with Express Scripts Holding Company, to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs. Since biosimilars have the potential to lower production costs, the move is considered to be a prudent and timely one.On the flip side, Walgreens Boots’ gross margin figures continued to contract in the last reported quarter as well. Lower pharmacy margins in the U.K., reflecting the reduction in funding, led to the downside. However, the company is working tirelessly to increase efficiency and provide high quality and cost-effective pharmacy services, in order to reduce overall pharmacy cost.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Walgreens Boots is +2.46%.

972,EW,"Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report) and Biocartis Group NV (BCART) signed an agreement to develop an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) version of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Scoretest on Biocartis' proprietary Idylla platform. This can be performed locally by laboratory partners as well as hospitals globally. Biocartis is an innovative molecular diagnostics company providing next generation diagnostic solutions.According to Genomic Health, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test evaluates the activity of 21 genes in a patient's breast tumor tissue. This provides customized treatment options based on the biology of the patients’ individual disease. The company claims this to be the only proven test to predict chemotherapy benefit. Consequently, this is included in all major cancer guidelines worldwide. Further, the test is considered standard of care for early-stage breast cancer.Biocartis' Idylla platform provides a unique solution that is unparalleled in the localization of complex molecular diagnostics. Based on the advanced features of the Idylla platform, Genomic Health expects local pathology labs to generate Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score results with minimal labor and efficient turnaround time. The company also looks forward to maintaining the high quality and clinical utility that physicians and patients expect from Oncotype DX.This agreement will provide Genomic Health rights to develop and commercialize Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test on the Idylla platform. The development of the Oncotype DX IVD test is expected to initiate in late 2017. Genomic Health is anticipated to pay around $3.3 million to Biocartis in the third quarter of 2017. Rest of the payments will be made to Biocartis after achieving few commercial milestones.Excluding the transaction cost of the partnership, Genomic Health continues to anticipate earning profits in full year 2017. Per the agreement, the company will make royalty payments based on net sales of the IVD tests developed on the Biocartis Idylla platform, post commercialization.In September, Genomic Health announced that new data shows additional evidence of the unmatched value of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Scoretest in predicting outcomes in early-stage breast cancer patients accurately.In July, majority of panelists from the St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference Expert Panel supported that Oncotype DX was the only test providing information that aided physicians in taking the decision to omit chemotherapy in patients with up to three positive nodes. The panel also published updated guidelines endorsing Oncotype DX for guiding chemotherapy treatment decisions in both node-negative and node-positive breast cancer patients.In June, five studies in breast cancer were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Annual Meeting, including new analyses from the tie ups with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results or SEER Registry program. The study focused on outcomes of more than 49,000 women who have received an Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test. One of these analyses examines the risk of breast cancer-specific mortality across the full range of Recurrence Score results and is consistent with previous validation studies.According to a report by GBI Research, the global breast cancer therapeutics market is estimated to reach $17.2 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 7.3%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest agreement is a strategical fit.In the past year, Genomic Health has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 11.9%, in comparison with the broader industry’s 2.6% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGenomic Health carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

973,EW,"On Aug 28, we issued an updated research report on Burlington, NC-based Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp. The company is a major player in healthcare diagnostics space, providing comprehensive clinical laboratory services and end-to-end drug development support.Last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has surged 10.6% as against the industry’s 1.2% loss during this period. Despite the continued dull performance within the company’s Covance drug development business, the market is upbeat about the Diagnostics business which has successfully demonstrated a solid show over the recent past.Although Covance Drug Development’s financial performance was down year over year in the recently reported second-quarter 2017, the company is currently on track to achieve its target of $100 million in cost synergies through the three-year period ending in 2017. It has also completed the remaining consolidation of central lab facilities in Europe and the United States.Notably, the company’s strategic focus on women’s health and reproductive genetics, besides the acquisition of Sequenom, a leader in non-invasive prenatal testing, has reenergized its larger genetic testing portfolio within Diagnostics. Also the market is looking forward to the long-standing strategic collaboration with 23andMe, which has already demonstrated an impressive growth trajectory, providing further strategic collaboration opportunities.On the flip side, an unfavorable foreign exchange remains a drag of late. The reduced guidance for 2017 also fails to indicate chances of any respite soon. There is also apprehension about a tough reimbursement scenario which the company is already facing to some degree.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

974,EW,"On Aug 25, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report).Medtronic exited the fiscal first quarter on a mixed note, with earnings exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Over the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the broader industry. The company has witnessed a decline in its share price since the release of quarterly results. Per the last share price movement, the company has lost 6.2%, as against the broader industry’s 0.8% gain over the last three months.Moreover, escalating costs and expenses are weighing on margins. Also, unfavorable foreign exchange continues to remain a drag.On a positive note, apart from displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets, Medtronic’s major business groups continue to contribute to top-line growth which highlighted sustainability across all segments and geographies. Recently, the company announced the receipt of CE Mark for Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead. We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend, continuing in the United States as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Moreover, a consistent and gradually stabilizing movement in the global Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market can be observed. This should improve further in the coming quarters.We are also looking forward to Medtronic to receive $6 billion in cash for the Patient Monitoring & Recovery (PMR) division divestment, which will strengthen the company’s position to make further developmental investments..Meanwhile, post the Covidien acquisition, the consolidated company has so far successfully demonstrated strong segmental performance, reflecting successful integration and achievement of synergy targets.This apart, we note that despite facing severe macroeconomic pressure, Medtronic saw 12% growth in the emerging markets in the last reported quarter which contributed nearly 14% to the company’s overall revenues. Despite strong growth, the figure was in line with the company’s double-digit growth projections for the long term.The company is currently resorting to all possible means to boost growth. This includes penetrating the emerging markets, expansion of portfolio and restructuring of initiatives. These should benefit Medtronic over the long term. We are also encouraged by its foray into the rapidly growing transcatheter mitral valve replacement market through its $458-million acquisition of California-based medical device start-up Twelve, Inc.At present, Medtronic carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

975,EW,"On Aug 28, we issued an updated research report on PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). Operating as 1-800-PetMeds, the company is a leading nationwide pet pharmacy. PetMed currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Over the last six months, PetMed has been trading above the broader industry. Per the last trading price, the company has gained a stupendous 69.3% when compared to the 27.6% gain of the broader industry.PetMed posted better-than-expected results in the first quarter, marking a solid start to fiscal 2018. We are encouraged by the significant increase in reorder sales and new order sales in the quarter as well.We expect the company’s impressive first-quarter performance to maintain the momentum. PetMed is striving to implement several strategies to revitalize its top line. These include focusing on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items, while also expanding product offerings. However, we are apprehensive about the escalating advertising expenses incurred in the quarter.The company markets its products primarily under well-known brands of medication such as Frontline Plus, K9 Advantix, Advantage, Heartgard Plus, Sentinel and Interceptor, among others.On the flip side, PetMed operates in a highly competitive and fragmented pet medications market. The competitors include veterinarians, traditional retailers, other mail-order and online retailers of pet medications and other health products. Also, the acquisition of Novartis’ animal health division by Eli Lilly and Company has given rise to more challenges for PetMed.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

976,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) has announced that its computed tomography imaging (within the PARTNER 3 trial of the SAPIEN 3 valve) sub-study has recently completed enrollment.Notably, this sub-study is evaluating the leaflet mobility of both SAPIEN 3 and surgical heart valves in patients, who are at low risk and experiencing valve replacement for treating severe aortic stenosis. Data from the main PARTNER 3 study will be presented at ACC 2019. Notably, the company expects an FDA approval for the indication late in 2019.Per management, Edwards Lifesciences is studying the SAPIEN 3 Ultra System (featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology) as part of a single-arm multi-center trial of up to 30 intermediate-risk patients. The company now anticipates the system’s launch in late 2018 across both Europe and the United States. It also announced that the updated timing for the European launch of the system does not change the 2018 sales guidance, pegged at the high end of the projected $3.5-$3.9 billion range.Market PotentialPer a report by Zion Market Research, the global heart valve devices market is estimated to be worth $10.35 billion by the end of 2022 at a CAGR of around 13% between 2017 and 2022. A very noteworthy player in this niche is Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report).THV in FocusBasically, SAPIEN 3 is an artificial valve, which falls under Edwards Lifesciences’ Transcatheter Heart Valves (THV) segment. The THV segment includes technologies designed to treat heart valve diseases using catheter-based approaches, opposed to open surgical techniques. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported 20.2% of THV sales growth over the prior-year quarter’s tally. In the United States, THV increased 22.3% year over year, attributable to an excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well as a continued strong therapy implementation across all regions. Outside the United States, the underlying growth rate was 22% with contributions from all regions. The company continues to see a strong TAVR therapy adoption in Japan, driven by SAPIEN 3.Buoyed by the previous quarter’s strong performance, Edwards Lifesciences now predicts full-year THV sales growth rate at the high end of the 11-15% guided range. Also, per management, THV boasts the highest margin business.Of late, Edward Lifesciences has witnessed multiple developments in its THV segment. Good news is that the company has recently received a CE Mark for its self-expanding CENTERA.Also, management released positive patient outcomes on SAPIEN 3 valve including high survival rates and low rates of stroke and paravalvular leak.Share Price & Estimate Revision TrendEdwards has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

This reimbursement will entitle patients to access the therapy through the country's health insurance plans.  Per the company, mitral regurgitation is a serious, progressive heart disease in which the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backward into the heart.The MitraClip system is approved in Japan for the treatment of both severe degenerative mitral regurgitation (""DMR"") and functional mitral regurgitation (""FMR"") heart diseases.A Glimpse of the Structural Heart BusinessAbbott’s Medical Device segment presently comprises the new Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Vascular businesses along with the Diabetes Care business.Sales improvement at this segment was driven by double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care in the last quarter.Notably, the Structural Heart business accounted for 9.3% of total revenues in the Medical devices segment. The upside was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip. We believe the latest development will boost the company’s top line.Recently, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the world’s smallest rotatable, bileaflet mechanical heart valve — Masters HP 15mm. With the approval, the company has expanded the Masters Series portfolio under the Structural Heart business.Market ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, Tanscatheter Mitral Valve Repair & Replacement Market is estimated to worth $1,878 million (both repair and replacement valves) by 2023, at a CAGR of 30% from 2017 to 2023.

978,EW,"The U.S. Medical Device industry has been riding high on optimism, courtesy of the Senate’s latest decision to postpone an industry-wide excise tax for another two years, known as the ‘Medical Device’ tax.Notably, the tax will be effective from on Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on employer insurance, until 2022.The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor’s optimism in them.The Medical-Device Tax “This is a tax on innovation, a tax on jobs and a tax on the health and well-being of millions of American patients.” – Scott Whitaker, president and CEO of the Advanced Medical Technology Association.The Medical-Device taxes were originally implemented in 2013 as part of the Obamacare. The taxes imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, reducing the research and development (R&D) prospects.Considering the headwinds, the senate placed a temporary suspension on these taxes from January 2016 to December 2017. Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax resulted in around 83% rise in R&D investments by MedTech players.However, the taxes were again brought back on Jan 1, 2018. But on Jan 22, the Fed came with its new law of respite with a $31-billion bill of tax cuts.Why is the MedTech Fraternity Happy? Revamps R&D StatureMedTech companies will now be able to reinvest profits (tax savings) and enhance the R&D stature, launch new products, reduce capital depreciation, invest in early stage med-tech companies, execute clinical trials and ‘fuel the next generation of life-changing technologies for patients.’A report by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation suggests that big shots like Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) expressed concern in an email statement regarding lesser investments in innovative projects with leading medical facilities if the taxes were back. EmploymentThe tax repeal is likely to reinforce domestic production, increase hiring of skilled professionals and lower the nation’s overdependence on offshore productions. Reports suggest that a complete repeal could generate more than 53,000 jobs very soon and increase wages.Per a report by Modern Healthcare, reports suggest that 28,000 jobs were lost nationally in three years in which the tax was in effect. If the taxes were reestablished, the nation might have suffered cumulative loss of 25,000 jobs by 2021.Let’s take a quick look on three major MedTech companies that are going to make the best out of the recent Tax-Repeal upheaval.3 Stocks to Ride High on the TrendsThere are hardly any evidences of MedTech companies witnessing strong R&D growth and margin expansion because of the tax-repeal in 2016. However, the market expects the recent tax-repeal to have a favorable impact on R&D and margin in the upcoming quarters. If that happens, the following three companies would be the leading ones.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks. To shortlist the stocks from the vast universe of medical devices, we have picked the ones that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Surmodics, Inc. (SRDX  -  Free Report): The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1. In the past year, the stock has returned 39.1%, higher than the industry’s return of 16.9%.Surmodics’ efforts to improve research and development stature have been a key growth driver. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee DCB (Drug Coated Balloon) program deserve a mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 DCB balloon platformIn the non-drug delivery R&D pipeline, Surmodics received the FDA clearance for its Telemark support microcatheter. The Telemark support microcatheter offers superior crossability for complex coronary and peripheral lesions. This microcatheter combined Surmodics' extreme composite shaft technology with a high performance pristine hydrophilic coating, that together provide exceptional deliverability, kink resistance and complex lesion crossing.First quarter of fiscal 2018, R&D expenses were 46% of net sales, up from 33.6% of net sales in the year-ago quarter. Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report): The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. In the past year, the stock has returned 49.1%, higher than the industry’s return of 24.7%In December 2017, Edwards Lifesciences announced a strategic framework. The outlook indicates the company’s long-term growth strategy and recent progress in technology pipeline. In THV (Transcatheter Heart Valves), Edwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership in the global TAVR market through increased focus on expanding patient access.On the margin front, the company anticipates moderate expansion in gross margin on an improving mix, partially offset by capacity investments. More specifically, in terms of capacity investments, heavy investments are going into facilities and expanding the capacity in the United States and outside. Edwards Lifesciences also expects the global TAVR opportunity to exceed $5 billion by 2021. Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report):The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1. In the past year, the stock has returned 57.7%, higher than its industry’s return of 15%Continued momentums in new business generation and geographical expansion have helped the company deliver strong results in the quarter. The company’s strong cash position boosts investors’ confidence. The expansion in gross and operating margin buoys optimism. The raised fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings guidance is also impressive. The ParadoxNot to forget, the brunt of this tax relief is huge!A report published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the two-year suspension will cost the federal government about $3.7 billion during that period and $310 billion to federal-budget deficits over the next decade.Notably, the federal budget deficit reached $228 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal, $18 billion more than the deficit in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.However, Republicans spurned these concerns with the belief that tax cuts will drive faster growth and national prosperity.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks’ has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

982,EW,"On Aug 24, we issued an updated research report on Austin, TX-based Luminex Corp (LMNX  -  Free Report) – a manufacturer and marketer of proprietary biological testing technologies with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industry. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Luminex’s second quarter saw strong top-line performance, solid cash flow and soaring profits. The company’s Assay business is likely to be its key growth driver over the long term. Luminex reported earnings of 26 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017. Revenues in the quarter increased almost 19.2% year over year.Although the company reiterated its 2017 annual revenue guidance, it has projected third-quarter 2017 revenues in the range of $73 million and $75 million, down from the previously issued band of $74 million to $76 million. Luminex expects revenues at the segment to be impacted by funding challenges related to a multi-year bulk bead contract from a life science customer.The company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front in the second quarter. In this regard, the recent CE-IVD mark for the ARIES Norovirus Assay, the FDA approval of ARIES C. difficile Assay and the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan are noteworthy. Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review.The company has a broad product portfolio that comprises the advanced xMAP, xTAG and MultiCode technology. Moreover, Luminex has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should help expand the use of its products/technology. In this regard, we note that Luminex had earlier announced the signing of a new supply and distribution agreement with Bio-Techne Corp. (TECH), through 2020. Luminex also entered a similar deal with Affymetrix (AFFX). Under the terms of the agreement, eBioscience, a business division of Affymetrix, will commercialize MAGPIX, Luminex 200 and FLEXMAP 3D multiplexed assay platforms in select countries of the Americas, Asia and Europe.On the flipside, reimbursement landscape and cutthroat competition continue to be major challenges. Also, the share price movement of Luminex has been unfavorable over the last one year. Notably, the stock lost 10.9%, as against the broader industry’s gain of roughly 3.8%. Further, Luminex’s stock looks a little overvalued at the moment. A comparative analysis of the company’s P/E (TTM basis) multiple reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause of investor concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLuminex sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

983,EW,"On Apr 3, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). While we are encouraged by the global acceptance of the company’s advanced therapies, its escalating costs and expenses raise concerns. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).On a positive note, we are upbeat about Medtronic’s recently-launched restructuring initiative called Enterprise Excellence plan, aimed at $3-billion annual growth run rate savings by the end of fiscal 2022. Per the company, this new program has been designed to increase its effectiveness and growth-related reinvestment ability along with a consistent boost to margin expansion and driving the EPS leverage.Also, a gradually stabilizing movement witnessed in the global Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market bodes well for further improvement in the coming quarters.Medtronic PLC Price Medtronic PLC Price | Medtronic PLC Quote Meanwhile, at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2018, Medtronic noted that it has successfully met its $850 million Covidien synergy commitments in time. Significantly, this comes under one of the company’s four priorities, which is, ‘optimize’. Per this commitment, Medtronic has started to deliver $225-$250 million in cost synergies and $850 million in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2018.On the flip side, shares of Medtronic have underperformed the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has lost 8% versus the broader industry’s 2.5% gain.The company has been exposed to escalating costs and expenses, weighing heavily on its margins.

984,EW,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has made an extension to its Invisalign clear aligner range with the latest launch of Vivera Retainers with Precision Bite Ramps. This is claimed to be the first-of-its retainers in the market, which can be customized to provide additional support after a deep bite correction.Notably, Vivera retainer is made with the same state-of-the-art technology as Invisalign aligners. It employs 3-D digital imaging, proprietary clear thermoplastic material and advanced fabrication technology for a stronger retention with a precise, comfortable fit.Per Align, Precision Bite Ramps were first introduced in 2014 and are designed to disocclude the posterior teeth or “open the bite”. This improves efficiency in deep bite Invisalign treatments. Since Precision Bite Ramps are part of Invisalign G5, its integration with Vivera Retainers is expected to bring greater clinical success for Align in the orthodontic space.With deep bite malocclusion gradually becoming a very common orthodontic occurrence worldwide, we consider this development a major breakthrough for Align with respect to customer adoption. The rate of deep bite malocclusion cases is mostly high in North America and EMEA, registering 45% of patients from those regions.According to statistics provided by Align, till date, more than 688,000 moderate or severe deep bite patients (including over 185,000 teenagers) have been treated with Invisalign clear aligners. Patient data also showed that doctors are increasingly fixing severe deep bites with Invisalign G5 Precision Bite Ramps.It is important to note that Align has recently undertaken several strategies to improve adoption of Invisalign Technology globally including product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, expansion of the Invisalign Technology brand and driving international growth. In a parallel press release today, the company has introduced an expanded Invisalign product portfolio offering new options and greater flexibility to a wider range of patients. Earlier, the company had introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC. These are indicative of the growing popularity of Align’s dental products in the international market. Over the long term, we expect G6, G7 and similar innovations to act as major catalysts for Align in the new as well as the existing markets. Over the past six months, shares of Align have outperformed its industry. The stock has surged 33.1% compared with the 2.1% increase of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlign carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

985,EW,"Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of FDA Pre-Market Approval (PMA) for its Impella CPheart pump with SmartAssist, featuring an optical sensor. This will broaden the portfolio of its flagship, Impella heart pumps. The company plans a controlled roll-out of the technologically-advanced heart pump at hospital sites, with developed heart recovery protocols over the next fiscal year.What is PMA?Per FDA, special medical devices with a ‘Class III’ tag require a PMA nod for the availability in the markets. Notably, these Class III devices have an extremely high level of risks associated with its usage. Consequently, general regulatory approvals, alone, can’t assure the safety and effectiveness of these devices.Abiomed’s Impella CP heart pump is a Class III medical device.The data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA included over 60 engineering reports and comprehensive technical specifications. Per the company, the clinical data informatics has been verified on 38 patients on the Abiomed Impella Controller at two hospitals in the United States.Notably, the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP are the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support devices that the FDA has approved as safe and effective for High Risk PCI. Furthermore, Impella CP with SmartAssist also boasts a CE Mark approval and has already been used for treating over 60 patients at three sites.Impella Product Line: A Major Growth DriverAbiomed’s main product line -- Impella -- comprises Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP. This flagship product line continued to be growth catalyst, reflecting stellar performance in the last reported quarter as well.Expanding the Impella portfolio, the company recently announced that Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart-pumps have received PMA from the FDA for expanded use. With this, the products will now be used during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Notably, it was the second PMA in a row for the devices, which was earlier granted by the FDA to treat heart failures associated with cardiomyopathy, leading to cardiogenic shock.We encouragingly note that, in the last reported quarter, the installed customer base for Impella CP heart pumps grew by 41 new U.S. hospitals, taking the total number of Impella CP sites to 1,134.

986,EW,"On Mar 29, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report).We are currently looking forward to the company’s modified Rite Aid contract, expected to benefit the company in the long run. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Walgreens Boots have outperformed the industry. The stock has lost 6.9%, narrower than the industry’s 11.1% decline. We note that the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, having grossed highest sales in the last eight quarters.We are encouraged by the company’s consistent sales increase in the Retail Pharmacy International business. Moreover, Walgreens Boots has been gaining traction from a slew of strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about the company’s alliance with Express Scripts, via which, both companies aim to expand respective existing group purchasing efforts. This latest pact is expected to improve Express Scripts’ supply chain and make medicines including biosimilars affordable and accessible to patients.The above positives apart, Walgreens Boots’ decision to buy a 40% stake in China’s Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores looks promising as that should provide a strong impetus to the company’s worldwide retail pharmacy business. The limited number of Rite Aid stores’ acquisition also impresses us for which, the company has recently secured a regulatory approval.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to reap from its growth initiatives, major mass merchants are already advancing with boost in pharmacy businesses and a fair market share.Notably, a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Also, an escalated reimbursement pressure and a generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

987,EW,"On Aug 25, we issued an updated research report on Cincinnati, OH-based Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report). The company currently operates two wholly-owned subsidiaries — VITAS Healthcare and Roto-Rooter.Over the last six months, Chemed has been trading above the broader industry in terms of price. The stock has gained 5.6%, higher than the industry’s loss of 8.6%. This improvement in average net Medicare reimbursement rate and increase in average daily census during the recently reported second quarter were encouraging. The raised outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and earnings per share is indicative of the company anticipating improved operating results in the upcoming quarters. This boosts investors’ optimism on the stock.Notably, Chemed’s VITAS business had been in trouble over the past few quarters due to certain admission coding changes initiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). However, management noted the recent admission trends to be positive and that should continue in the coming quarters as well.Chemed Corp. Price and Consensus Chemed Corp. Price and Consensus | Chemed Corp. QuoteDuring second-quarter 2017, VITAS performed well, both financially and operationally, surpassing the company’s expectations. The business experienced 2.1% net revenue growth when compared to the prior-year quarter. VITAS also generated admissions growth of 0.81% in the quarter.In terms of Roto- Rooter business, it displayed a robust performance in core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments during second-quarter 2017, as well as prompted a solid rise in water restoration. Management increased expectations to achieve Roto-Rooter full-year 2017 revenue growth of 12-13%, higher than the earlier expected range of 3-4%. Revenue estimates are based on increased job pricing of approximately 2% and continued growth in water restoration services.However, headwinds like reimbursement related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges for Chemed.  Also, a tweaked guidance for Medicare Cap billing limitations is a matter of concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksChemed currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report).

In this regard, the acquisition of FEI, which has already started generating synergies and contributing largely to the company’s analytical instruments portfolio, has in turn boosted market optimism about the stock. Moreover, we are looking forward to the company’s latest Patheon buyout through which Thermo Fisher forayed into the high-potential contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) space.Solid Prospects in High-Potential Emerging Markets: The Massachusetts -based, medical instruments manufacturer plans to continue to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, such as China and India, and to translate this success to other high-priority opportunities in regions such as South Korea, Russia and Brazil.

We are also upbeat about the company recently opening a Center of Excellence for electron microscopy in Saudi Arabia.Earnings per Share Growth: Thermo Fisher has recorded an earnings growth rate of 14.2% over the last three to five years compared with 5.8% for the S&P 500 index.Further, this earnings momentum is likely to continue in the long term (three to five years) as reflected by the company’s projected earnings per share growth rate of 11.7% compared with 9.9% for the S&P 500 index.Superior Return on Equity: Thermo Fisher has a return on equity of 15.2% compared with the industry average of 0.2%.

990,EW,"On Sep 6, we issued an updated research report on Pleasanton, CA-based The Cooper Companies (COO  -  Free Report).Shares of Cooper have outperformed the industry year to date. The shares of the company have increased 37.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 15.3%.Additionally, the company’s earnings estimates have moved north in the current year, reflecting analyst optimism. Over the past month, current and next quarter earnings estimates have increased 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively. Moreover, Cooper reported earnings which have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 4.8%.The company’s leading position in the market of specialty lenses was also supported by highly exclusive products of Biofinity and Clariti. In fact, its flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the coming quarters. The company has also initiated the process of introducing MyDay lenses in the domestic market. It is already available in Europe and has gained significant traction within a short span of time. Clariti lenses hold significant growth prospects for the company.The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. A fall in dropout rate of contact lens users and further market penetration, especially in developing nations, is expected with continuous improvisation in the technology. Growth in international markets is something that contact lens manufacturers are banking on. Furthermore, user preferences are shifting from low-feature commodity lenses to expensive single-use and specialty lenses such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses (silicone hydrogels).We believe that Cooper is well positioned to address this shift in customer preferences based on its expansive product portfolio. The company recently introduced Biofinity Energys’ contact lenses, which is targeted at group of users who frequently complain about the discomfort arising from prolonged usage of smartphones, tablets, laptops, in-car displays and other devices. The company is a leader in the high-margin toric lens market. It offers multiple designs of toric lenses across a wide range of parameters, unlike some of its competitors, who offer the same lenses in limited designs. This is expected to further boost the company’s top-line growth going forward.On the flip side, macroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending. Also given its significant international presence, Cooper remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCooper carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

Per the agreement, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available under Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. This will boost the iTero scanner customer base to a considerable extent.Further, in June, Align Technology had announced its inclusion in the esteemed S&P 500 Index, which boosted investors’ confidence in the stock considerably.We are also encouraged by Align Technology’s solid second-quarter 2017 performance with year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues. The company’s encouraging InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and international regions also raise hopes.

992,EW,"On Sep 5, 2017, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report).Over the past three months, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry on several issues. The stock has improved 2.3% compared with the broader industry’s 5.4% gain during the period.While adverse foreign exchange continues to pose challenges, we are concerned with the company’s recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. It is important to note that last quarter, foreign exchange headwind affected the company’s top line by $23 million and adjusted gross margin by 50 basis points. Also, a dull defibrillator sale within core Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) continues to remain a drag for overall growth. The woes of challenging economy and competitive landscape persistently burden the stock.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus  Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteHowever, given the company’s bullish second-quarter 2017 results and several recent developments, we find quite a few positive factors to rely on. The company is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest more in global markets.Among the recent upsides, worth mentioning is the company’s acquisition of Symetis, in a bid to fortify its European structural heart business. We are also encouraged with the company securing multiple product approvals both in domestic and overseas markets. Notably, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of ICD and CRT-D systems.Additionally, the market holds optimism on the stock, following the company’s recent release of an outline on sustained growth strategy, focusing on planned expansion in new markets and consolidating product lines across all business segments.

The launch is aimed at solidifying the company’s footprint in the rapidly growing hereditary cancer testing market. Based in Salt Lake City, UT, this leading molecular diagnostics and personalized medicines provider intends to make riskScore a precision medical tool for patients who use myRisk to get their tests done.Notably, riskScore helps determine a woman's risk of developing breast cancer by combining genetic markers throughout the genome with the patient’s family and clinical history.Per management, this highly advanced prediction tool will also aid 90% of the patients with negative results for heredity cancer genes to derive proper conclusions.In June, the company had presented encouraging data from a 2,000-patient clinical study with myRisk Hereditary Cancer testsat the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The results highlighted the importance of the multi-gene panel testing for advancement of the hereditary cancer-risk evaluation platform. Per management, around 50% of the identified mutations were found in patients who did not comply with the testing guidelines. The study also found 34% of identified mutations in unexpected genes.Myriad Genetics has been riding high on strength in the Heriditary Cancer testing space. In the last reported quarter, the company saw 6% year-over-year rise in Heriditary Cancer testing volumes, marking the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth.Per a report by DPI Research on Medium, the breast cancer screening market in the United States is expected to reach a value of roughly $5.8 billion by 2022.

They also project 63,410 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer this year as well.We believe an ageing population, rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the breast cancer screening market. However, this market is dominated by many well established players, Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one. In this space, Quest Diagnostics’ Quest Vantage services help in the discovery of genetic variants related to the hereditary risk of 15 types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, pancreatic and renal.Moreover, Myriad Genetics has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

994,EW,"On Mar 27, 2018, we issued an updated research report on ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company achieved strong global revenue growth over the past few quarters on the back of robust sales of sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems and software solutions. Also, synergies drawn from Brightree’s acquisition have acted as a significant contributor to ResMed’s operating results through 2017.We expect the company’s product launches and strategies to gain traction in the sleep-disordered breathing market and further boost its near-term performance.

996,EW,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of national reimbursement for the FreeStyleLibre glucose monitoring system from National Health Service (NHS) Business Services Authority in the U.K. Notably, this was a major breakthrough in its diabetics business.The development has widened this Illinois-based medical device major’s customer base in diabetes management. Beginning Nov 1, Abbott’s flagship glucose monitoring system will be available for reimbursement through the NHS across England and Wales, NHS Scotland, and the Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland.Per Abbott, the grant of reimbursement will also make FreeStyleLibre system widely available to around 3.5 million people in the U.K.who are diagnosed with diabetes. Also, management expects that there may be roughly 549,000 people in the U.K.who have diabetes but are yet to be diagnosed.This reimbursement approval in U.K. marks another milestone where Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 17 countries, including France, Germany and Japan. Notably, FreeStyle Libre system is presently under review by the FDA and awaits approval in the United States.Meanwhile, Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in Japan.Moreover, the company recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the U.K., Japanese and Canadian developments, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.This apart, in July, the company partnered with Bigfoot Biomedical to solidify its footprint in the rapidly growing diabetes therapeutics market.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%.Considering the market potential and Abbott’s slew of latest developments in the diabetes care segment, the recent national reimbursement grant in U.K. will accelerate the top line.However, the diabetes market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Share Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

997,EW,"DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) subsidiary — DaVita Medical Group — recently announced the receipt of the Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The award has been conferred on DaVita’s CA-based facility, also known as Casa PacifiCA building.Notably, the LEED Gold certification is exclusively granted to buildings situated in sustainable sites with strong water, energy, atmosphere, materials and resource efficiencies. Additionally, these buildings should operate under a superior indoor environment and must show innovation in design and regional priority credits. Undoubtedly, DaVita’s Casa PacifiCA building is a solid choice based on the aforementioned criteria.In an initiative to bolster DaVita’s 2020 environmental goals, the company’s operations are conducted in a healthy environment and DaVita is solely committed to improve health care in the United States without violating the basic environmental norms. In this regard, 75% of Casa PacifiCA’s construction waste was diverted from landfills.Shares Lack LusterDaVita has had an unfavorable run on the bourse in the last six months. The stock has lost almost 13.4%, much wider than the broader industry’s decline of just 4.5%. The current level also substantially underperforms the S&P 500’s gain of roughly 4.8%. This deterioration is largely due to the ongoing political conundrum in the U.S. medical world that had initiated since the Presidential elections. High debt levels, adverse effects of healthcare reforms and escalating expenses are other major stock dampeners. Favorable Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend has been favorable for the company. In the current quarter, two estimates moved north compared with two movements in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the ongoing quarter has inched up 1.1% to 94 cents per share during the same time frame. DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the full year, six estimates moved upward compared with two downward movements. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year has increased 1.4% to $3.54 per share over the same period.Our TakeDaVita’s environment-friendly operations are likely to enhance the company’s sustainable growth in the long haul. In fact, DaVita’s Denver-based headquarters were awarded with the LEED Platinum Certification by the USGBC for operations and maintenance efficiencies only last year.Davita’s significant growth in recent times was reflected on the back of strong patient services. Last quarter the company saw solid improvement in Kidney care. DaVita also made crucial efforts to control expenses. The company’s strength basically lies in enhanced service offerings. A compelling inorganic growth story supported by a strong financial position is the key development catalyst at the moment.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

998,EW,"Fresenius Medical Care (FMS  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of its regional manufacturing plant in Bandar Enstek, Malaysia. The plant is a state-of-the-art facility and will be Fresenius Medical's regional manufacturing hub for Southeast Asia. In addition to supplying high-quality haemodialysis concentrates and disinfectants, the plant also produces Peritoneal Dialysis (“PD”) products necessary for advanced Continuous Ambulatory PD (“CAPD”) treatment.PD is a form of dialysis that uses the natural lining of the patient's abdomen to filter waste from the blood. We feel that the plant would expand its presence in the fast-growing market. With about 43,000 dialysis patients in Malaysia the market has ample scope for growth. The plant in Bandar Enstek is the second plant of Fresenius Medical in Malaysia. At Ipoh, the company produces Water Treatment Systems to ensure high-quality water essential for dialysis. We anticipate that the latest development will help the company counter the pressure on margins.Per management, the latest development is a significant step to boost the company’s long-term goal. Fresenius Medical has set up a strong long-term objective – ‘Growth-Strategy 2020’ – to formulate a few initiatives for attaining solid market traction.Per the postulates of ‘Growth-Strategy 2020’, Fresenius aims to boost its revenues to $28 billion by 2020, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of around 10% by enhancing its core business and the Care Coordination unit.For full-year 2017, Fresenius Medical estimates revenue growth of 8-10% at cc. Net income attributable to shareholders of the company is likely to increase around 7-9%.Meanwhile, the stock represents a solid return of 13.4%, comparing favorably with the industry’s gain of just 9.6% over the last six months. Furthermore, Fresenius Medical promises a long-term expected earnings growth rate of almost 10.1%. This indicates chances of outperformance over the long haul.Our TakeFresenius Medical provides a wide range of Dialysis products in its own dialysis clinics and to third-party clinics. The company offers a wide array of Hemodyalisis, Peritoneal dialysis and Acute Dialysis products as well. However, the latest development is expected to fortify the company’s foothold in the Home dialysis market, particularly in the renal care space.

1000,EW,"On Sep 11, we issued an updated research report on IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), a leading molecular diagnostic company. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).It is encouraging to note that IDEXX continues to demonstrate solid global growth on potent international expansion. International revenues in the last-reported second quarter of 2017 grew in high single digits, driven by an 11% organic rise in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues and 12.3% gains in Water business. This indicated continued consumable revenue gains supported by a strong Catalyst instrument customer base and average testing utilization.IDEXX derives the lion’s share of revenues from its Companion Animal Group segment (CAG). In the second quarter, CAG organic revenues rose low double digits on a year-over-year basis, supported by CAG Diagnostics recurring organic as well as CAG instrument revenue growth. We believe management’s innovation-based global strategy is leading to growth in CAG Diagnostics.Also, IDEXX recently announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technological applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flipside, over the last six months, IDEXX has been trading below the broader industry with respect to share price movement. The stock has rallied 5.1% over this period in comparison to 11.7% gain of the broader industry. IDEXX’s high dependence on third-party distributors and intense competition continue to pose threats. Moreover, with growing international expansion, the company's Companion Animal Diagnostics business is likely to suffer from adverse currency fluctuations. A competitive landscape in the overseas market weighs on the company as well. Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

1002,EW,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is EW due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsEdwards Lifesciences’ first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.22 while reported EPS was 96 cents.The adjusted EPS figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 by 10.9%. Moreover, adjusted earnings improved 29.8% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the transcatheter heart valves business.Sales DetailsFirst-quarter sales improved 1.3% to $894.8 million but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $930.2 million by 3.8%. Underlying sales increased 9.3% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in the nation chose to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by Critical Care product line.Segmental DetailsIn the first quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $551.6 million, reflecting 2.3% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the United States, THVT procedures grew in mid-teens year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well as continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter totaled $179.5 million, down 10% from the prior-year quarter. This includes a sales return reserve for conversion to a consignment inventory model. However, Edwards Lifesciences continued to witness solid uptake of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system along with strong demand for the latest INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in the United States. Further, the company’s latest products drove underlying sales growth at a rate which surpassed the total procedure growth rate. Critical Care sales were $163.7 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 13% from first-quarter 2017. The upside can be attributed to solid growth across all product categories, largely led by HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform  along with solid growth in the United States and the Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the first quarter, gross margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 73.9% owing to adverse currency movements and continued operational investments. However, this was partially offset by more profitable product mix led by growing sales of transcatheter valves.SG&A expenses rose 11.5% year over year to $256 million on account of sales and personnel-related expenses, as well as strengthening of euro in comparison with the dollar. R&D expenditures increased 11.3% year over year to $143.2 million owing to continued investments in the transcatheter aortic valve and mitral valve program along with expenditures on clinical trials. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 570 bps to 29.3%.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.50 billion compared with $1.34 billion at the end of 2017. Long-term debt in the reported quarter totaled $456 million versus $438.4 million at 2017-end.Cash flow from operating activities was $151.3 million in the first quarter. Excluding capital spending of $43.2 million, free cash flow was $108.1 million. During the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding totaled 215.1 million.2018 Guidance RaisedEdwards Lifesciences raised its 2018 adjusted EPS expectations to $4.50-$4.70 from the previous $4.43–$4.63. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $4.52, near the low end of the company’s guided range.However, the company continues to maintain sales expectations at the high end of the previously projected range of $3.5-$3.9 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is $3.85 billion, within the guided range.For the second quarter of 2018, the company projects sales between $950 million and $1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $964.6 million, within the company’s estimated range. The company forecasts adjusted EPS between $1.05 and $1.15. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is $1.16, which is above the company‘s forecasted range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.42%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 31.50% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Red Hat Inc (RHT  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.51% of total assets, followed by Servicenow Inc (NOW  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 12.59% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskJKH seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Mid Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Morningstar Mid Growth Index measures the performance of stocks issued by mid-capitalization companies. The Morningstar index methodology defines mid-capitalization stocks as those stocks that form the 20% of market capitalization between the 70th and 90th percentile of the market capitalization of the stocks eligible to be included in the Morningstar US Market Index.The ETF return is roughly 4.79% so far this year and was up about 18.99% in the last one year (as of 05/10/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $176.62 and $218.58.The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 14.44% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 213 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JKH is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (IJK  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (IWP  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF has $7.91 B in assets, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF has $8.67 B. IJK has an expense ratio of 0.25% and IWP charges 0.25%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

1004,EW,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on leading molecular diagnostic company, Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the last six months, Amedisys has gained 3.1% against the industry’s 5.2% decline. The company’s impressive results in second-quarter 2017 with both earnings and revenues significantly improving year over year have bolstered market confidence leading to a further rally in share price.We are encouraged by the company’s long-term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to a one focused on bringing home a continuum of care to serve patients better and diversify sources of payment and become less reliant on Medicare. Moreover, the company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on synergies from acquisitions. The company recently made a number of strategic acquisitions — the recent one being that of Intercity Home Carein Massachusetts which is slated for close on Oct 1.The home health industry is poised for substantial growth in the long term, driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States. The company is expected to continue to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment. Notably, the company is on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. Recently, it announced the completion of National Readmission Prevention Collaborative (‘’NRPC’’) certification program by clinical programs team which handles home healthcare programs.Additionally, the company’s strong cash balance position bolsters our confidence in the stock.On the flip side, we expect synergies from the Tenet Healthcare acquisition may escalate costs and operating expenses weighing on the company’s margins. Also, an intense competitive landscape and regulatory concerns continue to pose challenges in the home health and hospice industry.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

1005,EW,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Aortic & Peripheral Vascular (APV) business. The company recently announced the receipt of regulatory approval for IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”).Medtronic’s IN.PACT Admiral DCB gained approval for treating peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the upper leg, - particularly thigh (superficial femoral arteries and behind the knee (popliteal arteries). However, before the commercial launch of the product, Medtronic has to collaborate with Japanese MHLW to attain reimbursement approval. The company believes that reimbursement approval will widen the global customer base for IN.PACT Admiral DCB.The Japanese regulatory approval was granted to IN.PACT Admiral DCB on the grounds of successful results from the IN.PACT SFA Japan Trial. This development is in line with the company’s strategy to focus on research and development of high-end medical device products within its core business lines.We note that the IN.PACT Admiral DCB received FDA approval in December 2014 to treat superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Moreover, it is commercially available in Europe since its receipt of the CE mark approval in 2009. So far, 200,000 PAD patients in Europe have been treated with the device.Interestingly, Medtronic’s revenues from the APV division improved 4% year over year (up 5% at constant exchange rate) in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, Peripheral Vascular business grew low double digits in both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons. The latest development should boost the company’s performance in this segment.Medtronic’s strategy to gain traction in the peripheral vascular sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by MarketsAndMarkets. Per the report, the interventional cardiology & peripheral vascular devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.1% from 2016 to 2021 to reach a value of $31.47 billion.We believe the high incidence of peripheral artery disease due to unhealthy lifestyle and aging population, penetration by the companies in the untapped markets, rising needs for minimally-invasive angioplasty procedures, technological advancements and increasing awareness among people will continue to drive the global acceptance of this technology. In view of these encouraging factors, we believe that the company’s Japanese development for IN.PACT Admiral DCB is strategic and will broaden its customer base.However, over the last month, Medtronic has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has declined 2.6% in contrast to the industry’s 2.5% gain. It also underperformed the 0.8% gain of the S&P 500 over the same time frame. Nevertheless, we believe the latest Japanese regulatory approval will boost investor confidence in the stock.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1007,EW,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Medical Devices business. The company recently announced FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD).Built on the sophisticated Full MagLev (fully magnetically-levitated) Flow technology, the HeartMate 3 system provides advanced short-term hemodynamic support to advanced heart failure patients.The Full MagLev technology enables HeartMate 3 system to lower trauma to the blood passing through the pump while optimizing blood flow. Interestingly, HeartMate 3 is an upgraded version to the existing HeartMate II system, which is used for longer duration.The much-awaited FDA approval was awarded to Abbott post successful results from the MOMENTUM 3 clinical study. We also encouragingly note that HeartMate 3 received CE Mark in 2015.Per management, over 5.7 million people in the United States suffer from heart failure and roughly 915,000 new patients are diagnosed with the condition every year. Supporting this data, Statista’s report on the U.S. Heart Failure market states that the market is projected to value $1,969 million by 2020, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2%. Moreover, they see an encouraging growth in the user penetration rate (as a share out of all ailing people) to 11.1% in 2020 from 8.1% in 2017. Thus, considering this data base, we believe that the latest FDA nod will accelerate the top-line growth.Per a report by Culrav.org, the global LVAD market is projected to value $2,323.4 million witnessing a CAGR of 8.9% from 2017 to 2025. Moreover, as per Transperency Market Research, the North American market for ventricular assist devices is expected to see a CAGR of 9.2% in the 2016 to 2024 period.Thus, considering the market potential, Abbott’s latest development will help it gain traction in the LVAD space.Interestingly, Abbott’s Medical Devices operating segment (39.1% of total revenues) stood out as the highest revenue grossing business in the second quarter of 2017.  Moreover, the company’s Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sub-segment was the highest contributor, making up for 87.1% of the total Medical Devices revenues with 49.1% sales from the United States alone. Thus, the company’s latest development will help boost performance in this segment.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the heart failure market.However, this market is dominated by many well-established players with Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientiific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) being the most prominent ones.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

Notably, the company is engaged in clinics trials for evaluating Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead in the United States, Canada and other regions.Medtronic’s latest offering features active-fixation technology that assists in precise lead placement and stability when paired with the company’s quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (CRT-D) and -pacemakers (CRT-P).

This global study is aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of the lead in heart failure patients.Interestingly, Medtronic’s Cardiac & Vascular group (CVG) segment accounted for 35.9% to total revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, the company’s CRHF sub-segment was the highest contributor, making up for 52.3% of the total CVG revenues.

1009,EW,"On Aug 22, we issued an updated research report on Waltham, MA-based PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report). The company provides scientific instruments, consumables, and services to pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing, chemical, and general industrial markets worldwide. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).PerkinElmer’s expanding product portfolio is helping the company win market share worldwide. Within a short span of time, its new products have gained significant traction among consumers. We believe the products will continue to boost the company’s market share in areas like diagnostics, research and environment.Moreover, PerkinElmer is well positioned to benefit from investments in the area of cancer immunotherapy as well as the rising trend of outsourcing instrument maintenance and scientific services over the long term.Acquisitions and strategic partnerships have been key catalysts for PerkinElmer over the years. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to acquire EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.The acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics will expand PerkinElmer’s reach in the autoimmune and allergy diagnostic markets. The acquisition will also reinforce the company’s capabilities pertaining to new infectious diseases in the Chinese market. Per management, the acquisition is expected to add about 28 cents to 30 cents to 2018 adjusted earnings.PerkinElmer continues to acquire a large number of companies. While this improves revenue opportunities, it adds to integration risks. The frequent acquisitions can also negatively impact its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets. Frequent acquisitions are also a distraction for management and impacts organic growth.Stock Performance at a GlancePerkinElmer’s share price movement in the past one year has been unsatisfactory. The company represented a return of almost 16%, a bit lower than the broader industry's return of almost 22.1%. The company has been witnessing weakness in academic markets outside the United States. Furthermore, lackluster performance in Europe impacted the company’s third-party logistics in the second quarter.The estimate revision trend has been favorable for PerkinElmer over the last two months. For the current quarter, five estimates moved north compared to one movement in the opposite direction, while for the full year eight estimates moved north over the same time frame.This has had a significant impact on the magnitude of the estimates as the current quarter estimates increased 2.8%, while full-year estimates inched 1% up over the same time frame.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Cogentix Medical, Inc. .

1010,EW,"On Aug 22, we issued an updated research report on St. Paul, MN-based Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report). The company is a leading provider of water, hygiene and energy technologies and services. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Ecolab had an impressive run on the bourse over the last three months, trading above the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Ecolab’s shares have gained 2.7%, comparing favorably with the industry’s 1.9% decline.Ecolab reported a stellar second quarter of fiscal 2017 result, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both counts. The upside came from new business gains, better pricing, product innovation and cost efficiencies. Overall adjusted quarterly net sales were $3.46 billion, up 4% from the year-ago period. This more than offset higher delivered product costs.For the third quarter of 2017, Ecolab projects adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.36–$1.44, compared with $1.28 a year ago.  Ecolab’s considerable earnings growth despite the challenging business environment instills confidence. Additionally, the company's large base of recurring revenues, industry-leading technologies and excellent field service are significant propellers for long-term growth.The company’s prospects in the Global Industrial and Global Institutional business segments are also bright. In the last reported quarter, sales at these segments both scaled 3%, on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, Ecolab boasts compelling fundamentals with revenues and adjusted earnings multiplying at a rate of 4.6% and 13.7%, over the last three years.However, on the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency and the impact of Venezuelan deconsolidation are expected to hurt earnings in the near term. Also escalating costs and expenses are weighing on its margins. Last month, a comparative study of Ecolab’s forward P/E (forward 12-month basis) multiple reflected that the stock has been quite overvalued.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.31 billion (31% of total revenue), reflecting a 5% increase at CER (up 4% as reported). Emerging markets (14% of total revenue) amounted to $1.04 billion, up 12% at CER (up 11% as reported).Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteSegment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG includes both the Surgical Solutions and the Patient Monitoring & Recovery (PMR) divisions. RTG includes the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.Revenues at CVG improved 6% at CER (or up 5% as reported) to $2.65 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales were $1.39 billion with 5% year over year at CER (up 4% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope and continued worldwide customer demand for the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor. This apart, the HeartWare International acquisition drove growth in the Heart Failure division.CSH revenues were up 8% at CER (7% as reported) to $817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 4% as reported) to $439 million, driven by the continued adoption of the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft and remarkable strength of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by low-double digit growth in both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.49 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year increase at CER (same as reported) on mid-single digit growth in Surgical Solutions and low-single digit growth in PMR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.81 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on high-single digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in Spine, thus mitigating a decline in Pain Therapies. However, revenues from the Diabetes group decreased 1% at CER (same as reported) to $449 million.MarginsGross margin during the reported quarter contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 68.2% despite a 2.8% increase in gross profit to $5.04 billion. Adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 26.3%. This was owing to a 1.4% decline in research and development expenses (to $548 million) which was offset by a 2.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter were $66 million as compared with $39 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company still expects full-year revenue growth in the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $380-$480 million impact in the fiscal year compared to an expected positive impact of $75-$175 million stated previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at $30.72 billion for fiscal 2018.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is now expected to have an adverse impact of 3 cents to a positive impact of 1 cent compared with the earlier expectation of negative impact of approximately 5-10 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.89.Moreover for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $25-$75 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected to have a favorable impact of 0-2 cents on second-quarter earnings per share.Our TakeMedtronic’s exited the fiscal fourth-quarter on a mixed note with earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the reported revenues failing to meet the estimates. While the company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER, escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on bottom line. Unfavorable currency translation acted as a dampener to the company’s quarterly performance. However, the fiscal guidance represents chances of respite.On a positive note, three major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend, successfully continuing in the U.S. as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is currently focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronics currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Reported EPS came in at 17 cents.The adjusted EPS figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents by 4.4%.

Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $204.9 million, up 8.2% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and solid uptake of core products outside the United States.Critical Care sales were $164.3 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 12.3% from fourth-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by strong growth in the company's core products, mainly in the United States and China.MarginsIn the fourth quarter, gross margin expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 73.5% owing to a more profitable product mix led by growing sales of transcatheter valves. This was however partially offset by the shutdown of the company's manufacturing plant in Switzerland.SG&A expenses rose 14.2% year over year to $266.7 million on account of sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in the Transcatheter Valve (THV) segment. R&D expenditures increased 27.6% year over year to $146.6 million owing to continued investments in the transcatheter aortic valve and mitral valve program.

1017,EW,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is gaining momentum with 133 S&P 500 participants having already released financial numbers as of Jan 26. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the reporting cycle was off to an encouraging start with above-average proportion of companies edging past the top and bottom-line expectations.Total earnings for these members have improved 11.6% on 6% increase in revenues.With results of roughly 121 members slated to be announced this week, per the Zacks data, estimates for the period are gradually trending upward across the board for nine of the 16 Zacks sectors. The Medical as one in the bracket, is expected to witness a 2.1% earnings rise in the fourth quarter on 2% revenue growth projection.What’s in Store for Medical Device Industry?The medical device space within the broader Medical sector somewhat displays a mixed bag of sorts. As part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed down to 21% from the previous 35%, thus lending a huge relief to the MedTech mammoths.However, ahead of the industry’s fourth-quarter earnings release, a section of analysts expect this new tax law to negatively impact the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending, if certain criteria are not fulfilled by a specific date. The Congressional Budget Office apprehends that in absence of any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax reduction, automatic cut backs worth $136 billion including $25 billion in Medicare cuts from the mandatory budget of spending in 2018, could be triggered.Amid tax reform related concerns, the news of Congress delaying the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge boost to industry players and investors. This 2.3% tax was earlier delayed by Congress in 2015 for a couple of years. The deferral will once again largely propel R&D activities within this space.Let’s take a sneak peek at the performance of five major medical device companies, waiting to report earnings on Feb 1.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology, led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, The WATCHMAN platform is expected to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth.The company has a positive Earnings ESP of +1.07% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While a favorable Zacks ESP indicates a likely positive surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  (Read More: Will WATCHMAN Boost Boston Scientific's Q4 Earnings?)Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteBaxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report): In the fourth quarter of 2017, Baxter International is anticipated to gain from strong Hospital Products, driven by solid sales in the U.S. Fluid Systems business as well as robust demand for injectable pharmaceuticals. Within the Hospital Products segment, we expect Fluid Systems to maintain the momentum, evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $634 million for the to-be-reported quarter, which reflects a 3.3% improvement from the year-ago period.Banking on solid prospects, our quantitative model also shows a beat for the company, given the combination of a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.28%.

Also McKesson Specialty Health unit is likely to drive the company’s top line in the same time frame. The unit is likely to benefit from the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition and the recent BDI Pharma buyout.We are unable to conclude whether McKesson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

1018,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 1, after market close.Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.2%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to gain from strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies, with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well. In the United States, transcatheter heart valve sales grew 20% year over year in the third quarter. Outside the United States, the underlying growth rate was 21%, with strong contribution from Japan.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote In the last reported quarter, growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $509 million reflects an increase of 17.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, fourth-quarter revenues are projected at $862.86 million.Here are the other factors that might influence Edwards Lifesciences’ fourth-quarter results:Investors are bullish on the Harpoon Medical acquisition, which was completed on Dec 6, 2017, with the intention to enhance the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy portfolio. However, the buyout is not expected to contribute significantly to fourth-quarter revenues.Meanwhile, the INTUITY Elite valve system was approved for Medicare's new tech add-on payment effective Oct 1, 2017. This recognized INTUITY as the latest technology to provide substantial clinical improvement over conventional valves. The company believes that many hospitals will be helped by this add-on payment over the next year and this should simplify adoption of this rapid-deployment valve that shortens minimally invasive and complex procedures.Edwards Lifesciences expects sales in 2017 to meet the high end of the $3.2-$3.4 billion range.Moreover, we note that the company projects total sales between $855 million and $895 million and adjusted earnings per share of 84 cents to 94 cents for the fourth quarter.However, the company expects some changes in fourth-quarter gross margin. Earnings are expected to be impacted by foreign currency fluctuation.Also, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to raise caution.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Edwards Lifesciences has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Edwards Lifesciences is +1.3%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Edwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 90 cents reflects a 20% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1019,EW,"In an initiative to enhance clinical development in Japan, PAREXEL International Corporation , a global biopharmaceutical services company and provider of clinical research and logistics has formed an alliance with Osaka International Cancer Institute to bolster patient enrollment for clinical trials in oncology and hematology.Per management, Osaka will leverage on PAREXEL’s biopharmaceutical expertise to provide a wide range of potential treatment options to cancer patients. We believe solid advancement of clinical trials with scientific expertise in the oncology segment will fortify PAREXEL’s foothold in the niche markets (both oncology and biopharmaceutical). In this regard, oncology is the largest and the fastest growing therapeutic area for PAREXEL. In fact, the segment grew 31% on an average over the past four years.However, we believe initiatives like these will help PAREXEL drive its top and bottom line. A solid long-term expected earnings growth rate of 13% holds promise in this regard. Furthermore, the biopharmaceutical services market is healthy and PAREXEL enjoys a competitive edge in the space.Solid Prospects in Asia PacificPAREXEL’s growth story in the Asia Pacific has been compelling. In Japan, the company has a leading position among biopharmaceutical companies and is well positioned to advantage from an outsourcing market that is relatively underpenetrated. PAREXEL has operations in Tokyo, Kobe and Osaka in Japan.After reporting third-quarter fiscal 2017, PARAXEL’s business across Asia has more than doubled over the last two years, at a CAGR of almost 50%. Apart from Japan, the company sees solid prospects in China — the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market witnessing double-digit growth.Shares Shine BrightPAREXEL has had an impressive run on the bourse over the last three months. The company has gained 10%, comparing favorably with the broader industry’s addition of 1.9%.

Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter and full year stood at 94 cents and $3.23, respectively, over the same time frame.PAREXEL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bottom LineApart from fortifying hold in the oncology space, PAREXEL is focused on expediting activities in areas like protocol design, study start-up, trial execution, regulatory submission and product commercialization. The company provides a broad range of clinical research, consulting, medical communications and technology solutions and services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical deviceindustries worldwide.In fact, the global market trends seem favorable at the moment. The biopharmaceuticals market is anticipated to reach a worth of $278 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 9.4%, per Persistence Market Research. We expect PAREXEL to gain significant traction in the biopharmaceutical and related ancillary markets, courtesy of the favorable trend and the latest partnership.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1020,EW,"On Sep 22, we issued an updated research report on North Kansas City, MO-based Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) – a leading global provider of healthcare information technology solutions (“HCIT”). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We believe that Cerner has solid growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) suite of solutions. In fact, the segment has been a strong contributor in recent times with RevWorks services delivering a solid performance. In fact, bookings in the second quarter of 2017 were $1.636 billion (an all-time high), up 16% on a year-over-year basis.A secondary growth driver for Cerner is its Population Health (“PH”) Management platform. Notably, the company clinched a high number of large contracts for the PH platform in the last reported quarter.Cerner offers exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company won contracts in the U.K. as well as the Middle East. Furthermore, Cerner constantly pursues complementary business acquisitions that enable it to expand solutions, device offerings and services.On the flipside, the company operates in the HCIT space which is intensely competitive and fast evolving, subjecting it to rapid technological changes.Share Price & Estimate RevisionCerner had an impressive run on the bourse over the last six months, trading above the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Cerner’s shares have gained 17.4%, comparing favorably with the 15.8% rise of the industry it belongs to. Cerner Corporation Price  Cerner Corporation Price | Cerner Corporation QuoteOn the flip side, the estimate revision trend for the current year remains unfavorable with eight estimates moving south over the last two months, compared with only two movement in the opposite direction.

1021,EW,"On Sep 22, we issued an updated research report on PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). PetMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last six months, PetMed has been trading above the broader industry. Per the last trading price, the company has gained a stupendous 75.5% when compared with 27.6% growth of the broader industry.In the fiscal first quarter, PetMed posted better-than-expected results, marking a solid start to fiscal 2018. We are encouraged by the significant increase in reorder sales and new order sales in the quarter and expect the same to continue throughout the year.PetMed is striving to implement several strategies to revitalize its top line. These include focusing on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items, while expanding product offerings. However, we are apprehensive about escalating advertising expenses incurred in the quarter.The company markets its products primarily under well-known brands of medication such as Frontline Plus, K9 Advantix, Advantage, Heartgard Plus, Sentinel and Interceptor, among others.On the flip side, PetMed operates in a highly competitive and fragmented pet medications market. The competitors include veterinarians, traditional retailers, other mail-order and online retailers of pet medications and other health products. Also, the acquisition of Novartis' animal health division by Eli Lilly and Company has given rise to more challenges for PetMed.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

1022,EW,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) continues to broaden portfolio with pain therapeutic solutions. Following the FDA approval, the company has recently made a significant breakthrough with the U.S. launch of the Intellis platform for management of certain types of chronic intractable pain.Per Medtronic, this Intellis platform is able to overcome certain limitations related to current spinal cord stimulation (SCS) systems like battery performance. The platform can power the Evolve workflow, which standardizes guidance and balances high-dose (HD) and low-dose (LD) therapy settings.Among other advancements of this platform, it is worth mentioning that it can be managed on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet interface. This provides the physicians with faster delivery of evolving workflows and software upgrades. The Intellis platform includes both Medtronic’s proprietary SureScan MRI technology (for the broadest access available to MRI diagnostic imaging and simple eligibility determination) as well as AdaptiveStim technology (for automatic adjustments to deliver the right therapy dose to the right location as the pain target shifts according to body position).Per a Transparency Market Research report, Global Pain Management Therapeutics Market is expected to ascend to $83 billion by 2024from $60.2 billion in 2015. Per Medtronic, back problems are one of the top 10 most expensive medical conditions with estimated 30% of the 300,000 patients annually undergoing lumbosacral spine procedures, which develop chronic intractable pain.Keeping the above problem in mind, we are looking forward to a solid customer adoption of Intellis platform considering the huge and growing market for chronic pain management.Medtronic PLC Price  Medtronic PLC Price | Medtronic PLC Quote Over the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has lost 10.8% versus the 2.5% gain of the broader industry during the period. Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

1023,EW,"AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 4, before market opens. Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.On an average, AngioDynamics delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.79% in the trailing four quarters. However, a lackluster price performance over the last year and high debt levels continue to hinder the company. AngioDynamics’ shares have returned a mere 0.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayStrong Product Portfolio: AngioDynamics’ wide array of products like AngioVac, BioFlo and NanoKnife enhances market opportunities. Notably, the PV business (peripheral vascular sales) has also built a strong momentum. AngioDynamics has been experiencing growth in other product families like Food Management, Thrombus Management, BioFlo products and NanoKnife disposables in the Oncology section.Solero MTA System to Drive Growth: The company rides on the market’s solid response to Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation (MTA) system, especially within the Microwave Ablation space. The platform is intended to be used for the ablation of soft tissue during open procedures. Per management, Solero was the primary driver for the whopping 11% year-over-year increase in the oncology surgery sales last quarter.Robust Fundamental Growth Story: Over the last 4 years, the company’s sales witnessed a CAGR of 0.3%, whereas, earnings per share saw a CAGR of 11.3%. The company expects to benefit from the ongoing market transition toward less invasive interventional procedures in the upcoming years.Unfavorable Estimate Revision Trend: The estimate revision trend for the current quarter has been unfavorable for AngioDynamics. In the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues fell 1.4% year over year to $87.80 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings declined 12.3% to 17 cents per share on a year-over-year basis.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersHowever, our quantitative model does not conclusively show earnings beat for AngioDynamics in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AngioDynamics currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 17 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

1024,EW,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) – one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse in the last three months, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen’s shares have lost 10.7%, comparing unfavorably with the 1.3% gain of the broader industry.The unfavorable performance was led by pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, significantly lower than the previous 6.5% to 8% band. The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen took over PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the coming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends AmerisourceBergen a competitive advantage in the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind for the business in fiscal 2017.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. AmerisourceBergen witnessed a negative revenue impact from declining sales at the segment in the last reported second quarter. Revenues improved only 4% to $37.1 billion in the quarter, which might have been around 5.5% without the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an additional concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors are national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is witnessing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

1025,EW,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), a provider of integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Post a better-than-expected performance in the second quarter, CVS Health was observed trading significantly ahead of the industry. Per the last three months, the stock has inched up 2.5% in contrast to the industry’s 1.9% decline over the same period. On a positive note, strong Pharmacy Services numbers benefited from the upside in Specialty Pharmacy. Another encouraging fact is that despite a year-over-year decline in hepatitis C script volume in the recently reported second-quarter 2017 on lower new patient enrolment, CVS Health’s Specialty business growth outperformed the market.The company is currently working on integration of Omnicare’s specialty operation into the company’s existing specialty business profile. Besides, CVS Health’s Specialty Connect offering continues to experience strong surges in prescription volumes along with high satisfaction scores with patients, payers and providers.We are also impressed with the company’s robust PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season. Incidentally, CVS Health had already confirmed a very successful selling season this year based on which, the expected revenue for 2017 was increased last quarter.Regarding 2018 PBM selling season, which has already begun from the start of this current year, the company had a successful second-quarter 2017 despite the magnitude of bidding opportunities being flat to down year over year.  While gross new business was $5.4 billion, net new business commendably reached $1.8 billion. These new business numbers include the loss of the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract but lack any impact from individual Med D PDP. The company has already completed about 70% of client renewals for 2018.However, the highly competitive retail pharmacy business poses severe threats. The company has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in recent past. Per the company, the decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps. Also, dull economic conditions in the United States might hamper company’s profit margin.Other Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

The company’s current-year growth rate is also favorable at 13.1% compared with the 4.5% increase of the broader industry.

1027,EW,"HealthEquity Inc. (HQY  -  Free Report) reported earnings of 27 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents. The figure was higher than the year-ago earnings of 14 cents on revenue and margin expansion.Shares of HealthEquity have gained only 3.5% of its value year to date, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s gain of 4.6% to which it belongs to.Quarter DetailsRevenues during the said quarter amounted to $56.9 million, reflecting an increase of 29% year over year and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $56.0 million. Service (40% of total revenues), Custodial (37%) and Interchange (23%) revenues were up 21%, 44% and 21% year over year, respectively.The growth in service revenues was driven by year-over-year increase in average health savings account (HSA) which was offset by a decrease in service revenue per average HSA. The decline was led by the company’s strategy of offering lower service fees per HSA for more volume from network partners, particularly with higher balances. HealthEquity stated that the profitability of HSA in this business model increases as balances grow.The growth in Custodial revenues was supported by higher average daily cash AUM. The strong year-over-year growth in Interchange revenues was driven by increased card spending and more favorable interchange terms (higher spend volume).As of Jul 31, 2017, total number of HSA members – for which the company serves as a non-bank custodian – increased 26% year over year to 2.9 million. Total assets under management (AUM) surged 28% year over year to $5.4 billion.HealthEquity, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  HealthEquity, Inc.

1029,EW,"Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report) recently signed a definitive agreement to sell the company’s certain neurosurgery assets to healthcare products and services provider Natus Medical Incorporated (BABY  -  Free Report) for a total deal value of $47.5 million. This forms part of the company’s efforts to fulfill certain closing conditions toward the proposed $1.05 billion acquisition of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Codman neurosurgery business.Integra has decided to sell the global Camino ICP monitoring product line, including its San Diego manufacturing facility, to Natus Medical. Natus will also get hold of the U.S. rights related to Integra’s fixed pressure shunts as well as U.S. rights to Codman’s DURAFORM dural graft implant, standard EVD catheters and CSF collection systems.While announcing this entire set of divestiture, Integra has also discussed its imminent financial impact. Per the company, in 2016, approximately $50 million of revenues were earned from the neurosurgery product lines associated with these divestitures. Taking net of divestitures and the Codman acquisition into account, the company on a preliminary basis, estimated fourth-quarter 2017 revenue contribution of approximately $60-$65 million. For full-year 2018, Integra expects Codman Neurosurgery to contribute between $290 million and $300 million in revenue and net of divestitures.Overall, the Codman Neurosurgery business is expected to remain accretive toward Integra’s 2018 adjusted earnings per share and contribute at least 22 cents. However, for full-year 2017, Integra expects minimal contribution from Codman Neurosurgery to adjusted earnings per share.Notably, Integra’s proposed acquisition of Codman, declared in February, will provide the company with the global reach in Neurosurgery which connotes the core expertise within Integra’s Specialty Surgical Solutions.Per Integra, Codman Neurosurgery’s existing portfolio and new product pipeline in advanced hydrocephalus, neuro-critical care and electrosurgery are going to complement the acquirer’s leading products and pipeline in tissue ablation, dural repair and cranial stabilization. Post the completion of this acquisition, the consolidated portfolio will offer complete solutions for neurosurgery and the scale to invest and bring in new technologies to the table for patients worldwide.Notably, per a report by Radiant Insights, the global neurosurgery market is expected to witness an estimated CAGR of around 10-12% during 2015-2019. Taking into consideration the huge growth prospects, we believe Integra’s initiative to strengthen its foothold in this particular niche to be well-timed.Overall, Integra Lifesciences has been consistently trading above the broader industry in the last six months. The stock has rallied 22.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 5.9% gain of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PickIntegra currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1030,EW,"California-based Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) recently signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental, a business unit of Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report).Per the non-exclusive agreement, effective September 2017, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. Thus, we believe Align Technology’slatest deal will boost the iTero scanner customer base to a considerable extent.We are also optimistic about the company’s expanding work flow options for its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align Technology recently launched a software upgrade to its iTero Element intraoral scanner that is capable of comparing patient scans over time with the latest TimeLapse technology.Also, Align Technology collaborated with exocad GmbH in March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, designing and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. In February, the company announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio.Interestingly, revenues from Scanner and Service improved a substantial 36.7% in the last reported second quarter 2017. Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. In line with the latest developments in the iTero scanner space, Align Technology’s latest deal buoys optimism.Per a report by MedGadget, the global market for 3D Dental Scanners is projected to see a CAGR of 10.2% over the 2017-2021 period.Considering the market potential and Align Technology’s current developments in the scanners and services space, this collaboration seems to be a strategic one.We believe an unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the 3D Dental scanners market. However, this market is dominated by many well established players, with DENTSPLY SIRONA being a prominent one.Align Technology has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 22.3%, as against the broader industry’s 0.9% fall. The company has also outperformed the 1.3% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame. Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlign Technology currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1031,EW,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has recently teamed up with Integrated Medical Foundation (IMF) and LUGPA, an association of independent urology group practices, to raise awareness on prostate cancer. More specifically, Henry Schein’s global corporate social responsibility program — Henry Schein Cares — will work on this matter.Per Henry Schein, it will support IMF and LUGPA with a series of communication efforts to increase awareness among practitioners and public about the importance of early detection of prostate cancer. According to them, it has been widely accepted how early detection of prostate cancer can greatly enhance a patient’s chances of recovering from the disease.We believe, the company’s move is well-timed taking into consideration the frequency rate at which prostate cancer is growing. The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately one in nine men will be diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime. Per the American Cancer Society, more than 160,000 men are expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 26,000 men may succumb to the disease in 2017.Though Henry Schein is yet to make a foray into the world of cancer research, it has already come up with several awareness drives of late. Only last month, the company announced to offer its dental, animal health and medical customers an opportunity to join in the fight against cancer.The proposal will be open from from September through December. By purchasing a range of pink products, customers can support the company’s Practice Pink program, an initiative designed to increase awareness and back the cure for breast cancer as well as other cancer therapies.Over the past three months, Henry Schein has underperformed the broader industry.

1032,EW,"On Sep 4, we issued an updated research report on Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report), a major commercial laboratory services provider. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last six months, Quest Diagnostics has been trading above the broader industry. As per the last share price movement, the stock has gained 9.9% in contrast to the 5.5% decline of the broader industry over the same time frame.The company’s earnings in the last reported second quarter exceeded estimates, while revenues lagged the same. The company has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. It is currently refocusing on core diagnostic information services business and disciplined capital deployment. Finally, the raised 2017 guidance indicates chances of continuation of this bullish trend. In addition, alliance with hospitals and integrated delivery networks are other growth drivers. The company is particularly positive about its PeaceHealth acquisition in the Pacific Northwest which is expected to bolster growth in the rest of 2017.We are also encouraged by the launch of QHerit by Quest Diagnostics in July. The QHerit Pan-Ethnic Expanded Carrier Screen is a panel of tests for the 22 heritable diseases mentioned under new screening guidelines issued in March 2017 by the American College of Gynecology (ACOG). Further, the company has completed its previously announced acquisition of laboratory businesses — Med Fusion and Clear Point.In late 2016, Quest Diagnostics came up with an upgraded long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017) based on its new and extended two-point strategy to generate shareholders’ value, accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.However, we are concerned about the tough organic volume scenario. Also, in the last three months, a comparative study of Quest Diagnostic’s forward P/E (F12M basis) multiple reflects that the stock is quite overvalued. A tough competitive landscape and reimbursement headwinds are other concerns.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

1033,EW,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Mazor Robotics Ltd recently announced an amendment to their existing partnership,which was initially signed in May 2016 to distribute a range of Mazor products. Per the modification, the companies have entered the next phase of the agreement earlier than expected.Mazor Robotics is an Israel-based medical device company in the field of robotic surgical guidance systems.Meanwhile, Medtronic will assume the rights to exclusive worldwide distribution of the Mazor X system (Mazor Robotic’s spine surgery system) and will make $40-million third tranche investment in Mazor Robotics.The early payment came on the back of the achievement of certain pre-agreed sales and marketing targets in advance. The growing demand for the Mazor X system also acted in favor.Following the third installment, Medtronic‘s total investment in Mazor Robotics will rise to $71.9 million.  The partnership will help the companies get a platform to explore the development of products for the spine market.Medtronic is making consistent efforts to expand its spine business under the Restorative Therapies Group (RTG). In the last reported first quarter of fiscal 2018, RTG reported a 2% year-over-year revenue increase at constant exchange rate, while the Spine business witnessed  low single-digit growth. Also, within RTG, the company has announced plans to launch the Solera Voyager 5.5/6.0 fixation system.According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for Spinal Surgery Devices is estimated to reach a worth of $16.6 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 5% from 2016 to 2021. Taking the bountiful opportunities in this niche space into consideration, we believe the company’s latest development is strategic.Over the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the broader industry. As per the last share price movement, the stock lost 6.9%, as compared to the 0.3% gain of the broader industry over this period.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1034,EW,"Healthcare diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp successfully continues to expand through acquisition strategy. Apart from huge buyouts like Covance, the company continues to add complementary capabilities through targeted tuck-in mergers.Latest on the list is the company’s agreement to purchase the analytical testing services business of ChromaDex Corp. (CDXC). The transaction is expected to complete in early September. This newly acquired entity will become part of LabCorp’s Covance Food Solutions business.Notably, ChromaDex is a natural product company working on health, wellness and nutritional ingredients, creating science-based solutions for dietary supplement, food and beverage, skin care, sports nutrition and pharmaceutical products.Although both the companies haven’t disclosed the deal’s financial terms through press release, per a report by American City Business Journals, the deal value has been fixed at $8.5 million. Per this report, “Covance will buy the analytical testing business for $7.5 million. Under the agreement, ChromaDex is also able to receive an earnout payment of up to $1 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.”It is important to make a note of LabCorp’s $5.6 billion mega buyout of Covance by virtue of which, the company is full on force to expand a range of diagnostic offerings and create a new industry leader in both laboratory testing and CRO (contract research organization) spaces, slated to act as a leading provider of medical testing besides operating as a premier full-service drug development organization.Per the company, Covance Drug Development is the only CRO, providing full spectrum of drug development capabilities — from research to real-world evidence studies — creating commercial and scientific advantage for LabCorp’s partners.Apart from Covance, another recent significant buyout is Sequenom, a prominent player in the field of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for reproductive health. Sequenom’s NIPT and genetic testing capabilities has further added an impetus to LabCorp’s extensive women’s health test menu. This inclusion has also expanded the company’s geographic reach both domestically and internationally (particularly in the EU and Asia-Pacific region).In May, the company acquired Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories (PAML) from former owners Providence Health & Services (Providence) and Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI). PAML is one of the nation’s premier medical reference laboratories and a healthcare solutions company. All these acquisitions are consistent with the company’s efforts to strengthen foothold in the personalized diagnostics testing market.Last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. Over this period, the stock has gained 9.2% as against the industry’s 1.1% loss.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1035,EW,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last three months, this leading molecular diagnostic company has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 4.7% compared with the broader industry’s 1.8% rise during the period.  On a positive note, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales growth of 17.3% in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting a rise over the prior-year period. This upside was led by a strong continued adoption of the therapy across all geographical regions. Per management, THVT adoption in the reported quarter grew consistently on robust performance of its SAPIEN 3 valve.We are also encouraged by the company’s long-term growth strategies and its recent progress in technology pipeline. As far as transcatheter heart valve is concerned, Edwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership position in the global Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) market.The TAVR adoption rate in Japan and European countries continues to surpass the same in those regions where the therapy is more popularly well-established. In the U.K., the company’s optimism gets further boosted by the proposal of implementing TAVR technology for treatment purposes by the reimbursement authority of NICE.Also, the company’s focus on building its pipeline to strengthen foothold across all operating businesses bodes well. Edwards Lifesciences has also witnessed growth in its emerging portfolio of mitral and tricuspid repair therapies.On the flip side, natural disasters impacted sales in the third quarter to the tune of $2 million. Also, higher operating expenses continue to be a drag. Stiff competition, currency headwind and reimbursement issues are other challenges to cope with.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report), Tactile Systems Technology (TCMD  -  Free Report) and Integer Holdings Corporation (ITGR  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1036,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) recently acquired Harpoon Medical, Inc. — a privately-held medical technology company focused on beating-heart repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR).Per the agreement, Harpoon Medical’s flagship beating-heart repair procedure for mitral valve patients — HARPOON system — will be added to Edward Lifesciences’ Surgical Heart Valve Therapy portfolio for treating structural heart disease. However, the HARPOON system is yet to receive CE Mark approval.Financial DetailsEdwards Lifesciences paid $100 million in cash to close the deal on Dec 1. Moreover, the company is liable to pay another $150 million on achievement of certain pre-decided milestones over the next 10 years.Recent DevelopmentsInterestingly, Edwards Lifesciences has been witnessing strength in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy segment on strong uptake of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system.  Progressing in this space, the company received FDA approval for INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves in July 2017.

The company plans to commercially launch the product in the United States and Japan in 2018, followed by the successful launch of INSPIRIS RESILIA in Europe earlier in 2017.Market PotentialWe believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further strengthened by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019. Within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%. Moreover, per a report by Medgadget, the global heart valve repair and replacement market is expected to rise from $2,281.2 million in 2014 to $3,767.0 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 8.7%.Thus, in view of the current market potential, we believe that the company’s efforts will help boost the top line.Share Price PerformanceEdwards Lifesciences has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

The company also launched XT Series Automated Supply Dispensing system in July 2017.During the quarter, the company also launched the controlled substance dispenser, a module-providing secured workflow for dispensing and administration of controlled substance. However, weak margins raise concern.On the flip side, Omnicell faces intense competition in the medication management and supply chain solutions market. Also, the company has adopted several strategies to drive its top line including portfolio expansion, acquisitions and further penetration into the medication adherence market. Thus, the company continues to battle escalating costs. Overall, in majority of the last three months, Omnicell has been trading above its industry.

1038,EW,"Gainesville, FL-based Exactech Inc.  recently announced that its new product, the Truliant Knee System’s surgical instrumentation has been honored with a bronze award in the 2017 International Design Excellence Awards (IDEA) in Atlanta, GA.Sponsored by the Industrial Designers Society of America, IDEA winners receive significant international publicity and exposure. The 2017 IDEA contest noted hundreds of entries from 54 countries in six continents.A significant development in the company’s knee segment Truliant Knee System offers advanced approaches to total knee replacement surgeries, with a clinically-recognized platform of proven implants and personalized surgical workflows.Exclusivity of the Truliant System is embedded in its ergonomic instrumentation design, which enables surgeons to make appropriate bone cuts and adjustments to the joint during total knee arthroplasty. In the last reported quarter, Knee revenues were flat at $19.6 million, which increased 1% at constant currency.Exactech Rides on Solid Knee BusinessIn July, Exactech took a step toward its goal of providing an all-inclusive range of knee replacement systems with the launch of ExactechGPS TKA PLUS. This is an advanced software application that provides systematic computer guidance to orthopedic surgeons during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures.Though Exactech might benefit from the solid prospects in the Total Knee Replacement market, it will face tough competition from the likes of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, INC. (ZBH  -  Free Report), which offers the iASSIST knee Personalized Guidance System for knee replacement procedures.Exactech plans a complete commercial launch of TKA PLUS software application in 2018. This product development is in line with the company’s objective to gain traction in the huge and untapped Total Knee Replacement market. As per data provided by GRAND VIEW RESEARCH, this market is expected to reach a worth of $12.4 billion by 2024.Apart from solid initiatives in the knee platform, Exactech announced FDA approval to market its proprietary ExactechGPS Shoulder Application in the United States earlier this year.Share Price TrendsOver the past six months, Exactech has been trading above the broader industry. The company’s stock has gained 20.2%, higher than the industry’s 6%. We believe that the company is currently riding high on regulatory approvals and product launches.However, the estimate revision trend for the current quarter lacked luster over the last two months. Notably, one estimate moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter fell 4.1% to 23 cents per share over the same timeframe.Exactech has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1039,EW,"Amedisys, Inc.  (AMED  -  Free Report), renowned home health and hospice services provider, has rallied 3.6% over the last six months, ahead of the S&P 500’s 2.9% gain. The stock has a market cap of $1.7 billion. The company’s five-year historical growth rate is also favorable at 17.5% as compared to 12.4% of the broader industry.Also, the company represented a return of almost 3.6%, in comparison to the broader industry’s decline of 8.2% over the last six months.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick at present.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has also been positive. In the past 60 days, five analysts moved their estimates north, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision increased around 6.2% to $2.22 per share over the same time frame.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Recently, Amedisys ended the second quarter of 2017 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues beating the year-ago figures. Also, at Hospice, the company registered strong growth across all segments.Amedisys is currently exploring opportunities in the Home Health and Hospice segments. The company’s favorable demographic trend and strategic acquisitions encourage us as well. Moreover, the company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on synergies from acquisitions.We are encouraged by the company’s long-term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to one focused on bringing home a continuum of care to better serve patients and diversify sources of payment so as to become less reliant on Medicare. In this regard, the company experienced an improvement in non-Medicare revenues in comparison with the declining Medicare revenues within the Home Health division as seen in the last reported second quarter.The home health industry is poised for substantial growth in the long term driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States. The company should continue to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and the need for higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment. Notably, the company is on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. Recently, it announced the completion of National Readmission Prevention Collaborative (NRPC) certification program by its clinical programs team that handles the progress and delivery of home healthcare programs.Additionally, the company’s strong cash balance position bolsters our confidence in the stock.On the flip side, we expect synergies from the Tenet Healthcare acquisition may escalate costs and operating expenses weighing on the company’s margins. Also, an intense competitive landscape and regulatory concerns continue to pose challenges in the home health and hospice industry.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1040,EW,"Investors in Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 1, 2017 $96.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Edwards Lifesciences shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Edwards Lifesciences is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Instruments industry that ranks in the Bottom 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 91 cents per share to 90 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Edwards Lifesciences right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1041,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 84 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents by 2.3%. However, adjusted earnings improved 23.5% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the company’s transcatheter heart valves business.Excluding one-time items, net income in the third quarter came in at $170.1 million or 79 cents per share, up 20.3% or 21.5% year over year, respectively.Sales DetailsEdwards Lifesciences’ third-quarter sales improved 11.1% to $821.5 million. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $834 million by 1.5%. Underlying sales increased 12.9% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in the nation chose to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care product lines too across all regions. Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote                                                                                                                       Segments DetailsFor the third quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $481.2 million, reflecting 17.3% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the United States, THVT sales in the quarter totaled $311.6 million, up 20.1% year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $195.6 million, up 2.4% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and strong uptake of core products outside the United States, partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valves in the United States and Europe.Critical Care sales were $144.7 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 4.5% from third-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by strong growth in the company's core products and the Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, mainly in the United States and Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the third quarter, gross margin expanded 120 basis points (bps) to 74% owing to a more profitable product mix, led by growing sales of transcatheter valves as well as a favorable comparison of supply chain expenditures. This was however partially offset by expenses incurred due to flooding from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the shutdown of the company's manufacturing plant in Switzerland.SG&A expenses rose 6.5% year over year to $244.6 million on account of sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in the Transcatheter Valve (THV) segment.R&D expenditures increased 26.5% year over year to $142.9 million owing to continued investments in the company’s transcatheter aortic valve and mitral valve program. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 50 bps to 26.9% as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion, compared with $1.13 billion at the end of the second quarter. Long-term debt in the quarter totaled $1.03 billion, compared with $1.02 billion reported in the previous quarter.Cash flow from operating activities was $310.8 million in the third quarter, compared with $197.7 million in the previous quarter. Excluding capital spending of $42.3 million, free cash flow was $268.5 million. During the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 216.2 million. 2017 Guidance StaysEdwards Lifesciences has reaffirmed its full-year 2017 sales expectations at the high end of the previously projected range of $3.2-$3.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is $3.40 billion, coinciding with the high end of the guided range. Adjusted EPS expectations have also been reinstated at $3.65–$3.85. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $3.78, within the company’s guided range.For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company projects sales (after adjusting for the effect of Germany stocking sales) between $855 million and $895 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $874.2 million, within the company’s projected range. The company estimates adjusted EPS between 84 cents and 94 cents. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 92 cents, which is also within the company‘s forecasted range.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the third quarter on a disappointing note with both earnings and revenues lagging the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s business was affected by the recent natural disasters in the Caribbean and the United States. Edwards Lifesciences has principal manufacturing locations for its Critical Care products in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, the company had to discontinue production due to floods which affected the top line to some extent. The company also had to postpone a number of procedures in Houston and Florida. Per management, natural disasters negatively impacted third-quarter sales to the tune of $2 million.Nevertheless, strong transcatheter valve sales in the domestic market as well as overseas is a major positive. The company also performed well on its gross margin front, which raises optimism.Management expects to gain traction in the ever-expanding TAVR market, based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidence, leading to strong adoption of THV therapy. However, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to pose challenges.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report). Notably, PetMed sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Abbott and Intuitive Surgical carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PetMed reported EPS of 43 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 79.2% from the year-ago quarter’s 24 cents. Also, gross margin expanded 548 bps year over year to 35.2% in the reported quarter.Abbott reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 66 cents per share, up 11.9% year over year. Also, third-quarter worldwide sales came in at $6.83 billion, up 28.8% year over year. Intuitive Surgical posted adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2017, up 34.5% on a year-over-year basis.

1043,EW,"Medtronic plc. (MDT  -  Free Report) has initiated a voluntary product recall of specific series of infusion sets used with all models of Medtronic insulin pumps. Shares of the company registered a 0.57% drop to close at $81.56 following this announcement.The company decided to recall the insulin pumps on the risk that these devices may potentially over-deliver insulin, exposing respective patients to threat of hypoglycemia.Medtronic has taken this decision on the basis of recent field reports from patients and root cause analysis. Per the report, vent membrane — a component of the recalled infusion sets — may be susceptible to blockage by fluid during the process of priming/fill-tubing.Medtronic plans to replace the recalled lots of infusion sets with the currently manufactured specimens at no cost. This new version has been in use since April and includes a design update of vent membrane which per the company, reduces risk of insulin over-delivery after an infusion set is changed for good.In the press release, Medtronic has not specifically mentioned about the number of defective infusion sets. However, we apprehend about a huge chunk of disputed units to be replaced, following the statement by Pamela Reese, Medtronic senior manager for communications, published on Medscape Medical News: “Because this recall applies to all versions of infusion sets that are used with Medtronic insulin pumps, to publish a list of specific lot numbers would be unwieldy. This is why we designed the [online] lot look-up tool.”This product recall is anticipated to act as a setback for Medtronic’s growing Diabetes business. Considering the large number of MiniMed infusion sets already being rolled out, we believe the recall of the flawed bunch may adversely impact the company’s diabetes arm’s revenue in the ongoing quarter.Within this particular business space, the company is currently putting an all-out effort to capitalize on distinctive innovation and strengthen foothold in the market. Based on the company’s class apart strategy to move toward fully closed loop systems, algorithms and CGM sensors to automate insulin dosing, Medtronic has been of late consistently observing a strong demand graph globally for its new diabetes technology. We apprehend, with the latest recall news, this positive momentum within the Diabetes group may get interrupted to some extent. Over the past three months, Medtronic has been constantly trading below the broader industry. The company has lost 6.9% versus the industry’s 2.5% gain during the period.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked medical stocks include Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

Bard will be integrated into this vertical.Coming to the strategic advantages post the closure of the deal, Becton, Dickinson will generate high-single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share by fiscal 2019. The transaction will lead to a pre-tax annual savings worth $300 million in fiscal 2020. The company will be able to expand to new areas where C.R. Bard currently operates. These include fast-growing vascular access segments like PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.In this regard, we note that Becton, Dickinson announced collaboration for its IMPRESS instrument management system with cloud-based solution provider, UniteOR's surgical tray tracking and vendor management solution. The system provides greater visibility of surgical tray management to health-care workers in the operating room and sterile processing department. This integration with UniteOR allows Becton, Dickinson to offer a truly integrated approach for complex challenges which hospitals and health systems face with regard to surgical tracking.Also, the company completed the buyout of Israeli-based Caesarea Medical Electronics, a global infusion pump systems manufacturer.Apart from the acquisitions and mergers, other catalysts include the company’s receipt of 510(k) clearance from the FDA for a flow cytometer system with a leucocount reagent assay, which is used in residual white blood cell enumeration.Becton, Dickinson also announced the global distribution of a complete line of products for mass spectrometry that provides high-speed and high-confidence identification of pathogens in clinical laboratories.

After a series of futile attempts, the Republicans resorted to a “skinny repeal” of Obamacare which failed as well. Now, the Republicans are back with the latest Graham-Cassidy bill targeting the termination of Obamacare. While investors are busy gauging the extent of the impact of the latest Graham-Cassidy legislation on the Medical Device space, there have been a few encouraging developments in the sub industry.Meanwhile, the 18-company Zacks Outpatient Healthcare Industry, an integral part of the Medical Device space, currently has better prospects as is evident from its Zacks Industry Rank of #38.

1047,EW,"Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), a leading home health and hospice services company is on a healthy growth trajectory of late.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate is also favorable at 18.2% compared with the 12.3% gain of the broader industry.With solid growth prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick at present.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the past 60 days, five analysts moved upward with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision increased around 5.7% to $2.21 per share over the same time frame.Of late, Amedisys has been riding high on solid potential of new opportunities within its home health and hospice services segments. We are also encouraged by the company’s long-term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to a focused unit, bringing home a continuum of care to serve patients with better services and diversify sources of payment to become less reliant on Medicare. The company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on the back of synergies from acquisitions. It recently made a slew of strategic acquisitions — the recent one being that of Intercity Home Care in Massachusetts, slated for close on Oct 1.The home health industry is poised for substantial growth in the long term, driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States. The company is expected to continue to benefit from ageing demographics of the U.S. population and higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment. Notably, the company is on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. Lately, it announced completion of National Readmission Prevention Collaborative certification program by a clinical programs team, which handles home healthcare programs.Additionally, the company’s strong cash balance position bolsters our confidence in the stock.On the flip side, we anticipate synergies from the Tenet Healthcare acquisition to escalate costs and operating expenses, weighing on the company’s margins. Also, an intense competitive landscape and regulatory concerns continue to pose challenges in the home health and hospice industry.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

The company’s sales to assets ratio of 1.19, compared with the industry’s ratio of 0.64, signifies it as a solid growth stock. Moreover, the projected sales growth rate of 10.1% surpassed the industry’s rate of 7.2%.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.IDEXX Laboratories continues to display strong growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations, demonstrating bountiful opportunities.The stellar topline performance over the past few quarters was driven by the company’s companion animal business. The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. In the last-reported second quarter, management’s unique innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. Moreover, the strong top-line growth in this quarter was driven by considerable contributions from other business segments.Also, IDEXX Laboratories recently announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the company’s high reliance on third-party distributors. IDEXX Laboratories faces higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count, portfolio expansion and higher investments targeted toward geographical expansion in the United States and internationally. Moreover, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on the company’s performance.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

The stellar performance was driven by the company’s increase in the average net Medicare reimbursement rate and average daily census.Continuing with the momentum, the raised outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and earnings per share is indicative of the company’s anticipated improved operating results in the upcoming quarters. This, in turn, boosts investors’ optimism on the stock.In fact, the raised view was backed by the Chemed’s expectation of significant gains from its Roto-Rooter business.Within Chemed’s VITAS business, management noted that the recent admission trends have been positive and is expected to continue in the coming quarters. During second-quarter 2017, VITAS performed well, financially and operationally, thereby surpassing the company’s estimates.Additionally, the company’s strong cash balance enables it to carry out share repurchase programs, providing solid returns to investors.However, headwinds like reimbursement-related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges for Chemed.  Also, a tweaked guidance for Medicare Cap billing limitations is a matter of concern.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report)and Amedisys, Inc (AMED  -  Free Report).

1054,EW,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) has moved a step forward within its core Breast Health business with another new product added to its kitty. The company has announced to have commercially launched the Brevera breast biopsy system with CorLumina imaging technology in the United States.Per the company, this real-time breast biopsy and verification system enhances workflow and patient experience, streamlining the entire biopsy process. Notably, the Brevera system claims to be world’s first and only breast biopsy solution, combining tissue acquisition, real-time imaging, sample verification and advanced post-biopsy handling into one integrated system. Designed for 2D and 3D breast biopsy, this technical method increases biopsy accuracy with real-time imaging, thus helping to perform fast and efficient procedures in a cost saving manner.Per Hologic, this new advancement is a major breakthrough by the radiologists, who were hitherto conducting stereotactic breast biopsy procedures to diagnose breast cancer. This conventional practice is time-consuming as well as uncomfortable for patients. Whereas with the Brevera system, image tissue samples can be obtained right in the procedure room within a few seconds only. Good news is that this highly sophisticated technology will potentially save up to 10 minutes per patient, cutting the procedure time almost by 25%.Hologic also claims the Brevera system’s proprietary CorLumina imaging technology to help improve workflow across multiple departments within a health system. It also features PACS integration for advanced image sharing and transfer of patient records.Significantly, within its breast health segment, Hologic has reshaped its R&D strategy toward continuous innovation around its leadership position in 3D mammography. Besides the latest Brevera routine, there is Affirm prone biopsy system.Management is hopeful that Brevera will begin to boost growth in 2017 and add more meaningful contribution in 2018. Also in June, Hologic had announced that the FDA labeled its Genius 3D Mammography exam as better than the standard 2D mammography for routine breast cancer screening of women with dense breasts.While Hologic is pretty confident about the strong adoption of its Brevera breast biopsy system in the market, we look forward to the company’s consistent efforts to flourish in the field of women’s health. In this regard, it is important to mention about the immense growth opportunities the healthcare market holds at present.Per the data provided by Markets and Markets, the breast imaging market is expected to reach $4.14 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2016. However, more searches reveal the global breast biopsy market to advance at a CAGR of 10.70% during the period 2017-2021 (per Research and Markets data, published in Business Wire).Over the last three months, the company’s share price has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has lost 13.3% compared with the broader industry’s fall of 0.7%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHologic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1055,EW,"Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report) has recently obtained the required antitrust clearance related to the earlier-announced purchase of all outstanding ordinary shares of Patheon N.V. . On Aug 7, 2017, competition authorities in Brazil approved of this transaction and initiated a 15-day comment period, which expired on Aug 22, 2017. Additionally, the European Commission sanctioned the takeover on Aug 23.Notably, in May, Thermo Fisher (CN) Luxembourg S.à r.l., a wholly owned subsidiary of the leading scientific instrument maker agreed to acquire Netherlands-based Patheon. The latter is a global provider of high-quality drug solutions to pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors. On completion of the deal, Patheon will become a part of Thermo Fisher’s Laboratory Products and Services segment.Total transaction value was fixed at around $7.2 billion, including the assumption of approximately $2.0 billion of net debt. The acquisition is expected to wrap up by the end of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.Basically, Patheon offers comprehensive and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies satisfy complex developments and manufacturing needs. It is a leader in the high-growth, $40 billion Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) market. The company with extensive network in North America and Europe had generated revenues of approximately $1.9 billion in 2016.Notably, Thermo Fisher has been doing well for quite some time. For the last three months, the company has been trading above the industry. The stock has inched up 2% as against the industry’s 0.2% decline during the period.Per the latest reported second-quarter 2017, revenues from the Laboratory Products and Services Segment grew 4% year over year. This segment serves laboratory customers with equipment and consumables improving productivity and a range of BioPharma outsourcing services. It also includes the company’s research and safety market customer channels.Thermo Fisher considers Patheon’s purchase as a strategic fit to expand biopharma services in Europe. Per management, the combined entity should significantly strengthen the acquirer’s unique value proposition for pharmaceutical and biotech customers by adding highly complementary services.The consolidation is also expected to prove accretive to Thermo Fisher’s adjusted earnings per share in the first full year post the merger’s completion. Management also expects to realize total synergies of approximately $120 million by the third year following the closure of the deal, which consists of roughly $90 million of cost synergies and $30 million of adjusted operating income benefit from revenue-related synergies.Per a recent MarketsandMarkets report, the global laboratory equipment services market is projected to reach worth $11.51 billion by 2021 from $6.50 billion in 2016, at a CAGR of 10.0% during the forecast period. Growth in this market is primarily led by an increasing research in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with the urgent need for timely and effective diagnosis of diseases. We expect Thermo Fisher to cash in on this opportunity in order to gain traction in a potentially strong new market.Zacks Rank & Key PicksThermo Fisher currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1056,EW,"Kalamazoo, MI-based Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market, recently announced the voluntary product recall of the Oral Care lineup, which was offered by the company’s Sage-Products unit.Added to the voluntary recall, Stryker has placed a temporary hold on certain cloth-based products. The decision followed complaints of minor irritation and allergic reactions from consumers. However, management expects to reinitiate product shipment by September and expects to begin full supply capacity by the end of the year.The share price of Stryker slipped 1.9% to close at $138.36 following the news release.What Led to the Recall?The recall pertains to a cross-contamination issue in the Oral-care solutions which were manufactured for Sage by a third-party supplier. Notably, these solutions were distributed in markets between July 2015 and August 2017.However, Stryker affirmed that it has closed its business with the third-party supplier. In fact, Sage has resumed production of the oral care solutions.Coming to the temporary hold decision of the cloth-based products, the FDA expressed concerns regarding the ongoing microbiological testing methods for all products under the Sage platform. Now the FDA has instructed Stryker products to be verified using a new ‘compendial microbiological method’. Undoubtedly, the new method is more time consuming and complex than the one previously used at Sage.Notably, the FDA had warned Stryker about these issues in July.Product Recall Hurts GuidanceThe recall is likely to adversely impact the company’s sales and operating income. For the full year, Stryker now expects organic sales growth at the low end of its previously issued guidance band of 6.5% to 7.0%. Added to this, the company announced that net earnings per diluted share are expected at the low end of the $6.45-$6.55 range.For the third quarter, Stryker estimates adjusted net earnings per diluted share at the low end of its previously issued $1.50-$1.55 band.Stryker has been grappling with supply issues in the spine business for long which may prove to be a major drawback in the quarters ahead. In fact, international growth of the company’s Spine segment in the second quarter of 2017 was partially affected by these supply headwinds.Stock Performance at a GlanceStryker's share price movement over the past one year has been favorable. The company yielded a return of almost 22.1%, better than the broader industry's only 8%. Solid performances by the MedSurg and Neurotech segments in the last reported quarter hold promise. Strength in the international segments on strong momentum in Europe and China also buoys optimism.Zacks Rank & Key PicksStryker has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

The target company provides services to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the state of Minnesota.Coming back to the news, we feel that the acquisition is a smart move on the part of the company. Habilitative Services operates in 22 counties in Minnesota. It provides a continuum of residential and periodic services. Habilitative Services supports approximately 360 adults in 86 residential sites and another 180 individuals in periodic programs.

The stock has gained 13.7%, compared with only 3.9% rise of the industry it belongs to.Civitas Solutions is a leading national provider of home and community-based health and human services to individuals with intellectual, developmental, physical or behavioral disabilities and other special needs.Going forward, we are encouraged by the company’s progress in Post-Acute Specialty Rehabilitation Services (SRS) and Adult Day Health (ADH) services, two of its fastest growing businesses. Moreover, the company is witnessing steady contributions from its strategy to grow organically and through acquisitions. Also, even though the company seems to be implementing its cost restructuring program efficiently, weak margins may continue to mar its financials.Also, the company recently slashed its 2017 guidance.

1059,EW,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report), which manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Align Technology has been trading above the industry since last month. The stock has gained 4.2% in this period as compared to 7.3% decline of the industry. The company’s strong InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and international regions look encouraging.In EMEA, second-quarter 2017 volumes surged 33.2% year over year, reflecting a continued adoption of InvisAlign Technology in core markets like the U.K. and Spain as well as rapid growth from expansion in new markets including Eastern Europe, Central Europe and Benelux. During the reported quarter, volumes soared 44.4% year over year in the Asia Pacific belt, led by China and followed by SouthEast Asia, Japan and ANZ (Australia and New Zealand).Great news is that the company has recently opened a new InvisAlign Technology Treatment Planning facility in China. Plus, a multimillion dollar marketing campaign for InvisAlign Technology brand promotion is also likely to keep investors upbeat. The company’s receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack Aligner material no doubt buoys optimism.On the contrary, foreign exchange headwinds continue to pose a major dampener to the company’s international performance. Also escalating costs and expenses are weighing on its margins. Last month, a comparative study of Align Technology’s forward P/E (forward 12-month basis) multiple reflected that the stock has been quite overvalued.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1060,EW,"Leading healthcare diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp recently inked a distribution agreement with Roswell Park Cancer Institute’s molecular diagnostics subsidiary, OmniSeq, Inc.Per the deal terms, LabCorp will distribute OmniSeq’s Immune Report Card and OmniSeq Comprehensive clinical assays across the United States and outside.The company will get an exclusive right to distribute these OmniSeq tests to U.S.-based physicians through Integrated Oncology, a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group, and globally to biopharmaceutical customers via its Covance Drug Development arm.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price  Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings price | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteAlso, the chief scientific officer of LabCorp Diagnostics, Marcia Eisenberg, will join OmniSeq’s board of directors. Plus, LabCorp has plans to participate in OmniSeq’s Series B financing round. This financing will be used to conduct OmniSeq’s ongoing retrospective and prospective clinical trials as well as to generate further evidence of the clinical utility of OmniSeq’s comprehensive genomic and immune profiling services.Notably, Immune Report Card is a comprehensive immune profiling test, designed to inform oncologists regarding checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment decisions. This combines results for all common biomarker assays relevant to checkpoint inhibitors as well as other informative analyses. Per OmniSeq, this assessment will provide a comprehensive immune profile to help in identifying 20-40% patients, who are likely to respond to CPI monotherapy.On the other hand, OmniSeq Comprehensive assay is a 144-gene, pan-cancer, next-generation sequencing tumor profiling diagnostic panel. It helps oncologists to determine a particular line of treatment.Considering the fact that both Immune Report Card and OmniSeq Comprehensive trials have received the New York State’s Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program’s approval, we expect this alliance to help LabCorp broaden its customer base in cancer immunotherapy diagnostics space. Notably, this market is growing in leaps and bounds in recent times.Per the data provided by Radiant Insights, Inc. as published in Cision PR Newswrites, global cancer immunotherapies market is expected to witness a CAGR of 23.9% by 2022. Hence, we believe LabCorp’s latest decision to widen its position in this market is perfectly strategic.As part of its key tactical plans, LabCorp is consistently working hard on new innovations with academic institutions to capture the growing lab testing market with its advanced assays and tools.During the second quarter of 2017, the company has opened a state-of-the-art companion diagnostics laboratory in North Carolina and delivered a double-digit increase in year-over-year revenues aided by continued growth in immuno-oncology services.The company also won $100 million in companion diagnostic-related awards during the first half of the year. Its pipeline comprises a diverse range of oncology and non-oncology indications with new and established clients that might position it well for consistent growth in the future.LabCorp’s latest partnership with OmniSeq as well as its decision to invest for latter’s research and development should add further momentum to the company’s growth trajectory.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1061,EW,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) released interesting data indicating substantial potential in the flu vaccination market of the United States. Data confirmed that about 61% of the American population is either taking or planning to take a flu vaccination every year. Moreover, data also revealed a 2% rise in the flu vaccination taking population compared to the previous year’s survey results.Interestingly, CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic locations across the United States recently began offering flu vaccinations. Notably, CVS Health’s Pharmacy Services witnessed a 9.5% rise in the last reported second-quarter 2017. Also, revenues at MinuteClinic rose 8% year over year. We believe that the affirmative survey data will help the company gain traction in this space.Also, the survey’s findings indicate a 7% rise in employed flu vaccine receivers that prefer to get vaccinated at their workplace in partnership with local pharmacy or drugstore.Notably, the company has been on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. In August 2017, CVS Health and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) announced the launch of Cigna Health Works. Per the collaboration, leveraged on CVS Pharmacy and CVS MinuteClinic, retail health care services will be available for Cigna self-funded employer-sponsored health plans.Also, in July 2017, MinuteClinic partneredwith Alere eScreen Occupational Health Network whereby employees can visit MinuteClinic for a wide range of services required by employers including biometric screenings and vaccinations. Thus we believe the positive survey data further amplifies the importance of these strategic partnerships.Per a report by ReportsnReports, the Global Influenza Drugs and Vaccines market is projected to witness a CAGR of 10.2% over the 2017-2022 period. Thus, favorable survey findings further indicate the array of untapped opportunities available within this space. We believe an aging population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the vaccinations market. However, this market is dominated by well established player like Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (EBS  -  Free Report).Moreover, CVS Health has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results.

1066,EW,"In a bid to expand its advanced materials science range, NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) recently announced the Vertera Spine buyout.

This deal will also lend the company a three-dimensional porous interbody technology across both polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium materials. Notably, the company has introduced a few new features in its Modulus XLIF built on a fully-porous titanium implant created in a three-dimensional manufacturing process and designed to match the porosity and stiffness of bone.We encouragingly note that the company’s U.S. Spinal Hardware business, comprising implants and fixation products, MAGEC-EOS spinal bracing and lengthening system and the PRECICE limb lengthening system, registered 3% growth in the last reported quarter. NuVasive is leaving no stone unturned to gain traction in the fast growing spine market. In this regard, the company has been steadily focusing on product development.  Moreover, the company claims to have an active corporate development pipeline that includes a number of strategic investments, acquisitions and partnership opportunities. Notably, during the first quarter of 2017, the company launched the first two interbody devices, MLX and TLX, used in lumbar fusion procedures.Per a report from BECKER’s SPINE REVIEW, the global minimally-invasive spine surgery market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.6% between 2017 and 2021. Also, per a report by Technavio, the global spinal implants market is expected to witness a CAGR of roughly 6% in the 2016-2020 period.Thus, given the current market potential, we believe that the company is on the right track to gain traction.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the minimally-invasive spine surgery market. However, this market is dominated by many well-established players like Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report).

1067,EW,"On Sep 7, we issued an updated research report on Cincinnati, OH-based Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the last six months, Chemed has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.1% as against the industry’s decline of 5.1%. Improvement in average net Medicare reimbursement rate and an increase in average daily census during the recently-reported second quarter were encouraging.The raised outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and earnings per share is indicative of the company’s anticipated improved operating results in the upcoming quarters, which in turn boosts investors’ optimism on the stock.Notably, Chemed’s VITAS business had been in trouble over the past few quarters due to certain admission coding changes initiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). However, management noted the recent admission trends to be positive and that should continue in the coming quarters as well.In terms of Roto-Rooter business, the company continues to display a robust performance on the strength of core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments. It also prompted a solid rise in water restoration. Management increased expectations to achieve Roto-Rooter full-year 2017 revenue growth of 12-13%, much higher than the earlier projected range of 3-4%. Revenue estimates are based on increased job pricing of approximately 2% and continued growth in water restoration services.However, headwinds like reimbursement-related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges for Chemed.  Also, a tweaked guidance for Medicare Cap billing limitations is a matter of concern.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

1068,EW,"Shares of Inogen Inc. (INGN  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $101.14 on Sep 7, closing a tad lower at $100.79. This represents a strong year-to-date return of approximately 50.1%, higher than the S&P 500’s 10.2% over the same time frame. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Taking the stable stock performance into consideration, we expect Inogen to scale higher in the coming quarters. Also, the company’s long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20% is higher than the broader industry’s 18.3%.For the majority of the last three months, the company’s share price has considerably outperformed the broader industry. The stock has rallied 10.9% over the last three months, beating the industry’s gain of just 3.7% over the same time frame.Factors Driving the StockGuidance Upbeat: Banking on the solid performance in the last quarter, Inogen raised its 2017 revenue and adjusted net income guidance. Moreover, the company narrowed its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance.Inogen projects revenues in the range of $239 million to $243 million, higher than the previous range of $233 million to $239 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 17.8%-19.8%, up from the previous range of 14.9%-17.8%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $48 million-$50 million, compared to $46 million-$50 million estimated earlier. This represents an increase of 10.6% to 15.2% as compared with the year-ago quarter’s 6%-15.2%. Inogen expects adjusted net income in the range of $25 million-$27 million, up from the previous band of $22 million-$24 million.Unique Direct-to-Customer Business Model: Notably, Inogen has a market cap of $1.99 billion. The company’s direct-to-customer business model has lent it a leading position in the oxygen therapy market. The direct-to-consumer model gives companies an opportunity to build a unique brand relationship directly with customers. In an initiative to support growth in the direct-to-consumer line of business, the company had announced that it has secured an additional facility in the Cleveland, OH area.Solid Q2 Results: Inogen reported a stellar second quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. Solid domestic and international business-to-business sales drove revenues. In fact, the company expects direct-to-consumer sales to be its fastest growing channel, followed by domestic business-to-business sales in the coming quarters, with solid focus on Europe.Bright Prospects in LTOT Space: Inogen develops, manufactures and markets portable oxygen concentrators (POC). The company recently announced the receipt of EC Certificate for the Inogen One G4 platform, which will be available for sale in select international countries. We believe an expanding Long-Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) market, advantages of POCs over traditional delivery model, direct-to-customer business model, underpenetrated international markets and expanding product portfolio are key growth catalysts.Favorable Estimate Revision Trend: Inogen’s estimate revision trend has been promising for the full year. In the last two months, three estimates moved north compared to no movement in the opposite direction. Full-year estimates rose almost 9% to $1.20 per share over the same time frame.For the current quarter, two estimates moved up, compared to one downward revision in the last two months.

1070,EW,"Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), commonly known as BD, recently announced an agreement with Italy-based Euroclone for the development and global distribution of molecular assays. The molecular assays are exclusively formulated to detect sexually-transmitted pathogens.In fact, BD has been a leading player in providing solutions for women's health and sexually transmitted infections (STI).Notably, the company’s latest development closely follows its recent launch of BD Ultra-Fine micro pen needle 6mm x 32G for use with pen injection devices. The needles offer comfortable injection experience, enhancing customer satisfaction. The device is slated for distribution this month.Coming back to the news, BD and Euroclone plan to launch these molecular assays outside of the United States from 2018.The molecular assays leverage on the company’s flagship platform BD MAX System to detect infectious genital mycoplasmas, including Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species, which are generally unidentifiable by the conventional methods. However, the assays are currently not available for sale in the United States.Per management, the addition of these assays to the existing BD MAX portfolio along with the company’s other assays like BD SurePath and the BD Onclarity HPV assay is likely fortify the company’s foothold in clinical laboratories for testing STI.Impressive Stock PerformanceShare prices of BD inched up 0.5% to close at $194 following the news release.

Additionally, a diverse revenue base and increased adoption of the company’s new and existing products are expected to drive its top-line growth.Meanwhile, the latest development is likely to maintain the company’s international footprint.

Of the recent developments, orders for the newly unveiled Radixact System, solid revenue performance in APAC and Japanese regulatory approval for Radixact are key positives in our view. However, unfavorable product mix, declining service revenues, sluggish macro economic conditions and pricing headwinds are major concerns. Notably, China and Europe saw sluggish revenues in the fourth quarter. Accuray’s significant international presence helps broaden its customer base. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly with a strong dollar, will continue to adversely impact the company’s backlog and top line in the coming quarters.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1076,EW,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently initiated a post-market FORWARD PRO Clinical Study to measure the performance of CoreValve Evolut PRO transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system in regular clinical treatments.This study will evaluate the long-term performance of the next-generation self-expanding TAVI system in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and who are at an intermediate, high or extreme risk for open heart surgery. Notably, this system has recently been approved for commercial use in Europe and the United States.Per management, this multi-center study will enroll 600 patients across 35 sites in Europe. Moreover, the study involves measuring the safety standards of CoreValve Evolut PRO valves by analyzing the all-cause mortality and all stroke rates at 30 days along with clinical performance covering valve hemodynamics and paravalvular regurgitation. Moreover per the company, patients will be continued to be followed and evaluated out to five years.We encouragingly note that, in March 2017, the CoreValve Evolut PRO system had received FDA approval for use on symptomatic patients who are at high or extreme risk for open heart surgery. Moreover, this self-expanding TAVI system has been granted regulatory approval in Europe as well. Thus, we believe a clinical study data displaying the efficiency of the product will help the company gain traction in the Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) space.Interestingly, Medtronic’s CSH revenues were up 7% (8% at constant exchange rate) to $817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe.Notably, per a report by Medgadget, the global heart valve repair and replacement market is expected to grow from $2,281.2 million in 2014 to $3,767.0 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 8.7%.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Medtronic is based in a highly fragmented heart valve repair and replacement market.

1077,EW,"World Heart Day is observed every year on September 29 to raise awareness across the world about cardiovascular (CV) diseases. CV diseases, more commonly known as heart disease or stroke, are basically diseases of the heart or blood vessels.According to the World Heart Federation, CV diseases are the biggest killers in the world accounting for 17.5 million deaths every year with the number expected to cross 23 million by 2030. Some of the factors contributing to these numbers include uncontrolled hypertension, high cholesterol levels, obesity, smoking, diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle.The theme this World Heart Day is “Share the Power” with the focus on inspiring people across the world to be heart healthy. The focus is on creating heart-healthy environments that will help reduce cardiovascular risk be it at work or at home. Simple changes in lifestyle including healthy eating, exercising, lower alcohol consumption and giving up smoking are some of the ways to cut or even prevent the risk of CV diseases.According to the FDA, 2,200 people die from cardiovascular disease every day in the United States – this adds up to about 815,000 Americans every year. Given these statistics, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies devote a significant amount of R&D dollars on developing treatments and devices for cardiovascular and other diseases that increase the risk of heart issues. According to a GBI Research report, more than 1,400 products are in active development for CV diseases with the focus being on four main indications – hypertension, heart failure, dyslipidemia and thrombosis.Importantly, it is not just healthcare companies that are involved in the fitness segment – with many CV diseases being preventable by addressing behavioral risk factors like food consumption, smoking and lack of exercise, people are becoming more conscious about their health. This has led to tech companies coming out with fitness trackers that help keep track of heart rates, calories burned and sleep patterns all of which help in the management of lifestyle diseases like diabetes and obesity.With World Heart Day coming up, let’s take a look at some well-positioned stocks in this segment of the market.  BioTelemetry, Inc.

1078,EW,"After Trump’s failed efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump introduced the “skinny” repeal that calls for doing away with parts of Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare like “individual mandate,” “employer mandate” and “Cadillac taxes”.Last month, the Republicans lost the debate over skinny repeal. The United States witnessed a political dilemma after three Republicans voted in favor of the existing Healthcare Act. They probably decided to support the existing Healthcare Act based on data provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). As per the report, with the abolition of Obamacare, another 17 million people will be uninsured in 2018, 27 million more in 2020 and the count is expected to increase to 32 million in 2026.The cancellation or withdrawal of the individual and employer mandate might have made health insurance and contracted health insurance coverage expensive. This will significantly dent demand for healthcare services, impacting the medical device industry as a whole.However, the MedTech industry is looking forward to the abolishment of the major healthcare taxes, including Cadillac tax and the 2.3% MedTech tax. Although the Republicans failed to pass the skinny repeal, it has been able to delay the Cadillac tax until 2026.Thanks to the postponement of the Cadillac tax, the medical device industry is hopeful that the 2.3% medical device tax would be eradicated soon.In such a mixed scenario, we feel investors should place their bets on large cap stocks that delivered positive average earnings surprises in the last reported four quarters and are witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates.Stocks to PickWe have selected four medical device stocks with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener (hyperlink) to shortlist Medical Device stocks which are poised for impressive returns over the next five years.

1080,EW,"Headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, Accuray Inc. (ARAY  -  Free Report) recently announced that the Boise-based Summit Cancer Center has initiated cancer treatment with its Radixact Treatment Delivery System. Notably, the Radixact system leverages on the company’s flagship TomoTherapy platform.Radixact system provides complex treatments such as craniospinal and total marrow irradiation. Added to these functionalities, Summit Cancer Center has the capability to perform stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) while sparing normal tissues and maintaining optimal treatment efficacy.The Radixact System has been designed to deliver image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy, an extremely precise form of radiation therapy. The platform gained Japanese regulatory approval (Shonin approval) in the last quarter and is expected to start formal treatments from the fourth quarter.In this regard, a glimpse at the preliminary fourth-quarter results reveals that Accuray expects approximately $86 million of gross product orders. Solid growth in gross orders is buoyed by the full commercial launch of the Radixact system and continued strong demand for the company’s flagship CyberKnife system.Stock Price & Estimate Revision TrendAccuray has had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one year. The company has lost 23.7%, way wider than the broader industry’s rally of almost 2.4%. Moreover, the current level compares unfavorably with the S&P 500’s 11% gain.Furthermore, the estimate revision for the stock has been unfavorable. The full-year estimates deteriorated 3 cents to a loss of 28 cents per share. Owing to the bearish analyst sentiments, Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which signifies underperformance in the near term.Our TakeAccuray’s top-line growth is highly dependent on CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems sales. However, both systems involve significant capital spending, which many healthcare providers are reluctant to spend, primarily due to the sluggish macro-economic conditions. This might mar revenues over the long haul.However, the company has been gaining ground on a series of positive tidings on the regulatory front recently. Of the notable ones, Accuray received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its iDMS Data Management System in July.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1082,EW,"Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. But the question here is why? This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!This metric is also considered the most significant variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a vital role in determining share price movement.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.So, what are earnings estimates?

Allscripts’ products have a long sales cycle which involves decision-making at different managerial levels. This increases the company’s operating expenses.Added to this, the lingering global economic weakness presents a substantial risk for Allscripts.

1091,EW,"On Sep 15, we issued an updated research report on San Francisco, CA-based McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), a health care services and information technology company. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past month, McKesson has been trading above the broader industry. Per the last trading price, the stock has gained 2.6%, higher than the broader market’s gain of 2.3%. The company continues to witness strong growth in pharma and biotech backed by solid market fundamentals and planned growth strategy. The raised 2017 guidance is also encouraging.McKesson delivered disappointing results in the recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter saw strong performance by the Distribution Solutions segment. The segment is expected to remain consistent with its performance in fiscal 2018 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. To boost growth, the company recently acquired CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion.Coming to guidance, the Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to witness robust growth on a year-over-year basis. The upside is expected to be driven by market growth and acquisitions. McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.10-$9.00 for the fiscal ending Mar 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings for the same period are expected in the range of $11.80-$12.50 per diluted share.On the flipside, pricing pressure in the independent retail pharmacy channel is a headwind. McKesson entered fiscal 2018 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single digits and its first quarter slightly surpassed expectations.McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes. The company continues to witness a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the United States. However, it expects to overcome the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018.Cutthroat competition in the niche markets, currency headwinds and reimbursement issues remain challenges.Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend for McKesson has been unfavorable at the moment. For the current quarter, six analysts moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, magnitude of full-year estimates fell 4.8% to $2.76.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks in the medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc (LNTH  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report).  Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Lantheus Holdings and IDEXX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Notably, there are also quite a few scientific research partners of Walgreens, all dedicated to enhance healthcare values. These academic institutes are Johns Hopkins Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health besides the Scripps Translational Science Institute, the University of California, San Francisco - School of Pharmacy and the University of Chicago Medicine.Several research studies have already been published by the entire team. One such study is on pharmacy patients enrolled in Medicare Prescription Drug Plans.

1094,EW,"Medication and supply management and adherence tools provider Omnicell, Inc. (OMCL  -  Free Report) recently advanced its Patient Management Access Portal (PMAP) with four new enhancements to help it improve patient outcome.Notably, this single, web-based portal hosts functionality to guide and track patient notes, interventions and appointments. It also provides a detailed information on the patients to the respective pharmacist by identifying, preparing and documenting the ongoing patient engagement.The latest enhancements to the PMAP include Targeted Adherence Interventions for patients, who are new to chronic therapy. Also, there is a Time My Meds dashboard, providing pharmacists with individualized performance snapshots. These enhancements also consist of single sign-on integration with a third party software, helping the pharmasists assist patients with a Medicare plan option and Immunization Solutions to aid in identifying those in need of vaccinations while simplifying a pharmacist’s workflow.Per Omnicell, all these advancements will together make PMAP a more comprehensive web portal, prompting the pharmacists to provide a personalized care to medically complex patients while maintaining effective services. Further good news is that this initiative will lead to curbing healthcare costs.Per the data provided by Omnicell, currently more than 30 million Americans are taking five or more maintenance medications daily. However, only half of all chronic-condition patients, who require medications, do not take them as prescribed. This accounts for a 30-50% of all treatment failures and 125,000 deaths annually. With people gradually realizing the importance of medication adherence, the market potential of PMAP-like web portals seems huge. We expect this latest feature-enhancement of PMAP to result in better market adoption of the system.For most part of the past three months, Omnicell’s share price consistently underperformed the industry. However, the company has picked up some steam post its impressive second-quarter results with a year-over-year increase in both earnings and revenues. Accordingly, the stock has surged 24.2%, significantly ahead of the industry’s 4.6% gain. With Omnicell putting efforts in product innovation through research and development, we expect the company to maintain this bullish momentum going ahead.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOmnicell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

1095,EW,"STERIS Plc (STE  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 85 cents, up 7.6% from the year-ago quarter. This adjusted EPS figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents.On a reported basis, the quarter’s EPS came in at 68 cents, up 21.4% year over year.Revenues in DetailSTERIS generated revenues of $608 million, down 4.8% year over year. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $596 million. The year-over-year decline was a result of foreign currency fluctuations as well as divested businesses. Organic revenue growth at constant currency was 6% year over year, primarily driven by balanced growth in all segments.STERIS PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise STERIS PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | STERIS PLC QuoteThe company operates through four segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences.Revenues from the Healthcare Products segment inched up 2% year over year to $289.1 million in the reported quarter. This was driven by 7% growth in service revenue and a 2% increase in capital equipment revenue, which in turn were partially offset by a 1% dip in Consumables due to divestitures. Revenues from the Healthcare Specialty Services segment plunged 25.4% to $113.4 million on a reported basis due to divestitures. However, organic revenues grew 11%, reflecting growth at IMS North America and CSD outsourcing business in Europe.On the other hand, revenues from Applied Sterilization Technologies rose 2% to $124.5 million and organic revenue growth was 6%, on the back of an increased volume from the segment`s core medical device customers.Lastly, revenues from the Life Sciences segment dropped 1% to $80.9 million in the quarter as 5% growth in Service revenue and 2% increase in consumable revenues were more than offset by a 12% decrease in capital equipment revenues. On an organic basis, revenues nudged up 1% year over year. MarginsAdjusted gross margin improved 410 basis points (bps) year over year to 42.3% in the reported quarter. This expansion was on account of the positive impact of divested low-margin businesses,improvements in operational efficiencies, a favorable foreign currency, plus cost synergies and pricing.STERIS witnessed a 2.6% year-over-year rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $155.8 million. Research and development expenses fell 2.8% to $14 million. Adjusted operating margin expanded 265 bps on a year-over-year basis to 14.2% in the reported quarter.Financial DetailsSTERIS exited the first-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $294.8 million compared with $282.9 million at the end of fiscal 2017. The company had a long-term debt of $1.49 billion at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018 compared with $1.48 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.The company generated $80.7 million in cash flow from operations in first quarter, up 0.5% from the year-ago period. Free cash flow for this period was $44.2 million compared with $49.5 million in the prior-year time frame.2018 GuidanceSTERIS continues to expect 4–5% of organic revenue growth on constant-currency basis in fiscal 2018 from the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $3.96–$4.09 per share.Our TakeSTERIS posted better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is a disappointment. On a positive note, organic growth performance was strong across all the segments. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. Recently, the company has made a couple of organizational changes, expected to better align with its operations.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSTERIS currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1096,EW,"BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report) reported net loss from continuing operations of 11 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, compared to net loss of 8 cents a year ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of 10 cents. RevenuesWith the completion of the company’s non-core PBM business divestment (treated as discontinued operation in the previous quarter), BioScrip currently has a simplified business structure focused on core Infusion Services.Revenues from continuing operations in the second quarter fell 6.2% year over year to $218.1 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $220 million. The year-over-year decline was due to the company’s shift in strategy to focus on growing its core revenue mix coupled with the impact of the Cures Act along with and contract modifications with UnitedHealthcare. This was partially offset by synergies from the Home Solutions acquisition.BioScrip, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BioScrip, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BioScrip, Inc. QuoteGross profit in the second quarter was $68.3 million, up 6.5% year over year. Gross margin also expanded 370 basis points (bps) to 31.3%.

This guidance incorporates the estimated adverse effect of the Cures Act legislation and the company's estimates regarding its contract with UnitedHealthcare. The company has updated its revenue outlook for 2017 to a range of $815.0–$835.0 million including the impact of the revised UnitedHealthcare contract on its 2017 revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $855.2 million lies above the company’s guided range.Our TakeBioScrip exited the second quarter on a dismal note with wider-than-expected loss and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Management’s 2017 guidance, which includes the negative impact of the Cures Act legislation, also adds to our concerns.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s progress in the second quarter, courtesy of its new multi-faceted CORE plan which was adopted to improve the financial position. Further, the company achieved annualized supply chain improvement of roughly $20 million since the acquisition of Home Solutions’. The company expects core revenues at Home Solutions and continued core growth to prove accretive.

1097,EW,"BioTelemetry Inc. (BEAT  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 23 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents and the year-ago equivalent by a couple of cents.Revenue DetailsRevenues increased 10.3% year over year to $58.1 million, almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $58 million. The upside has been primarily driven by a $1.9 million increase in Healthcare revenues owing to rising MCOT patients. However, this was partially offset by the $1-million impact from the slower Medicare rate effective Jan 1.Notably, this marked the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.Meanwhile, research revenues increased $1.6 million, led by imaging study volume growth and the full quarter impact of the acquisition of VirtualScopics, partially offset by lower cardiac revenues. Technology revenues increased by $1.9 million on higher sales of wireless blood glucose monitors through the Telcare division.BioTelemetry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BioTelemetry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BioTelemetry, Inc. QuoteMarginsGross profits increased 9.3% from the year-ago quarter to $35.9 million, primarily driven by increased revenues. The gross margin contracted 62 basis points (bps) due to the impact of the Medicare rate reduction and the 2016 acquisition which carries lower margins than the existing businesses. The decline was partially offset by volume driven efficiencies.Adjusted operating expenses totaled $24.5 million, reflecting a 4.4% increase from the year-ago quarter. The upside was led by increases in selling and marketing (S&M) and research and development (R&D) expenses by 7.1% and 27.9% year over year, respectively.Meanwhile, adjusted operating margin expanded 178 bps to 19.7%.Financial UpdateBioTelemetry exited the second quarter of 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $26.9 million, as compared with $25.1 million at the end of the first quarter.GuidancePost the acquisition of LifeWatch, BioTelemetry currently expects full-year 2017 revenue in the range of $285 million to $290 million.

We are encouraged to note that the company is putting efforts in product innovation through research and development. The company recently completed the acquisition of LifeWatch AG.

Fresenius also expects integration costs of about $150 million over the next three years from the time of announcement.Per management, the takeover will boost revenues at the Care Coordination segment. In this regard, in the last quarter, margins at Care Coordination declined substantially on a year-over-year basis owing to lower profits in vascular services and higher costs in pharmacy services. We believe the latest development will help the company counter the pressure on margins.Growth-Strategy 2020 at a GlancePer management, the latest development is a significant step to boost the company’s grand long-term goal.

Per the first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Subscription revenues were significantly up on strength in Entrada. We believe the EagleDream Health acquisition will also prove accretive to the company.Notably, the company has successfully added Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) solutions, Analytics, Patient Management and Regulatory and Clinical tools to its product portfolio through acquisitions. We believe that the company will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that will not only expand its product portfolio but also strengthen its competitive position.Per a report byMedGadget, the healthcare information systems market is expected to reach a value of $53.2 billion by 2019, at a CAGR of 7.1%.Considering the market potential and Quality Systems’ current developments, this acquisition seems to be a strategic one.Quality Systems has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results.

The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings rose around 3.9% to $3.17 per share over the same time frame.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one. Recently, IDEXX ended the second quarter of 2017 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The stellar quarterly performance was driven by the company’s companion animal business. The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Management’s unique innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. Moreover, the strong top-line growth in this quarter was driven by considerable contributions from the rest of the business segments.Also, IDEXX recently announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations, demonstrating the bountiful opportunities.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the company’s high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company faces higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion in the United States and internationally, and portfolio expansion.

Post collaboration, Align Technology’s Invisalign clear aligner treatment will be used by dentists during tooth alignment procedures along with Smile Design protocols.We are also upbeat about the multi-million dollar marketing campaign initiated by the company for its Invisalign brand in order to gain through increased awareness.We are also optimistic about the company expanding work flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align Technology recently launched a software upgrade for its iTero Element intraoral scanners that is capable of comparing patient scans over time with the new TimeLapse technology.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.However, downsides include unfavorable foreign currency that might affect the company’s revenues. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1111,EW,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on San Francisco, CA-based McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), a health care services and information technology company.  McKesson posted disappointing results in first-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The quarter saw strong performance by the Distribution Solutions segment. The segment is expected to keep up its performance in fiscal 2018 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. To boost growth, the company recently acquired CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion.Coming to guidance, the Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to witness robust growth on a year-over-year basis. The upside is expected to be driven by market growth and acquisitions.McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.10-$9.00 for the fiscal ending Mar 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings for the same period are expected in the range of $11.80-$12.50 per diluted share.On the flipside, pricing pressure in the independent retail pharmacy channel is a headwind. McKesson entered fiscal 2018 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single digits and its first quarter slightly surpassed expectations.McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes. The company continues to see a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. However, McKesson expects to overcome the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018.Furthermore, cutthroat competition in the niche markets, currency headwinds and reimbursement issues remain challenges.Stock Performance and Estimate Revision TrendOver the last three months, McKesson has been trading above the broader industry.

1112,EW,"Medical device major Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) is focusing on expanding its core Coronary and Structural Heart business. Keeping in line with this, the company recently announced a global randomized clinical trial to evaluate one-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients implanted with the Resolute Onyx Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.DAPT is a combination of aspirin and anti-clotting medication. Notably, Resolute Onyx DES is the first DES which works on the Core Wire Technology, an evolution of Continuous Sinusoid Technology (CST).Resolute Onyx DES provides enhanced visibility to surgeons, delivering superior clinical performance.According to Medtronic, the RESOLUTE ONYX ONE-MONTH DAPT study aims to help inform DAPT guidelines for newer-generation DES that currently support bare-metal stents (BMS) for stable ischemic heart disease patients who might require a shorter dual antiplatelet regimen. The study will also demonstrate Medtronic’s clinical investment to provide relevant DAPT evidence to physicians for both current and previous generation DES.DAPT therapy guidelines vary geographically as well as by patient presentation. Duration of DAPT evaluation is made based on individuals along with clinical judgment, evaluating the benefit/risk ratio, product labeling, and patient preference. The study will be based on approximately 2,000 patients worldwide.As per the company’s press release, the RESOLUTE ONYX ONE-MONTH DAPT study outcomes will build on the RESOLUTE Pooled DAPT Interruption analysis that showed no increased risk of stent thrombosis with DAPT interruption or discontinuation after a month.Taking into consideration the huge and growing global coronary stent market, we believe the latest initiative by Medtronic is well timed. Per a report by Transparency Market Research, the global coronary stents market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.6% from 2013 to 2019.Recent Developments on Coronary StentRecently, Medtronic announced that DES has met its primary endpoint of Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at one year for the treatment of coronary artery disease in extra-small vessels.Also, of late, the Resolute Onyx DES received FDA approval.Further, post the successful launch of Resolute Onyx DES in the U.S. in May 2017, Medtronic has started selling it in the Japan market from Jul 10, as per a Cardiovascular Business report released on Jul 7.To note, over the last six months, Medtronic has outperformed the S&P 500 Index. As per the latest share price movement, the company has gained 7.2%, compared to the S&P 500’s 5.2% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per management, an important trial on the combined technological systems is projected to initiate in 2018 at clinical research sites across the U.S.Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 20.2% in first-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the Canadian development, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to value $30.25 billion by 2021 witnessing a CAGR of 5.93%. Moreover, the insulin delivery devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 5.59% to roughly $14.22 billion in 2019.Thus, considering the market potential and Abbott’s current developments in the diabetes care segment, this collaboration seems to be a lucrative and strategically aligned one.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the diabetes market.

Notably, this marked the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. The company also registered growth across all segments. We are encouraged to note that the company is putting efforts in product innovation through research and development. However, a decline in gross margin is a matter of concern.LifeWatch Acquisition: In July, BioTelemetry announced the acquisition of LifeWatch AG in a deal valued at about $280 million. With this buyout, BioTelemetry enhanced its position in the wireless medicine space, expanding its product profile and customer base in the cardiac monitoring and diagnostic services space.Management expects the acquisition to yield significant synergies over the next 12–18 months. Both the companies make products which are utilized for remotely monitoring cardiac care patients.Guidance Strong: The raised full-year 2017 revenue guidance is encouraging.

Management has also maintained high confidence in the continued growth of its commercial plasma collection business.In the quarter, North America Plasma disposables revenues increased 6%.

1116,EW,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Palo Alto, CA-based Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report). The company is the world’s leading provider of radiotherapy, radiosurgery, proton therapy and brachytherapy for treating cancer and other medical conditions.Varian Medical had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the share price movement reveals that Varian Medical’s shares have lost 6.4%, comparing unfavorably with 3.0% decline of the industry.Looking forward, Varian Medical's oncology and Proton therapy business' growth prospects remain impressive. The company is addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam, Halcyon products. The company is winning contracts, not only in the Americas but also in the emerging international markets, which is a huge positive. We believe that China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunity in the near term. The company is opening new offices in Africa and the Middle East, which will provide growth opportunities in the region.Varian Medical operates in a technology-driven environment where success depends on innovation and frequent product updates. The company has been successful on the R&D front as evident from year-over-year growth in its top line. The company has approximately $1 billion revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products over the next five years.  The varied offerings include TrueBeam and Edge platforms, InSightive Analytics, Qumulate QA and RapidPlan knowledge-based treatment planning. We believe that Varian Medical’s innovative product pipeline will continue to drive growth over the long term.Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe that proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian Medical. This is because ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors and causes lesser side effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system uses the same interface used by the company in its TrueBeam platform.Finally the company’s strong overseas presence is expected to enable it to leverage this opportunity in emerging markets. In line with growing demand for cancer treatment in overseas markets, Varian Medical’s sales, in Europe, Africa and particularly Asia, are growing at a faster rate than in the domestic market.On the flip side, unfavorable currency translation continues to be a major dampener for the stock. Management fears that further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies will lead to deteriorating operating results.Intense competition as well as the possibility that Varian Medical’s new test might not generate meaningful profits to outweigh the costs associated with its development, continues to raise concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksVarian Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), Steris Plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

1118,EW,"Civitas Solutions, Inc. (CIVI  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 20 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Adjusted earnings improved 53.8% year over year, primarily on strong sales growth from the company’s Post-Acute Specialty Rehabilitation Services (SRS) and Adult Day Health (ADH) services.Revenue DetailsCivitas Solutions’ third-quarter revenues rose 5.2% year over year to $372.3 million. The figure, however, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $379 million by 1.8%.The company gained $11.7 million from organic growth and $6.7 million from acquisitions in the third quarter.  Per management, organic growth was largely driven by strong performance by Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD). Also, the company acquired seven companies in the reported quarter with total annual revenues of $23.2 million. Moreover, the deals mostly covered I/DD, SRS and ADH service lines.Segmental DetailsFor the third quarter, the company reported I/DD revenues of $243.5 million, reflecting 4.1% growth from the prior-year quarter. SRS service revenues in the quarter totaled $77.8 million, up 5.8% from the prior-year quarter.At-risk youth (ARY) servicesrevenues came in at $35.4 million in the reported quarter, flat with the third-quarter 2016 level. Civitas Solutionsreported ADH revenues of $15.7 million, reflecting 39.7% growth over the prior-year quarter.Margin DetailsIn the reported quarter, Civitas Solutions registered a gross margin of 21.4%, down 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis owing to a 6.5% rise in cost of revenue to $292.5 million.General and Administrative expenses declined 5.8% to $40.4 million led by enhanced cost efficiencies under the company’s cost restructuring program. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 30 bps to 10.6%.GuidanceCivitas Solutions lowered the high end of its fiscal 2017 revenue guidance.The company projects revenues in the range of $1.48–$1.49 billion, lower than the previous range of $1.48–$1.52 billion. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.49 billion, at the high end of the company’s updated guided range.Our TakeCivitas Solutions exited the third quarter on a mixed note with better-than-expected earnings and a revenue miss.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s progress in SRS and ADH, two of its fastest growing businesses. Moreover, the company is witnessing steady contributions from its strategy to grow organically and through acquisitions.However, a tweaked fiscal 2017 guidance raises concern. Also, even though the company seems to be implementing its cost restructuring program efficiently, weak margins may continue to mar its financials.Peer Earnings PerformancesMedical stocks that have performed well this earnings season are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1119,EW,"Irvine, CA-based Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report) recently reported that Dubai Health Authority (DHA) introduced Masimo Patient SafetyNet, a supplemental remote monitoring and clinician notification system, at two hospitals in Dubai. DHA is a government organization that oversees the healthcare systems of Dubai.Patients are being monitored by Masimo Patient SafetyNet, the latest cutting-edge remote monitoring and wireless notification system designed for doctors. The system is intended to assist hospitals to prevent injuries and deaths related with failure to rescue events, a frequent medical error.     Patient SafetyNet aids in keeping inmates secure by continuously and non-invasively monitoring their basic physiological condition. The system can monitor as many as 80 patients to timely detect abnormalities and variances that indicate deteriorating health.The moment a patient’s health starts deteriorating, the system automatically transmits wireless messages to the smart phone of the concerned technician. This elicits a prompt and possibly life sustaining response from the caregiver. It has been established that Patient SafetyNet cuts down traumatic critical occurrences by 65% and expensive transfers to the Intensive Care Unit by 48%.Patient SafetyNet system consists of a bedside patient monitor and a non-invasive patient sensor, which continuously reports vital physiological statistics, such as total hemoglobin (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), oxygen content (SpOC) and pulse rate, among others.Masimo SafetyNet offering places the company in an advantageous position to be the dominant global player in the pulse oximetry market. Additionally, the company’s complementary portfolio of products and services is likely to assist in strengthening its market position and achieving high productivity to better compete with rivals like Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), CryoLife, Inc. (CRY  -  Free Report) and Edap Tms S.a. (EDAP  -  Free Report).The addition of non-invasive parameters is expected to act as a long-term barrier to entry and drive substantial growth. The expanded pulse oximetry utilization into non-critical care areas of hospital represents another growth driver. Shipments have been growing at a steady rate fueled by new contracts. Moreover, recurring revenues from sale of consumables are increasing.On the negative side, a weak macro environment raises concern and competition remains intense. Moreover, Masimo partly depends upon its Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) partners for a part of its sales. In conclusion, its valuation, which already factors in its robust growth prospects, offers limited upside potential at this time.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1120,EW,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.33 were up a nominal 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The quarter’s adjusted EPS also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Earnings performance was sluggish year over year on disappointing Retail/LTC numbers as well as weaker margins.Without the one-time adjustments, reported EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter surged 24.4% year over year to $1.07.Net revenue in the quarter increased 4.5% year over year to $45.7 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.3 billion by a close margin. Strong revenue growth in Pharmacy Services segment was partially offset by a decline in Retail/LTC performance in the quarter.CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteQuarter in Details Pharmacy Services revenues increased 9.5% to $32.3 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in the specialty pharmacy volume, higher pharmacy network claim volume as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 10.3% to 376 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 65.6 million, up 5.2% on a 30-day equivalent basis on the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC dipped 2.2% year over year to $19.6 billion, primarily due to a 2.6% decrease in same store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 2.1% year over year. The shift of the Easter holiday to second-quarter 2017 from the first-quarter 2016 had a 75 bps positive impact on Front-end same-store sales. Front-store sales were, however, affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were again partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales also declined 2.8% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 410 bps due to recent generic drug introductions. Also, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes were flat on a 30-day equivalent basis. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 460 bps negative impact on same store prescription volumes.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) soared 130 bps to 87.2% at the Pharmacy Services segment and 150 bps to 87.6% at the Retail/LTC segment.While gross profit dropped 1.1% to $6.9 billion, gross margin contracted 86 bps to 15.2%. Total operating margin during the quarter contracted 76 bps to 4.6% on a 10.2% plunge in operating profit.CVS Health exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.2 billion compared with $2.3 billion at the end of first-quarter 2017. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 billion, up 34.1% from the year-ago period.During the second quarter, CVS Health opened 27 new retail stores and shut three retail locations. Further, the company relocated 10 retail stores. As of Jun 30, 2017, CVS Health operated 9,700 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.2017 OutlookCVS Health has narrowed its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $5.83-$5.93 from the earlier band of $5.77-$5.93.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.87 is within this guided range. However, full-year operating cash flow guidance has been reiterated in the range of $7.7–$8.6 billion and free cash flow in the range of $6.0–$6.4 billion.For the third quarter, the company expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.47-$1.50. This projection takes into consideration the timing of the Medicare Part D operating profit between the third and fourth quarters, relative to the preceding year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1.62, way above the company’s projection.Our TakeCVS Health posted better-than-expected second-quarter results with both adjusted EPS and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, poor year-over-year Retail/LTC numbers along with margin debacle resulted in a dull earnings performance by the company in the quarter.Nonetheless, year-over-year growth on the top line was due to a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy. An unimpressive bottom-line scenario also prompted the company to narrow its earnings outlook for 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCVS Health has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1121,EW,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on Salt Lake City, UT-based molecular diagnostics provider, Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the past three months, Myriad has been trading above the broader industry. The company has rallied 24.7%, compared with the industry’s 3.7% gain.Myriad ended fiscal 2017 on a solid note, with its fourth-quarter numbers exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company particularly observed strong growth in EndoPredict and GeneSight testing revenues. Also, Myriad witnessed a third consecutive quarter of rise in hereditary cancer volumes. Also, it received provincial reimbursement in Quebec for EndoPredict.Notably, at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) meeting held in June in Spain, Crescendo Bioscience, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Myriad, released new data from a meta-analysis of clinical studies. The data has demonstrated the Vectra DA test’s ability to predict a joint damage.The same month, the company announced that its BRACAnalysis CDx companion diagnostic test has successfully identified BRCA-mutated patients with HER2- metastatic breast cancer in the OlympiAD trial, who have responded to treatment with olaparib better than standard chemotherapy.Myriad’s collaborations with AstraZeneca and BeiGene for development of companion diagnostics also raise optimism. Moreover, Myriad continues to make progress with its kit-based versions of Prolaris and myPath Melanoma in the international market and expects to file for CE Mark for Prolaris by 2018.Moreover, the company has introduced its ‘Elevate 2020’ program that targets to achieve $50 million of incremental operating income by fiscal 2020. Per management, the company has selected the projects that are anticipated to deliver $17 million of operating income in fiscal 2018 and another $24 million in fiscal 2019.On the flip side, unfavorable currency translation continues to be a major dampener for the stock. Management fears that further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies will lead to deteriorating operating results.Intensifying competition as well as the possibility that Myriad’s new test might not generate meaningful profits to outweigh the costs associated with its development continues to raise concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

1122,EW,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Ohio-based STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) – a manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction along with surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).STERIS posted better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2018 with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is dampening.On a positive note, organic growth performance was strong across all segments. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. Also, gross and operating margin expanded year over year. Recently, the company made a couple of organizational changes to serve customers in a better way. We expect this move to enhance the company’s cost structure as well. Over the last three months, the stock has gained 13.1%, which outperformed the 1.1% decline of the broader industry.However, we note that the government and insurance companies’ consistent efforts to curb healthcare costs have been putting pressure on the stock for quite some time. We are also concerned about the current customer consolidation scenario which will continue to affect the company, unless checked immediately. The competitive landscape and weak cost reduction initiatives are other overhangs.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

The company is a leading Infusion Service provider and strives to deliver cost-effective programs to patients. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the last three months, BioScrip has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 78.0%, comparing favorably with the 4.9% decline of the broader industry.BioScrip exited the second quarter with wider-than-expected adjusted net loss and a revenue miss. Management’s unimpressive 2017 guidance, which includes the negative impact of the Cures Act legislation, adds to our concerns. Nonetheless, the market is upbeat about BioScrip’s announcement to continue to offer certain core product lines to UnitedHealthcare. Also, stiff competition raises concern.On a positive note, we are encouraged by the company’s recent progress, courtesy of its new multi-faceted CORE plan which was adopted to improve the financial position. Further, the company achieved annualized supply chain improvement of roughly $20 million since the acquisition of Home Solutions.BioScrip currently operates in an attractive market with favorable industry dynamics and positive fundamentals. In particular, market forces, developing patient management technologies and the aging U.S. population are driving growth opportunities for home health service providers like BioScrip. With the healthcare landscape rapidly changing, the company is focused on boosting its core Infusion Services platform through a clinically-focused and customer-orientated model.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

The year-over-year improvement came on the back of 7.7% growth in local currencies partially offset by a 1.2% decline owing to foreign currency exchange. At local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.4% and acquisition growth was 3.3%.Henry Schein, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Henry Schein, Inc.

This included 2.8% growth in local currencies and a 1.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. There was 0.6% contribution from acquisitions during the quarter under review.Margin Trends         Gross profit increased 4.7% to $839.2 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin declined 50 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 27.4% due to a 7.2% rise in cost of sales, higher than the revenue growth rate.  Despite a 4.7% rise in selling, general & administrative expenses of $628.5 million, adjusted operating income improved 4.8% year over year to $210.7 million. Moreover, adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 6.9% in the reported quarter.Financial PositionHenry Schein exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $74.7 million, compared with $62.8 million at the end the first quarter.

All four of its operating segments delivered strong year-over-year growth. The company’s strong share gains in both the North American and overseas markets along with strong revenues raise optimism.However, despite the better-than-expected earnings performance, we are disappointed with the company’s unchanged EPS guidance for 2017. Meanwhile, the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein’s gross and operating margin was due to higher cost of sales and expenses. Also, foreign currency fluctuations continued to mar the company’s financials.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1127,EW,"Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 42 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings improved 5% year over year, primarily on strong sales growth at the company’s Biologics and Spine Fixation strategic business units (SBU).Excluding one-time items, net income in the second quarter came in at $4.7 million or 26 cents per share, showing a remarkable year-over-year improvement from a net loss of $6.3 million or 35 cents.Sales DetailsOrthofix’s second-quarter sales improved 4.7% (5.1% at constant exchange rate or CER) to $108.9 million. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $103 million by 5.7%.Sales were primarily driven by better-than-expected performance by all four of the company’s SBUs with significant contributions from Biologics and Spine Fixation.Orthofix International N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Orthofix International N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Orthofix International N.V. QuoteSBU DetailsFor the second quarter, the company reported BioStim sales of $47.1 million, reflecting 5.4% (same at CER) growth from the prior-year quarter. Favorable NASS coverage recommendation, introduction of advanced spinal fusion therapy products and extensive sales force were the major drivers for the BioStim business.Biologics SBU sales in the quarter totaled $15.7 million, up 9.9% (same at CER) from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for Trinity Elite due to expanded distributor network, the reacquisition of the national hospital contract along with increased contributions from the national distributor partner.Extremity Fixationsales were $24.7 million in the reported quarter, showing a decline of 7.7% (6% at CER) from second-quarter 2016. However, after excluding planned subsidiary restructuring and the loss of sales due to the divestiture of a non-core business in 2016 impacts, the trailing 12-month growth rate of this business was 3.5% at CER.Orthofix reported Spine Fixation SBU sales of $21.4 million, reflecting 17.1% (same at CER) growth over the prior-year quarter. This can be attributed to strong growth in the U.S. and the strategic initiatives adoptedMarginsIn the second quarter, gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) to 78.7%. Solid top-line growth can be a major factor that might have contributed to the improved gross margin.Sales and marketing expenses rose 9.6% year over year to $50.5 millionowing to increased sales mix from newly added distributors in Biologics and elevated spending in Extremity Fixation to accelerate sales growth in the U.S. General and Administrative expenses were up 10.1% to $20.4 million led by increased investments to implement the strategic initiatives designed by the company, legal settlements and stock-based compensation. The company also witnessed a 1.3% rise in research and development expenses to $6.8 million. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 250 bps to 7.3% as a result of increased operating expenses.Cash PositionOrthofix exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $44.3 million, compared with $41.7 million at the end of the first quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $9.7 million, compared with $21.4 million in the year-ago period.Excluding capital expenditure of $8.6 million, free cash flow was $1.1 million in the reported quarter. This compares to capital expenditure of $10.4 million leading to free cash flow of $11 million in the year-ago period.Updated 2017 GuidanceBanking on a solid second-quarter performance,Orthofix has raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to $422–$425 million from the previous $411–$415 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is pegged at $414.3 million, below the guided range.Adjusted EPS expectations have also been raised to $1.54–$1.60 from $1.48–$1.58. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $1.54, in line with the low end of the company’s projected range.Our TakeThe company exited the second quarter on a mixed note, with sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings meeting the same. Per management, the top line was substantially driven by strength in Biologics and Spine Fixation businesses which is expected to continueon the back of improved performance by sales partners, expanded distributorship network and introduction of products.Moreover, the company seems to be upbeat on the encouraging response received by the Spinal-Stim and Cervical-Stim bone growth therapy devices launched earlier in 2017. Moreover, the company’s CETRA Anterior Cervical Plate has witnessed strong market adoption, resulting in sales of over $1 million in the first five months since the launch.Continuing with its slew of product developments and launches, the company recently launched RIVAL, a full line foot and ankle internal fixation system. Also, within its Extremity Fixation space, the company recently launched JuniOrtho, a new brand for orthopedic products, which currently accounts for roughly one-third of Extremity Fixation sales. Also, we believe that the raised full-year 2017 guidance is indicative of enhanced prospects.On the flip side, currency fluctuations, competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges for the company. Moreover, higher operating expenses are also a matter of concern for Orthofix. Also, the increased dependence on third –party for final distribution of products exposes the company to increased risks. Zacks Rank & Key PicksOrthofix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

1128,EW,"Headquartered in Austin, TX, Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) reported earnings of 20 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents by a massive 122.2%. Earnings also increased 23% year over year.Revenues in the quarter increased almost 19.2% year over year to $76.5 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $75 million. Luminex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Segment AnalysisSystem Sales: Revenues jumped 10.1% on a year-over-year basis to $9.9 million. Notably, the company shipped 270 multiplexing analyzers in the reported quarter that led to the upside in revenues. Here we note that the systems included MAGPIX, LX and FLEXMAP 3D.Assay Revenues: Assay revenues grew 45.8% year over year, out of which 12% was organic.Royalty Revenues: Coming to royalty revenues, sales at this segment declined 4.7% on a year-over-year basis to around $10.8 million. Royalty revenues lacked luster in the reported quarter owing to timing of items like royalty minimums and audit payments.Consumables Sales: Revenues at the segment declined 0.2% to $13.3 million. Per management, consumable revenue expectations will be adversely impacted by funding challenges owing to a multi-year bulk bead contract by a life science customer.Quarter HighlightsPositive Tidings on the Regulatory Front: Luminex received its fourth and fifth FDA clearances on the Aries assay platform in the second quarter for ARIES Bordetella and ARIES C. Difficile assays. Luminex also gained CE-IVD marking for Norovirus and C. Difficile.  In fact, the company is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep, which will soon be submitted for review by the FDA.Lastly, Luminex announced that Japan's Central Social Insurance Medical Council has approved the recommendation by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to provide reimbursement for its proprietary VERIGENE assays. The approval was for two VERIGENE assays: the Gram-Positive Blood Culture test and the Gram-Negative Blood Culture test. Notably, Luminex is the only company in Japan with a clear automated sample-to-answer solution for blood culture identification.Molecular Diagnostic Business Solid: Molecular Diagnostics Group jumped 45% to $10.7 million on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. Solid performance was fueled by growth in automated solutions, VERIGENE and ARIES platforms. Furthermore, the segment got an additional momentum from the recently negotiated group purchasing organization agreements that are adding ARIES platform to their existing VERIGENE agreements, or are establishing new agreements.Margins Details: Gross margin was 65% in the reported quarter, highlighting a contraction of 300 basis points (bps) year over year. The margins deteriorated on a year-over-year basis owing to an anticipated shift in overall product mix and higher inclusion of lower margin automated sample-to-answer solutions.  However, gross margin was in line with expectations, courtesy of improvement in margin of Verigene and ARIES-related revenues, stringent cost management of the acquired enterprises, incremental system placements and a continuing flow of new assays.Operating expenses rose 14% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to the incorporation of Nanosphere. R&D expenses (16% of net revenues) in the quarter were up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, SG&A costs were up 16% year over year. Excluding Nanosphere, SG&A expenses increased only 3%. As a result, operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 10% or $7.5 million in the second quarter.Financial Condition: The company ended the second quarter with approximately $103.7 million in cash and investments, up $17 million from the first quarter.GuidanceLuminex reiterated its 2017 annual revenue guidance at the band of $300 million to $310 million. This depicts 11% to 14% growth on a year-over-year basis. Luminex expects gross margins for the next few quarters in the mid-60s.Meanwhile, the company projects third-quarter 2017 revenues in the range of $73 million to $75 million, down from the previously issued band of $74 million to $76 million.Luminex Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Luminex Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Luminex Corporation QuoteOur TakeLuminex’s second quarter saw a strong top line, solid cash flow and profitability. The company’s Assay business will be its key growth driver over the long term. The company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front in the second quarter. In this regard, the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan and FDA clearance of Bordetella Assay are noteworthy. In fact, Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review. On the flipside, the company slashed its third-quarter revenue guidance. Furthermore, low consumable revenues raise concern. Luminex expects revenues at the segment to be impacted by funding challenges related to a multi-year bulk bead contract from a life science customer. Cutthroat competition in the niche space is another headwind.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Fresenius Medical Care Corporation (FMS  -  Free Report) and Dextera Surgical Inc. .Notably, Edwards Lifesciences and Fresenius Medical sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Dextera has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1129,EW,"On Aug 9, we issued an updated research report on Rhode Island-based pharmacy retail giant, CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), which provides integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care.Post a better-than-expected performance in the second quarter, CVS Health was observed trading significantly ahead of the broader industry. Per the last three months’ share price movement, the stock has lost 1.9% over this period, narrower than the broader industry’s 4.9% loss.On a positive note, strong Pharmacy Services numbers benefited from the upside in Specialty Pharmacy. Per a recent data, three million people in the U.S. are currently in need of specialty treatment which has high potential costs. With management emphasizing that CVS Health’s specialty business remains a top priority for its customers, we believe it is well-positioned to tap this opportunity based on the broad, differentiated offerings, including the likes of Specialty Connect.The company’s strong PBM selling season also looks encouraging. Regarding 2018 selling season, despite the magnitude of bidding opportunities being flat to down year over year, the company had a successful quarter. While gross new business was $5.4 billion, net new business also reached an impressive $1.8 billion. These new business numbers include loss of the FEP specialty contract but lack any impact from individual Med D PDP (prescription drug plan). The company has already completed about 70% of client renewals for 2018. Despite a soft bottom line, the company narrowed its 2017 earnings outlook, indicating chances of recovery ahead. We believe, both the Omnicare and Target Pharmacy buyouts, which have already started to benefit CVS Health on multiple prospects, should drive the enterprise value significantly in the coming days.However, poor year-over-year Retail/LTC (long-term care)numbers along with margin debacle dragged the bottom line, last quarter. Notably, the highly competitive retail pharmacy market too seems to pose a threat. Also, the sluggish economic condition in the U.S. is a concern.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics, Inc.

Consequently, loss from operations came in at $17.2 million, highlighting an improvement from the operating loss of $18.5 million in the prior-year quarter.

Taking the bountiful prospects in the global niche space into consideration, the latest development should boost investor’s confidence.Share Price PerformanceA promising portfolio combined with robust initiatives has been favoring this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which has delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 14 quarters. We note that shares of Varian Medical have declined 0.2% over the past three months against the broader industry, which grew 0.5% in the same time frame.Our TakeVarian Medical operates in a technology-driven environment where success depends on innovation and frequent product updates. The company has been successful on the R&D front as evident from year-over-year expansion in its top line. The company has approximately $1 billion revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products over the next five years.Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe that proton therapy holds significant promise for Varian Medical. This is because ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors and cause lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system uses the same interface used by the company in its TrueBeam platform.Finally, the company’s strong overseas presence is expected to enable it to leverage this opportunity in emerging markets. In line with growing demand for cancer treatment in overseas markets, Varian Medical’s sales, in Europe, Africa and particularly Asia, are growing at a faster rate than in the domestic market.Do Medical Stocks Interest You?

1133,EW,"Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 17 cents per share, a huge decline from the year-ago earnings of 61 cents. The quarter’s figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents by a wide margin.Notably, net income in the second quarter was hit by lower sales, weaker gross profit, increased acquisition-related expenditures for new products and technology plus higher expense for implementation of new systems and operations in Europe. Net sales in the quarter came in at $504.7 million, down 2.3% year over year (down 1.6% at constant exchange rate or CER). Sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $515 million by 1.9%. The year-over-year fall in sales was largely due to a slowdown in productivity related to the recent go-live of the company’s global ERP system in Western Europe as well as a shift in sales into the first quarter in anticipation of the ERP deployment.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailOn a segmental basis, the Life Science segment’s net sales came in at $179.4 million, down 0.3% year over year (up 0.3% at CER). At CER, sales rose on the back of strong sales of Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) instruments and reagents, offset by a decrease in process chromatography media sales, plus some of the ERP-related disruption.Within Clinical Diagnostics, the company registered sales of $322.1 million, down 3.5% year over year (down 2.7% at CER). This decline resulted from a significant slowdown of European sales, especially in infectious disease and immunohematology products, directly related to the disruptions post go-live of the new ERP system.Gross margin of 54.1% during the second quarter was down 7 basis points (bps) year over year on a 2.5% decline in gross profits. Adjusted operating loss in the reported quarter was $2.35 million compared with the operating profit of $24.9 million in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 717.4 million compared with $844 million at the end of 2016. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.2 million compared with $69.7 million in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance Despite a dismal second-quarter performance, Bio-Rad continues to expect organic sales growth of approximately 4% at CER for the full year. This growth rate assumes recovery of a substantial portion of the $15-$17 million of ERP-related sales disruption that took place in the second quarter.With lower-than-anticipated operating profit in the first half of 2017 and including the addition of RainDance Technologies, the company has lowered its currency-neutral operating margin projection for the full year to a range of 6--6.5% from the earlier guidance of 7%.Bottom LineBio-Rad posted a disappointing quarterly show with both earnings and sales significantly lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales growth was majorly hampered by a slower productivity resulting from ERP deployment in Western Europe as well as lower-than-expected sales in the process media business. However, the company reiterated its organic growth expectation indicating chances of recovery.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBio-Rad has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16 million. Excluding hydrophilic royalty catch-up payments, revenues rose 2.5% on a year-over-year basis.The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Segment AnalysisSurmodics reports revenues under two segments – Medical Device and In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD).Medical Device: In the reported quarter, sales declined 18.4% to $12.8 million due to lower hydrophilic royalty revenues. Royalty and license fee revenues at the segment totaled $7.2 million, down by $3.3 million on a year-over-year basis.Third-quarter operating income at the segment was $1.4 million, significantly lower than $6.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline is attributable to increased investments related to whole-products strategy and reduced royalty revenues.IVD: In the quarter under review, sales increased 16.1% to $5 million. The upside came from strong growth and stabilization across BioFX, microarray and antigen product sales.Third-quarter operating income at the segment was $2.2 million, relatively higher than $1.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. This resulted in an improved operating margin at the segment (up 570 basis points), courtesy of favorable product mix and solid operating leverage from higher revenues.Q3 HighlightsSurVeil DCB Pivotal Study: Surmodics received IDE approval from the FDA for its TRANSCEND SurVeil DCB pivotal study. The company is expected to begin enrollment in the platform by the end of fiscal 2017. SurVeil is a paclitaxel drug-coated balloon which is used for the treatment of femoral-popliteal disease. The study is formulated to enroll approximately 446 patients at almost 60 clinical sites in the U.S. and European Union.For-ex Woes: In the third quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to weaken as compared to the euro and the company suffered loss in its euro-denominated contingent considerations.

The year-over-year margin expansion was primarily buoyed by manufacturing leverage and favorable sales mix.R&D expenses in the third quarter were 44.6% of net revenues, compared to 23.5% in the year-ago quarter. Surmodics expects expenses on R&D to rise on a year-over-year basis, thanks to its whole-product solutions strategy and the new SurVeil drug-coated balloon human clinical trials.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 accounted for 29.4% of net revenues, higher than 22.4% in the year-ago period.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow: At the end of the third quarter, the company had $43.7 million. Surmodics repurchased 169,868 common shares for $4 million during the reported quarter under the share repurchase program. The company invested $4.9 million in plant and equipment.OutlookSurmodics raised its guidance for fiscal 2017 revenues and earnings.The company expects fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of 29 cents to 39 cents, as compared to the prior guidance of 15 cents to 25 cents. Meanwhile, revenues are projected in the range of $70.0 million to $72.0 million, up from the prior range of $65.0 million to $68.0 million.Revenues at the IVD segment are expected to grow in low single digits. Over the long term, IVD revenue growth is expected in the mid-single digits.Surmodics anticipates R&D expenses in the band of 40% to 44% of fiscal 2017 revenues.Surmodics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Surmodics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Surmodics, Inc. QuoteOur TakeSurmodics’ third-quarter fiscal 2016 results were impressive, wherein it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues. Furthermore, an upbeat guidance raises investor confidence in the stock. The regulatory approval for SurVeil reflects Surmodics’ solid foothold in developing surface technology for muscular devices, particularly in the drug delivery space.

The figure is 2 cents wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Per management, growth in the U.S. lower extremities was driven by total ankle growth rates and reduced headwinds from dis-synergies resulted in a 4.5 percentage point improvement from the first quarter growth rate.Internationally, lower extremities sales fell 9.1% on a year-over-year basis.Upper Extremities: Sales at the segment increased 9% on a year-over-year basis to $80.5 million in the quarter under review.The U.S. upper extremities business grew 15.3% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the ongoing launch of the PERFORM Reversed glenoid along with the expanded BLUEPRINT surgical planning modules that became available during the quarter.However, Upper extremities sales decreased 4% on a year-over-year basis internationally.Biologics: Sales at the segment rose 7.7% on a year-over-year basis to $24.4 million in the quarter.The U.S. biologics business grew 8.3% to $19.3 million in the quarter. Per management, AUGMENT had an impressive quarter with improvement in average daily revenue when compared to the first quarter, whereas the core biologics portfolio continued to be challenging. Management expects growth in the U.S. biologics business in the second half of 2017 through both the sales force expansion initiative in lower extremities and cross-selling programs of core biologic products with the upper extremities sales force.Sales at the segment grew 5.4% internationally on a year-over-year basis.Sports Med & Other: Sales at the segment dropped 5.1% to $5.7 million from the year-ago quarter.The U.S. sports med & other segment sales declined 17.7% to $1.8 million and increased 2.1% internationally in the second quarter.Margin DetailsAdjusted gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, is pegged at 78.8% for the quarter, expansion of roughly 30 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Selling, general and administrative expenses accounted for 71.1% of total revenues in the second quarter, totaling $130.8 million, a contraction of 280 bps from the year-ago quarter.Notably, expenses on Research and Development (R&D) were $12.5 million in the second quarter, up 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceWright Medical reiterated its full-year guidance.The company continues to expect net sales for full-year 2017 in the band of $755 million to $765 million, representing growth of 9% to 11%. This includes a negative impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 1%. Notably, the midpoint of the net sales guidance represents constant currency growth of approximately 13%.The company forecasts full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the range of $78.5 million to $85.5 million.Our TakeWright Medical exited the second quarter on an impressive note with both revenues and earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, strong margin and reiterated full-year outlook buoys optimism. The company is putting efforts in product innovation through research and development. Wright Medical launched INVISION Total Ankle Revision System in July. This is the first system developed for total ankle revision arthroplasty. Per management, PERFORM Reversed launch will boost revenues in the later half of the year after the company delivers additional instrument sets to the U.S. field.However, decrease in both Lower extremities sales and Upper extremities sales internationally is a matter of concern.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc.

1142,EW,"Goleta, CA-based Inogen, Inc. (INGN  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 38 cents per share, up 5.6% year over year, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and the year-ago figure of 36 cents.The upside was driven by roughly 17.5% growth in revenues, which totaled $64.1 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of almost $60 million.Q2 DetailsSales revenues surged 27.3% to $58 million, while rental revenues declined 32.3% to $6.1 million.Business-to-business: Business-to-business domestic sales were up 32.2% on a year-over-year basis to almost $21.2 million, primarily driven by traditional home medical equipment provider purchases and the consistent strength of the private label partner.Inogen, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Inogen, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Inogen, Inc QuoteMeanwhile, business-to-business International sales rose around 13.9% to almost $14.9 million on the back of solid demand from the company’s partner’s in Europe.Direct-to-consumer: Direct-to-consumer domestic sales advanced 33.3% to almost $21.9 million.However, direct-to-consumer rental sales fell 32.3% to $6.1 million. This decline can be attributed to decreased rental reimbursement rates and the company’s increased strategic focus on sales.Margin DetailsIn the reported quarter, Inogen registered a gross margin of 49.2% (as a percentage of revenues), up 120 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, sales gross margin expanded 240 bps in the quarter to 51.8%, as a percentage of revenues. Per management, an increase in sales gross margin was driven by lower material costs resulting in decreased cost of goods sold in the quarter.Rental gross margin was 25.0% in the reported quarter, much lower than 41.0% in the second quarter of 2016. This was primarily driven by lower net revenue per rental patient led by fallen reimbursement rate. However, this decline in rental gross margin was partially offset by decreased cost of rental revenue particularly led by lower depreciation and servicing costs.Adjusted EBITDA rose 5.6% to $14.4 million on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceBanking on solid performance in the second quarter, Inogen raised its 2017 revenue and adjusted net income guidance. Moreover, the company narrowed its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance.Inogen projects revenues in the range of $239–$243 million, higher than the previous range of $233–$239 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 17.8%–19.8%, up from the previously provided range of 14.9%–17.8%. The company expects rental revenue to decline in 2017, courtesy of lower average rental revenue per patient and continued focus on sales.Adjusted EBITDA is now projected in the band of $48–$50 million, compared to $46–$50 projected previously, thereby presenting an increase of 10.6% to 15.2% from 6%–15.2% year over year.Inogen expects adjusted net income in the range of $25--$27 million, up from the previously provided range of $22–$24 million. This represents 21.8%--31.6% year-over-year growth compared to the previous range of 7.2%–17%.Our TakeInogen reported a stellar second quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. The company witnessed solid growth in revenues and adjusted earnings on a year-over-year basis. In our view, solid domestic and international business-to-business sales has driven the stellar quarterly performance. In fact, the company expects direct-to-consumer sales to be its fastest growing channel, followed by domestic business-to-business sales in the coming quarters, with solid focus in Europe. In this context, the company recently signed a lease for its expansion site in Ohio to accelerate growth in domestic direct-to-consumer sales channel.Moreover, during the second quarter, the company took a series of strategic initiatives to strengthen its product offerings and market position. In this regard, the company successfully integrated MedSupport Systems B.V. acquired in May 2017.Continuing with the slew of product developments and launches, the company received EC Certificate for its One G4 product in Jun 2017.Per management, the company also effectively launched its new customer relationship management (CRM) system in Jun 2017. This latest development is expected to enhance the productivity across sales, billing, and customer service teams in the long term.On the flip side, declining rental revenues raise concern, which might mar the company’s prospects. Moreover, since the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the International market, volatile foreign exchange rate will always continue to pose a concern for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksInogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc.

1143,EW,"On Aug 3, 2017, we issued an updated research report on San Diego, CA-based Illumina Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a company providing tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function.Illumina exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line was strong with new product launches including the VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe and the strength of NovaSeq. More good news is that the rate of NIPT adoption is increasing outside the U.S.Notably, over the last three months, Illumina has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has grown 4.8% in this period compared with a 3.9% gain of the broader industry. The company’s raised guidance is also encouraging enough to indicate that this bullish trend will continue in the coming period.Also, demand for NovaSeq surpassed the company’s expectations with orders beating forecast over 30%. More than 230 NovaSeq instruments have been ordered since its launch in January. We are also looking forward to GRAIL, Illumina’s own-developed company, focused on the cancer screening market.Within clinical markets, demand from customers undergoing oncology testing remains robust. We are currently looking forward to the performance of the Extended RAS Panel, slated for launch in the third quarter. Significantly in June, the company announced an FDA approval receipt for the Extended RAS companion diagnostic kit (as the Class III PMA).On the flip side, weak margins owing to NovaSeq’s launch, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents.

The upside was largely driven by increased rapifleX revenue and strong performances in consumables and aftermarket service sales.BEST revenues rose a substantial 43% organically on a year-over-year basis, backed higher MRI OEM consumer demand and the Bruker-OST acquisition in Nov 2016.Margin TrendGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 150 basis points (bps) to 44.2%.

Moreover, organic revenue growth guidance has been raised to 1.5–2% from 1–2% previously with continued acquisition growth expectations at 3.5–4% (unchanged).Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to have an adverse impact on revenues of approximately 0.5-0% marking an improvement from 2.5% projected previously. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.67 billion.The company also expects 2017 adjusted operating margin increase of approximately 40–70 bps year over year, unchanged from the previous guidance. This includes an approximate 40-bps headwind in fiscal 2017 from the recent acquisitions.  On the bottom-line front, Bruker raised adjusted EPS projections to a new range of $1.08--$1.12 from $1.05–$1.09. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS is pegged at $1.10.Our TakeBruker exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Adjusted revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $424.2 million. Without the adjustments, Allscripts reported revenues of $426.1 million, which also outpaced our estimates.The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Quarter DetailsKey Highlights: Solid growth in U.S. Core Solutions and Services, fueled by Sunrise electronic health record (EHR) platform and Allscripts Revenue Cycle Management Services buoyed optimism in the second quarter. Furthermore, increased demand for CareInMotion solution in the health plan market and multiple global clients across the U.K. and the Asia-Pacific region drove revenues.

Margins contracted 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Software gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 260 bps on a year-over-year basis. However, Client service margins in the second quarter increased almost 410 bps to 18% of revenues, compared to 13.9% for the same period last year. Margin expansion was on the back of gains in efficiencies and scale within the company’s managed services business.Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter totaled $141 million, reflecting a 6% year-over-year increase.GuidanceFor full-year 2017, the company expects revenues between $1.79 billion and $1.82 billion, up from the previously issued range of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion.  Adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow in the band of 10% to 15%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the band of $345 million and $365 million.For 2018 to 2020, Allscripts raised its adjusted revenue growth guidance. The company expects adjusted revenue growth in the band of 9% to 11%, up from the previously issued range of 6% to 8%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase in the band of 17%--20%, up from the previously issued range of 12%--15%.Most importantly, Allscripts announced the acquisition of the hospital and health system business of McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), which is estimated to close early in the fourth quarter of 2017. The deal is worth $185 million in cash.Our TakeAllscripts exited the second quarter on a favorable note, wherein adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues beat the same. A solid guidance for full-year 2017 and a strong long-term outlook are the key highlights of the moment. Allscripts announced plans to takeover the hospital and health system business of McKesson Corporation, which is expected to close by the fourth quarter. Allscripts’ continued reliance on mergers and acquisition activities poses substantial integration risks. Furthermore, intensifying competition is a major dampener. The company’s products have a long sales cycle which involves intensive decision-making at different managerial levels.

1147,EW,"The stock market has been on a stellar run this year thanks to strong corporate earnings, still lower interest rates, and improving health of economies around the world. Even the ongoing turmoil in Washington, geopolitical tensions, North Korean nuclear missile tests and stretched valuations failed to block the road.In fact, Dow Jones crossed the another milestone of 22,000 for the first time in yesterday’s trading session after hitting the 20,000 and 21,000 marks earlier this year and the S&P 500 is less than 1% shy of its major threshold of 2,500. The bullish trend is likely to continue at least in the near term.This is especially true, as the economy has been on a solid growth path buoyed by an impressive labor market, increase in wages, and increasing consumer spending. U.S. GDP growth expanded 2.6% annually in the second quarter, which is double the first-quarter growth of 1.2% and represents the fastest growth since the third quarter of last year when the economy grew 2.8%. Notably, this 96-month growth confirms the eight-year expansion since mid-2009 – the third-longest economic winning streak in American history behind March 1991 to March 2001 (120 months) and February 1961 to December 1969 (106 months).Additionally, consumers now appear to be more optimistic as we enter into the second half of the year. The Consumer Confidence Index, as indicated by the Conference Board, surged to a 16-year high of 121.1 in July from the revised 117.3 in June and is much above the expected 116.5. Further, a weaker dollar helped blue chip companies, most of whose revenues came from international markets, to surge higher (read: 4 ETFs to Ride on 16-Year High Consumer Confidence).    Amid bullish sentiments, momentum investing would be a winning strategy for those seeking higher returns in a short spell. This is because the strategy looks to fetch profits from buying hot stocks that have shown an uptrend over the past few weeks or months.As such, we have presented five ETFs and stocks that could lead to outperformance in the current market environment.

1148,EW,"Hologic Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 50 cents, down 1.9% year over year. However, adjusted EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and remained at the upper-end of the company’s guidance of 48–50 cents.Strong top-line growth led to better-than-expected EPS increase in the reported quarter.On a reported basis, the company recorded net income of $59.5 million or 21 cents per share, both reflecting a year-over-year decline of 29.8% and 32.3%, respectively.Revenues in DetailRevenues grossed $806.1 million in the quarter, up 12.4% year over year. The top line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $799 million and the company’s own estimation of $790–$805 million. At constant exchange rate (CER), revenue growth was 13.1%.Solid growth at Hologic’s molecular diagnostics and GYN Surgical business segments drove this upside in the top line.Hologic, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. QuoteGeographically, revenues in the U.S. grew 9.5% year over year to $618.5 million. Excluding blood screening and medical aesthetics, the U.S. revenue rose 1.3%. On the other hand, international revenues were up 23% (up 26.5% at CER) to $187.6 million, banking on increased revenues of Breast Health and GYN Surgical products. Excluding blood screening and medical aesthetics, international revenues increased 6.8% or 10.5% at constant currency.Segments in DetailRevenues at the Diagnostics segment (35.2% of total revenue) declined 8.3% year over year (down 7.4% at CER) to $284.1 million in the second quarter. Under this segment, molecular diagnostics revenues of $144.1 million increased 9.3% (10.3% at CER). In the U.S., this was primarily driven by an increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system, plus market expansion by conforming to testing guidelines.  Internationally, results were strong from acquiring benefits of new leadership, healthy Panther placements and multiple new-product introductions, including viral load assays.Cytology and perinatal revenues of $121 million also showed a decline of 1% (up 0.2% at CER).Revenues at the Breast Health segment (35.1%) inched up 0.4% (up 0.9% at CER) to $283.7 million. Revenues in the U.S. declined 1.7% on reducing incremental placements of 3D gantries. International revenues however climbed 13% year over year.Revenues from the GYN Surgical business (13.2%) were up 4.4% (up 5.2% at CER) to $106.5 million. Medical Aesthetic business in the quarter reported revenues of $110 million, 13.6% of total revenue. Revenues at Skeletal Health (accounting for the rest) dropped 5.3% (down 5% at CER) to $21.8 million.Operational UpdateIn the fiscal third quarter, Hologic’s gross margin contracted 400 basis points (bps) to 50.8%. Adjusted gross margin also decreased 260 bps to 63.1% due to product and geographic revenues mix, divestiture of blood screening business and a full quarter of revenues from low-margin Cynosure products.Hologic’s adjusted operating expenses amounted to $276 million, up 19.9% year over year. Adjusted operating margin contracted a massive 480 bps to 29%.Financial UpdateHologic exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $588.4 million, considerably below $1.13 billion reported at the end of the second quarter. Total long-term debt was $3.22 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter compared with $3.28 billion at the end of the preceding quarter.Year-to-date operating cash outflow was $158.3 million compared with  cash inflow of $569.7 million in the same period last year. Fiscal 2017 GuidanceHologic reduced its revenue guidance for fiscal 2017. The company currently expects revenues in the range of $3.04–$3.05 billion from the earlier band of $3.05–$3.08 billion. This new outlook reflects annualized growth of 7.3–7.8% (previously it was 7.7–8.7%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07 billion remains above the company-provided guidance.Management has however raised the lower end of the earlier provided adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2017. Hologic currently projects adjusted EPS in the range of $2.00–$2.02 (from previous $1.98–$2.02) for fiscal 2017, reflecting annualized growth of 2–3.1% (1–3.1%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is pegged at $2.01, falling just below the upper end of the guided range.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Hologic expects revenues of $785–$800 million, representing annualized growth of 8–10.1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is $798.9 million, close to the upper end of the projected range.Adjusted EPS is projected at 48–50 cents, an annualized decline of 7.2–3.4%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter adjusted EPS is pegged at 49 cents, within the company’s guidance.Our TakeHologic posted better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results in terms of both earnings and revenues. The company’s strong cash position is another encouraging factor.However, we are disappointed with the decrease of revenues at the company’s Diagnostics segment. The blood screening divestiture is expected to mar the company’s growth momentum in the days ahead. Overall, the company’s reduced revenue guidance for fiscal 2017 lowers investors’ confidence in the stock.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksHologic currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the medical stocks worth considering are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report). All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1151,EW,"Danvers, MA-based Abiomed Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report), a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical products, reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 45 cents per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents. The figure was also higher than 29 cents in the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, revenues increased roughly 29% year over year to $132.5 million approximately, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $130.0 million. The year-over-year upside was supported by robust performance of the Impella heart pump product line. The Impella heart pump product line’s robust performance supported the year-over-year upside.Quarter HighlightsGlobally, Impella heart pump’s global revenues grew a strong 30% to $127.2 million in the quarter.U.S. Impella revenues improved 28% to $114.7 million (driven by a 27% increase in patient utilization). Outside the U.S., revenues shot up 53% to $12.5 million. Germany accounted for the majority of the international revenues, which grew 62% on a year-over-year basis.During the reported quarter, the installed base for Impella 2.5 heart pumps in the U.S. grew by 16 hospitals, raising taking the installed customer base total to 1,154 sites. The installed customer base for Impella CP heart pumps grew by 46 U.S. hospitals, reaching a total of 1062.Overall operating income for the reported quarter came in at $33.1 million or 25.0% of operating margin (as a percentage of revenues), compared with $21.2 million or 20.6% in the prior-year quarter.Abiomed’s gross margin in the first quarter was 83.5%, compared with 85.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.Financial ConditionAbiomed’s cash and cash equivalents were $44.0 million as of Jun 30 compared with $39.0 million as of Mar 31,. Notably, management announced that the company currently has no debt.ABIOMED, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  ABIOMED, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ABIOMED, Inc. QuoteGuidanceAbiomed forecasts fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of $560 million to $575 million. This marks an increase of 26–29% from the fiscal 2016 level. Operating margin is projected in the band of 22% to 24%.Our TakeGoing forward, we believe that robust demand for the Impella product line will continue to drive Abiomed’s top line over the long term. The company’s expanding product portfolio will improve its penetration into both the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market going forward. This is evident from the fact that both Impella 2.5 and CP continue to add centers in the U.S. New publications regarding the devices in leading medical journals help in promoting their utilization and effectiveness.Although Abiomed’s significant international presence helps broaden its customer base among other positives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely impact the company’s international sales.

Adjusted earnings also improved a stupendous 42.1% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the company’s transcatheter heart valves business.Excluding one-time items, net income in the second quarter came in at $186.1 million or 86 cents per share, up 46.9% or 48.3% year over year, respectively.Sales DetailsEdwards Lifesciences’ second-quarter sales improved 10.9% to $841.8 million. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. Underlying sales increased 15.3% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in Germany elected to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by the other two product lines across all regions.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteSegments DetailsFor the second quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $487.5 million, reflecting 16.5% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., THVT sales in the quarter were $316.3 million, up 28.4% year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance results being delivered by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $207.1 million, up 4.2% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and the supply recovery in mitral valve sales, partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valve.Critical Care sales were $147.2 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 3.7% from second-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by double-digit growth in the company's Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, mainly in the U.S and Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the first quarter, gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 74.9% owing to a more profitable product mix, led by growing sales of transcatheter valves. This was however partially offset by adverse foreign exchange.SG&A expenses rose 6.6% year over year to $243.8 million on account of sales and personnel related expenses, primarily in the Transcatheter Valve (THV) segment.On the other hand, R&D expenditures increased 19.5% year over year to $134.4 million owing to continued investments in the company’s transcatheter mitral valve and mitral valve programs, including expenditure on clinical trials. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 160 bps to 29.9% as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.13 billion, compared with $918.9 million at the end of the first quarter. Long-term debt in the quarter totaled $1.02 billion, compared with $847.9 million reported previously.Cash flow from operating activities was $197.7 million in the second quarter, compared with $128.3 million in the previous quarter. Excluding capital spending of $58.0 million, free cash flow was $139.7 million. During the quarter, management repurchased 0.8 million shares for $73.8 million to offset dilution associated with its Valtech Cardio acquisition and stock-based incentive compensation.Updated 2017 GuidanceBanking on a solid second-quarter performance,Edwards Lifesciences has raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to the high end of the previously projected range of $3.2–$3.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is $3.35 billion, near the high end of the guided range. Adjusted EPS expectations have also been raised to $3.65–$3.85 from $3.43–$3.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $3.52, within the company’s guided range.For the third quarter of 2017, the company projects sales (excluding the effect of Germany stocking sales) between $810 million and $850 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $816.1 million, within the projected range. The company estimates adjusted EPS between 80 cents and 90 cents. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 83 cents, which is also within the company‘s forecasted range.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong transcatheter valve sales were a major positive. The company also performed well on its gross margin front, which raises optimism. Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences’ raised revenue and earnings guidance hints at better days ahead. However, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to pose challenges to the company.Nevertheless, management expects to gain traction in the ever expanding TAVR market, based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidences, leading to strong adoption of THV therapy.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

We believe this is in tune with the company’s long-term objective, or the ‘Growth Strategy 2020’, where it aims to increase revenues to $28 billion by 2020, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of around 10%. A wide range of dialysis products, initiatives to attaining market traction, solid international foothold, strategic acquisitions and divestments are major catalysts for the company.However, a tough regulatory environment, difficulties in boosting the profit margin in foreign legal-paradigms and competition in the niche markets are major headwinds.Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Abiomed Inc.

1161,EW,"The second-quarter earnings season commenced last week and the S&P 500 index had a good start with respect to earnings and revenue growth. Per the latest Earnings Preview, till Jul 21 2017, 97 S&P 500 members (28.1% of the total market cap) have reported their quarterly numbers. Total earnings for these members have gone up 8.4% on 5.1% higher revenues.This week, 183 S&P 500 members are lined up to report their quarterly results. This time around, we are bullish about the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.What’s in Store for the Medical Space?While overall growth is steadily accelerating from the few preceding quarters’ performances, the investors are concerned about the healthcare space, a sector that has been seen to struggle a lot during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.Whether President Donald Trump finally amends its earlier proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA) or totally repeals and replaces Obamacare, uncertainty within the medical space is towering high. Investors are currently adopting a wait-and-see policy about the space.This lack of visibility befuddles the bullish trend the Medical sector (one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors) was maintaining over the past few quarters. Accordingly, for the second quarter, expected earnings growth rate stands at 0.00%, a break-even level on 3.8% revenue growth projection. This compares unfavorably with the first-quarter 2017’s reported earnings growth rate of 5.6% on 5.7% revenue growth.Let’s take a sneak peek at the performance of four major Medical - Instruments companies within the broader Medical space expected on Jul 26.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report): This leading cardiovascular product maker is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 26. Edwards Lifesciences posted strong global sales in the last reported quarter, primarily buoyed by strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve (TAVR). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S., the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.Edwards Lifesciences currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are on par at 88 cents. We note that, while a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.(Read More: Edwards Lifesciences Q2 Earnings: A Surprise in Store?)Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteThermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report): This MA-based medical instruments manufacturer’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the second quarter. The company has already spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is expected through this year too.Thermo Fisher is expected to beat expectations when it reports its second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +0.44%.That is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $2.27, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at $2.26.

1163,EW,"Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 loss per share of 8 cents, reflecting an improvement from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 18 cents. The quarter’s number is however wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents.Net loss in the reported quarter was $2.7 million, as compared with net loss of $6.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Revenues in DetailTotal revenue in the quarter rose 4.3% year over year to $85.5 million, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86 million. Growth in the U.S. and international markets drove the top line.Geographically, second-quarter product revenues in the U.S. improved 4.02% to $72.4 million. The U.S. product revenue growth was fueled by invasive breast cancer revenue growth of 1.9% as well as 78.3% rise in Prostate test revenues. International product revenues were $13.1 million in the reported quarter, up 6%, and 10% on a CER basis.During the quarter, the company delivered more than 31,550 Oncotype DX test results, up 9% year over year.Genomic Health, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Genomic Health, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Genomic Health, Inc. QuoteMargin TrendIn the quarter under review, Genomic Health’s gross margin expanded 300 basis points (bps) year over year to 83.9%. Apart from significant top-line growth, the improvement in gross margin was led by an 11.5% decline in cost of product revenues to $13.8 million.Genomic Health also witnessed a 4.6% rise in operating expenses to $74.8 million owing to a 7.4% increase in selling and marketing expenses to $40.7 million and a 6% rise in research and development expenses to $15.8 million. However, general and administrative expenses declined 0.5% to $18.4 million.In the reported quarter, Genomic Health reported an operating loss of $3.1 million, showing a 40.4% year-over-year improvement from an operating loss of $5.2 million a year ago.Financial UpdateGenomic Health exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities (including a corporate equity investment) of $109.8 million, reflecting a slight improvement from $94.4 million recorded at the end of the first quarter.Our TakeGenomic Health exited the second quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note. We are concerned about the company’s rising operating expenses as well.Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the decline in cost of sales which led to solid gross margin expansion.Management noted that strong demand for Genomic Health’s Oncotype tests in the second quarter of 2017 was partly on account of growth in its U.S. and International prostate and global invasive breast business. Specifically, in invasive breast cancer, the Oncotype DX test proved to be the company’s only test to predict all major short- and long-term outcomes. In this context, in Jun 2017, the company announced results from eight studies based on its Oncotype DX tests at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago. Per management, results confirm the efficiency of the Oncotype DX tests in predicting clinically meaningful endpoints and outcomes across multiple cancer types. We are also looking forward to the company’s newly initiated Clinical Utility Program for select centers in the U.S. to prepare for the commercial launch of the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test in collaboration with Epic Sciences.On the flip side, management has not issued any guidance, which is discouraging. Moreover, the company’s sole reliance on the Breast Oncotype DX test is a concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGenomic Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1170,EW,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 14.63%. It is worth noting that Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.21%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayEdwards Lifesciences posted strong global sales in the last reported quarter, primarily buoyed by strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve(TAVR). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S., the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.In the TAVR space, Edwards Lifesciences reported highly encouraging European post-approval clinical trial results for its SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in May 2017. The company also demonstrated successful results pertaining to its CENTERA valve for transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures in the much awaited EuroPCR 2017 held in May.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteWe are also upbeat about the company’s initiative of strategic investment in research and development and receipt of regulatory approvals for those products. Moving on, the latest breakthrough achieved in its TAVR segment is the FDA approval for its SAPIEN 3 valve in early Jun 2017.Bullish on the company’s ongoing performance, management raised growth expectations to the high end of the projected full-year 2017 guidance for each segment.Moreover, we note that the company projected total sales between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents to 92 cents for the second quarter.Apart from this, management completed the acquisition of Israel-based Valtech Cardio, a developer of Cardioband System for transcatheter repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves, toward the end of 2016. All these are expected to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported.On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continues to challenge the company. We also believe that unfavorable foreign currency will affect the company’s gross margin in to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Edwards Lifesciences this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Edwards Lifesciences has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.41 You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1171,EW,"Headquartered in Latham, NY, AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report), a leading provider of minimally invasive medical devices, reported adjusted earnings of 19 cents per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents but remained flat year over year. The stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters at an average of 23.7%.Meanwhile, net sales fell almost 7% on a year-over-year basis to $86.9 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $91 million.Stock Performance Lacks LusterShare price of AngioDynamics declined 3.9% to close at $15.12 following the earnings release. In fact, the company had a negative return of almost 3.9% over the last three months, as against the Zacks classified Medical Instruments sub-industry’s gain of 9.6%. The current level is also significantly below the S&P 500’s 4.7% gain over the same time frame.Highlights of the QuarterInternationally, AngioDynamics registered revenues of $16.1 million, down 9.6% year over year. However, sales in the U.S. totaled $70.8 million, down 6.3%.Peripheral Vascular (PV) business: Sales at this segment were $53.9 million in the reported quarter, lower than $55.6 million in the year-ago quarter.Despite the disappointing performance, management expects the ‘Thrombus Management’ platform in the PV product line to provide the company with a competitive advantage and open up significant long-term opportunities.We note that AngioDynamics is a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space (catheter directed thrombolysis). The company boasts highly unique catheters like Uni-Fuse, SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio.Vascular Access (VA)business: Sales at this segment declined almost 2.2% year over year to $24.2 million, partially offset by solid growth at BioFlo Midlines and Dialysis.The BioFlo line of products at the segment is expected to be a key catalyst.Oncology/Surgery business: Sales at this segment plunged over 33% from the year-ago quarter to $8.9 million owing to lower sales of ablation products and NanoKnife capital.The segment performed unimpressively primarily due to the market withdrawal of the company’s flagship Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System.The recall also affected the company’s international sales. Precisely, this had an overall negative impact of $4.5 million on earnings. Per management, without the recall of Acculis, net revenues would have totaled $352 million, within the previously guided range.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and Consensus  AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and Consensus | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteFY17 HighlightsNet sales for fiscal 2017 were $349.6 million, down 1.2% from $353.9 million a year ago. AngioDynamics registered adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share, up 22% on a year-over-year basis.Per management, the year-over-year decline in sales was primarily led by unimpressive performances by the company’s VA (28.1 % of net sales) and Oncology segments (13.8% of net sales). However, this was partially offset by growth in the PV segment (58.1% of net sales).In this regard, the PV segment saw a 1% rise to $208.6 million on a year-over-year basis. PV sales were driven by growth in the core Angiographic Catheter business. However, sales at the VA and oncology segments declined 3% and 9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Margin DetailsAdjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points (bps) to 51.8% in the quarter.Adjusted EBITDAS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, excluding the items shown in the attached reconciliation table, was $15.0 million compared with $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Coming to operating expenses, sales & marketing (S&M) and research & development (R&D) expenses declined 30 bps and 10 bps, respectively, as a percentage of revenues. However, general & administrative (G&A) expenses rose 230 bps on a year-over-year basis.Financial ConditionAngioDynamics had a strong cash flow balance in the fourth quarter. Per management, it generated $19 million in operating cash flow and $18.3 million in free cash flow.Additionally, AngioDynamics ended the quarter with $47.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt of $97.5 million.GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of 64 cents to 68 cents.The company projects fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of $352 million to $359 million.Furthermore, free cash flow is expected to be over $35 million.Our TakeAngioDynamics reported a mixed fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, wherein adjusted earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. The company also provided encouraging earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.The major growth drivers for the company are the Perpheral Vascular, the NanoKnife and BioFlo Midline product lines. Growth in the core Angiographic Catheter business is also likely to fortify the company’s footprint in the global space.On the flipside, AngioDynamics recalled the Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System under the Oncology and Surgery segment. The company also has a high outstanding debt level at the end of the fourth quarter. Higher debts impose certain operating and financial restrictions which might limit the execution of the company’s core business strategies.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAngioDynamics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), CryoLife, Inc.

1174,EW,"On Jul 13, we issued an updated research report on Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report), a Braintree, MA-based leading provider of blood management solutions to customers encompassing blood and plasma collectors, hospitals and health care providers globally. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the past year, Haemonetics has been trading above the Zacks categorized Medical - Products industry. Over this period, the stock has surged 34.7% compared with the broader industry’s 10.4%.We are particularly encouraged by the company’s consistent growth in both its Plasma segment as well as the Haemonetics Management franchises.Haemonetics has been witnessing a strong flourish in its Plasma franchise for quite some time now. Management has also maintained high confidence in the continued growth of its commercial plasma collection business.Of late, management declared that its NextGen plasma collection software has been seeing avid customer interest. Management’s 2018 guidance for Plasma revenue growth is 3-5% inclusive of the divestiture of SEBRA bench-top and handheld sealers, representing 1.4% of annual Plasma revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017.The company’s Hospital business is also progressing well. The TEG line of products has gained popularity worldwide. The TEG 5000 is approved of for a broad set of indications in all its top markets. The TEG 6s and TEG Manager are sanctioned for the same set of indications in Europe, Australia and Japan.In the U.S., TEG 6s is to be used for cardiovascular surgery and the company is presently pursuing a broader set of indications, beginning with trauma.On the flip side, the company has been witnessing sluggish revenue growth at the Blood Center franchise. This has significantly affected Haemonetics’ results over the past few quarters. Management also doesn’t expect any early recovery in the Blood Center’s outcomes.Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to pose a challenge for Haemonetics. Management also anticipates slower-than-expected product adoption by customers to reduce revenues and profits. Also, currency fluctuations and a stiff competition continue to hamper the stock.Other Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc.

The company’s shares have rallied 20.3%, much above the 11.4% gain of the broader Medical Dental Supplies industry over this period.Although we are currently looking forward to the company’s impending sale to ultra-high-purity materials supplier Avantor (announced back in May), the upside potential of the stock is, however, limited.The divestiture, post-closing is expected to create a major consumables-focused solutions and services provider to high-growth life sciences and advanced technologies industries. The acquisition will build on the Avantor’s strengths, including its cGMP (current good manufacturing practice) processes, significant exposure to the emerging markets and VWR’s vital position across both Americas as well as Europe.The combined company will therefore be serving a global customer base in all areas of its activities from research through production – reflecting a unique advantage in a fast growing marketplace.From shareholders’ point of view, the potential merger with Avantor seems a beneficial move at the moment. The consolidation deal has been fixed at $33.25 in cash per share of VWR common stock, representing an enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. The purchase price represents an approximate 17% premium to the unaffected closing stock price as on May 2, 2017, the day before the start of market speculations regarding a potential sale of VWR.The purchase price also denotes an approximate 20% premium to the 30-trading day volume weighted average price (VWAP) and an approximate 24% premium to the 90-trading day VWAP of VWR common stock as of May 2, 2017.Key PicksOther better-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc.
