7,PGR,"Travelers (TRV) shares jumped sharply after the insurance giant announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday despite hefty payouts due to catastrophic wildfires in California.X The Dow 30 company's earnings per share plunged by 29% to $2.28, but analysts had predicted a steeper fall to $1.52, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue increased 3.6% to $7.45 billion, which surpassed analyst estimates of $7.1 billion.Net written premiums, a key revenue metric, rose by 6% to $6.42 billion. The firm attributed this to factors including strong retention and an increase in new business in domestic management liability.The company's fourth-quarter net income included a charge of $129 million related to the Trump administration's tax law reforms.Travelers' combined ratio, an important measure of profitability, increased by 5.5 percentage points to 95.5% compared with the equivalent 2016 quarter due to higher catastrophe losses, meaning payouts for claims took up a higher share of premium revenue. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed due to the wildfires, which also claimed the lives of more than 40 people.Shares of Travelers were up 5% at 146.26 on the stock market today, now extended from a 138.05 buy point in a flat base cleared on Monday.

15,PGR,"Warren Buffett expects Hurricane Harvey to hit car insurer and wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)-unit Geico harder than Hurricane Irma, given the massive floods that accompanied the former storm.Geico is the No. 2 insurer in Texas, where Harvey struck in August. That storm, in contrast to Irma which pounded Florida earlier this month, was primarily a flooding event. Water can be more damaging to cars than wind.""It's very hard to give numbers but ... there were more total losses by quite a margin in Harvey than in Irma,"" Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire, told The Wall Street Journal Tuesday about Geico's business.In August, Buffett had said he expects Geico to report losses on about 50,000 cars following Harvey.As the No. 1 insurer in Florida, Geico will hardly be unscathed by Irma though. Irma was more like a typical hurricane, causing heavy wind damage.""Auto insurance claims from this storm are also expected to be significant, and we expect Berkshire Hathaway's Geico unit to have the largest exposure, based on its nearly 26% share of the Florida auto insurance (physical damage) market,"" Cathy Seifert, an insurance analyst with CFRA Reasearch, wrote in a recent note.Progressive (PGR) is the third largest car insurer in Florida, with a roughly 14% market share, while Allstate Corp.

16,PGR,"Here's Your Investing Action Plan: what you need to know for Wednesday and beyond.Earnings season gets underway in earnest with reports from Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday and banking giants such as Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) later this week.XFor the third quarter as whole, S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 2% from the same period last year on a 5% revenue gain, according to Zacks Investment Research. That follows double-digit profit growth in the first two quarters of 2017.The technology sector should earnings up nearly 10% as revenue grows 7%. While flagship names Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) will step up to the dock as November dawns, smaller names like Barracuda Networks (CUDA), out Tuesday night, are on tap this week.Estimates for the financial sector have notably worsened over the last two months, as last quarter's back-to-back hurricanes weigh on corporate profits, especially on insurers and reinsurers such as Travelers (TRV), American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB) and Everest Re (RE).Insurers, who account for a quarter of the finance sector's total earnings, are expected to see earnings decline 25% vs. a year ago, contributing to a dip in Q3 earnings for the broad financial sector, according to Zacks.But both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are estimated to grow adjusted profits and sales in the September quarter when they report Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The impact of the storms on insurers may already be priced in, with AIG moving back toward a buy point of 67.57 after bottoming in early September and Progressive (PGR) crossing a 49.11 buy point off a flat base.Transporters and air carriers are also likely to see a hurricane-related knock on profit growth, but Delta Air Lines added 1.9% on the stock market today as the stock moves toward a 55.85 buy point ahead of the carrier's report on Wednesday.Analysts call for Delta earnings to shrink 9% to $1.54 as revenue rises 5% to $11.04 billion, Zacks said. Delta already has reported strong preliminary Q3 unit revenue figures, with United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) following suit on Tuesday.Finally, small-cap companies, which are not part of the S&P 500, should see earnings growth return in Q3. For the S&P 600 index as a whole, earnings are expected to be up 11% vs. a year ago on 5% higher revenue, snapping a run of earnings declines in three of the last four quarters.Small-cap stocks also have been leading in recent months.The finance, technology and energy sectors are likely to drive small-cap growth. Without the finance sector's contribution, small caps' Q3 earnings would drop 0.3%.RELATED:American, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapWal-Mart Sees 40% Online Sales Jump, Sets $20 Billion BuybackMove Over Techs, There's A New Sector Leader On Wall StreetNvidia Shares Jump As It Debuts Computer For Self-Driving Cars

One exchange, BTCChina, said it would stop bitcoin trading on Sept. 30. Remarks from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who called bitcoin ""a fraud,"" and Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed El-Erian, who said bitcoin was far overvalued, didn't help.

The FTC is probing the incident, and Reuters reported some 40 states have come together to look into the breach. A JPMorgan analyst cut his 2018 EPS estimates by roughly 10% in the wake of the hack, which was disclosed on Sept. 7, weeks after the company first learned of it. The company has been harshly criticized for what has been seen as insufficient customer support following the breach.

22,PGR,"Stocks held fast to their rebound gains Monday as Asian stock markets launched a global rally that sent broad array of U.S. industries to powerful gains.XA solemn session marked by remembrances of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that left Americans dead in New York, Washington, D.C., and Somerset County, Pa., saw the Dow Jones industrial average lead, rising 1.2%, vs. a 1.1% gains each for the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500.Preliminary data showed trade was below Friday's levels on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges.Before the U.S. open, markets in Tokyo and Hong Kong clocked substantial rallies, boosted by a shift in Chinese currency regulations and relief that North Korea had not tested either missiles or nuclear bombs over the weekend.  That strength carried over to European trade, which saw benchmarks in Paris and Frankfurt end well over 1% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Finding early stage, top-flight stocks is only part of the investing game. Knowing when to buy, and when to sell are just as import. IBD's CAN SLIM-based investment program tutors you through the start up stages, and provides an arsenal of powerful tools as you progress.In the U.S., insurers were among the early winners, with Dow issue Travelers (TRV) and Progressive (PRG) rising more than 2% as Hurricane Irma softened to tropical storm status. The storm pushed north into Georgia and the southern U.S. leaving more than 6 million Floridians without electricity and large portions of the state wind-strafed and waterlogged, but with much less damage than the severe scenarios for which the markets had braced on Friday.Airlines rebounded: American Airlines Group (AAL) jetted ahead 5%, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) bobbed more than 3% each.Cruise line operators also felt some relief trade, with Carnival Cruise (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) — both based in Miami — up more than 3% at the end of the day.  Norwegian announced it was sending on of its cruise ships on a relief mission to St. Thomas, to pick up 2,000 tourists stranded the by the storm. It had another fully stocked ship standing by in the Gulf of Mexico, ready to deliver supplies to either Key West or Tampa after the storm passed, according to the Miami Herald.Automakers turned in the Monday's strongest move among industry groups, led by Tesla (TSLA) which snapped more than 5% higher to finish within 2% of a 370.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Tesla had reportedly release a software update to Florida Tesla owners on Saturday, extending slightly the battery charge range of vehicles as an assist to those evacuating ahead of the storm.Apple (AAPL) of course made its splash for the day, thundering ahead 1.7% in rising trade ahead of its annual product release event, scheduled for Tuesday. Apple shares remain in a buy range, above a 156.75 buy point.On the IBD 50 list, Laser maker Coherent (COHR) led, rising nearly 5% in light trade and retaking support at its 50-day moving average.

"
24,PGR,"• 90 or better Composite Rating.
"
25,PGR,"• 80 or higher Relative Strength Rating.

27,PGR,"• B or better Accumulation/Distribution Rating.In recent quarters, Facebook (FB), Tesla (TSLA) and Alibaba have made this list, but did not make the cut this round. Analysts expect Facebook to post earnings growth of 42%, and see Alibaba generating a 26% gain. Wall Street sees flat growth for Tesla in Q2 and Goldman Sachs (GS) said the electric car pioneer's stock is extremely overpriced.But new names on the list include a leader in self-driving-car technology, Nvidia; a South Korean maker of LCD panels, LG Display (LPL); and 2017 IPO Floor & Decor.LG Display tops the list with analysts expecting explosive earnings growth of 944%. The stock had already been rising in recent weeks when it jumped even higher on news that Apple (AAPL) is in talks with LG Display to invest in the display-maker's new OLED screen factory. The stock pulled back on Friday to close down nearly 2% for the week.After a solid run from its April 27 initial public offering, Floor & Decor has been pulling back recently, but managed to close the week in positive territory. Given its fundamentals, including 96% average earnings growth over the last three quarters and 35% three-year annual sales growth, it's one to keep an eye on. For Q2, analysts expect a 260% rise in earnings-per-share.Alibaba has invested in fellow Chinese e-commerce stock Baozun, which analysts expect to deliver 400% earnings growth in its next report. The stock is already extended from an earlier breakout and was up over 13% this week. See if it goes on to offer another buying opportunity.Nvidia, which is also extended beyond a proper buy zone, is expected to deliver 68% EPS growth. While self-driving car technology leader pulled back recently, it's managed to stay above its 10-week line and closed over 1% higher for the week.Heavy construction firm MasTec (MTZ) is also noteworthy. On Thursday, it briefly poked its head above a 46.15 buy point, but then pulled back as the indexes also encountered selling pressure. On Friday, the stock rose over 1% to close at 45.90. The Florida-based company is expected to report in early August, with analysts looking for earnings growth of 81%.The trick to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watchlist and action plan.

"
31,PGR,"Conviction is vital to the managers of Parnassus Fund (PARNX). Ian Sexsmith and Robert Klaber, along with lead portfolio manager Jerome Dodson, have guided the fund into the upper echelon of large-cap growth funds by taking big stakes in relatively few stocks.They take above-average bets on each stock, particularly in their top 10 holdings. So they better have done their homework and have high confidence that their picks will pan out. Top holdings as of Jan. 31 include Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Micron Technology (MU).The Parnassus approach is working fine. The average annual returns of Parnassus and its stablemate Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) have surpassed the S&P 500's in the past year, as well as the past three years, five years and 10 years -- by enough to earn them both IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards.Parnassus Endeavor took top honors for being among the top five winners ranked by 10-year average annual return in three categories: overall U.S. diversified equity, as well as growth and large-cap funds. Parnassus Fund was among the top five in growth and large cap.The $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor owns just 26 stocks, while its $950 million stablemate Parnassus Fund holds 36 stocks. The larger fund, which Dodson has managed alone since 2005, has 48% of its assets invested in its top 10 holdings. Parnassus, which has been around since 1984, has 38% embedded in the top 10.Many growth funds hold 50 to 100 stocks in smaller position, seeking to control volatility with greater diversification. Not Parnassus.""We are a high-conviction fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have high active share and are bottom-up stock pickers."" Active share is a measure of how much a portfolio's holdings differ from its benchmark index.Aside from its focused approach, another way the funds stand out is their mandate to invest in good corporate citizens. ""We have no exposure to the energy or utility sectors,"" Sexsmith said. ""We are looking for companies that are best-in-class from an environmental perspective, a social perspective and a governance perspective."" In addition, Parnassus Endeavor's holdings must offer outstanding workplaces.As a multicap fund, the Parnassus team has the flexibility to invest wherever it sees opportunity. ""It is a go-anywhere domestic stock fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have no market-cap restrictions, so it gives us a pretty broad playing field."" Though Parnassus does have more than Endeavor in small and midcaps, 29% vs. 25%, Parnassus still favors large caps with 64% of its assets. Meanwhile, large-cap-oriented Endeavor has 86% in big caps.Some funds aim to control risk by veering only so far from benchmark-index sector weightings. Parnassus' conviction-investing results in some heavy over- and underweighting in sectors. As of Jan. 31, Parnassus Fund had 23% in financials vs. the S&P 500's 16%. Parnassus Endeavor was close to the benchmark in tech with 18%, but had outsize bets of 38% in tech vs. 19%, and 31% in health care vs. 14%.Klaber notes that a long-term focus has been key to the fund's success. Both funds have turnover rates 42% or lower. ""We are a bit more contrarian than other Parnassus funds,"" he said. ""We're willing to accept a wider range of outcomes in the short term.""Indeed, a direct line between top holdings and current fund performance isn't always clear. Some of the two funds' recent top holdings show signs of struggling, including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Allergan (AGN), off 33% and 14% from their 52-week highs.Parnassus screens all potential holdings for relevance. ""We are looking for companies that are becoming increasingly relevant for the products or services they offer,"" Klaber said. ""We want to own companies that are gaining share in their sector or industry. The focus on relevance helps us to avoid value traps."" In value traps, investors are attracted to a stock by its low valuations, but after investors buy, the stock fails to rise.Wide moats are a hallmark of portfolio holdings. ""We seek companies with sustainable competitive advantages,"" Klaber said. ""We feel that provides protection during down markets because there is stored value.""Another important consideration for Parnassus is efficient capital allocation by companies it invests in. ""We go back five years and analyze how management has allocated capital in the past,"" Klaber said. ""We then project how we think they will allocate capital in the future to understand whether they are good stewards of capital.""The Parnassus team creates a three-year forecast with base, bull and bear scenario analyses for potential new stock buys. ""We are looking for asymmetry,"" Klaber said. ""We want companies with moderate to low downside risk and significant upside. An asymmetric risk to reward ratio is a common feature across all of our holdings.""""Historically, the Endeavor Fund has had a tech bias,"" Klaber said. ""As of the end of last year, more than 40% of the fund was invested in tech.""As of the end of January, two sectors accounted for approximately half of the Parnassus Fund. ""From a sector perspective, one of the sectors we have been most overweight is financials,"" Sexsmith said. ""The pro-growth agenda of the new administration has been a tailwind for these firms.""Parnassus is weighted 22.9% in financial service stocks. It added Progressive (PGR) in the first-quarter of 2015. Endeavor also has a stake in the auto insurance company. Sexsmith sees the company's online sales strategy as a disruptive force. ""There aren't many companies that are going to gain market share for as long as we can see,"" he said. ""When we see opportunities like that we are going to invest in them. Every year, Progressive chips away and gains market share. Its market share now is around 9% of the U.S. auto insurance market. That's going to keep going up over time.""Progressive shares have gained 11.4% since the beginning of the year and 19.1% from a year ago.Parnassus is weighted 27.3 in technology. ""In technology, we own a collection of wide-moat businesses with strong growth profiles that trade at attractive valuations,"" Klaber said.Klaber cites eBay (EBAY) as a prime example of a company with a wide moat. It is owned by both Parnassus and Endeavor. ""The source of its moat is a strong network effect where more sellers bring more buyers and vice versa,"" he said.Shares of eBay are up 12% year-to-date and 37.9% over the past year. They broke out of a cup-with-handle base in February, ran up 4%, but have since eased to near the breakout point.IBM (IBM) is a top tech holding in both portfolios. ""It is trading at 13 times earnings, about a 25% discount to the market, with a 3% dividend yield, so expectations are low,"" Klaber said. ""We think its server business will do better than expectations and its strategic initiatives group will continue to see growth accelerate.""IBM has climbed 7.1% so far this year and 24.9% over the last 52 weeks.The Parnassus team sees a lengthy runway for Allergan. The pharmaceutical company is the top holding of Parnassus and a top five holding of Endeavor. ""It has a dominant position in many therapeutic areas,"" Klaber said. ""It's a stock we have owned as a firm since the end of 2013, when it was in the high 80s. We were also buying it aggressively toward the end of last year. This is a company that has six drugs either in phase three or entering phase three in 2017.""Allergan shares have jumped 14.8% in 2017.The Parnassus crew exhibit the kind of patience with Allergan that many growth investors do not. While the company's earnings have grown at a 24% annual rate the past three years, Wall Street analysts see growth slowing to 19% this year and 11% next year. The stock's Relative Price Strength Rating from IBD is just 50.RELATED:Contrarian Pin Oak Equity Rises To The Top

"
37,PGR,"Insurers have long used the age, sex and driving history of their customers to set premium prices. An 18-year-old male driver typically is more expensive to insure than a 45-year-old female driver, for example.
"
38,PGR,"But not every teenager is a bad driver and not every middle-aged person is a good one. In order to more fairly and accurately price insurance, some companies have started to use data mining technology to chip away at old methods.
"
39,PGR,"Taking Behavioral 'Snapshots'
"
40,PGR,"Progressive (PGR) has been among the leaders in this area, permitting its customers to insert a ""Snapshot"" gadget into their cars in order to provide increasingly sophisticated information about their driving habits.
"
41,PGR,"""It made more sense to price premiums on how you actually drive,"" said David Pratt, Progressive's general manager of user-based insurance.
"
42,PGR,"The Mayfield, Ohio-based insurer began developing the gadgets in the mid-1990s. The market for them is growing quickly. The program now generates $2.5 billion in premium revenue for Progressive and serves 2.5 million customers.
"
43,PGR,"Progressive customers receive the gadgets and plug them into their cars. After 30 days, they receive a discount if they drive safely. After six months, the company recalculates the discount. Customers are then asked to return the devices, in part to keep down technology expenses.

In Italy, where telematics-supported insurance is oldest, market penetration is only 4% of insured drivers.
"
49,PGR,"Altering The Actuarials
"
50,PGR,"Such disruptive technology could alter the basic assumption of insurance — that it's better to pool risks because it's impossible to predict misfortunes precisely.
"
51,PGR,"""Companies would stop punishing safe drivers for the mistakes of the risky drivers,"" said Michal Kosinski, a professor at Stanford University.
"
52,PGR,"""In a way, it completely changes the function that insurance has at the moment,"" Kosinski said. ""For the companies, it makes sense. They can give you a discount because they know you better.""
"
53,PGR,"Said Luedke: ""At this point, you can only win: It's only discounts. Now, the level of discounts vary.""
"
54,PGR,"If the practice becomes more popular, one presumes premiums for risky behavior will rise as premiums fall for safer people.
"
55,PGR,"Although primarily used in the auto insurance field, one New York-based insurer, Oscar, gives customers a ""Misfit"" fitness tracker to wear, helping to shave $1 off a premium for each fitness goal reached.
"
56,PGR,"While wireless mobile telematics technology is fresh, the practice of electronic monitoring is not new to property insurers who've long discounted premiums for clients who install smoke detectors and burglar alarms.
"
57,PGR,"Cautiously Invading Privacy
"
58,PGR,"So far, automotive telematics are voluntary but raise questions of privacy. Progressive doesn't monitor customers' whereabouts. Location trackers, such as the OnStar system devised by General Motors (GM), several years ago led to complaints and calls from Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill for new regulation and legislation.
"
59,PGR,"Certain states, such as California, only permit insurance companies to track their customers' accrued mileage. But Timetric, the London researcher, believes governments will drive the growth of automotive telematics through 2018 because of enhanced safety and accountability.

In order to more fairly and accurately price insurance, some companies have started to use data mining technology to chip away at old methods.Taking Behavioral 'Snapshots'Progressive (PGR) has been among the leaders in this area, permitting its customers to insert a ""Snapshot"" gadget into their cars in order to provide increasingly sophisticated information about their driving habits.""It made more sense to price premiums on how you actually drive,"" said David Pratt, Progressive's general manager of user-based insurance.The Mayfield, Ohio-based insurer began developing the gadgets in the mid-1990s. The market for them is growing quickly. The program now generates $2.5 billion in premium revenue for Progressive and serves 2.5 million customers.Progressive customers receive the gadgets and plug them into their cars. After 30 days, they receive a discount if they drive safely. After six months, the company recalculates the discount. Customers are then asked to return the devices, in part to keep down technology expenses.The company also has resorted to federal litigation to protect its patented telematics technology.State Farm Insurance's ""Drive Safe and Save"" program measures the rates of acceleration and deceleration, braking habits, even the G-forces around curves. Participants can see their premiums drop as much as 50%.""There is an advantage to the customer in that the customer wants more control over the premiums they pay,"" said Dick Luedke, a spokesman for State Farm. ""It might cause you to go a little more slowly and a little more carefully than you otherwise would.""Allstate (ALL), which settled a patent lawsuit with Progressive in 2011, has its own ""Drivewise"" system.Timetric, a London-based market research company, estimated in an October 2014 study that 4.5 million telematics-supported insurance products with premiums totaling $4 billion had been written globally by December 2013, with Italy, the U.K. and U.S. being the most mature markets. In Italy, where telematics-supported insurance is oldest, market penetration is only 4% of insured drivers.Altering The ActuarialsSuch disruptive technology could alter the basic assumption of insurance — that it's better to pool risks because it's impossible to predict misfortunes precisely.""Companies would stop punishing safe drivers for the mistakes of the risky drivers,"" said Michal Kosinski, a professor at Stanford University.""In a way, it completely changes the function that insurance has at the moment,"" Kosinski said. ""For the companies, it makes sense. They can give you a discount because they know you better.""Said Luedke: ""At this point, you can only win: It's only discounts. Now, the level of discounts vary.""If the practice becomes more popular, one presumes premiums for risky behavior will rise as premiums fall for safer people.Although primarily used in the auto insurance field, one New York-based insurer, Oscar, gives customers a ""Misfit"" fitness tracker to wear, helping to shave $1 off a premium for each fitness goal reached.While wireless mobile telematics technology is fresh, the practice of electronic monitoring is not new to property insurers who've long discounted premiums for clients who install smoke detectors and burglar alarms.Cautiously Invading PrivacySo far, automotive telematics are voluntary but raise questions of privacy. Progressive doesn't monitor customers' whereabouts. Location trackers, such as the OnStar system devised by General Motors (GM), several years ago led to complaints and calls from Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill for new regulation and legislation.Certain states, such as California, only permit insurance companies to track their customers' accrued mileage. But Timetric, the London researcher, believes governments will drive the growth of automotive telematics through 2018 because of enhanced safety and accountability.Even the existing voluntary programs — including a recent Progressive-GM partnership giving participating drivers a detailed driving assessment — seem to empower the insured and insurers.""If we can identify those really safe drivers and give them a good deal,"" Pratt said, ""they're more likely to remain customers.""

117,PGR,"The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17 before the market opens. Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 2.60%.Factors to be Considered in Q2The top line is likely to have witnessed improvement in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by an expected increase in premiums, investment income coupled with higher service revenues and fees as well as other revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period’s revenues is pegged at $7.9 billion, up 19.7%.Solid policies in force are anticipated to have improved premiums in the second quarter.Strong performing Vehicle and Property businesses might have benefited Personal and Commercial business lines.The company’s continued spending on marketing and competitive product offerings plus a sturdy market presence should consistently drive personal auto business.However, expenses might have increased due to higher loss and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs plus other underwriting expenses.The company’s Property business has already gained traction. Given its expanded footprint and a compelling product offering, the Property business is expected to have delivered solid results.   Though there were cat events like rain storms in the United States, underwriting results will still be not severely hampered. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss of about $7.1 billion in the quarter under consideration. The analyst also noted that the tally is much lower than the general figure of around $14 billion that insurers have suffered in any given second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.07 per share, reflecting 81.4% year-over-year growth.With respect to the earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.23%.The Progressive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Progressive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Progressive Corporation QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model SaysOur proven model shows that Progressive is likely to beat estimates this quarter to be reported.

118,PGR,"The current economic backdrop is shaping up well for insurers as they are witnessing gradual improvement in interest rates along with substantially lower level of catastrophe loss and reduced tax (owing to a noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1, 2018). These factors have also led to a promising performance in the first quarter of 2018 and augur well for an encouraging second quarter. Hence, we expect the insurance industry to continue with the momentum and deliver a better-than-expected show as the year progresses.However, concerning factors like weather-related events, political turmoil and regulatory uncertainty have posed challenges to the insurance industry, which nevertheless, maintained its focus on achieving two important objectives — the top-line sales growth while bolstering bottom-line profitability. Therefore, despite the aforementioned headwinds, we expect some insurers to generate desirable results and keep the optimism alive among investors on the stock.Pertaining to the interest rate environment, continued improvement in the interest rates has proved to be beneficial for insurers, reflecting stability in the U.S. economy at the same time. The FOMC meeting on Jun 13, 2018 marked the second interest rate hike so far this year, which further cemented insurers’ confidence in the regulatory body’s promise to deliver a fourth rate raise this year and three more in 2019 (exceeding the previously announced limit of two hikes). The recent growth announced at the meeting has put the current interest rate in the 1.75-2% range.An advancing rate environment will ultimately profit the insurance industry with regard to its players’ investment income (a component of their revenues), thereby adding to their overall top line. For instance, the life insurance companies will be relieved of the operating pressures, induced by tight credit spreads that the low-rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time. Moreover, amid the improving interest rate environment, the property and casualty (P&C) insurers will also gain traction from a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes.Speaking of underwriting performance, per a Fitch Ratings report, the insurance space is expected to regain substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slower pace after being badly hit by the devastating hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017.With The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) projecting a total catastrophe loss of $387 million after tax for the months of April and May 2018, the insurance industry players are not expecting a huge impact on their underwriting results. Hence, the occurrence of catastrophe loss is not likely to be a huge drag for the insurance industry, which is hopeful about its underwriting performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, insurers have likely witnessed a noticeable rise in combined ratios, which might inch close to a break-even point as the year moves ahead.Notably, capital strength displayed by insurers will assist them to offset a near-term volatility and the effects of adversities.Additionally, mergers and acquisitions have recently grabbed headlines as an important trend to look out for in 2018. The last couple of years has prepared insurers to take an aggressive and positive stance toward the deal-making environment in 2018, mainly driven by an evolving industry and M&A environment. Hence, this trend is expected to add more fuel to the already upbeat performance of the insurance industry.There are also other factors which have aided results in the last reported quarter and are likely to repeat this quarter to be reported too. The unemployment rate in May 2018 came in at 3.8% (the lowest since 2000 and 1969) with the gross domestic product estimated to grow 2.7% (an increase from the earlier estimate of 2.5%). Further, the inflation fell just below the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.This apart, a recovering housing market looks geared up to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written.Moreover, the tax cut, slashing the tax rate to 21% from 35%, proved to be an attractive option for most corporates including insurers as it helped driving the companies’ bottom-line, boosting margins directly.A sturdy financial position, attributable to continued capital inflow into the industry, will not only back insurers to counter a near-term instability as well as the impact of unfavorable occurrences but will also keep the industry’s growth trend active.Key PicksDespite a slew of headwinds posing a threat to insurers this year, tailwinds like the positive interest rate environment, better underwriting results and a steadily thriving economy have likely cushioned the following stocks to push the envelope further for yielding profits via an underlying strength and business streamlining.We have zeroed in on three stocks that have had a bull run despite all odds. These stocks also carry a VGM Score of A. We expect these best bets to deliver an impressive performance given northbound estimate revisions, a solid Zacks Rank and share price outperformance on year-to-date basis.

120,PGR,"The Finance sector is set to kick off its earnings season this week with major banks reporting quarterly results. Improving rate environment and tax cuts should continue to drive the sector’s performance.  Per the Earnings Outlook, earnings for the sector are expected to increase 18.5% on 3.6% higher revenues.Insurers, an important component of the Finance sector, are shortly going to release their financial numbers. Earnings of the Insurance Industry are envisioned to grow 12.2% in the second quarter, given a slew of tailwinds favoring its operating environment.Progressing Rate EnvironmentThe second quarter of 2018 marked the second rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year, reflecting a robust economy. The rate now stands at 2% with the regulatory body’s intentions of two more raises in 2018 followed by three in 2019 as well as a couple of in 2020.A Benign Cat EnvironmentAlthough the second quarter escaped the harsh lashes of Mother Nature, a few cat events like rain storms in the United States and Canada still plagued the period. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss of about $7.1 billion in the quarter under discussion. The analyst also noted that the count is much lower than the general tally of around $14 billion insurers having suffered natural calamities in any given second quarter.However, price hikes, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and adherence to reinsurance covers will help insurers withstand the deficits.Also, lower cat loss means lower claims, which in turn, strengthens reserves. The insurance industry is already boasting an all-time sturdy capital position.While surplus capital is lending a cushion to more capital deployment in growth initiatives, mergers and acquisitions plus shareholder value addition, the same is also responsible for restricting the desired pricing. A Morgan Stanley analyst noted that Jun 1 renewals witnessed an average 1% increase, which is lower than expected.Tax Reforms and Capital DeploymentPer the implementation of the new tax rate effective first quarter, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. Not only will this aid in margin expansion but also increase dividend payouts owing to rise in net profit available to shareholders.W.R. Berkley Corporation approved a 7.1% raise in dividends as well as a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share. Chubb Limited announced a 3% hike in quarterly dividend to 73 cents per share. Unum Group too enhanced its quarterly dividend by 13% and approved a new $750-million share buyback program.Promising Economic NumbersJob growth has been solid through the second quarter of 2018 with an average of nearly 0.211 million.  Unemployment rate in June was 4%.Per Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations, the GDP growth rate for the quarter is estimated at 2%.Price PerformanceThe Insurance industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index during the second quarter. While the industry has decreased 5.3%, the elite index has gained 3.8%.Q2 OutperformersRiding high on tailwinds, insurers enjoyed a favorable operational backdrop to generate improved results. With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we identified stocks poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter.  Our proven model conclusively states that because of an ideal combination of the two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank — the following stocks are likely to surpass expectations at their earnings announcement.

122,PGR,"A recent report by Insurance Information Institute stated that the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be milder than the earlier forecast. This is a relief for insurers since they faced above-average catastrophe activity in 2017 and incurred billions in losses from claim costs.Improved climatic conditions, increasing interest rates and a so-far resilient U.S. economy in the face of the trade spat with China, bode well for the industry. Therefore investing in stocks from this space is a wise option.Milder-Than-Expected Hurricane SeasonColorado State University (CSU) released its updated outlook for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season earlier in the month. The report predicts a below-normal season with a total of 11 named storms (including Alberto which formed in May), four hurricanes and one major hurricane (maximum sustained winds of 111 miles per hour or greater; Category 3-5 on the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale).  This forecast marks a considerable reduction from their June outlook of 14 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes.  Per the Aon Benfield report, preliminary weather-related losses for insurers in the United States for June 2018 were $2.6 billion.A Painful 2017These predictions come as a great relief to insurance players after having faced with unprecedented catastrophe losses in 2017. Per Aon, in 2017, the record-breaking weather-related events across the globe included Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, plus Typhoon Hato in China and Cyclone Debbie in Australia. For historical context, the report said, 2017’s natural catastrophe losses were 93% higher than the 2000-2016 average. Willis Re report said that the insured loss estimates from major natural catastrophes in 2017 of about $143 billion, is the highest since the annual market loss of $120 billion observed in 2011.  And U.S. insurers bore most of the burnt in 2017.One of the players, XL Group, reported a combined ratio of 108.3% for 2017, indicating underwriting loss (an underwriting ratio of more than 100% indicates loss for an insurer.)  Another company, The Allstate, incurred $3 billion in catastrophe losses, making 2017 the fourth-highest catastrophe loss incurred year. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance operations suffered nearly $2.8 billion of cat losses, which led to a 17.8% decline in the company’s earnings for 2017. Its insurance and reinsurance entities posted an after-tax underwriting loss of $2.2 billion.Surplus Capital a BoonLow cat loss will lead to lower loss claims, which will in turn save insurers’ reserves and lead to capital surplus. The industry is already boasting surplus capital. According to ISO, a Verisk business, and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI), private U.S. property/casualty insurers saw investment gains push the industry’s surplus to a new all-time-high value of $752.5 billion in 2017, up 7.4% year over year.A benign cat loss environment coupled with record capital surplus positions the players in the industry for long-term growth. We therefore expect players to use part of its surplus funds to extend mergers and acquisitions, form of new business units, and invest further in technology, which should drive business growth and efficiency gains. Part of the funds should be returned to shareholders in the form of share buyback and dividend payouts. We therefore expect to hear more stories of dividend hikes and increased share repurchases from this space.Rising Rates Another PositiveThe increase in Fed funds rates is another positive for the insurance industry, which had been suffering from low returns on its investments portfolio due to near zero interest rates for a prolonged period. With last month’s rate hike, the Fed funds rate stands at 2% now. There are expectation of two more rate hikes for the rest of 2018. For 2019, the interest rate is estimated to be 3.1%, up from 2.9% projected at its May FOMC meeting, while the same is expected to reach 3.4% at 2020 end. These trends bode well for insurers’ investment income. The industry’s investment income increased 5.2% in 2017 and the uptrend should continue.In a year’s time the industry has grown 8.9%, compared with the rise of 14.8% in the S&P500 index.Stocks to PickGiven the favorable trends, it is wise to invest stocks in this space. We have thus chosen stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Each of these stocks has witnessed upward revisions in 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate and carry a Value Style Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Progressive Corp.

124,PGR,"Earnings growth interests all, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t be able to stand the test of time. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, deduct production cost and you will have earnings!This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PriceWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks Rank Buy and Strong Buy are allowed.

Banking on these positives, we expect the company to continue this momentum in the near term.Better Investment Results: Investment income, a major contributor to insurers’ top line, has been improving over the past few years owing to rising interest rates, improved limited partnership income along with a well-balanced portfolio.

126,PGR,"A favorable operating environment has set the stage for insurers to perform well through the second half of 2018. Though macro factors like interest rate hike, trade tariffs, rise in oil prices and inflation rate should continue to render volatility in markets and sectors, the insurance industry is expected to push limits, banking on inherent strength cushioned by a beneficial operating environment.Driving ForcesStrengthening of the U.S. economy has propelled the Federal Reserve raise rate from its near-zero level. In its June meeting, Federal funds rate was projected at 2.4% for 2018. Though insurers have lowered their exposure to rate sensitive instrument, yet given the accelerated pace of rate hikes, they stand to benefit.Employment statistics instill optimism as a solid labor market reflecting lower unemployment level and higher wages increases the disposable income, thus widening scope for more policy writings. Fed officials anticipate a 3.8% unemployment rate while GDP is expected to grow 2.7% in 2018.Also, increased frequency of catastrophe events has impelled an increase in coverage policies.The tax rate overhaul, amounting to $1.5-trillion lower tax burden, slashed the rate to 21% from 35%. A lower tax incidence broadens chances of effective capital deployment as well as margin expansion. Insures have already started to see benefits of this lower tax incidence.  The first half of 2018 escaped the brutal blows of nature but given the unprecedented nature of catastrophes, none is sure what lies ahead. The second half of 2017 witnessed the merciless wrath of nature turning the year into the costliest phase in terms of catastrophe loss. While Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in August, Irma and Maria devastated parts of the United States in September. And further adding to the woes, were two consecutive earthquakes in Mexico in September. Also, there were California wildfires during October affecting many.Catastrophic occurrences weigh on insurers’ underwriting profitability. Nonetheless, price hikes by the industry players following a series of cat events, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and taking reinsurance covers should help insurers withstand the deficits.While greater demand for insurance (particularly with the emergence of new insurable risks including cyber threats) will keep the business of P&C insurers afloat, their willingness to negotiate on policy terms and ample capital strength will intensify the competition for grabbing a sizeable market share in the quarters ahead.Given an all-time high capital level, mergers and acquisitions are arresting attention of late. While these should help curb competition, consolidations should enhance insurers’ portfolio.Robust reserves, all-time high capital level, focus to boost the top line while improving the bottom line should help insurers emerge winners going ahead.Stocks Trading CheapYear to date, the insurance industry has declined 6.9% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 2.6%.However, given a favorable operating backdrop and solid fundamentals of the industry, it seems apt to add insurance stocks to investors’ portfolio now as the valuation looks cheap now. Price-to-book ratio (P/BV), the most appropriate multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, is 2.15, lower than the S&P 500 index’s 3.85 as well as the Finance sector’s reading of 2.47.Stocks to Add to PortfolioWith the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we shortlisted an array of insurance stocks with a bullish Zacks Rank supported by upward estimate revisions over the last 60 days and an impressive Value Score of A or B.

128,PGR,"Gradual improvement in interest rates, substantially lower level of catastrophe loss, reduced tax (owing to a noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1, 2018) and improving economy have resulted in a favorable first half performance and set the tone for an encouraging second half. We expect the insurance industry to continue with the momentum and deliver a better-than-expected show as the year progresses.Notably, insurers battled against the challenges faced during the first half, while remaining focused on achieving two important objectives, which are top-line sales growth while bolstering bottom-line profitability.Concerning factors like weather-related events and political turmoil are beyond any insurer’s control. Despite such trials, we expect some insurers to generate desirable results and keep the optimism alive among investors on the stock.Let us talk about a few driving factors that have paved the way for insurers to perform well in the first half, allaying apprehensions among stockholders.Rising Interest Rates: A Boon for Insurers?The gradually increasing interest rates have been a blessing for insurers, who are major beneficiaries of the climbing interest rates. The FOMC meeting on Jun 13, 2018 marked the second interest rate hike so far this year, which further strengthened insurers’ confidence in the regulatory body’s promise to deliver four rate raises in 2018. The recent growth announced at the meeting has put the current interest rate in the 1.75-2% range.The June meeting also highlighted the seventh straight rate hike since late 2015, the period when the Fed initiated the procedure of raising interest rates from an almost zero level. With the Central Bank adopting a somewhat aggressive stance toward increasing interest rates, we can expect it to deliver its promise of a fourth rate raise this year and three more in 2019 (exceeding the previously announced limit of two hikes).An advancing rate environment will ultimately benefit the insurance industry with regard to insurers’ investment income (a component of their revenues), thereby accelerating adding to the overall top line. For instance, the life insurance companies will be relieved of the operating pressures, resulting from tight credit spreads that the low-rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time. Rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide the required breather for insurers to maintain decent margins.Amid the improving interest rate environment, the property and casualty (P&C) insurers will also gain traction from a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes.Will Favorable Underwriting Performance Buoy Optimism?California mudslides, northeast winter storms and a couple of severe wind and hail events, which mainly affected Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and certain Midwest states, have impacted the results during the first half of 2018. With The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) projecting a total catastrophe loss of $387 million after tax for the months of April and May 2018, the insurance industry players are not expecting a huge impact on their underwriting results. Thus, the positivity surrounding a better underwriting performance remains intact despite such massive inclement weather-oriented losses being incurred.In fact, per a Fitch Ratings report, the insurance space is expected to regain substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slower pace after being badly hit by the unprecedented hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017. Moreover, insurers have likely witnessed a noticeable improvement in combined ratios, which might come close to a break-even point as the year goes on.Capital strength displayed by insurers will in turn assist them to counter a near-term volatility and the effects of adversities.Other High Points for a Winning PerformanceThere are a few other factors that have bolstered the insurance industry in the first half of 2018. Notably, the unemployment rate in May 2018 came in at 3.8% (the lowest since 2000 and 1969) with the gross domestic product estimated to grow 2.7% (an increase from the earlier estimate of 2.5%). Further, the inflation came in just below the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.This apart, a recovering housing market looks set to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written.Moreover, the tax cut, which slashed the tax rate to 21% from 35%, proved to be an attractive option for most corporates including insurers, as it helped aiding the companies’ bottom-line, boosting margins directly.A strong liquidity profile, attributable to continued capital inflow into the industry, will not only back insurers to counter a near-term volatility and the impact of hostile occurrences but will also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Outperformers in 1HDespite a slew of headwinds posing a threat to insurers this year, tailwinds like the positive interest rate environment, better underwriting results and a steadily thriving economy have likely cushioned the following stocks to push the envelope and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification.We have zeroed in on three stocks that have had a bull run despite all odds. We expect these best bets to deliver a consistent performance given northbound estimate revisions, a solid Zacks Rank and an impressive VGM Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a commendable VGM Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the top investment opportunities.Mayfield Village, OH-based The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) provides personal and commercial auto insurance, residential property insurance plus other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services, primarily in the United States.

130,PGR,"The ongoing two-day FOMC meeting is concluding later today and anticipation surrounding its outcome is sky-high. The Fed is on its way to raise interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2% driven by a strengthening economy and higher inflation. Per CME group, the odds of a June rate hike are 96%. This would also mark the seventh rate hike since December 2015.Additionally, investors are keenly waiting for the Fed’s guidance on the future rate trajectory. Many analysts are expecting four lift-offs compared to the three penciled in for this year, suggesting a faster-than-expected tightening path by the central bank. The minutes from the May meeting also revealed that some policymakers are betting on four rate hikes. This is especially true, as the economy has expanded for nine years and the United States has now entered its second-longest expansion phase since 1785 with unemployment dropping to 3.8%, the lowest level since 2000.Additionally, inflation has been trending above the Fed’s 2% target over the past few months. The latest data showed that it accelerated at the fastest pace in more than six years in May. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% in May, bringing the annual inflation (12 months through May) to 2.8% -- the biggest gain since February 2012 and following a 2.5% increase in April.However, many experts caution against the fourth rate hike and expect the Fed to leave its future rate forecast unchanged, thanks to tariff and trade threats that could hamper global growth. A surprise could also be in store as the Fed may signal an early exit from its history-making program to reduce the level of bonds on its balance sheet.Higher interest rates will benefit the financial sector, as it would bolster profits for banks, insurance companies, discount brokerage firms and asset managers.

Snapshot, Robinson and Home Quote Explorer programs are estimated to have boosted the business too.However, expenses might have increased due to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs plus other underwriting expenses.Though there were cat events like the California mudslide and the northeast winter storms dominating the start of the year, underwriting results will still not be hampered to a greater degree. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between $5 billion and $10 billion, much lower than losses incurred in the past years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.19 per share, reflecting 77.6% year-over-year growth.With respect to the earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.01%.The Progressive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Progressive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Progressive Corporation Quote What the Quantitative Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that Progressive is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock must have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you can see below.Zacks ESP: Progressive has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.19. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Progressive carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around are:Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +11.71 % and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Travelers Companies, Inc.

133,PGR,"Riding high on an improving economic backdrop, increasing interest rates and a benign catastrophe environment, the insurance industry seems well-placed to facilitate players in ramping up their growth profile.Recently, the Fed has raised the interest rate by 25 basis points under the new chairman Jerome Powell and the rate now stands at 1.75%. The Federal Reserve has hinted at two more hikes in 2018 followed by three in 2019 and two in 2020, thus pushing up the rate to 3.4%.An increased rate is expected to positively impact the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other upsides.Underwriting results — the major indicator of profitability for any insurer — are expected to improve on the back of a favorable catastrophe setting. Though, the first quarter escaped the wrath of Mother Nature, there were a few cat events like California mudslide and northeast winter storms. Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has estimated $305 million of cat loss for the first quarter of 2018.Nonetheless, price increases by insurers will help generating improved premiums.Also, President Donald Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul of tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden. The tax rate was slashed to 21% from 35%, calling for a $1.5-trillion tax cut.Interestingly, due to lower tax incidence, net profit available to shareholders will be higher, thereby leaving room for higher dividend payout by the companies.The Property and Casualty Insurance industry is ranked at #200, denoting the bottom half of the Zacks Industry Ranks for 265 plus industries. However, the industry’s registered rise of 1.3% has outperformed the S&P 500 index’s loss of 0.8% year to date. Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) and The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report). While the former with a market capitalization of $37.88 billion provides commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance products and services in the United states and internationally, the latter provides personal and commercial auto insurance, residential property insurance as well as other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services, primarily in the United States with a market cap of $35.7 billion.A better-ranked stock from the same industry is CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank stocks here.Zacks RankTravelers carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Progressive has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Travelers emerges a clear winner in this round.Price PerformanceShares of Progressive have soared 55.9%, outperforming both Travelers’ rally of 15.9% and the industry’s increase of 17.2% in a year. The Progressive stock undoubtedly performs better with this metric. ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers because of its variations in quarterly earnings. The industry’s P/B ratio is 1.43. However, both Progressive and Travelers with a reading of 3.84 and 1.59, respectively, are overvalued compared with the industry’s tally. Yet with a comparatively lower P/B ratio, Traveler’s shares are cheaply priced and hence the stock wins this round.  Debt-to-EquityTravelers has a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 27.6 compared with the industry average of 29.1% and Progressive’s leverage ratio of 35.6.  Therefore Travelers has a visible edge over Progressive here.  Return on EquityProgressive with a return on equity of nearly 16% exceeded the industry average of 4.8% as well as Travelers’s reading of 8.6%. Return on equity is a profitability measure, identifying how the company is effectively utilizing its shareholders’ money. Hence Progressive wins hands down this time. Dividend YieldBoth Travelers and Progressive underperform the industry’s dividend yield of 6.73%. Yet with 2.07% yield, Travelers scores higher than Progressive’s yield of 1.84%. Combined RatioCombined ratio, the percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses, determines an insurer’s underwriting profitability.Progressive’s combined ratio was 93.4 in 2017 while Travelers’s is 97.9. Thus Progressive edges past Travelers with this parameter.Earnings ESPBoth companies are set to report their earnings in the latter half of this month. Per our proven model, Travelers is set to deliver a positive surprise with the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank of 2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.00%. While Progressive’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes prediction inconclusive although it has a favorable Zack Rank of 3.Earnings Surprise HistoryAs far as the companies’ surprise history goes, Travelers earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 43.06%.Progressive’s metric too has outpaced the consensus mark in the last two quarters with an average four-quarter surprise of 5.01%.Travelers visibly beats Progressive in this round of the comparison game.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth Projections    Progressive’s 2018 earnings estimates have moved 5.1% north in the last 30 days. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has been revised 2.6% upward. The consensus mark for 2018 reflects 40.7% growth on 17.5% revenue increase. For 2019, the bottom line is expected to rise 5.2% on 12% higher revenues. The projected long-term earnings growth is pegged at 7.3%.For Travelers, the consensus mark for 2018 earnings has been raised 0.3% in the last 30 days while the same for 2019 has been revised upward only by a cent. The  consensus estimate for 2018 reflects 45.9% surge on 2.6% revenue improvement. For 2019, the bottom line is likely to increase 6.2% on 3.9% higher top line. The anticipated long-term earnings growth stands at 7.5%.This round lends equal weightage to both competitors.To ConcludeTravelers scored higher than Progressive on the basis of a solid Zacks Rank, valuation, sturdy leverage ratio, strong dividend yield and a robust earnings surprise history. However, considering yardsticks like price performance, return on equity or a combined ratio, Progressive seems better-equipped than Travelers. Per our comparative analysis, Travelers is thus, a more economically feasible investment option for investors than Progressive.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

135,PGR,"A healthy business with steady sales growth is the key to survival in today’s fast changing and highly competitive business environment. As such, superior revenues are necessary to drive growth, and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise.Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities. Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period, it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations. In such cases, the company is valued on the basis of revenues. This is because sales growth (or decline) is usually an early indicator of the company’s future earnings performance.The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio takes into account a company’s revenues when valuing it. It remains the key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate revenue figures as it can with earnings.  While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making, this in isolation doesn’t indicate too much about a company’s future prospects. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits.Therefore, a consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control, and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation for it.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Burbank, CA, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) operates as an entertainment company.

139,PGR,"Credit rating giant A.M. Best has downgraded all of AmTrust Financial Services, Inc.’s (AFSI  -  Free Report) Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs) and Indicative Long-Term IRs. This apart, the rating agency downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (Long-Term ICR) of AmTrust from “bbb” to “bbb-” while removing the same from review with negative implications.Concurrently, the rating agency has downgraded the Financial Strength Rating to A- (Excellent) from A (Excellent) along with the Long-Term ICR from “a” to “a-” for the units of AmTrust Group. Moreover, the rating agency removed the ratings from under review status with negative implications.Nonetheless, A.M. Best has affirmed the FSR of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a-” of AmTrust Title Insurance Company while removing the assigned rating from under review status with negative implications. The outlook for all the aforementioned ratings remained stable.AmTrust’s balance sheet, acknowledged as extremely strong by the rating agency, along with sustained operational performance, marginal enterprise risk management (ERM) and a neutral business profile are represented by the aforementioned ratings.Also, an adequate level of risk-adjusted capitalization, measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), and financial leverage plus coverage metrics, which remain within the guidelines for the current rating level, are also reflected by the ratings.The ratings of AmTrust Title Insurance Company signify a solid balance sheet, marginal operational performance, restricted business profile and marginal ERM.AmTrust witnessed improvement in its risk-adjusted capitalization, measured by BCAR during the first quarter of 2018. This was attributable to a major interest sale from a portion of the property and casualty (P&C) insurer’s U.S.-based service and fee business.Moreover, the balance sheet evaluation denotes the P&C insurer’s comparatively modest exposure to natural catastrophe and terrorism events, reflected in favorable performance on stress tests of its risk-adjusted capitalization.  However, adverse development of previous years’ loss reserves suffered in 2016 and 2017 can offset the above-mentioned positive rating factors.Completion of the rating agency’s review along with the issuance of an “A-” (Excellent) rating and a stable outlook, will allow the P&C insurer to move ahead with the much-needed confidence and assurance in its ability to lend support to its business on a global scale as well as capitalize on the opportunities for the future.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence as well as maintaining credit worthiness of a stock. Whereas rating downgrades not only hamper business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently, AmTrust has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of AmTrust have surged 44.8% year to date against the industry’s decrease of 5.2%. We expect the company’s premium growth, high policy retention levels, disciplined sales execution as well as robust capital position to drive the stock higher in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd.

144,PGR,"Trade related conflicts, which commenced in March due to President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, are showing no signs of subsiding. Investors’ apprehensions regarding an impending global trade war have kept the market on edge resulting in severe volatility for the last three months.The United States and China is yet to reach any sort of understanding to defuse trade tensions between the two countries. Moreover, the U.S. government has extended tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union.Furthermore, geopolitical conflict related to North Korea still persists. All these factors are resulting in market fluctuations on a regular basis. At this juncture, investment in low-beta stocks with favorable Zacks Rank will be a lucrative choice.Trade Conflicts Loom LargeSince March, the United States and China are engaged in a trade tussle wherein both have imposed tariffs worth $50 billion on the other’s imports. Two rounds of meeting between the countries high-level delegations have failed to reach a meaningful resolution.On May 31, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that the U.S. government will impose 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum for imports of Canada, Mexico and the European Union from Jun 1.As a result of these trade conflicts, U.S. exports have become vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that Canada intense to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum on the U.S. imports. Further, Mexico stated that it would target several U.S. goods with tariffs including pork bellies, apples, grapes, cheeses and flat steel. The European Union is also considering imposing tariffs on a broad range of U.S. imports.No End to Geopolitical DisturbancesThe development of geopolitical disturbances is taking a toll on the stock markets. In April, it was the U.S. military intervention in Syria which angered Russia. In May, the United States withdrawal from the nuclear pact and plans of re-imposition of oil sanctions on Iran stirred up new problems. In fact it resulted in oil price shock.President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un on Jun 12 in Singapore. However, the proposed meeting was jeopardized in May after Kim Kye Gwan, a senior foreign ministry official of North Korea stated that the country won’t take part in the summit as it will focus only on denuclearization of North Korea. It remains to be seen whether a truce can be reached between the countries.Our Top PicksStock markets are likely to remain volatile in near future due to trade concerns, geopolitical conflicts and may be some sector specific issues. At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks will be fruitful. The beta is equal to 1 which means that the stock is as volatile as the market. So, a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1. However, picking winning stocks can be a difficult task.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select the winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

145,PGR,"The Zacks Property and Casualty industry is currently undervalued compared with the S&P 500 index. The price-to-book (P/B) ratio, the best multiple for valuing insurers because of their unpredictable financial results, is 1.4, less than the broader market’s P/B of 3.9. Such below market positioning hints at room for upside in the coming quarters.Before the valuation expands, it is wise to add some undervalued stocks with growth potential to investors’ portfolio for better returns.Driving ForcesUnderwriting results, a P&C insurer’s profitability measure, are favored by a benign catastrophe environment. The ongoing year has endured a California mudslide in the first quarter followed by two severe wind and hailstorms witnessed in Texas and some parts of Southeastern states during April. A not so active cat environment coupled with price hikes should fuel underwriting profitability for insurers. Also, natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Though P&C insurers’ financials are less sensitive to interest rates than life insurers’, as the large financial portfolios managed by these carriers are designed to be fairly conservative, yet the improving interest rate environment will cushion to investment income. The interest rate has climbed up to 1.75% from its near-zero level during the financial crisis. While a wave of optimism followed the Fed’s last meeting hinting at a probable June hike, the regulatory body’s indication of more such rate raises this year as well as the next should add more impetus to investment results.The insurance industry is well capitalized. Its capital level is at an all-time high, inspiring players to pursue mergers and acquisitions, thus curbing competition in the process.The tax rate overhaul, calling for $1.5 trillion lower tax burden, slashed the rate to 21% from 35%. Lower tax incidence widens scope for capital deployment as well as margin expansion.An improving employment scenario raises optimism too. Per Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment rate in May was 3.8%, lowest in 18 years.  With the same declining, demand for insurance goes on the rise. This in turn will again drive the premiums higher, the primary source of insurers’ revenues.Price PerformanceThe industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index year to date. While the index has gained 3.2%, the industry has declined 2.3%. Nonetheless, strategic initiatives to build a competitive and diversified portfolio, mergers and consolidation for ramping up growth and global expansion plus an addition of capabilities position insurers well for a healthy performance.Picking the StocksDespite the P&C insurance industry plummeting since the onset of the current year, solid fundamentals will likely boost the insurers’ performance.  With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three P&C insurance stocks with  an impressive Value Score and a bullish Zacks Rank. Back-tested results have shown that stocks with a favorable Style Score of A or B coupled with a solid Zacks Rank are the best investment bets on offer.These stocks have also witnessed northbound estimates reflecting analyst’s confidence in the companies’ operational efficiency.

146,PGR,"Volatility and uncertainty in the stock market has raised the appeal for dividend growth stocks. A history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:Ohio-based The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) provides personal and commercial auto insurance, residential property insurance, and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services primarily in the United States.

150,PGR,"Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing southbound revisions of late. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 7.3% downward while for 2019, the consensus mark moved nearly 0.4% south.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an unimpressive VGM Score of C. Back tested results show that stocks with a favorable VGM Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks.Shares of Reinsurance Group have lost 8.9% year to date, slightly narrower than the industry’s decrease of 10.5%. Although the stock has performed comparatively better than the industry in the above-mentioned time frame, we are apprehensive about its share price movement going forward based on the headwinds faced by the stock that we will discuss below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   What’s Ailing the Stock?Rising Expenses: Reinsurance Group has been incurring rising expenses over the past few years, primarily due to higher claims and other policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses as well as interest expenses. The life insurer witnessed the metric increase 5% over the past five years. We do not expect any major turnaround in this respect in the near term. It is important to note that escalating expenses are likely to restrict operating margin expansion, which in turn might hurt the company’s overall growth.Weak Australian Business: Additionally, the company’s Australian business has been displaying weak performance over a considerable period of time, mainly due to competitive direct and reinsurance markets, complex product designs, softening claims experience and increasing legal activity. We continue to anticipate a certain level of volatility in this business in the near term.Dwindling Cash Flows: Moreover, Reinsurance Group’s cash flow from operations has also been on the wane over an extended period of time and we expect volatility in this metric to continue in the short term. Dwindling cashflows might restrain the company’s financial flexibility.Low ROE: Return on equity — a measure for comparing a company’s profitability — stands at 8%, noticeably below the industry average of 12.1%. Also, the company’s long-term growth is 9%, much lower than the industry’s 11.9% tally.Choosing the StocksWhile Reinsurance Group appears far from being an attractive pick right now, there are a few good solid stocks in the insurance space, which promises greater returns to fill in pockets with. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally so far this year.We have narrowed down to four investor-friendly stocks with an upside potential to enhance one’s portfolio by means of Zacks Stock Screener.

152,PGR,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 net operating income of $2 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. Also, the bottom line improved 6.9% from the year-ago period. Lower effective tax rate owing to the tax cut and decent underlying profitable growth in key businesses like mobile business and multi-family housing, drove this improvement. However, higher level of net operating loss at the Corporate segment and a substantial catastrophe loss in Global Housing, partially offset this upside.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. Quote Total revenues improved 7.2% year over year to $1.6 billion, mainly attributable to higher premiums earned, fees and other income as well as net investment income. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.2%.Net investment income improved nearly 8% year over year to $130.2 million.Total benefits, loss and expenses increased 12.4% to $1.5 billion, mainly due to a substantial increase in policyholder benefits, selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.Segmental PerformanceNet earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing slid about 1.6% year over year to $523.1 million, primarily due to lower placement rates as well as real-estate owned volume in lender placed insurance plus reduction in client demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions. However, sustained growth in multi-family housing and higher contributions from international housing products partially offset this downside.The company reported net operating income of $71.2 million, which increased 15% from the year-ago quarter. This improvement was mainly attributable to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.  Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle improved 14.1% year over year to $918.5 million. This benefit was primarily driven by growth in new and existing mobile protection programs as well as vehicle protection. However, a decline in mobile trade-in volumes partially offset the upside.Net operating income of $55.8 million rose 6.5% year over year. The upside was driven by the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 4.5% year over year to $46.2 million, primarily owing to growth in the United States including prior period sales of the Final Need product.Net operating income slipped 1% year over year to $9.8 million, mainly due to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $20 million, substantially wider than the year-ago quarter’s net operating loss of $10.1 million. Increases in employee-related costs from the year-earlier quarter along with the adverse impact of the reduced effective tax rate were responsible for this downside.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $575 million in corporate capital as of Mar 31, 2018. Total assets rose 1.8% to $32.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2018 from $31.8 billion at year-end 2017.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateThe company did not buy back any shares in the quarter under review.The company’s total dividends amounted to $30 million in the first quarter.2018 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe loss) to grow between 10% and 14% from the reported results of $413 million in 2017. The growth in earnings is likely to reflect a lower effective tax rate and a considerable rise in underlying segment earnings (while adjusting for $12.5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items). Declines in lender-placed insurance and credit insurance are likely to be offset by a profitable increase in Connected Living and multi-family housing as well as vehicle protection.Notably, with the sanction of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), Assurant’s consolidated effective tax rate is anticipated to decrease to 22-23% from 33% with nearly one-third of the savings to be reinvested to support future growth.Assurant projects operating earnings per share (excluding catastrophe loss) to grow in excess of net operating income, representing the benefit of a lower consolidated effective tax rate, moderate growth in underlying earnings as well as capital management.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe loss before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Further, the company expects to witness a decline in the ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and mortgage solutions. However, continued growth in multi-family housing is likely to partially offset this downside. Additional savings from expense management efforts are to be realized toward the end of 2018 and further into 2019. Higher net operating income is expected after reflecting a lower effective tax rate of about 20-21% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth. Revenues are projected to be close to 2017-levels as decrease in lender-placed insurance normalization are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as vehicle protection expansion and expense efficiencies. The ongoing decline in credit insurance will partially offset this probable upside. Lower effective tax rate of 22-24% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is anticipated to boost results. Moreover, the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection, globally.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its revenues and earnings, mainly on the back of the company’s alignment with market leaders before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Lower effective tax rate of about 22% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is estimated to enhance results.Assurant expects full-year net operating loss to be close to 2017’s loss of $63 million before considering the recently sanctioned tax reform at Corporate & Other. The loss will likely increase after taking into account an effective tax rate of about 20%.Dividends from the units, namely Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed are predicted to be higher than the net operating income (including catastrophe loss) owing to the implementation of TCJA.   Zacks RankAssurant carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong other players from the insurance industry having already reported first-quarter earnings, the bottom line of The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report), MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG  -  Free Report) and RLI Corp.

Moreover, the bottom line surged 48.2% from the year-ago quarter.Alleghany Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Alleghany Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Alleghany Corporation Quote The company reported net earnings $ 11.04 per share in the reported quarter, which improved 14.2% from the year-ago quarter.The quarter under review benefited from a solid underwriting performance at TransRe, a non-recurring gain related to the conversion of Ares partnership interest, decreased corporate administration expenses as well as lower tax. However, lower underwriting profits at RSUI partially offset this upside.Operational UpdateRevenues for the first quarter declined 3.4% from the year-ago quarter to 1.6 billion.Net premiums written inched up 1.6% year over year to $1253.3 million.Net investment income came in at $124.1 million in the quarter under review, up 7.4% year over year. This improvement is driven by higher dividend income, stemming from a rise in the size of equity portfolio as well as higher interest income. However, this was partially offset by higher performance-based investment fees from the company’s outside investment advisors.Underwriting profit increased 29.1% year over year to $130.9 million.Corporate administration expenses lowered 53.8% to $7.8 million.Segment UpdateReinsurance Segment: Net premiums written increased 5% to $997million owing to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as increased writings in the U.S. casualty lines.

The segment’s first-quarter combined ratio improved by 460 basis points to 89.7%, reflecting an increase in favorable prior-accident year loss reserve development.Insurance Segment: Net premiums written were down 9.7 % to $256.3 million, due to the sale of PacificComp in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, growth at CapSpecialty and RSUI limited this downside. Underwriting profit of $32.1 million was down 33.1% from the year-ago quarter. The combined ratio of the reported segment deteriorated 400 basis points to 87%, attributable to higher non-catastrophe property loss incurred by RSUI.Financial UpdateAlleghany exited the first quarter with cash of $711.04 million, down from $838.38 million at the end of 2017.Debt balance of $1.54 billion inched up 3.8% from 2017-end level.Allegheny’s shareholder equity at the end of the first quarter declined 1.6% to $8.4 billion from $8.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.Book value per share was $545.07 as of Mar 31, 2018, down 1.5% from the level as of Dec 31, 2017.

161,PGR,"Wall Street is likely to walk a tightrope with a trade war knocking at the door. This is especially true as tariff talks between the two world’s biggest economies have worsened with Trump threatening to impose additional massive tariffs on Chinese goods unless Beijing reverses course on its own trade actions and does not change its unfair practices.This time, Trump is seeking a tariff on an additional $400 billion worth of Chinese goods on top of the $50 billion already announced on Jun 15. The latest news came following the tit-for-tat situation by China, which has imposed duties of “the same scale and strength” to that of Trump’s list of Chinese goods targeted for 25% tariff. The Trump administration’s initial list of $34 billion worth of Chinese products, including nuclear reactors, aircraft engines, semiconductors, and a lengthy list of industrial and agricultural machinery, will be subject to duties on Jul 6. The move would intensify the fight with China into an all-out trade war.Aside the political ills, economic fundamentals remained sound given the raft of upbeat data that shows that the economy is piping hot with unemployment dropping to 3.8% — the lowest level since 2000, increasing consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and a rebound in retail sales.Further, a massive $1.5-trillion tax cut will create an economic surge, boosting job growth and reflation trade. It will further accelerate earnings, leading to increased dividend and buyback activities. Additionally, the tax repatriation will allow companies to bring offshore cash back home, paving the way for increased mergers and acquisitions. A combination of all these factors coupled with higher oil price bodes well for the stocks.Given this, we have highlighted some investing ideas that could prove extremely beneficial for investors amid heightened trade tariff talks:Make Defensive Sectors Your FriendInvestors could rotate into defensive sectors, like real estate, utilities and consumer staples, which generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty. This is a much better option than holding cash. LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO  -  Free Report), UGI Corporation (UGI  -  Free Report) and B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) seem intriguing picks. LHO has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and risen nearly 41% over the past three months while the other two have a Zacks Rank #2 each and have gained nearly 15% each in the same time period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bet on Small CapsSmall-cap stocks are less vulnerable to a political issue and could better insulate investors from the ongoing trade war fears. Additionally, these pint-sized stocks tend to outperform on improving economic fundamentals given their less international exposure and higher revenues from the domestic market. Computer Programs and Systems Inc. (CPSI  -  Free Report) could be an attractive choice given its projected earnings growth of 31.07% for this year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of A. It has gained more than 13% over the past three months.  Add Value to Your PortfolioValue stocks have proven to be outperformers over the long term and are less susceptible to trending markets. These stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued. These have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts. While there are several options in the space, Town Sports International Holdings Inc. (CLUB  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 and a top Value Score of A could be a solid pick. The stock saw its earnings estimate moving up from a loss of 4 cents to earnings of 19 cents for this year over the past three months with an expected growth of 211.76%. It has gained 61.1% in the same period.Lower Risk with Low Beta StocksLow-beta stocks exhibit greater levels of stability and usually lose less when the market is crumbling. Though these have lesser risks and lower returns, the stocks are considered safe and resilient in a choppy market. Comstock Resources Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) having beta of 0.10 seems a good bet in this category. It has expected earnings growth of 110.26% for this year and has surged 26.43% over the past three months. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.Overweight Dividend StocksThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these world’s — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis.While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report), having a strong history of dividend growth, seems to be a good pick. Though the yield is not much high at 1.80%, the stock has five-year historical dividend growth of 24.65% and estimated earnings growth of 59.32%. Progressive Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. It has added 3% in the past three months.Invest in Gold StocksGold generally acts as a store of value and hedge against market turmoil. Acting as a leveraged play on the underlying metal prices, metal miners tend to experience more gains than their bullion cousins in a rising metal market. Hence, mining stocks could outperform in the current trade turmoil. As such, Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd (KL  -  Free Report) seems a lucrative pick as it carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. The stock has an estimated earnings growth rate of 56.34% for this year and has risen about 32% over the past three months.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

163,PGR,"The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) has reputation in the market as an industry-leading independent agency writer when it comes to automobile insurance. Its excellent record confirms its successful client servicing, catering to diverse needs. Over the years, the customers have gained a lot from the company’s broad portfolio of varied insurance products and services and by retaining this favorable buzz among brokers, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) P&C insurer consistently emerges stronger over time and looks set to maintain its hot streak in the near future.Growth DriversGiven the credibility of its product portfolio, Progressive has been witnessing premium growth over a considerable period of time and we expect the company to sustain this momentum in the near term. Interestingly, the company’s Personal and Commercial business lines have also been displaying an upward trend pertaining to premiums, driven by its expanded multi-product offering and competitive market rates.Improvement in investment income as well as premiums has enabled the company to grow its revenues over an extended time frame and we expect this trend to continue, going forward.Also, the company’s efforts in boosting customer retention has led to improving policy life expectancy (PLE) over the past few years with the company anticipating to report higher PLE in the upcoming quarters. On the back of competitive pricing, the company strives to ensure that its consumer retention and innovative product offerings address clients’ needs.Further, a robust capital position has allowed the company to enhance shareholder value via dividend payouts, which includes special dividends as well as share buybacks. With respect to dividend payment, the P&C insurer has registered a five-year CAGR (2013-2018) of nearly 41%. Hence, these shareholder-friendly moves continue to raise optimism among investors.In future, we expect Progressive to capitalize on cross-selling auto policies and Progressive Home Advantage (PHA) to better its bundled strategy that will carve out the course for satisfying customers’ need in choosing a combination of home and auto insurance. Also, judicious buyouts will help the company boost its bundling strategy, which might result in policies in force growth in the short term.An Outperformer: Shares of Progressive have gained 9.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 0.2% decrease.

164,PGR,"Investors often overlook sales growth while picking stocks, as a company’s stock price is generally sensitive to its earnings momentum. However, earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily cooked and inflated. That’s why sales must always be taken into consideration while making any investment decision.Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company's health and ability to sustain its business. It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power. The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings.Without some top-line growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable in the long term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires sales growth.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks but it does not ensure profits. Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in New York, AMC Networks Inc.

It is also benefiting from past acquisitions and growth in emerging businesses as reflected by consistent increase in earned premium for the past many years. The trend continued in 2017 which observed an increase of 3% in net written premium.We expect the segment to continue adding to its top line given a number of strategic initiatives taken for growth. These include product enhancements, revenue diversification from the acquisition of SquareTrade, and changes in business mix to focus on those that command high return on equity.After suffering from declining income in its investment portfolio for the past several years, due to market volatility and low interest rates, the company is gradually gaining ground. Net investment income rose 11.8% in 2017, reflecting higher performance-based results and stable income from market-based portfolios. We anticipate further improvement in investment income with an increase in interest rates.A strong capital position aids the company to return value to shareholders via dividend hikes and buybacks. Earlier this month, Allstate increased quarterly dividend by 24.3%. Its current dividend yield of 1.6% is considerably higher than 0.5% for the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the insurance industry can also look at NMI Holdings Inc.

169,PGR,"The Fed minutes released yesterday signaled a hawkish stance and raised the chances of a faster-than-expected rates hike. This is because Fed officials are now more confident about economic growth and the need to keep raising rates as inflation picks up.They now see a much stronger economy than at the end of 2017, thanks to tax cuts, increased consumer spending, rising consumer confidence, 17-year low unemployment, pick up in average hourly earnings and better-than-expected January inflation numbers (read: 5 ETF Ways to Trade Surging Inflation).The minutes point to “further gradual increases” in short-term interest rate. Many market participants believe that the addition of the word “further” opens the door to four hikes. According to data compiled by CME Group, there is 30% probability that the Fed will raise rates four times this year, compared with about 20% a month ago.In particular, the combination of tax cuts and spending increases would result in higher inflation, compelling Fed to tighten its policy aggressively. Notably, the first rate hike for this year is expected to come as soon as next month.The hawkish signals pushed Treasury yields higher, and are expected to benefit the financial sector. The sector is a major beneficiary of a rising interest rate environment. This is because the steepening yield curve bolsters profits for banks, insurance companies, discount brokerage firms and asset managers (read: 7 Ways to Play Rising Yields With Inverse Treasury ETFs).Given this, we have highlighted three ETFs and stocks that are expected to see smooth trading this year and lead the market higher.Top ETFsWhile there are a number of ETFs in this corner of the market, we have highlighted those that have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This is by far the most popular financial ETF in the space with AUM of $33.1 billion and average daily volume of nearly 59 million shares.

171,PGR,"Growing trade and tariff talks between the United States and many other countries across the globe has raised the appeal for dividend growth stocks, which offer income and stability.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 10 stocks that fit the bill:Delaware-based Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) provides performance chemicals in North America, the Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.

172,PGR,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) has been witnessing southbound revisions of late. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 10.1% downward while for 2019, the consensus mark moved nearly 5.8% south.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with an unimpressive VGM Score of D. Back tested results show that stocks with a favorable VGM Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Shares of Cincinnati Financial have also underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has lost 8.1%, massively wider than the industry’s 2.3% decline.  Further, valuation remains stretched at the current level. Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, the best multiple for valuing insurers, the company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.42, higher than the industry average of 1.41.Cincinnati Financial has been incurring rising expenses over the past few years, primarily due to higher insurance loss and contract holders’ benefits besides underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses. We do not expect any major turnaround in this respect in the near term. It is important to note that escalating expenses are likely to restrict operating margin expansion, which in turn might hurt the company’s overall growth.Additionally, the company with its concentration on the Midwest region has been exposed to devastating events. To that end, it has been experiencing high level of catastrophe loss over a considerable period of time and will continue to endure the same given the unpredictability of weather-related occurrences and natural disasters. Further, such huge losses have also induced deterioration in the company’s combined ratio, hampering underwriting profitability.Moreover, Cincinnati Financial’s cash flow from operations has also been on the wane over an extended period of time and we expect volatility in this metric to continue in the near term. Dwindling cashflows might restrain the company’s financial flexibility.Choosing the StocksAlthough Cincinnati Financial doesn’t appear an attractive pick right now, there are a few solid stocks in the insurance space promising greater returns. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally so far this year.We have narrowed down to four investor-friendly stocks with an upside potential to enhance one’s portfolio through the aid of Zacks Stock Screener. Our search is refined by using the a robust Zacks Rank, northbound estimate revisions and a commendable VGM Score of A or B. Buy-rated stocks with strong Value Scores are the best deals on offer.Birmingham, AL-based Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation  offers personal automobile insurance products in the United States.

174,PGR,"AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS  -  Free Report) has earned goodwill in the market, building a robust product and service portfolio, which includes primary and excess products as well as property and casualty (P&C) treaty reinsurance. Its stellar record vouches for its successful servicing of the clients by catering to their diverse needs. Historically, the clients have gained a lot from the company’s bouquet of diverse insurance products and services and by retaining this bullish sentiment among investors, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) P&C insurer continues to evolve stronger over time and looks set to retain its purple patch in the near future.Growth DriversAXIS Capital has been witnessing premium growth over a considerable period of time, driven by new business opportunities across the company’s business lines as well as its astute acquisitions. We expect the P&C insurer to continue capitalizing on such prospects and strategic initiatives going forward, which might result in improved premiums.Apart from helping AXIS Capital to ramp up its premium growth profile, the buyout of Novae Group plc in 2017 is projected to be financially accretive to the company with targeted cost savings of at least $30-$35 million in 2018 while estimating $60 million by 2020.Given the improvement in investment income as well as premiums, the company has displayed top-line growth and we anticipate this momentum to continue in the near term. The company remains focused on strengthening casualty and professional lines in the insurance segment, motor and reinsurance in particular.Over the past five years, AXIS Capital has returned to shareholders in excess of 100% of aggregate operating income through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, the 2.6% hike in dividend in the first quarter of 2018 marked the 13th straight dividend increase. We hope that a sustained operational efficiency will allow the company to engage in shareholder-friendly moves in the future, thereby raising optimism among investors. Going forward, the company intends to pay back at least 200% of its six months operating earnings to investors.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $4.52, representing a year-over-year surge of 243.5%.  For 2019, the consensus estimate for earnings per share stands at $5, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.5%.AXIS Capital has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 8.5%.An Outperformer: Shares of AXIS Capital have rallied 15% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 1.1% decrease. We believe, the company’s sustained operational performance, strategic initiatives, premium growth and a solid capital position will drive the stock higher in the near term.  Positive Earnings Surprise History: AXIS Capital displays an encouraging earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5.11%.Attractive Valuation: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio — the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next — shares are undervalued at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.07, falling below the industry average of 1.41.Near-Term HeadwindsBeing a P&C insurer, the company has been suffering catastrophe loss for a considerable period of time, thereby hampering the company’s underwriting profitability with the combined ratio having deteriorated in the last few years.Also, escalating expenses, mainly due to higher net losses and loss expenses, general and administrative expenses as well as higher acquisition costs persist to limit the operating margin expansion. Moreover, the company does not expect a turnaround on this front anytime soon.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report), The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) and RLI Corp. (RLI  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

175,PGR,"The U.S. stock markets have been reeling from severe volatility since February owing primarily to inflationary concerns. Investors remain apprehensive as inflationary tendencies are evident in multiple areas of economy. Market’s expectations of a higher inflation have been fanned by massive tax cut, strong fundamentals of the U.S. economy, robust labor market, higher consumer spending and geopolitical conflicts.Notably, the markets are concerned that higher inflationary expectations will lead to the central bank raising the interest rate aggressively to stabilize the economy. However, a hike in interest rate will raise cost of funds which in turn will enable the financial sector to increase the spread between longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities, thus bolstering the sector’s profits. Consequently, investment in financial stocks with favorable Zacks Rank is a lucrative option at the moment.Strong Retails Sales DataOn May 11, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% for the month of April, at par with the consensus estimate. Retail sales are up for two straight months and also rose 4.7% year over year. Notably, nine out of a total of 13 industries witnessed an increase in sales in April. Investors fear that higher consumer spending may generate inflationary pressure prompting the central bank to pursue aggressive interest rate policy to cooldown the economy.Geopolitical ConflictsOn May 17, the July Brent Crude (LCON8) touched $80.50, its highest level since November 2014. This was fueled by the concerns regarding the United States re-imposition of sections on Iran which will limit the oil production of Iran and elevate the oil prices. Although the higher oil prices may spur capital spending by oil producers, it is likely to take a toll on consumers. However, elevated capital spending may result in higher wage rate.Robust Labor MarketThe unemployment rate declined from 4.1% in March to 3.9% in April, the lowest level in nearly 18 years. This is the first time in six months that the unemployment rate has undergone a decline. Healthy non-farm payrolls data for April along with continuing decline in the weekly jobless claims is a clear indication of the employers’ intentions to continue recruiting. This may result into wage growth generating inflationary tendencies.Our Top PicksStrong earnings, massive tax cuts and solid economic data are likely to boost consumer spending in the coming months driving the price level up. This may prompt the Fed to aggressively implement tight monetary policy. Higher interest rate will eventually aid the banking industry. Non-banking financial institutions, including insurance companies, asset managers and brokerage firms, should also gain.We narrowed down our choice to five banking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and solid growth potential.

Increase in net premiums written in the Specialty Casualty (10%), Specialty Financial (4.9%) and Other (63.6%) on a year-over-year basis resulted in the upside.Underwriting profit of the segment improved 16.5% to $92 million, driven by higher underwriting profitability in Specialty Casualty Group. However, lower underwriting profit in Property and Transportation and Specialty Financial Groups partially offset this upside.The segment’s combined ratio improved 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 91.8% owing to improvement of 410 bps in Specialty Casualty division. However, deterioration of 310 bps and 520 bps in the combined ratio of Property & Transportation and Specialty Financial divisions, respectively, partially offset this uptrend.The Annuity segment’s statutory premiums of $1.2 billion declined 10.9% year over year, attributable to lower premiums in the financial institutions channel that more than offset premium growth in the retail channel.Pre-tax income came in at $125 million, up 30.2% year over year.Financial UpdateAs of Mar 31, 2018, American Financial had cash and investments of $45.9 billion, having dipped 0.2% from $46 billion at 2017 end.As of Mar 31, 2018, long-term debt of $1.3 billion remained flat with 2017-end level.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s book value per share (excluding unrealized gains/losses on fixed maturities) was $54.74, up 2.3% from the level at 2017 end.Core return on equity of 12.7% as of Mar 31, 2018, improved from 12.2% in the prior-year quarter.Dividend UpdateThe company announced a special dividend of $1.50 per share in the first quarter, amounting to about $133 million.

189,PGR,"The rate hike announced in the recently concluded FOMC meeting comes as expected. With the latest raise of one-quarter percentage points at the last held FOMC meeting, the interest rate now stands at 2%. This decision was unanimously favored by all eight members of the regulatory body.In fact, the odds for four hikes this year has increased. Media reports stated that odds for December hike followed by the one likely in September, increased to 58%, up from 50% according to traders. Federal funds rate is now projected at 2.4%, up from March projection of 2.1%.For 2019, interest rate is estimated to be 3.1%, up from 2.9% projected at its May FOMC meeting while the same is expected to reach 3.4% at 2020 end.Major indexes, namely S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average have lost in yesterday’s trading session.Strengthening of the U.S. economy propelled the Federal Reserve’s rate raise from its near zero level. The recent increase marks the seventh hike since the financial crisis.The Fed also provided an optimistic unemployment outlook. Per Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment rate in May was 3.8%, lowest in 18 years.  Fed officials continue to expect the employment rate at 3.6% for 2018, 3.5% for both 2019 and 2020, down from 3.9% for 2018 and 2019, 4% for 2020 and 4.6% over the longer-term, predicted in its March 2018 FOMC meeting. However, 4.5% unemployment rate over the long run still remains so. A spurt in employment shows an average of 0.2 million jobs growth over the last three months.Encouraging economic data instills hopes. The Fed now estimates GDP to gain at 2.8% in 2018, up from the March forecast of 2.7%. Expectations thereafter remain in line with the March projections of 2.4% in 2019, 2% in 2020 and 1.8% over the long term.  However, inflation might remain slightly above the targeted 2% through 2020, though the same will stay at 2% thereafter. Inflation is estimated at 2.1% till 2020.Although an improving rate environment comes as a piece of good news for some, while for others, it descends as bad news. Capital intensive industries worry as cost of capital rises. Meanwhile, banks and insurers remain major beneficiaries of a rising rate environment because of their sensitivity to interest rates.With the progressing rate environment, investment income — an important component of insurers’ top line — is also exhibiting an upward trend. This apart, tax rate overhaul, advancing economy, encouraging employment data and stringent underwriting standards infuse confidence in the stock among investors.Insurance Stocks in FocusAmid an improving macro backdrop, investors always look eagerly to add stocks with strong fundamentals, which are likely to generate better yields.It’s an intimidating task to zero in on underpriced stocks with a high-growth offer.

190,PGR,"The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield is close to topping 3%, a mark it hasn’t reached in four years. Strengthening inflation prospects pushed bond yields higher and prompted the Federal Reserve to step up the pace of monetary tightening from two to three additional rate hikes this year.This calls for investing in banks, insurance and brokerage houses as such institutions will see a ramp up in profits on quicker-than-forecasted rate hikes.Inflation Heats UpSigns of an uptick in inflation are pretty obvious. Oil prices near a three-and-a-half-year high and American companies paying a significant amount for purchasing raw materials indicate an upsurge in inflation that could easily derail economic growth in the near term. Business survey by HIS Markit has shown that cost of raw materials and partly finished goods increased at the fastest pace in nearly five years. Trump’s recent move to impose tariffs on steel and a series of Chinese goods were partly to blame.U.S. consumer prices, in fact, rose 2.4% last month from a year earlier, marking the fastest annual pace in 12 months, per the Labor Department. Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, core prices ticked up 2.1% from year-ago levels. This turned out to be the biggest annual jump for core prices since February 2017.U.S. 10-Year Bond Yield Near 3%Treasuries sold off as higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond’s fixed interest payments. As treasuries came under pressure, the 10-year yield and the 30-year yield moved north. Bond yields always tend to move inverse to prices.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2.4 basis points (bps) to 2.973% on Apr 23, its highest level since January 2014, after hitting an intraday high of 2.996%, per Tradeweb data. The 30-year bond yield advanced 0.5 bps to 3.143%, the highest since Mar 9.Higher Interest Rates a Boon for FinancialsShares of banks, insurance companies, and asset managers and brokerage firms were bolstered by higher interest rates in the form of an uptick in bond yields. Fed officials have rekindled the idea to raise federal funds rate four times this year and not three times that they have previously indicated. On Apr 20, the Fed-fund futures market witnessed a 40.2% chance of four rate hikes this year, much higher than a 28.6% chance on Mar 23.Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. The spread between long-term and short-term rates also expands during interest rate hikes because long-term rates tend to rise faster than short-term rates.Rising rates also act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more, expanding their profit margins. Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should gain from a raised rate.Brokerage firms and asset managers also advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since higher rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.5 Solid PicksWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned areas poised to gain on the rate hike prospects. These stocks boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B.

193,PGR,"On Jun 13, Fed Chairman Jerome raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point following the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) latest policy meeting. Notably, this was the second rate hike this year. Further, the central bank has raised the economic outlook for 2018 and provided robust estimates of several key economic metrics.At present, the U.S. economy is on strong footing. A set of stimulative policies led by the massive tax cuts in December 2017, a robust labor market operating near full employment and accommodative financial conditions have improved consumer and business confidence. Consequently, the blooming economic picture persuaded the central bank to raise the benchmark lending rate from 1.75% to 2%.At this stage, it will be a prudent move to invest in stocks exhibiting strong earnings momentum and carrying a favorable Zacks Rank.Fed Raises GDP EstimatesThe Fed raised forecast for 2018 GDP growth from 2.7% in March to 2.8%. However, GDP estimate for 2019 and 2020 remain unchanged at 2.4% and 2%, respectively.The primary catalyst behind these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%. Moreover, repatriation of income will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Robust Labor MarketOn Jun 1, the Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May, exceeding the consensus estimate of 190,000. The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, its lowest in 18 years. The decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened.The Fed’s latest projection for the labor market has added a little extra sweetness to the economic scenario. The central bank has reduced its 2018 unemployment rate estimate to 3.6% from 3.8% in March. Unemployment rate is likely to remain stable at 3.5% in 2019 and 2020 better than the central bank’s March projection of 3.6% for both years. This indicates that the U.S. labor market will maintain near full employment levels over 2018-2020.Inflation Under ControlThe Fed has increased its 2018 PCE (personal consumption expenditure) inflation projection from 1.9% in March to 2.1%. However, the core PCE inflation (excluding food and energy) --the key inflation measurement tool and the central bank’s preferred inflation barometer – was up slightly to 2% from 1.9% in March.Jerome Powell stated that the Fed was comfortable with the return of once-dormant inflation and will not adhere to raising rates in haste as it may result in recession by unnaturally inflating asset valuations. Latest Labor Department data revealed that wages have increased 2.6% year over year in April. However, April’s reading was lower than the previous 12-month period wage growth rate of 2.7%.Our Top PicksSolid macro-economic fundamentals, government’s tax reform and deregulation proposals along with sustained strong earnings performance are major tailwinds for the U.S. economy.

195,PGR,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. It provides an insight into product demand and pricing power. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can easily understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is important to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and disappointing financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but can’t rev up enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is essential to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

196,PGR,"We expect The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations in fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Progressive has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Progressive has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%. A stock’s positive ESP raises confidence about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Progressive Corporation (The) Quote Zacks Rank: Progressive carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-Than-Expected EarningsProgressive’s top line is expected to benefit from improving premiums as well as investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.02 billion, up 17.1%.Solid policies in force across Personal and Commercial Lines likely have driven improved premiums in the quarter.Retention ratio too has possibly remained solid owing to competitive pricing and a diversified product portfolio.However, expenses are anticipated to have increased due to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses plus policy acquisition costs as well as underwriting expenses.California wildfires inducing catastrophe loss is estimated to have weighed on underwriting profitability, deteriorating the combined ratio.With respect to its earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.79%.  Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around are:American Financial Group Inc.

197,PGR,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 139.47%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect catastrophe loss arising from the recent California wildfires to weigh on underwriting results of the company. Such losses also render volatility to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period to be reported is pegged at $1.64, representing a year-over-year slump of 48.8%.With respect to revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $7.1 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 0.3%.Travelers has projected a pre-tax catastrophe loss including estimated recoveries from reinsurance between $525 million and $675 million pre-tax or $340 million and $440 million after-tax. This will weigh on underwriting profitability, leading to deterioration in the company’s combined ratio.Despite gradual improvement in interest rates, the company anticipates a fall in net investment income in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Travelers estimates about $10 million or less of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with that of 2016. Travelers has provided this estimate on the basis of the size of its fixed income portfolio, higher short-term interest rates along with specific securities, scheduled to mature through the end of next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income stands at $562 million, a 10.4% decline on a year-over-year basis.Nonetheless, the company expects to see premium growth, primarily fueled by improving premiums across each business segment as well as successful marketplace strategies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net written premiums is pegged at $6.5 billion, indicating nearly 6.7% rise on a year-over-year basis.A major contributor to the overall premium, Business Insurance segment has likely witnessed higher premiums, primarily fueled by strong production results in select and middle markets. This in turn will help boost the company’s revenues as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Business Insurance revenues is $4.1 billion, representing an increase of 19.6% on a sequential basis.Additionally, the company is estimated to have experienced high retention rates and an increase in new business across its commercial businesses.Further, the company predicts improved profitability in auto business at its Personal Insurance segment owing to implementation of favorable pricing and underwriting actions. Also, the company is on track to achieve a double-digit renewal premium change on a written basis in the fourth quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Travelers is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of -10.69%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.47, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate’s $1.64. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | The Travelers Companies, Inc. Quote Zacks Rank: Travelers sports a Zacks Rank of 1, which although increases the predictive power of ESP. A company, however, needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 24 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

203,PGR,"On May 17, shares of ProAssurance Corporation (PRA  -  Free Report) hit 52-week low of $39.65. The stock seems to have fallen out of favor with investors, following disappointing first-quarter results.Shares of ProAssurance have also underperformed the industry. The stock has lost nearly 24% in a year’s time versus the industry’s rally of 18%The company’s first-quarter 2018 operating earnings per share of 40 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.9%. The bottom line declined 35.5% year over year.  Results suffered from increase in expenses that outweighed premium growth.Factors Weighing On the StockVolatility in Premium Retention:  ProAssurance has been facing volatility in premium retention in its physician business, mainly due to increased competition. Retention rate has been declining from past many years and the first quarter was no exception with the same declining 300 basis points. Continuous reduction in insured client base might weigh on premiums, dragging top-line growth going forward.Deteriorating Investment Portfolio: The sustained soft interest rate environment in the recent past kept the investment income in a lower level for long. Net investment income declined at an average rate of 6.3% over the past six years (2011-17), primarily due to a fall in the fixed income portfolio. Despite the recent interest-rate hikes during 2017, the company witnessed a 5% drop in net investment income.Growing Expenses: ProAssurance has been consistently suffering higher underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses. On an average, these expenses increased at a rate of nearly 8% in the past six years inducing deterioration in the company’s margin. An increase in net loss and loss adjustment expenses as well as underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses induced 5.4% increase in expenses in the first quarter of 2018.Any Respite Going ForwardThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has been revised 6% downward over the past 30 days. For 2019, the same has decreased 9.5%.

205,PGR,"Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 19, 2018 before the market opens.Despite improving credit metrics, the company expects an increase in its allowance for loan losses from the prior-year period due to seasonal trends and catastrophic events. This is expected to impact the fourth-quarter results adversely. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for allowance for loan losses is currently pegged at $5.6 billion, up nearly 30% year over year.Nevertheless, the company’s total interest and fees on loans are expected to increase in the fourth quarter, continuing the previous trend.

206,PGR,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has kicked off with 21 of the elite S&P 500 index members having already reported results. Earnings of these companies grew 34.3% on 71.4% higher revenues per the Earnings Outlook. The Finance sector has kick-started its earnings on Jan 12. Earnings are expected to increase 2.8% on 2.4% higher revenues. This is an improvement from the preceding quarter’s performance as the third quarter was impacted by soft performance from the insurance industry due to a series of hurricanes that was devastating.  A Silver Lining in the CloudHowever, the fourth quarter was not as badly affected as the third quarter. Though the period is estimated to suffer due to California wildfires, the magnitude is softer than that of Hurricane Harvey, which wreaked havoc last August, followed by Irma and Maria as well as the Mexican earthquakes. Per a report released by The California Department of Insurance, insurance claims have crossed $9.4 billion while catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimated that the loss could be about $10.5 billion.Nonetheless, insurers, having already suffered the bruise in the third quarter are likely to have weathered the fourth quarter cat loss too. Nevertheless, underwriting profitability must have suffered due to the Californian wildfires.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in the underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to withstand the loss to some extent.Also, insurers have braved some rate hikes that have remained flat for quite some time due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment.Improving Rate EnvironmentAmid bad news, there are reasons for insurers to cheer. The Fed kept its promise for three rate hikes in 2017. Since December 2016, four rate hikes have been made and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Also, the outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019. Owing to a gradually improving rate environment, investment results have also markedly improved from the historical lows.Tax Reforms    President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. The tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years lowers the corporate tax burden to 20% from 35%. This move is likely act as an impetus, aiding margin expansion. Per the Earnings Outlook, estimates for 2018 and 2019 have started moving north with the expected 2018 earnings growth going up by two points since the law’s enactment.However, due to reduction in tax rates, insurers are writing down deferred tax assets that in turn will adversely impact their risk-based capitalization levels and also reduce net income.Encouraging Economic DataAn improving employment situation, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and a momentum in oil prices point toward a better economic scenario.Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3.9% in 2018 and 2019. GDP is predicted to grow at 2.5% in 2018 and 23.1% in 2019. Inflation rate is estimated at 1.9% in 2018 and 2% in 2019.A reviving housing market is expected to boost insurable exposures and premiums written. Stronger corporate bonds and an improving real estate market might help curtail the credit-related investment loss.Price PerformanceThe insurance industry has scored better than the S&P 500 index since the onset of the fourth quarter, riding on core strength and a favorable macro environment. While the industry has gained 7.1%, the elite index has risen 5.5%. Industry RankThe Insurance industry is further divided into five components and all of them fall within the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) of the the Zacks Industry Rank.Life at #36, Accident & Health at #51, Property and Casualty at #65, Multiline is ranked at #73, Brokerage at #76, all fall in the top slot.Stocks to ConsiderStrategic initiatives to have a diversified portfolio, mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth and expand globally, prudent underwriting, capital influx and an effective capital deployment to enhance shareholders’ value position insurers on a solid base against all odds.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we shortlisted four insurance stocks carrying a bullish Zacks Rank, a solid Growth Score, witnessing upward estimate revisions over the last 30 days and boasting long-term earnings growth of at least 7%.

208,PGR,"The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) recently announced estimated pretax catastrophe loss of about $211 million or $167 million after tax for April 2018.The company expects reinsurance recoveries to reduce the loss to $195 million. These losses pertain to 10 events that occurred in April. About 60% of the catastrophe losses were related to two severe wind and hail events which occurred in Texas and some parts of Southeastern states.Per a recent report from Aon Benfield, five separate storm systems caused severe thunderstorms across the United States during the month of April. Total combined economic losses from these events were estimated at $2.3 billion, with public and private insurers expected to pay at least $1.5 billion in claims.Due to a relatively large property insurance business, Allstate’s business is significantly exposed to catastrophic events. Weather-related losses for the past many years have weighed on the company’s claims and benefits, expenses and cash flow, draining its underwriting profitability.In 2016 and 2017, the company's cat loss increased 51% and 26%, respectively, year over year. The company incurred $361 million of catastrophe in the first quarter of 2018. The company remains focused on reducing losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs, and limiting exposure to riskier geographic markets by raising premiums that would lead to a decline in the number of policies in force. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather incidents.Despite the cat loss incidence, we have confidence in the company’s ability to show strong results in the second quarter. Increasing premiums in property and casualty business, growing net investment income, a low tax rate and a strong balance sheet should act as catalysts to earnings growth.Zacks Rank & Share Price ImpactThe Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Combined ratio improved 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.5% owing to higher net favorable prior-year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss.

Adjusted book value per share was $84.54, up 3.7% year over year. Segment Update    Travelers’ Business Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.9 billion, up 3.6% year over year. A continued strong retention, an improved renewal premium change and a solid new business led to this upside. Combined ratio deteriorated 110 bps year over year to 97.5% due to higher underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss. However, higher net favorable prior-year reserve development partially offset this downside. Segment income of $452 million grew 2.3% on the back of lower segment income before income taxes, which was more than offset by decreased income tax expense. Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums rose 5.5% year over year to $574 million, primarily driven by improved domestic surety premiums, a sustained solid retention plus an increased new business in domestic management liability. Combined ratio improved 470 bps year over year to 74.7% owing to lower underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss along with higher net favorable prior-year reserve development. Segment income improved 19.3% year over year to $173 million, attributable to higher segment income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 7.6% year over year to about $2.3 billion. Combined ratio improved 210 bps year over year to 97.5%, backed by a higher net favorable prior-year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss, partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio. Segment income surged 44.9% to $129 million, attributable to higher segment income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Dividend and Share Repurchase Update The property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned total capital of $598 million to shareholders in the reported quarter. This included a buyback of 2.8 million shares worth $401 million. The company is now left with shares worth $4.2 billion for repurchase under its existing authorization at the end of the first quarter. The company’s board announced a quarterly dividend of 77 cents per share in the quarter under review, marking a 7% increase.

219,PGR,"With a slew of events and weather-related occurrences making waves in the insurance industry, it will be interesting to see how the industry will fare in the fourth and final quarter of 2017. Starting from massive catastrophe loss to a gradual rise in interest rates along with an improving employment scenario and other economic conditions, the insurance industry has seen it all. Amid such changing conditions, the industry still managed to hold its own and we expect it to do the same in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Below we will discuss the various scenarios that have influenced the Property and Casualty Insurance industry in particular to a great extent.Facing the Storm: Catastrophe LossesThe property and casualty insurers faced the biggest brunt of a massive catastrophe loss, having largely impacted the industry and qualifying the year as the costliest in terms of incurring weather-related loss. Notably, per Swiss Re, the total economic losses from natural and man-made disasters in 2017 are projected to be $306 billion.Further adding to the woes without respite, the fourth quarter also witnessed the Northern California wildfires resulting in catastrophe losses, posing a threat to dent the P&C insurers’ underwriting profitability. Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimated preliminary loss for the fourth quarter attributable to natural calamities of about $249 million after tax largely stemming from the Californian wildfires.In view of such losses, the insurers will experience weak underwriting results, disrupting the overall performance. But there is a silver lining in this catastrophe cloud, as the insurers braved price hikes, which remained flat in the past several quarters due to a not so active catastrophe environment. Nevertheless, there are a few insurers with an encouraging track record of weathering such setbacks and emerging winners on the back of their core fundamental strengths.Gradual Improvement in the Interest RatesThe steady increase in interest rates has benefited the insurance industry. The Federal Reserve delivered in its promise to raise the rates thrice in 2017 by announcing the third and the final interest rate hike at its last FOMC meeting held on Dec 13. The interest rate now ranges between 1.25% and 1.50%.  A progressing rate environment has lessened the pressure on the insurers’ investment income, boosting their earnings in process. Moreover, a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive, further supporting carriers to grow. It is important to note here that investment income constitutes a major component of insurer’s top line.Other Factors Influencing the IndustryWith cyber attacks on the rise, the P&C insurance industry has seen improvement in cyber security insurance, which has led to noticeable premium growth. This apart, advancement in technology has enabled insurers to enhance operational efficiency, starting from underwriting and policy administration to claims and risk management.Additionally, there are a few other factors impacting the industry performance during this time period. To that end, low inflation has remained at 1.7%, falling shy of the 2% target, which is considered good for the economy. Moreover, a reviving housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written. Plus, an improving employment scenario and a positive consumer sentiment buoy optimism.Price PerformanceDespite all odds, the industry has scored better than the S&P 500 index in the fourth quarter, riding on core strength. While the industry has gained 6.7%, the elite index has risen 6.4%. Industry RankThe P&C Insurance industry is currently ranked at #92, falling within the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) of the Zacks Industry Rank.Outperformers of Q4Despite adversities spurting concerns for insurers this year, positives like a rising interest rate environment and an improving economy have helped the following stocks perform well in the fourth quarter and yield profits through core strength and business modification.Here is a list of four top-ranked insurers that outperformed the industry in the last quarter. These stocks hold promise to deliver favorable results, banking on operational strength.

225,PGR,"It’s the tail end of 2017 and we are just a few days away from ringing in the New Year. This year has been a mixed bag of sorts for the insurance industry. While economic improvement and consecutive rate hikes triggered some good news, a number of catastrophe events jeopardized the underwriting profitability for insurers.Pinning hopes that the catastrophe environment will remain benign next year, the insurance industry will stand to benefit from the favorable macro backdrop leveraging its core strengths. Also, strategic initiatives to have a diversified portfolio, to expand globally and add capabilities plus mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth position insurers well for a healthy performance.Silver Lining in the CloudA slew of natural calamities inducing cat loss dented the underwriting profitability of insurers this year. Per the data released by Munich Reinsurance company, catastrophe loss in the first half amounted to $41 billion while Swiss Re estimated a catastrophe loss of $95 million in the third quarter. The fourth quarter is likely to suffer, partly due to the California wildfires. Per Swiss Re, the total economic loss from natural and man-made disasters in 2017, are projected at $306 billion.However, due to such a massive loss, insures have braved the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. In order to retain business and survive competition, insurers were earlier jittery about the price rise. But now with higher prices, not only insurers might enjoy higher premiums going forward but be also well-equipped to settle claims with less adverse impact on profitability.   Improving Rate EnvironmentAfter remaining at a near-zero level for about eight years, the Federal Reserve started to gradually raise the interest rate, reflecting the economic strength to gain traction and the US President Donald Trump’s bias for rate hikes.  The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes in 2017 and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Retaining this optimism, the outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated expectations for three rate increases in 2018.Insurers are major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. With the progressing rate environment, investment income is also set to grow. Investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line. Life insurers having suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates will also benefit from higher rates.Economic Data Instills HopeAn improving employment situation, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and a momentum in oil prices are parameters highlighting a better economic scenario. All these together fuel the approval for rate hikes.The economic scenario remains encouraging. While the Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3.9% in 2018, the GDP is predicted to grow at 2.5%, reflecting an increase from 2.1%, projected earlier. Inflation rate is estimated at 1.9% in 2018.A reviving housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written. Stronger corporate bonds and an improving real estate market might help curtail the credit-related investment losses.Also, Trump’s tax reform policy, an overhaul to tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden. The corporate tax rate lowered to 20% from 35% will likely act as an impetus.Price PerformanceDespite all odds, the insurance industry has scored better than the S&P 500 index so far this year, riding on core strength.

226,PGR,"This year has been a big year for the stock market, with many notable indexes soaring to new highs. But 2017 was important for more than just share price performance—it also marked another year where the number of women leading Fortune 500 companies jumped as well.The percentage of women heading Fortune 500 companies hit an all-time high in 2017. As of this summer, when Fortune released its 2017 Fortune 500 list, 32 of the CEOs were women, up from just 21 last year.That number still only accounts for 6.4% of the total, but it proved to be the highest in the history of the list. The number of female-led companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 index is smaller by comparison, with only 26 women—or 5.2%—holding their company’s top position. This figure is based on a list compiled by the nonprofit group Catalyst. The firm also noted that women hold 21% of S&P 500 board seats.Those numbers indicate that there is still plenty of progress to be made, but female CEOs did lead some of the biggest and most well-known companies, in a range of industries, in 2017.This list includes the likes of aerospace and defense power General Dynamics’ (GD  -  Free Report) Phebe Novakovic, as well as industry competitor Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).In the retail sector, Barbara Rentler has helped the discount department store firm Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) stock hit a new all-time high this year, making her one of several women leading their companies to new heights.Let’s take a closer look at more of those leaders:Mary Barra,General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) General Motors’ Chairman and CEO Mary Barra has served as the auto giant’s chief executive since January 2014. Since taking over the role as CEO, Barra has helped push GM towards the future with a focus on connected vehicles and electric car technology. On top of that, Barra began to focus some of GM’s energy on autonomous vehicle technology.Shares of GM are up 21.96% in 2017, and the company rests close to its five-year high, which it reached earlier this year. GM has beat or matched earnings expectations in the trailing 10 quarters and nearly every quarter since Barra became CEO.Tricia Griffith, The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) Tricia Griffith took over as president and chief executive officer of the insurance giant in July 2016. Since taking on the leading role at Progressive, Griffith began to bolster the company’s offerings. Previously, the company only really offered automotive coverage, but now Progressive has entered the $300 billion home insurance market—where they offer customers the chance to bundle home and auto.Griffith helped roll out the company’s HomeQuote Explorer tool. “Normally, homeowner quotes are a nightmare,” Griffith told Fortune. “They take a long time. This is something that we will buy, any publicly available data. You fill in a couple of fields and you get a home quote from four companies. Really easy.”Shares of Progressive are up over 57% on the year, and just hit a new 52-week and all-time high of $56.28 per share on Wednesday.Indra Nooyi,Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report)Indra Nooyi became Pepsico’s President and CEO in October 2006. She was then appointed chairman in May 2007. Nooyi facilitated Pepsico’s merger with Quaker Oats, which brought the beverage giant not only Quaker, but sports drink power Gatorade as well. She also helped lead the acquisitions of Tropicana and Wimm-Bill-Dann—which is the largest international acquisition in company’s history.Pepsico stock is up 13.36% this year, and it just recently hit a new all-time high of $119.74 per share, thanks in large part to Nooyi’s improvements to the company’s business.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

228,PGR,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 net operating income of $1.84 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.5%. Also, the figure skyrocketed 300% from the year-ago period. Lower reportable catastrophe loss and the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses in Global Housing, drove this improvement.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. Quote The company remains optimistic on building a strong foundation in 2018 with the closing of its buyout of The Warranty Group and leveraging the company’s expanded scale and experience in key Housing and Lifestyle markets in order to achieve sustainable long-term, profitable growth.Total revenues declined 2.8% year over year to $1.7 billion, mainly due to lower premiums earned, fees and other income plus net investment income. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%.Net investment income deteriorated 12.2% year over year to $118.6 million.Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased 10.6% to $1.5 billion, mainly owing to a substantial decline in policyholder benefits as well as selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses.Full-Year HighlightsFor 2017, Assurant reported net operating income per share of $3.98, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.6% but deteriorating 10.9% year over year.Total revenues of $6.3 billion fell 9.6% year over year.Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model, which supported its multi-year transformation. As of fourth-quarter 2016, Assurant reported through four segments — Global Housing (formerly known as the Assurant Specialty), Global Lifestyle (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions), Global Preneed (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions) and Corporate & Other.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing fell about 1.5% year over year to $562.8 million, primarily due to anticipated lower lender-placed insurance revenue, net of reduced catastrophe premiums. Also, reduced demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions led to this downside. However, growth in multi-family housing and revenues from new lender-placed loans onboarded in 2017, partially offset this downside.The company reported net operating income of $89.6 million, which skyrocketed 729.6% from the year-ago quarter. This stellar performance was mainly attributable to lower reportable catastrophes and the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses compared with the prior-year quarter.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle slipped 1.7% year over year to $913.6 million. This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in this particular segment.Net operating income of $42.8 million increased 23.7% year over year. The upside was driven by higher contributions from Connected Living, fueled by global mobile programs including a $5 million client recoverable and growth from vehicle protection. However, results were partially offset by declines in credit insurance.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 9% year over year to $45.9 million, primarily owing to growth in Canada along with realization of revenues from prior period sales of the Final Need product in the United States.Net operating income plunged 57.8% year over year to $4.6 million, mainly due to a software impairment worth $5 million.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $29.1 million, substantially wider than the year-ago quarter’s net operating loss of $20.3 million. Lower net investment income and a charge related to workforce reductions, worth $4.6 million, were responsible for the deterioration.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $540 million in corporate capital as of Dec 31, 2017. Total assets rose 7.2% to $31.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2017 from $29.7 billion at year-end 2016.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateThe company’s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to $169 million in the fourth quarter. While share buyback totaled $139 million, dividend payout totaled $30 million.The company has $293.4 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization.2018 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe loss) to grow between 10% and 14% from the reported results of $412 million in 2017. The growth in earnings is likely to reflect a lower effective tax rate and considerable rise in underlying segment earnings (while adjusting for $12.5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items). Declines in lender-placed insurance and credit insurance might be offset by a profitable increase in Connected Living and multi-family housing as well as vehicle protection.Notably, with the sanction of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Assurant’s consolidated effective tax rate is anticipated to decrease to 22-23% from 33% with nearly one-third of the savings to be reinvested to support future growth.Assurant projects operating earnings per share (excluding catastrophe loss) to grow in excess of net operating income, representing the benefit of a lower consolidated effective tax rate, moderate growth in underlying earnings as well as capital management.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe loss before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Further, decline in the ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization is anticipated as the housing market continues to improve. However, continued growth in multi-family housing and better performance in mortgage solutions are likely to partially offset this downside. Additional savings from expense management efforts are to be realized toward the end of 2018 and further into 2019. Higher net operating income is expected after reflecting a lower effective tax rate of about 20%. Revenues are projected to be close to 2017 levels as decrease in lender-placed insurance normalization are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection as well as expense efficiencies. The ongoing decline in credit insurance will partially offset this probable upside. Lower effective tax rate with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is anticipated to boost results. Moreover, the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection, globally.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its revenues and earnings, mainly on the back of the company’s alignment with market leaders before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Lower effective tax rate with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is anticipated to boost results.Assurant expects full-year net operating loss to be close to 2017’s loss of $63 million before considering the recently sanctioned tax reform at Corporate & Other. The loss will increase after taking into account an effective tax rate of about 20%.Zacks RankAssurant carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

243,PGR,"Welcome to the eighth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we jump into the business of college basketball to help provide investors deeper insights into the world of big-time NCAA hoops, as the likes of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), ESPN, and others continue to fuel the sport.Big-time programs engulfed in scandal, debate surrounding the one-and-done rule, and the NCAA’s role in enforcing amateurism are likely to remain some of the biggest storylines during the 2017-18 college basketball season, even as the regular season begins to heat up.Still, in an era where blue chip college basketball programs, such as the University of Kentucky, Indiana, and Duke, could be worth upwards of $340 million on the open market, the sport is seemingly more profitable than ever.CBS and Turner  are set to spend billions of dollars on the rights to the roughly one month NCAA March Madness tournament through 2032. On top of that, major sponsors of one of the biggest U.S. sporting events such as Coke , AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) aren’t likely to leave anytime soon. And this just covers the most mainstream portion of the college hoops season.Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) struggling sports media network, ESPN, is deeply invested in college basketball. The nearly five-month regular season is fueled by marquee games presented by the likes of Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) and sponsor-laden in-season tournaments tied to Progressive (PGR  -  Free Report), Gildan (GIL  -  Free Report), 2K TTWO, and many more. Even social media powerhouse Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) bought the rights to live stream college basketball this season.Lastly, as many college basketball fans and investors already know, Nike, Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour UAA might be the real lifeblood of NCAA hoops.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

246,PGR,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 net operating loss of $1.40 per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.79. Also, the net operating loss in the reported quarter compared unfavorably with the net operating income of $1.00 in the year-ago quarter. Significantly higher catastrophe losses resulted in such a weak earnings performance.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. QuoteNonetheless, the company remains focused on delivering its full-year 2017 financial objectives. Also, the company anticipates its buyout of The Warranty Group to boost its opportunities to scale and enhance lifestyle offerings in 2018, while experiencing more predictable and diversified earnings as well as cash flow in the long term.Total revenues fell 7.9% year over year to $1.6 billion, mainly due to lower premiums earned. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.Net investment income improved 6.3% year over year to $132.6 million.Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 5% to $1.7 billion, mainly due to a significant increase in policyholder benefits.Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model, which supported its multi-year transformation. As of fourth-quarter 2016, Assurant reported through four segments — Global Housing (formerly known as the Assurant Specialty), Global Lifestyle (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions), Global Preneed (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions) and Corporate & Other.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing fell about 8.4% year over year to $530.3 million, primarily due to anticipated lower placements rates in lender-placed insurance as well as catastrophe premiums. Also, reduced demand for originations and field services, together with the decrease in client volumes in mortgage solutions led to this downside. However, revenue growth in multi-family housing partially offset this downside.The company reported net operating loss of $110.3 million, which compared unfavorably with the net operating income of $44.5 million in the year-ago quarter. This dismal performance was mainly attributable to the $186.8 million of catastrophe losses arising from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the Mexico City earthquake.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle declined 9.3% year over year to $841.7 million. This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in Connected Living, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.Net operating income of $42.6 million surged 50.5% year over year. The upside was driven by a tax benefit of $9.6 million along with growth in mobile and additional real estate joint venture partnership income.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 3.2% year over year to $44.6 million, primarily owing to growth in the United States and Canada, especially in Final Need.Net operating income declined 14.6% year over year to $12.3 million due to lower real estate joint venture investment income.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $13 million, substantially narrower than the year-ago quarter net operating loss of $17.4 million. Lower taxes and reduced corporate expenses in the reported quarter, drove this improvement.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $570 million in corporate capital as of Sep 30, 2017. Total assets rose 9.1% to $32.4 billion as of Sep 30, 2017, from $29.7 billion at year-end 2016.Share Repurchase and Dividends UpdateThe company’s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to $63 million in the third quarter. While share buyback totaled $34 million, dividend payout totaled $29 million.The company anticipates to complete its return of $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company has $408 million remaining in the current repurchase authorization.2017 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe losses) to increase on a moderate basis compared with the 2016 level. This is primarily on the back of anticipated profitable growth in fee-based, capital-light offerings (comprising Connected Living, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions) and lower net operating loss at Corporate. However, declines in lender-placed insurance and other legacy businesses are likely to limit this uptrend.Assurant projects operating earnings per share (excluding catastrophe losses) to grow in double-digits from 2016 owing to share buyback activity.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net earned premiums and net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses. Further decline in the ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization, which represents lower placement rates for the second half of 2017, along with reduced contributions from mortgage solutions are anticipated to reduce the above-mentioned metric. However, expense savings and profitable growth in multi-family housing are likely to partially offset this downside.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase owing to an improved performance in Connected Living, fueled by growth in new and existing mobile programs as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies. The decline in credit insurance and legacy North American retail clients is likely to continue. The company anticipates revenues to fall, primarily due to a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, the company estimates net earned premiums to decrease by about $500 million from 2016 due to reduction in expenses. This apart, the company might witness a rise in net earned premiums and fee income owing to growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection globally. However, results are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its fee income and earnings, mainly on the back of the company’s alignment with market leaders and operational efficiencies.Assurant expects full-year net operating loss to range between $55 million and $60 million at Corporate & Other compared with $71 million in 2016, thanks to lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced corporate expenditures.Zacks RankCurrently, Assurant carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong other firms from the insurance industry that have reported third-quarter earnings so far, the bottom line of The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report), The Travelers Companies, Inc.

For 2018, the company remains focused on growth and execution of strategy along with increasing shareholder value.Including after-tax realized investment gains of 3 cents, unclaimed death benefits reserve increase of 11 cents and net tax benefit from enactment of the U.S. tax reform bill, net income improved 11.2% year over year to $1.19 per share.Total operating revenues of Unum Group were $2.8 billion, up 2.2% year over year.

In local currency, the figure declined 7.1% year over year to £22.4 million.Benefit ratio was 75.8%, up 820 basis points (bps) due to higher claim incidence in the group long-term disability product line and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits. Also, lower discount rate implemented in the first quarter of 2017 across several products of the company added to this downside.Colonial Life: Premium income increased 6% year over year to $382.1 million on sales growth in recent quarters. Adjusted operating income decreased 16.5% to $66.7 million.Benefit ratio deteriorated 340 bps year over year to 54.8%.Closed Block: Premium income reduced 4.6% from the year-ago quarter. This decline stemmed from expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business. Nonetheless, improvement in premium income for the long-term care line of business owing to premium rate increases on certain in-force policies, limited the downside.Adjusted operating income was $33.1 million, falling nearly 4.3% year over year.Corporate: The segment incurred an operating loss of $33.2 million, narrower than the operating loss of $41.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This was mainly driven by reduced operating expenses and higher investment income.Capital ManagementAs of Dec 31, 2017, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 390%.

248,PGR,"The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) and its units’ ratings were reiterated by Moody’s Investors Service. The rating agency has affirmed Progressive’s A2 senior unsecured debt rating and the Aa2 insurance financial strength (IFS) ratings for the company’s main property-casualty insurance operating units. The outlook of such ratings remained stable.Ratings Representation of Progressive and its UnitsThe ratings affirmation of Progressive and its primary operating insurance units represents the group’s strong foothold in the US auto insurance market, excellent underwriting and expense management, balanced distribution channels and a robust capital position. Additionally, Progressive boasts a decent risk-adjusted capitalization, having a superior quality, liquid investment portfolio and short-tail, granular insurance liabilities.However, Progressive’s moderately high operating leverage and its dynamic payments to shareholders via variable and special dividends plus share buybacks can partially offset the aforementioned strengths.Factors Resulting in Ratings Upgrade/DowngradeContinued lower operating leverage and consolidated financial leverage below 20% are a few factors that could lead to an upgrade of Progressive’s ratings.On the other hand, factors that might induce Progressive’s ratings downgrade include weakened core profitability, consolidated financial leverage above 30% and a substantial increase in gross or net catastrophe exposure as compared to the shareholders’ equity.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence plus maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help Progressive retain investors’ trust and write more businesses going forward.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementProgressive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Progressive have surged 44.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s increase of 11.3%. We expect top-line growth, higher premiums and a robust capital position to drive the shares higher in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Radian Group Inc.

268,PGR,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterArthur J. Gallagher is likely to witness a noticeable rise in expenses, primarily due to higher compensation and operating expenses. This increase in expenses can restrict operating margin expansion, thereby hurting the company’s overall performance.Also, with the insurance broker’s slew of strategic buyouts, the company has incurred one cent per share as integration costs in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, Arthur J. Gallagher is likely to report bottom-line growth in the fourth quarter, mainly owing to a strong performance by its Brokerage and Risk Management businesses as well as higher revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings is pegged at 75 cents per share, representing a rally of 13.6% from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, the company anticipates improved organic growth at its Brokerage segment in the period. To top it all, the company expects an impact from forex with a tailwind of about $10 million to its brokerage segment revenues in the fourth quarter.Employee benefit consulting operations are estimated to have registered organic growth on new business opportunities.Top-line growth has likely been fueled by organic sales as well as strategic mergers and acquisitions. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter of 2017 is $1.5 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% from the prior-year quarter.    Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Arthur J. Gallagher is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Arthur J. Gallagher has an Earnings ESP of -1.01%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Price and EPS Surprise  Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Price and EPS Surprise | Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Quote Zacks Rank: Arthur J. Gallagher holds a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 24.

This marked its biggest percentage gain since Apr 24. All of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors ended in the green, led by financials. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) advanced 1.7%.The financial sector gained from bullish sentiments following weaker than expected impact of Hurricane Irma. The hurricane was initially categorized as a Category 5 hurricane but lost strength after hitting the coast of Florida over the weekend. It has since been degraded to a tropical storm as the impact has been significantly lesser than what had originally been expected by the National Hurricane Centre.Biggest contributors to such gains were stocks of leading insurers.. Shares of Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report), American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), XL Group (XL  -  Free Report) and Everest Re Group (RE  -  Free Report) increased 2.3%, 2.2%, 1.7%, 5% and 4.3% respectively.

In the event of North Korea not going ahead with the test, geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington were eased and markets were back to normal.Meanwhile, the United States urged the Security Council of the United Nations to impose fresh sanctions on North Korea. The Trump administration wants the United Nations to impose an oil embargo on Pyongyang. This gave rise to fresh tensions as North Korea reacted by saying that the U.S. would eventually pay a ‘due price’ for backing the imposition of sanctions on the Asian country.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

276,PGR,"On Thursday, Hurricane Irma continued its path of destruction through the Caribbean after hitting Barbuda, St. Barthélemy, St. Martin, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico yesterday.Many industries have felt the impact of Irma already, and the storm has yet to make landfall here in the United States.According to the National Weather Service, the storm is projected to hit the central Bahamas by Friday, and then make landfall near Miami, Florida by Sunday morning as a Category 4 hurricane, “bringing high winds, abundant rainfall and potentially dangerous storm surge.”From the greater travel industry to airlines and restaurants, companies that have broad exposure to Florida have seen their shares slide on anticipation of Irma’s impending arrival. For more information, read:Hurricane Irma Hammers Travel StocksAs Hurricane Irma Gets Stronger, Restaurant Stocks Get WeakerHurricane Irma Hits Airline StocksIrma, as well as the aftermath of Harvey, has also taken a toll on the insurance market, and this past Tuesday marked one of the worst days of 2017 for insurance stocks. Today is no better, and the S&P 500 Insurance Industry Index (IUX) is down over 2% in afternoon trading, on pace for what could be its worst daily performance since Brexit lows back in June 2016. The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE  -  Free Report) is down nearly 2.5%.Like other industries, insurance companies with a huge presence in Florida are being hit the hardest. HCI Group (HCI  -  Free Report), known for its largest subsidiary Homeowners Choice Property & Casualty Insurance Company, is down over 10% in afternoon trading. Headquartered in Jacksonville, HCI provides property and casualty homeowners insurance, condominium-owners' insurance and tenants insurance.Another big name is Universal Insurance , which is currently down 14.75%. Universal is based in Fort Lauderdale, and through its subsidiary Universal Property & Casualty Insurance Company (UPCIC), is engaged in insurance underwriting, distribution and claims.Heritage Insurance Holdings (HRTG  -  Free Report) and United Insurance Holdings (UIHC  -  Free Report) are two other Florida-focused insurance players that have seen their stocks fall over the past few days. Headquartered in Clearwater and St. Petersburg, HRTG and UIHC are currently down over 5% and nearly 9% in afternoon trading.Other insurance stocks affected include Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), Alleghany Corp. (Y  -  Free Report), Chubb Ltd. (CB  -  Free Report), Cincinnati Financial (CINF), Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report), and Travelers Companies (TRV  -  Free Report), all of which have seen their stocks move downwards today.Companies who offer reinsurance, or when multiple companies purchase insurance policies from other insurers to limit the total loss the original insurer would experience in case of a disaster, are also at risk. Everest Re (RE  -  Free Report) and RenaissanceRe (RNR  -  Free Report), for example, are down 6.76% and 3.6% today.Experts are already predicting that Irma could be the biggest ever in insured damage in the U.S., even surpassing the record held by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. According to Barclays’ Jay Gelb, ""In a worst-case scenario, catastrophe modelers AIR Worldwide and Karen Clark and Co. have estimated a repeat of the 1926 Miami hurricane could result in $125-130 billion of insured damage.”One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

281,PGR,"Residents of southeastern Texas are bracing for the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which continues to wreak havoc on America’s fourth-largest city with heavy rainfall. The record-flood situation is likely to turn worse as the deluge is expected to continue for some days, as per Bloomberg. It is predicted to become the first storm of Category 3 or higher to hit Texas in the last 12 years.Needless to say, a catastrophe of this level is most likely to mess up citizens’ lives. With them, several effects on corporate life are likely to be noted.Energy As per Reuters, Harvey has thumped a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and over 10% of U.S. refining capacity. The area is a major hub for oil refineries. Several energy companies have shut down their operations. The last major storm that lashed this region in 2008 was Hurricane Ike, which cost the refining industry roughly $30 billion.This sparked off concerns about oversupply situation in the U.S. Lower demand from refineries is likely to pressure crude oil prices and ETFs like United States Oil Fund LP (USO  -  Free Report). Oil exploration ETF like The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report) this may lose ahead due to lack of activity.However, demand for finished product gasoline should rise. Gasoline futures on Monday jumped to a two-year high level, which should benefit United States Gasoline Fund (UGA  -  Free Report).  The difference in the price of crude oil for October delivery and Nymex gasoline futures for September — the ""crack spread"" — doubled to about $24 on Friday, as per an article published on CNBC. This should benefit VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK  -  Free Report) (read: 4 Sector ETFs Winning on Revenue Growth).Insurance Severe destruction is likely after Harvey’s passage as flooding in Texas may be identical to that of 2005's Hurricane Katrina -- “the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, said an insurance research group.” Insurance stocks normally fall over 1% in the month following the disaster caused by a Category 3 storm and severe flooding.John Dickson, president of NFS Edge Insurance Agency, estimates about 15% of the Houston area to be insured for flood. As a result, property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Insurance companies like Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report), The Allstate Corporation ALL, Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp. PGR are likely to be hurt. The insurance ETF iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Fund (IAK  -  Free Report) will feel the brunt (see all Financials ETFs here).Agriculture As per Bloomberg,the rain is washing away the largest U.S. cotton producer, drenching extra supplies stored on fields by many Texas farmers. Ports like Galveston will remain closed till Harvey dies out.The Bloomberg article went on to point out that ports at the Texas Gulf make up about 24% of U.S. wheat exports, 3% of corn shipments and 2% of soybeans. Naturally, this pseudo supply crisis will likely push up crop prices, benefiting ETFs like iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN, Teucrium Wheat Fund (WEAT  -  Free Report), Teucrium Corn ETF (CORN  -  Free Report) and Teucrium Soybean ETF (SOYB  -  Free Report). In fact, in such a heavy downpour, livestock is also at risk, which may push up iPath Pure Beta Livestock ETN LSTK (read: Should You Ride the Momentum in Grain ETFs?).Transportation Rail transportation near Houston has been delayed and massive gridlock on highways is expected. As many as 1,847 flights were canceled on Sunday at airports in Houston, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas, and an additional 1,580 were called off for Monday, according to FlightAware and quoted on Bloomberg. Naturally, transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) may feel the pressure ahead (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

This top-line growth was driven by a 40% surge in service revenues, 16% higher fees and other revenues and 17% increase in both premiums and investment income.Total expense increased 19.6% to nearly $2 billion. This rise in expenses can be primarily attributed to 19.8% higher loss and loss adjustment expenses, 16.5% increase in policy acquisition costs and 22% higher other underwriting expenses.In December 2017, policies in force were impressive at the Personal Auto segment, improving 13% from December 2016 to 11.7 million.

283,PGR,"Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.36%.  Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect operating expenses to increase in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, primarily due to the company’s strategic initiatives, which include expansion efforts as well as higher cost of operations plus an increased general and administrative expense. This in turn might restrict the operating margin expansion.Moreover, the company anticipates witnessing lower AIR MILES reward miles redeemed, which in turn will weigh on the AIR MILES revenues in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at 1.6 billion, reflecting a year-over-year plunge of 41.5%.Nonetheless, Alliance Data expects better-than-expected performance at BrandLoyalty, one of the loyalty programs of the company’s LoyaltyOne segment. The company projects BrandLoyalty’s revenues and adjusted EBITDA to increase by double digits year over year in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Further, Card Receivables — accounting for more than 50% of the company’s revenues — will continue to generate higher yields as Alliance Data has been rapidly growing its private label card portfolio with a number of wins from both the new and existing clients. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Card Receivables revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion, improving 12.3%, while EBITDA is estimated at $315 million, up nearly 5.4%. Average receivables are estimated at $17.4 billion, increasing 13.6% year over year.Additionally, the company anticipates experiencing growth in auto, CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and data supporting Epsilon segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Epsilon revenues is expected to rise 4.2% year over year to $625 million.Share buybacks must have lent an additional cushion to the company’s bottom line. The consensus mark for earnings of $5.00 per share represents a 7.1% year-over-year gain.With respect to the top line, the consensus estimate is pegged at $2.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alliance Data is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Alliance Data has an Earnings ESP of -1.06%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $4.95, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate’s $5.00. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Alliance Data Systems Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: Alliance Data holds a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 24. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.American Financial Group, Inc.

284,PGR,"Unum Group’s (UNM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 operating net income of $1.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. The bottom line also improved 11.2% year over year.Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unum Group QuoteStrong performance at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments was partially offset by weakness at Unum U.K. business.The company’s sustained performance is driven by strong top-line growth, overall decent benefits experience and a good expense management. In the reported quarter, the company displayed growth and disciplined execution of strategy. It also efficiently returned capital to its shareholders.Including after-tax realized investment gains of 3 cents, net income improved 10.9% year over year to $1.12 per share.Total operating revenues of Unum Group was $2.8 billion, up 2.1% year over year. Revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Premium income improved, whereas net investment income declined, both on a year-over-year basis.Total benefits and expenses inched up 0.9% year over year to $2.5 billion. Rise in benefits and change in reserves for future benefits, commissions and amortization of deferred acquisition costs led to an overall increase in costs.Quarterly Segment UpdateUnum U.S.: Premium income was $1.4 billion, up 3.5% year over year. Operating income climbed 11.9% year over year to $258.4 million.Unum U.K.: Premium income grew 3.3% year over year to $131.5 million. In local currency, premium rose 3.6% year over year to £100.4 million. This was mainly owing to growth in the in-force block, resulting from prior-period sales and stable persistency.Operating income was $26.5 million, down 6% year over year. In local currency, the figure declined 6% year over year to £20.2 million.Benefit ratio was 74.9%, up 310 basis points (bps). This was owing to higher claim incidence and unfavorable claim resolutions in the group long-term disability product line and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits. Also, lower discount rate implemented in the first quarter of 2017 across several products of the company added to this downside. However, a lower average claim size in the group life product line partially offset the downside.Colonial Life: Premium income increased 6.9% year over year to $378.7 million on sales growth in recent quarters and stable persistency. Operating income grew 3.4% to $81.7 million.Benefit ratio deteriorated 20 bps year over year to 51.8%.Closed Block: Premium income decreased 3.6% from the year-ago quarter. This decline stemmed from expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business. Nonetheless, improvement in premium income for the long-term care line of business owing to premium rate increases on certain in-force policies, limited the downside.Operating income was $26.6 million, falling nearly 7% year over year.Corporate: The segment incurred an operating loss of $36.2 million, narrower than the operating loss of $45.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This was mainly driven by reduced operating expenses and decrease in interest expense owing to a lower level of outstanding debt, partially offset by a higher overall rate of interest.Capital ManagementAs of Sep 30, 2017, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 410%. Unum Group exited the quarter with cash and marketable securities worth $771 million.Book value per share of Unum Group increased 4.4% year over year to $42.11 as of Sep 30, 2017.The company spent around $100 million to buy back about 2 million shares in the quarter.Guidance TweakedUnum Group projects 2017 operating earnings per share to grow between 5% and 8% or slightly above the upper end of the range.Zacks RankUnum Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Earnings also increased 18% from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted margin, adjusted for certain items, increased 170 basis points to 20.3%.Operational UpdateAon’s total revenues grew 6% to $2.3 billion in the third quarter and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. The year-over-year increase in revenues was supported by 2% organic revenue growth and a 3% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures and 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Operating expenses increased 13% year over year to $2.1 billion in the third quarter. The deterioration stemmed primarily from $102 million of restructuring costs, $62 million rise in operating expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, $54 million of accelerated amortization related to trade names, a $16 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, $10 million of transaction related costs associated with recent acquisitions and an increase in expense related to the organic revenue growth. These factors were partially offset by $55 million of savings related to restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives.Organic Revenue DriversCommercial Risk Solutions: Organic revenues decreased 1% year over year due to a decline across the Americas, particularly in U.S. retail and Latin America owing to certain unfavorable timing. This was, however, partially offset by solid growth across the EMEA and Pacific regions.Reinsurance Solutions: Organic revenues increased 7% from the prior-year quarter on the back of solid growth across all the major product lines, especially in treaty placements driven by record new business generation. The improvement was partially offset by a modest unfavorable market impact in the Americas.Retirement Solutions: Organic revenues grew 5% from the prior-year period, driven by continued improvement in investment consulting and growth in Aon’s talent practice for compensation surveys and benchmarking servicesHealth Solutions: Organic revenues rose 2% year over year owing to solid growth globally in health & benefits brokerage, especially in the United States and Latin America.

291,PGR,"Speculations of massive destruction by Hurricane Irma had rattled the insurance industry. The storm's impact on Florida, however, was not as devastating as expected as it has been downgraded to Category 1. Storm surges were also of a lesser magnitude than the National Hurricane Center’s initial projections.As Irma inflicted lesser damage than feared, insurance stocks bounced back and were among the biggest gainers on the bourses. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), in the meanwhile, said that the insurance industry “has strong balance sheet to weather the financial impact” of the storm and has historically performed well after such nerve-wrecking events.Needless to say, the insurance industry is already boosting business operations, implementing new technologies and investing in cybersecurity to drive growth. Thus, investing in sound insurance stocks seems prudent at the moment.Insurance Stocks: The Biggest GainersInsurance stocks had been losing ground for weeks as the hurricanes dampened investors’ sentiments. Rating agency Moody’s cautioned that property and casualty insurers, reinsurers as well as alternative capital providers like the buyers of catastrophe bonds, were all likely to undergo “substantial losses” owing to the hurricanes, particularly Irma. And why not? Irma was expected to be the most powerful hurricane and had already wrecked roads and telecommunications systems in the French Caribbean island territories.The lesser damage has been a blessing in disguise for insurance stocks. Major players like Travelers Companies Inc (TRV  -  Free Report) rallied 2.3% on Sep 11 and was one of the biggest drivers for the Dow Jones. Other significant players, including Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report) and American International Group Inc (AIG  -  Free Report), improved a respective 2.2% and 1.7%.Exchange traded fund that tracks the insurance sector also moved north. The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) and the iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Index ETF (IAK) increased 2.2% and nearly 2%, respectively. In fact, the PowerShares KBW Property & Casualty Insurance Portfolio advanced 3.1%, its highest one-day climb since July 2015. This gain helped the fund close in the positive territory for the year. The biggest gainers from the PowerShares fund were Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited (AHL  -  Free Report), Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR  -  Free Report) and Maiden Holdings, Ltd. (MHLD  -  Free Report), which saw a respective rally of 9.4%, 6.9% and 7.1%.Irma Fears DodgedInsurers breathed a sigh of relief after Irma changed its direction in the eleventh-hour and eased worries about widespread destruction in the Sunshine State. Residents of Florida had fled to safety as the hurricane was anticipated to hit with record-breaking winds of 185 miles an hour. The 400-mile-wide hurricane was devastating enough to affect the entire state (read more: Hurricane Irma Set to Hit Florida: Gainers & Losers).Irma, however, gradually lost strength once it made landfall on the Florida Keys on Sep 10. The eye of the storm missed Miami and lost steam once it crossed the mostly uninhabited Everglades. Following this, Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm. Chief investment officer of Atlantic Trust, David Donabedian said that “it was a relief rally”, while AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling software firm added that expected losses stemming from Irma is between $20 billion and $40 billion, way below their initial forecast of $20-$65 billion.New Technologies & Business Models Bode Well for InsurersMajority of U.S. insurance company CEOs that participated in the KPMG U.S. CEO Outlook 2017 are confident about the prospects of their firms in the next three years. They believe that innovative processes and implementation of new technologies in response to various disruptions will bode well for the industry.The insurance industry is optimizing the use of data analytics and predictive technologies, building data collection capabilities and uplifting the skill of the current workforce. At the same time, many insurance companies are investing in cybersecurity to find new revenue streams and innovate. Matt McCorry, Insurance Advisory Leader, KPMG LLP believes that “as insurers embark on a digital journey, cybersecurity is becoming increasingly more important to secure ongoing operations.”4 Must-Buy Insurance Stocks to Boost Your PortfolioGiven such positive trends, investing in fundamentally solid insurance stocks seems judicious.

292,PGR,"e massive trail of destruction in Houston and Texas Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Harvey has left insurers feeling jittery in the fear of high claim costs. While its too early to estimate the loss incurred due to the calamity, one of JPMorgan analyst’s anticipates potential losses to range anywhere from $10-$20 billion.Harvey, which went from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane, is expected to be among the top 10 financially damaging catastrophes ever to strike the United States.Is There a Silver Lining to the Cloud?On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurer's underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. Notably, insurance industry is highly cyclical in nature, and is characterized by periods of soft and hard pricing phases.Major events like Harvey are required by the industry now to turn the pricing cycle. A benign cat loss environment in the recent years fattened the capital reserves of the insurers resulting in the loosening of underwriting standards as insurers equipped with huge cash did not mind undertaking risky businesses at low prices. This heightened competition and insurers were compelled to lower prices further to attract more business. Eventually, pricing woes crept up, as evident by the continued soft pricing in many insurance business lines.Though the industry suffered a cat loss of $21.6 billion in 2016, it was only a modest increase compared with the 10-year average of $19.1 billion.A recent report by Swiss Re states that global insured losses from disasters plunged to $23 billion in the first half of 2017 from $36 billion in the year-ago period.Lower levels of claims from natural catastrophes and other disasters suppressed demand for insurance against such events, consequently putting pressure on premiums.Further, a report from insurance broker Marsh stated that global insurance rates fell for the 17th consecutive quarter, with property insurance rates down 2.8%.In a recent fact release, the Information Insurance Institute stated that the private insurance industry will easily able to handle losses from Harvey As of Mar 31, 2017, the U.S. property/casualty industry has $709 billion of capital, a cushion that is more than adequate to deal with events like the one mentioned above.Nevertheless, the industry has outperformed the broader market in last two years, evident from a return of 32% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 24%. Insurance Stocks in FocusCompanies such as Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report), and Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report) have a significant presence in the region with market share of nearly 13%, 11% and 9%, respectively. Other companies with presence in Texas are MeLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report), Kemper Corp., Chubb Ltd. among others. However, these companies have considerably lower market share in the region.Shares of both Progressive and Berkshire Hathaway fell by 2.3%, while Allstate and Travellers declined 1.5% and 2.6%, respectively, on Aug 28, the first trading session after Harvey struck on the night of Aug 25.Nevertheless, some of the stocks gained the following trading day on the likelihood of benefiting from raised premiums due to the devastation caused by Harvey.ConclusionIt remains to be seen weather-related losses over the coming months can shrink the massive capital surplus and change the insurance pricing cycle of the industry.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

293,PGR,"Benchmarks turned in a mixed performance on Monday as markets digested the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Energy shares declined after the hurricane disrupted oil refineries in the coastal areas of Texas, rendering them dysfunctional. Meanwhile, the oil prices also declined, weighing further on energy shares. The tropical storm caused widespread destruction of property on the southern coast of U.S., leading to losses for commercial insurers and reinsurers. This led to a decline in shares of insurance companies such as Travelers which weighed heavily on the Dow as the blue-chip index ended in the negative territory. The S&P 500 ended in the positive territory buoyed by gains for healthcare and tech stocks. The healthcare stocks gained because of merger deals. The Nasdaq also finished in the green due to gains in tech and biotech shares.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,808.40, declining 0.1% or 5.27 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1.19 points to close at 2,444.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,283.02, rising 17.37 points or 0.3%. A total of only around 5.13 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.14-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.02-to-1 ratio.Hurricane Harvey Weighs on Energy SharesEnergy shares were impacted after tropical Hurricane Harvey, hit the coast of Texas, rendering oil refineries in the area dysfunctional. Harvey is by far the most powerful hurricane to have hit the southern coast of U.S. in the last 50 years, delivering about 30 inches of rain in Houston and leaving it flooded over the weekend. Conditions could worsen if engineers released water from overflowing reservoirs in order to safeguard the dams.  The coast of Texas houses approximately 30% of the total refining capacity of the U.S. and Houston alone hosts 15% of the total capacity. The shutting down of major oil refineries in and around Houston has impacted almost 15% of the nation’s total refining capacity. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) closed its Baytown refinery and Dutch Shell  shut its Deer Park facility after the storm pummeled Texas. This disruption led to a decline in the energy shares. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) was down 0.5%. Shares of Exxon, Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) declined 0.4%, 0.4% and 3.7% respectively due to shutdown of refining operations.Oil prices also declined on Monday. West Texas Immediate oil futures dipped 2.7% to $46.57 a barrel. Also, United States Oil Fund plummeted 2.3%. Economists said that it would take weeks before the refineries became fully functional and therefore the demand for oil by refineries would be low. This led to a decline in West Texas oil futures. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced on Sunday that a total of 331,370 barrels a day equivalent of crude-oil production was affected after the hurricane’s landfall.Insurance Sector Battered by HarveyInsurance stocks also declined after the destruction caused by Harvey. Current estimates place the estimated damage at around $30 billion and analysts expect it to be one of the costliest storms in the history of the U.S. In case of such natural calamities, insurance shares are sent lower due to high number of claim payouts.As a result, shares of top American insurance companies like Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), Allstate Corp (ALL  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report) all declined 2.5%, 1.4% and 2.2% on Monday.  The SPDR S&P Insurance exchange-traded fund (KIE) dipped almost 1%, posting its worst day since April 28, 2017. Declining shares of Travelers weighed the heaviest on the Dow.Stocks That Made HeadlinesMotorola Solutions Closes Kodiak Buyout, Expands PortfolioMotorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in a bid to broaden its software product portfolio.(Read More)Abercrombie Further Expands Footprint in the Middle EastAmid a highly challenging retail landscape, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) continues to strengthen its footprint, which in turn, boosts its overall performance in second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.

294,PGR,"AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 operating loss of $5.35 per share, slightly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $5.34. Also, the operating loss in the reported quarter compared unfavorably with the operating income of $1.78 in the year-ago quarter. The massive catastrophe losses incurred in the reported quarter were mainly responsible for such a dismal earnings performance.Axis Capital Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Axis Capital Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Axis Capital Holdings Limited QuoteIncluding net realized investment gains of 15 cents, foreign exchange losses of 34 cents, and transaction related expenses of 7 cents, net loss came in at $5.61 per share, which compared unfavorably with the net income of $1.96 per share in the prior-year quarter.Operational UpdateOperating revenues of about $1.1 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $972 million. Revenues increased 4.9% year over year.Gross premiums written improved 23.5% year over year to about $1.2 billion. This improvement was driven by 55% higher premiums written in the Reinsurance segment and 10.2% higher premiums written in the Insurance segment.Net investment income declined 18.6% year over year to $95.2 million, driven by change in fair value of alternative investments.Total expense in the quarter shot up 85.9% year over year to $1.6 billion due to higher net losses and loss expenses, acquisition costs, foreign exchange losses and transaction related expenses.AXIS Capital reported underwriting loss of $512.9 million against the underwriting income of approximately $104 million. Combined ratio deteriorated 6030 basis points (bps) to 152.9%. Catastrophe and weather-related pre-tax net losses were $317 million, largely attributable to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Mexico earthquakes. The figure is significantly wider than the loss of $15 million in the year-ago quarter.Segment ResultsInsurance: Gross premiums written increased 10.2% year over year to $744 million owing to better performing liability lines of business, credit and political risk lines driven by new business as well as an increase in our aviation lines associated with the acquisition of Aviabel. However, a reduction in premiums written after the company’s exit from some U.S. retail insurance operations last year, partially offset the upside.Net premiums earned increased 11.5% year over year to $496 million on premium growth in accident, health and property lines along with the aviation lines of business in recent periods. Also, a decline in ceded premiums earned in the property lines of business added to the upside.Underwriting loss of $282 million, compared unfavorably with the underwriting income of $25.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio deteriorated 6250 bps to 156.9%.Reinsurance: Gross premiums written in the quarter jumped 55% year over year to $441 million, largely on the back of a higher level of premiums in the liability, catastrophe, property and motor lines.Net premiums earned increased 6.4% year over year to $521.1 million on premium growth in the motor line as well as favorable premium adjustments impacting the catastrophe lines. However, a rise in ceded premiums earned in the catastrophe lines partially offset the upside.Underwriting loss of $231.2 million compared unfavorably with the underwriting income of $78.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio improved 5860 bps year over year to 143.7%.Financial UpdateAXIS Capital exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion, up nearly 30% from the 2016-end level.Cash flow from operations was $163 million compared with $203 million in the year-ago quarter.As of Sep 30, 2017, diluted book value per share was $55.33, down 8% year over year.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateDuring the third quarter, the company repurchased 3 million shares.

295,PGR,"The untold damage and misery caused by Hurricane Harvey is not just being felt by the residents of Texas. Markets were also singed by the tropical cyclone on Monday, with energy and financials bearing the brunt of the pain. Stocks of energy companies suffered after key refineries in Texas had to close due to widespread flooding. But losses for insurers were possibly the most alarming, with the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF losing 1%.This was possibly a reaction to the enormous level of claims likely to be generated in the aftermath of this disaster. However, industry watchers think that the industry has the ability to absorb resulting losses and may even gain in the months ahead via higher rates. Adding select property and casualty insurers to your portfolio makes for a prudent option at this point.Insurers Possess Sufficient Capital Market watchers believe that insurers and reinsurers possess sufficient capital reserves to withstand the losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey. The damage generated by this Category 4 storm is yet to be correctly estimated. However, it is the fiercest hurricane to impact Texas since 2008. Even now, continuous rainfall is flooding the affected areas of the state. Current projections are that the hurricane may cost the U.S. nearly $30 billion.However, insurers serving individuals and businesses currently sport appreciably high levels of capital. Additionally, they do not require such funds to back existing obligations. Given such a state of affairs, Hurricane Harvey is unlikely to dent insurers’ financial position. At most, insurers with business concentrated in the storm-affected areas would experience a fall in quarterly earnings.Gains Likely in Months AheadIn 2005, insurers had suffered losses in the immediate fallout of Hurricane Katrina. Yet, over the next three months, industry heavyweights such as Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report), The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) and The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) notched up heavy gains. While Progressive and Allstate shares increased 20% and 10%, respectively, shares of Chubb skyrocketed over this period, gaining 27%.A similar scenario is likely to develop this time around as well. First, analysts think that the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program will have to bear the lion’s share of losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey. Second, insurers will once again be able to raise rates in the aftermath of a storm of such ferocity. Reinsurers will also likely benefit since over the medium term they will gain the ability to increase their insurance rates. In the aftermath of Katrina, the likes of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC  -  Free Report), which is an insurance broker, notched up gains in keeping with insurers.Our ChoicesDespite initial losses, insurers should withstand the impact of Hurricane Harvey without much difficulty. Appreciably high capital reserves provide them sufficient cushion for such an eventuality.Further, they could actually move higher in the months ahead as they begin to raise rates. Investing in property and casualty insurers looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in.

303,PGR,"Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 core earnings of $0.9 billion (C$1.2 billion), up 50% year over year. This improvement was largely driven by an increase in wealth and asset management businesses, core investment gains, in-force and new business growth in Asia and lower equity hedging costs.Manulife Financial Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Manulife Financial Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Manulife Financial Corp QuotePremiums and deposits were $30.6 million (C$41.2 million), up about 12% year over year.New business value in the quarter was $257.2 million (C$346 million), up 22.5% year over year. Strong growth, solid annualized premium equivalent (APE) sales and management actions to improve margins in Asia fueled this upside. However, a change in business mix in Hong Kong partially offset the same.During the quarter, Manulife’s total insurance sales were $1.0 billion (C$1.4 billion), up 42.9% year over year. This is because sales in Asia increased 11%, Canadian sales skyrocketed 266.1% and the U.S. life insurance sales surged 26%, all on a year-over-year basis.Manulife Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirements ratio was 230% as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with 233% as of Mar 31, 2017. This sequential decline may be attributed to the redemption of $500 million of subordinated debt and an increase in required capital from movements in interest rates.As of Jun 30, 2017, Manulife’s financial leverage ratio improved 90 basis points (bps) to 29.2% from Mar 31, 2017, driven by the redemption of $500 million of subordinated debt and higher retained earnings.As of Jun 30, 2017, assets under management were $743.4 billion (C$1000 billion), up 3.5% year over year.Core return on equity, measuring the company’s profitability, expanded 310 bps year over year to 11.5%.Segmental PerformanceAsia division core earnings came in at $405 million, up 18.4% year over year, banking on growth in new business volumes, continued increase of in-force business and a more favorable product mix. However, a small charge related to policyholder experience in second-quarter 2017 compared with a small gain in the prior year, partially offset this upside. Annualized premium equivalents sales climbed 12% year over year to $686 million in the quarter.Manulife’s Canadian division core earnings of $256.5 million (C$345 million) dipped 0.2% year over year. Nonetheless in local currency, core earnings improved 4% year over year, owing to higher fee income in the wealth and asset management businesses from higher average asset levels and improved earnings in the bank. A number of small items partially mitigated the upside.Insurance sales skyrocketed 266.1% year over year to $340.5 million (C$458 million), driven by large-case sales in group benefits business.The U.S. division reported core earnings of $452 million, up 25.2% year over year. This upside was fueled by improved long-term care policyholder experience gains, higher fee income from higher average assets and a favorable adjustment related to the timing of compensation expenses in WAM businesses, plus lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to in-force variable annuity business. Life insurance sales shot up 26% year over year owing to strong growth of international and term sales.Dividend UpdateThe company’s board of directors approved of a dividend of 20.5 cents per share to shareholders of record as of Aug 22, 2017.

314,PGR,"We expect Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations in third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 17.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Progressive has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Progressive has an Earnings ESP of +2.14%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 41 cents per share is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. A stock’s positive ESP indicates confidence about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Progressive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement.Factors Driving the Better-Than-Expected EarningsPremiums having been improving over the last few quarters, are expected to increase in the third quarter owing to solid policies in force across Personal and Commercial Lines.A gradually improving interest rate environment has likely driven investment income higher. These in turn will help top line rise year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $6.8 billion, up 14.1%.Owing to a diversified product portfolio and competitive pricing, retention ratio has possibly remained solid.  An active catastrophe environment has deteriorated loss ratio in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company had already reported 12.6 loss ratio points of catastrophe losses for August due to Hurricane Harvey. Vehicle and Property businesses will be affected the most.With respect to the earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.88%.  The company’s share price has been trending downward over the last few days and is currently trading at $48.67 per share. We wait to see how the stock performs post the earnings release.Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Progressive Corporation (The) QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks worth considering from the same space with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are:Aflac Inc.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PGR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.14% heading into earnings season.Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Progressive Corporation (The) QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

316,PGR,"The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) has successfully catered to the evolving demands and expectations of clients for years, thereby building a robust product and service portfolio over time. This in turn has helped the property and casualty (P&C) insurer become a one-stop insurance destination through the meeting of its customers’ requirements, mainly opting for a combination of home and auto.Progressive has maintained its industry-leading position in product, service and distribution innovation, particularly personal auto. The company’s net premiums written have been steadily improving over a considerable period of time. We expect Progressive to continue benefiting from the competitive rates in all its markets and diversified multi-product offerings. This will further assist the company to experience improved premiums in the future.Additionally, Progressive remains focused on boosting customer retention. It anticipates a higher Policy Life Expectancy (PLE) — a measure for customer retention —– in the near term on the back of competitive pricing. Also, the company is estimated to record a higher PLE in the short term, banking on competitive pricing and continued new offerings.The company’s inorganic growth carries on to impress with strategic buyouts, which will aid the P&C insurer in boosting overall results, thus accelerating growth on the whole.The company remains committed toward enhancing shareholder value through dividends and share buybacks. This lowers share count and improves the bottom line.However, exposure to catastrophe losses will continue to hurt the company’s underwriting results. With the recent occurrences of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the company expects its underwriting results to take a hit in the immediate term. As a result, the company worries over witnessing deterioration in the overall performance.Some Stocks that Warrant a LookSome stocks from the insurance industry that warrant a look are look at CNO Financial Group, Inc. (CNO  -  Free Report), Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) and Mercury General Corporation (MCY  -  Free Report).CNO Financial develops, markets and administers health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance products for senior and middle-income markets in the United States.

The year-over-year increase in revenues was supported by 3% organic revenue growth and a 3% increase related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Operating expenses increased 31% year over year to $2.5 billion in the second quarter. The rise was primarily due to $380 million non-cash impairment charge to the associated indefinite lived trade names related to the sale of the Benefits Administration and HR Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) platform. In addition, higher restructuring costs, acquisition related expenses, regulatory costs and depreciation & amortization also led to this deterioration.

The improvement was partially offset by a modest unfavorable market impact globally.Retirement Solutions: Organic revenues grew 1% from the prior-year period, driven by continued growth in investment consulting, primarily for delegated investment management. This was partially offset by a decline in  talent practice.Health Solutions: Organic revenues rose 5% year over year owing to solid growth globally in health & benefits brokerage, highlighted by strong growth in the U.S., Asia, and EMEA.Data & Analytic Services: Organic revenues climbed 4% from the prior-year period driven by strong growth across Affinity, with strength particularly in the U.S.Aon PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aon PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aon PLC QuoteFinancial PositionCash flow from operations for the first six months of 2017 decreased 22%, to $436 million compared to the prior-year period.

332,PGR,"Assurant, Inc.’s (AIZ  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 net operating income of $1.63 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. Also, the bottom line improved 14.8% from $1.42 per share earned in the year-ago quarter.Lower Corporate and other expenses resulted in the improvement. However, lower contributions from Global Lifestyle, driven by an absence of $18 million one-time tax benefit in the year-ago quarter, partially offset this upside. Notably, the company did not incur any reportable catastrophe loss in the second quarter, in comparison to $16 million of the same in the prior-year quarter.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. QuoteTotal revenue fell 5.2% year over year to $1.56 billion due to lower premiums earned as well as a decline in fees and other income. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 billion by 2.4%.Net investment income improved 1.6% year over year to $121.7 million.Total benefits, losses and expenses declined about 9% to $1.4 billion, mainly due to a significant decline in selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses plus interest expenses.Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model which supported its multi-year transformation. As of fourth-quarter 2016, Assurant reported through four segments – Global Housing (formerly known as the Assurant Specialty), Global Lifestyle (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions), Global Preneed (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions) and Corporate & Other.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing fell about 2% year over year to $550.2 million, primarily due to anticipated lower placements rates in lender-placed insurance as well as reduced demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions. However, growth in multi-family housing as well as new client revenues in lender-placed insurance partially offset this downside.Net operating income dipped about 1.2% year over year to $56.2 million. The ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and higher non-catastrophe losses led to the downside.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle declined 8.6% year over year to $836.0 million. This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in Connected Living, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.Net operating income of $40.2 million plunged 19.8% year over year. The downside was driven by a one-time tax benefit of $18 million in the prior-year quarter.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 6.9% year over year to $46.3 million, primarily due to expanded volumes in Canada.Net operating income climbed 13.3% year over year to $12.8 million, mainly driven by higher fees and investment income. Higher expenses partially offset this upside.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $10.6 million, substantially narrower than the year-ago quarter net operating loss of $19.4 million. Lower taxes and fees associated with Assurant Employee Benefits (sold in Mar 2016) as well as reduced corporate expenses in the reported quarter, drove the improvement.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $625 million in corporate capital as of Jun 30, 2017. Total assets inched up 1.2% to $30.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, from $29.7 billion at year-end 2016.Share Repurchase and Dividends UpdateThe company’s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to $142 million in the second quarter. While share buyback totaled $112 million, dividend payout totaled $30 million.The company spent about $25 million to repurchase an additional 0.2 million shares from Jul 1 through Jul 28, 2017. It now has $442 million remaining in the current repurchase authorization.2017 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe losses) to remain flat with the 2016 level. This is primarily due to the anticipated profitable growth in fee-based, capital-light offerings (comprising Connected Living, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions) and lower net operating loss at Corporate. However, declines in lender-placed insurance and other legacy businesses are likely to limit this uptrend.Assurant projects operating earnings per diluted share (excluding catastrophe losses) to grow in double-digits from 2016 owing to share buyback activity.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net earned premiums and net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses. The ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and reduced contributions from mortgage solutions are anticipated to decrease the above-mentioned metric. However, expense savings and profitable growth in multi-family housing is likely to partially offset this downside.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase due to an improved performance in Connected Living, fueled by mobile as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies. The decline in credit insurance and legacy North American retail clients is likely to continue. The company anticipates revenues to fall, primarily owing to a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, the company estimates net earned premiums to decrease by about $500 million from 2016 due to reduction in expenses. This apart, the company might witness a rise in net earned premiums and fee income owing to growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection globally. However, results are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its fee income and earnings, mainly due to sales growth across North America due to the company’s alignment with market leaders and operational efficiencies.Assurant expects a full-year net operating loss of about $60 million at Corporate & Other compared with $71 million in 2016, mainly due to lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced corporate expenditures.Zacks RankCurrently, Assurant carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong other players from the insurance industry that have reported their second-quarter earnings so far, The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) as well as The Travelers Companies, Inc’s.

343,PGR,"The curtain has already been raised for the second quarter earnings season with banks started reporting their quarterly results. The insurance industry is all set to announce its results shortly.  Underwriting results, the major indicator of profitability of any insurer, is likely to be affected. This is due to 16 severe wind and hail catastrophe events which occurred in April and May. The catastrophe losses not only have deteriorated the combined ratio but have also been a drag on the bottom line.The insurance industry has been building its capital reserve, courtesy a benign catastrophe environment. We expect some prudent underwriting standards to guard the insurers from erosion of the same.The interest rate environment has been slowly improving with Fed (Federal Reserve) raising interest rate thrice in three consecutive quarters. This reflects Fed’s confidence in the improving U.S. economy. An increased rate positively impacts the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other positives.Though the Property and Casualty Insurance industry is currently ranked at #229 (lies in the bottom one-third of the Zacks Industry Rank for the 252+ industries), it has outperformed the S&P 500 in the last one-year period by registering a gain of 15.64%.

Allstate emerges a clear winner in this round ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple, used for valuing insurers. Compared with Property and Casualty Industry’s P/B ratio of 1.44, Allstate is over-priced with a reading of 1.67. Meanwhile, Chubb is much cheaper with a trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 1.38. This round goes to Chubb as Chubb’s shares are cheaper than Allstate’s.Debt-to-EquityBoth Allstate and Chubb have lower debt-to-equity versus the industry average of 32.14%.

The figure not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents but also grew over three times from the previous quarter’s earnings of 31 cents.

Core losses of $52 million increased 4% from the year-ago quarter due to the favorable impact on second-quarter 2016 insurance operating costs and other expenses of the reversal of a legal accrual.

Last quarter, this company delivered a 1.47% negative earnings surprise. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing this Past QuarterProgressive’s top line is expected to have benefited from improved premiums as well as the investment income in its second quarter.The company’s diversified product portfolio, coupled with a competitive pricing, has probably aided a solid retention ratio.Policies in force across Personal and Commercial Lines are expected to have remained healthy in the quarter to be reported.However, overall expenses are estimated to have increased due to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses, rise in policy acquisition costs and escalating other underwriting expenses.With respect to an earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters, but with an average negative surprise of 4.95%.  The company’s share price has been trending up over the last few days and is currently trading at $45.58. We wait to see how the stock performs, post the earnings release.Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Progressive Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Progressive Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Progressive is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP as well as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Progressive has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Progressive has a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.Importantly, the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the P&C insurance space with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter are:Everest Re Group Ltd.
