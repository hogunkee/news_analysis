1,REG,"Longtime readers of Investor's Business Daily (started in April 1984), IBD Weekly (which launched in May 2016) and Investors.com know that one of the keys to a rewarding breakout is volume, and lots of it.But in the current equities market, how much is really necessary?Try this yardstick. For large and megacap companies, expect volume to rise 40% to 50% above the 50-day average or higher on the breakout day. Did you grab shares in a small or mid-cap leader? If yes, don't act surprised if the share turnover doubles or triples the usual amount.As a stock gushes up in price and hits new highs, hearty volume is the ultimate indicator that mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, corporate finance departments, college endowments and the like are racing to grab as many as shares as possible. Their sustained buying powers a stock's path to new highs and marvelous gains.Yet today's Wall Street is not your grandfather and grandmother's Wall Street.As Regulation FD (""Fair Disclosure"") has created an environment in which many stocks tend to see big moves after, and not before, the reporting of quarterly results, IBD has noticed an increasing number of true market winners that don't see volume really pick up until days or weeks after surpassing the proper buy point in, say, a cup with handle or a flat base, another bullish chart pattern.Reg FD, enacted in August 2000 by the Securities & Exchange Commission, may not be the only reason for this recent phenomenon. Other factors may be in play. A stock may break out late in the afternoon. Turnover may be dull overall in the Nasdaq or on the Big Board. A stock may be moving right before or right after a three-day holiday weekend.Yet in this age of light-speed information, one can understand why even the biggest mutual funds, hedge funds and large advisory firms hesitate to move into a stock with serious size before earnings and fresh outlooks hit the wires.Take Apple (AAPL) as it rallied past a 118.12 buy point within a 12-week cup-with-handle pattern on Jan. 6, 2017. On those two days respectively, volume was flat and 7% higher than average. Yet the stock made a slow but steady ascent until it flew 6% higher on Feb. 1 in huge volume, 273% above average, following better-than-expected Q1 results the prior day.Apple has since rallied as much as 55% past the 118.12 proper entry point.When Nvidia (NVDA) initially moved past its cup-with-handle base with a 33.16 entry on March 16, 2016, (please see the accompanying weekly chart), turnover fell 6% below average. Two days later, volume picked up a decent 40% above typical levels as the stock rallied 3%.Notice how volume for the week grew sharply vs. the prior week (1). Demand among large fund managers intensified.Then the whales really jumped into the stock almost nine weeks later after the chip firm announced accelerating EPS and revenue growth. As Nvidia soared 15% to 40.98, volume ballooned 500% above average.Still, one should not ignore IBD's research on big winners in the dozens of past bull markets over the past century. A minimum 40% jump in breakout volume vs. the stock's 50-day moving average still boosts the odds of success. And among small or midcap stocks, it's quite normal to see turnover spike 100%, 200% or more above average on the breakout day.Breakouts also work much better in a solid market uptrend, less so in choppy conditions, and practically never in bear markets.When Microsoft (MSFT), which debuted on the Nasdaq on March 17, 1986, broke out of its initial four-month base on Oct. 17 the same year, volume surged 396% above average as shares crossed a 35.60 buy point. That day, 432,100 shares changed hands, vs. the 50-day average of 87,100.The market was near the end of a significant correction. And the king of operating-system software for the PC revolution went on to rally 345% until its Oct. 5, 1987, peak before Black Monday, on Oct. 19.(A version of this column was first published on Feb. 10, 2017. Go to MarketSmith via the home page of Investors.com to see a historical chart of Microsoft to learn the patterns that it and other great stock market winners traced en route to huge profits.

In addition, tens of thousands of restricted shares were also allegedly given to two other affiliates. Many are said to have been then illegally sold when the stock price rocketed after an announced cryptocurrency play.""We acted quickly to prevent more than $27 million in alleged illicit trading profits from being transferred out of the country,"" Robert Cohen, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, said in a press release.

4,REG,"Five years ago last month, a Democratic President, a Democratic Senate, and a Republican House overwhelmingly agreed that the regulatory tax on capital was preventing small businesses from creating jobs. To address this, the JOBS Act was passed.The JOBS Act removed some of the regulatory tax by reducing or eliminating certain regulations for small business. The law established a category of companies with revenue under $1 billion known as emerging growth companies, or EGCs.EGCs are eligible for a streamlined IPO process and receive exemptions from certain rules once they become public. The JOBS Act also relaxed rules that apply to private securities offerings, and revived the long-dormant Regulation A market so issuers could pursue a ""quasi-public"" offering of stock.Unfortunately, due to the discretion that Congress gave to the SEC, many of these implementing regulations ended up being more complex than necessary. Consequently, the JOBS Act has not lived up to its full potential.While the JOBS Act led to a short-term spike in the IPO market, the U.S. still has less than half of the public companies that existed twenty years ago. While the cause of decline is unclear, what is clear is that the regulatory and market-structure environment remains inhospitable for small businesses.The SEC's disclosure regime has become increasingly costly to comply with, and trading rules under Regulation NMS (Reg NMS) do not work for small and microcap companies.  Not surprisingly, small companies choose to stay private or be acquired, rather than publicly access America's capital markets.The regulatory tax consists of the initial cost small businesses incur when taking a company public, the ongoing cost necessary to comply with regulations, and the quarterly cost of hiring extremely expensive experts to confirm a company's assumptions about its compliance program.The JOBS Act tried to reduce the regulatory tax on small businesses, but more can be done.Broadly speaking, we need a policy that will remove the power of decision-making from regulators and give it back to small-business owners and entrepreneurs. Only then can we create the right environment for entrepreneurs to take risks and create jobs.The current market structure for small-cap stocks is broken. To remedy this, we must recognize that one size does not fit all and treat EGC companies differently than mature companies.EGC issuers (current or future) should be able to opt out of having their securities classified as a Reg NMS Security. Reg NMS is a one-size-fits-all regulation that focuses on price and not on execution quality, and while it may be an efficient model for large-cap stocks that trade millions of shares a day, it is not appropriate for illiquid small caps with limited research coverage.It is time for policymakers to recognize that different tiers of equity market structure exist, that Reg NMS is not working for small-cap stocks, and that a viable trading option for these companies is badly needed.An EGC issuer should have the option to choose (1) the trading venue where it wants its stock to be listed, and (2) the appropriate tick-size increment for its listed stock. This choice would centralize liquidity for each EGC security on one trading venue and encourage venues to compete for EGC listings based on the incentives they provide to the EGC.Trading venues should be permitted to pay for market-maker programs in EGC securities. Broker-dealers who were compensated for market-making in EGC stocks would have an incentive to use those funds to expand research coverage of EGCs.Expanded research coverage, in turn, should stimulate investment by asset managers and others, including fiduciaries, who would have the information necessary to satisfy their due diligence obligations.We believe an increase in EGC investment by institutional investors, pension funds, mutual funds and asset managers should expand the available liquidity for EGC securities, improve execution quality and alleviate investors' fear that high transaction costs will devour their investment profits.High-frequency trading firms should also benefit from the opportunity to trade EGC securities in a deeper, centralized pool of liquidity. This would give EGCs the time they need to grow their businesses and graduate into the NMS system without harming liquidity or the flow of information to investors.During the EGC's IPO process, it should be allowed to meet with research analysts and investment bankers to discuss the valuation of the EGC and its industry peers.To facilitate a free-flowing discussion, pre-IPO valuation discussions should not be subject to Section 17 liability, although liability would remain for any misstatements in the offering documents.This is about investor protection. Analysts and bankers do not have the same agenda when they speak with a company about valuation. A research analysts' questions are focused on the future value of the company; bankers are focused on the current value of the company.Most important, an analysts' reputation and ability to continue to work in the industry rests on accuracy and independence. The Enron-like conflicts associated with keeping analyst ratings artificially high to preserve a steady flow of underwriting fees are not present with EGCs.EGC issuers should have the choice to opt out of the current quarterly SEC filing regime and only file an annual report supplemented by periodic material disclosures through 8-Ks, if that option appeals to their investors.EGC disclosure should be targeted and driven by the company and industry-specific information necessary for investors to make informed investment decisions. EGC issuers could provide information beyond the streamlined regulatory floor, but they wouldn't be liable to investors if they didn't.Together, these reforms will remove the regulatory tax on small-business capital, incentivize job creation and empower entrepreneurs — not federal or state government bureaucrats — to decide what is the highest, most efficient use of their company's capital.This is an American recipe for job creation that the president, members of Congress, and the SEC should pursue.

5,REG,"Last summer, at the first meeting of the Trump Leadership Council — an advisory group consisting of top CEOs from major companies — Donald Trump asked business leaders what their biggest problems were.I expected the answer to be America's anti-growth tax system. Almost all the CEOs did list the federal tax code as an albatross, but not the heaviest one. Instead, I was surprised to learn, most found the biggest restraint on growth to be federal red tape and regulation. Across all industries — manufacturers, energy firms, financial services, agriculture interests — federal rules were seen as mindless, inefficient, costly and incomprehensible.Trump is off to a speedy start in rolling back the rule-making industry in Washington. He has signed an executive order that mandates that any agency wanting to implement a new business regulation must at the same time repeal two existing regulations. This should reverse the tide of regulatory burdens. Yet there's so much more to be done. And Congress, not just the president, will have to play a lead role.Time out for a civics lesson: One of the mysteries of American government over the last half-century is why Congress has acceded so much lawmaking authority to what is now the fourth branch of government: federal agencies and interest groups. These agencies — the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Trade Commission, Food and Drug Administration and dozens more — have become fiefdoms that reign over private industries. They are effectively accountable to no one — and certainly not to Congress.But of course, Congress is supposed to make the laws — not unelected bureaucrats at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In the last decade or so, most of the big laws that affect private industry and consumers have been enacted by non-lawmakers.The excuse from Congress is that there are so many rules and regulations that the House and Senate can't possibly approve every one of them. Well, it's true that there are tens of thousand of these edicts. But isn't that the crux of the problem?A bigger problem is that agencies have become arrogant with power and desensitized to the impact of their litany of ""thou shalls"" and ""thou shall nots."" Martha Kent of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration once put the attitude of these bureaucrats succinctly: ""As long as I'm regulating, I'm happy."" She said she ""absolutely loves"" putting out ""a reg"" and that she was ""born to regulate."" This sounds like someone who is clueless about private industry.But who will stop these bureaucrats who are drunk with power?A new analysis by my colleague Jason Pye at FreedomWorks finds that under Barack Obama there were well over 500 new regulations with costs to the economy of more than $100 million each. That means these imposed a minimum of $50 billion of cost to the economy. How many of these were overturned by a mostly Republican Congress? Except for the roll back of some midnight regulations passed by Obama, the answer is exactly zero.The solution is a law that requires congressional approval before a regulation takes place. If I had my way, each and every new rule would only take effect after a vote of approval by the House and Senate. If they have to stay up until midnight to do it, so be it. That's what we pay these people for. At the very least, the Regulations in Need of Scrutiny Act (or the ""REINS Act"") would require congressional approval of any rule with a cost of $100 million to workers, employers or consumers.The CEOs on the Trump Leadership Council who called regulation the greatest threat to American prosperity weren't making this stuff up. A 2010 study by the Small Business Administration estimated regulations cost small businesses $1.75 trillion a year. That's more than the entire annual output of Pennsylvania and Ohio combined.This is a gigantic tax on the American economy — almost like a second income tax — sapping us of strength. The regulators enjoy doing it, and it will continue unabated unless Congress stops complaining about regulation and actually does something about it.RELATED:Donald Trump News & TweetsTrump's Plan To Cut Regulations Will Face A Surprising FoeFederal Regulations Now Cost Almost $1.9 Trillion, Study Finds

6,REG,"Eli Lilly (LLY) could benefit to the tune of $1.7 billion in 2025 on expanded Jardiance sales, Evercore analyst John Scotti said Friday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved another indication for the diabetes drug.In the stock market today, Lilly stock jumped 2.6% to 67.71, following the FDA decision. But shares still are down 13% since Nov. 22, when Lilly announced its Alzheimer's drug solanezumab had failed to significantly improve on cognition.On Friday, the FDA approved Lilly's new drug application (NDA) for Jardiance to be used in reducing cardiovascular mortality in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular death is 70% higher in adults with diabetes than adults without, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Lilly co-developed Jardiance with Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim.IBD'S TAKE: As Eli Lilly stock tanked last week, Apple stock retook a buy point and FANG stocks surged ahead. Make sure to keep tabs on IBD's Week In Review for leading and lackluster stocks each week.Bottom line, the indication allows Lilly to promote Jardiance for its CV reduction qualities vs. having them buried in the data, Scotti wrote in a research report. But it's somewhat controversial. In June, an advisory committee voted 12-to-11 to allow Lilly to promote the CV side.""The narrow vote clearly reflects the committee's mixed feelings of whether EMPA-Reg CVOT (cardiovascular outcome trial) provided substantial evidence that the drug reduces CV mortality in the population studied,"" Scotti wrote.Regardless, the expanded indication for Jardiance bodes well for Lilly and the entire SGLT-2 class, Scotti says. SGLT-2s are proteins involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. Inhibitors, like Jardiance, lead to a reduction in blood glucose.Lilly anticipates further indications, expected in 2017, to be catalysts for Jardiance sales, Scotti said.RELATED:

10,REG,"Passive management and index funds are the biggest challenges facing the active asset management industry, according to top executives at Principal Financial Group.Principal (PFG) Chairman and CEO Dan Houston and Jim McCaughan, president and chief executive officer of Principal Global Investors, expressed their views in New York while presenting the company's year-end review and long-term strategy to analysts, clients and investors.In a separate wide-ranging interview with Investor's Business Daily, the pair covered the state of the asset management business today, the rise of passive management and index funds, the fate of the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule and the future of the market in the wake of Donald Trump's election.The challenge presented by passive management and index funds come as investors wake up to the size of management fees, McCaughan said. He oversees all of the Des Moines, Iowa-based financial services company's asset management activities, which included $397 billion in assets as of Sept. 30.""The industry is seeing strong headwinds adversely affect the pricing on core active strategies with the moves to passive management,"" McCaughan said. ""You have horrible pricing pressure. And most investment managers are seeing declining revenues. It's become a very tough environment.""McCaughan said the main technology influences that contributed to the recent rise of index funds happened a decade ago: The New Market Systems regulation, or Reg NMS, and the Security and Exchange Commission's Financial Disclosure regulation, or Reg FD. These disrupted trading and the price discovery mechanisms for securities.""By making price discovery more immediate and transparent, you no longer have time to react to the news like you did 15 year ago,"" said McCaughan. No one has a chance to know anything before anyone else, and that is why active core strategies are less rewarding.IBD'S TAKE: Principal Financial Group is ranked third within the Insurance-Diversified group by IBD Stock Checkup. Go to Stock Checkup to see what other stocks in the group are highly ranked.Despite the headwinds, Principal's assets are up 9% so far this year because of a number of strategic moves, said McCaughan. He said his company hasn't seen the price erosion others have experienced because Principal's managers are focused on less efficient markets where better research can help them differentiate themselves from the indexes and their competition.He pointed to areas such as high-yield bonds, real estate investment trusts, emerging-market debt, investment-grade credit, even small- and midcap stocks. He said by moving into niche areas that are less liquid and less researched, it's possible to provide returns that investors are willing to pay a higher price for.But Principal is also counteracting the trend to passive by putting strategies together in what it calls outcome-oriented funds. These include target-date funds and target-risk funds. Target-risk funds are multi-asset funds with five ""flavors"" of risk from aggressive to conservative that advisors can use to provide a risk profile for a client.McCaughan said Principal has put this idea of a multistrategy income fund using global bond and equity markets into an active ETF, Principal EDGE Active Income ETF (YLD). After about 18 months, YLD has $270 million in assets. Trading so far is light, about 1,000 shares a day. But the ETF is up nearly 12% this year and yields 4%. Its expense ratio is 0.96%.""We believe the opportunity in the specialty assets and the multi-asset strategies will have a sustainable advantage for clients,"" said McCaughan. ""And if we are a leader in those areas, they will be rewarding for the clients and for us.""Another topic of concern for the industry is the implementation of the DOL's fiduciary rule, which is to be phased in next April.Houston said he doesn't expect the rule to be repealed, but that the implementation could be delayed.With advisors being paid by either a commission or fee structure, the new rule says advisors using commissions would need to provide clients with a disclosure called a BICE (best interest contract exemption).""I would hope we would see better clarity and avoid creating a massive class action lawsuit environment, primarily related to the BICE,"" said Houston. ""We think some help around the language related to the commission could provide serious benefits to consumers, starting with lower fees. ""He said there may be account holders where the fee structure is not as beneficial as a commission structure. Especially for clients who don't trade often.""There's all the reason in the world to have good fee disclosure to the consumer,"" Houston said. ""It should be very transparent and easy to understand. 'What am I getting for those fees?' The industry, broadly defined, supports that 100%. How you get there is the conversation that will take place in the ensuing months and years.""Looking forward, McCaughan said from an optimistic economic point of view you can anticipate reduced tax rates, fiscal stimulus from infrastructure and deregulation. This could lead to economic growth of 2% to 4%.""The question is does the economy have the capacity to growth that fast? We don't know, "" said McCaughan. ""Does unemployment of 4.9% mean that we're at capacity constraints in the economy? If that's true, then the boom would be short lived.""However, if the extra growth were to bring in new capacity, in particular workers currently outside the labor force, then this could start a period of sustained economic growth.On the negative side, if the new administration imposes tariffs on imports and deports undocumented residents, this could escalate social tensions, leading to a drop in consumer confidence. This could lead to a recession sometime late next year into 2018, said McCaughan.""But, don't underestimate the strength and innovation in the U.S. private sectors,"" said McCaughan. ""I am prepared to say continue to buy U.S. equities on setbacks. Keep asset allocations up to weight, focus on domestic earnings, which take you to small- and midcap stocks. Those would be my biggest points. On bond yields, don't play a yield game. Don't be out there on duration. Go for shorter duration higher-yielding bonds. My favorites are real estate bonds and high-yield bonds. A lot is pointing to the U.S. being the best place for capital over the next 12 months.""RELATED:DOL Fiduciary Rule Forces Investors To Weigh Their OptionsHow Much Is A Financial Advisor's Services Really Worth?

12,REG,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped Wednesday as Wall Street analysts weighed the results of a narrow Food and Drug Administration advisory panel vote late Tuesday.The panel met to decide whether it's a good idea to expand the label of Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance to include reduced death from cardiovascular causes, based on a large clinical trial called Empa-Reg. The committee voted 12 to 11 in favor of the change. Such a close vote leaves it less than clear just what decision the FDA will ultimately make.""The most cited reason for a 'No' vote was that the bar for a new claim to be granted based on a SINGLE study is very high, and panelists would like to see a second trial to 'confirm' the CV death finding,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note. ""Many panelists who voted 'Yes' also shared that concern, but they found the CV death benefit compelling and convincing enough to tip the balance for them.""Fernandez nonetheless liked the odds of approval, noting that ""most of the senior members of the panel, including two biostatisticians, and ALL five cardiologists, voted in favor of the new indication.""Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan is also betting in favor of a change, adding that this could read across to similar products in the SGLT-2 inhibitor class.""Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana remains the market leader in the SGLT-2 space, with its CANVAS outcome study scheduled to be completed in February 2017,"" Divan wrote in a research note. ""Assuming the FDA agrees with including the EMPA-REG OUTCOME CV death data into the Jardiance label, we could see some share shift from Invokana to Jardiance until CANVAS is completed, with longer-term implications dependent on the CANVAS results.""Results from outcome studies for AstraZeneca's (AZN) Forxiga and Merck (MRK)/Pfizer's (PFE) ertugliflozin are expected later in the decade,"" Divan said.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum was more cautious.""Despite the slight overall majority of votes in favor of the new CV indication, we view approval for an actual CV death indication as having coin-flip odds, given the unprecedented nature/results of the trial,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""That said, we also feel that there's a better chance the FDA would allow this data to be added to the label instead (no indication statement).""Lilly stock rose 4% to 78.13 on the stock market today, near 77, once again above its 50-day moving average. Lilly closed just below its 200-day line, where it's been for the past five months.Johnson & Johnson stock closed up 0.9% at 119.33, a fresh record high.
"
13,REG,"Drug giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) both face key Food and Drug Administration actions this Tuesday that will affect the future of their leading disease-treatment franchises.An advisory committee to the FDA will meet to discuss expanding the label of Jardiance, Lilly's 2-year-old drug for treating type 2 diabetes. What Lilly wants to add to the label is that the drug also reduces death by cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, and the risk of death in general.Those claims are based on a large, long-term trial called EMPA-REG, the results of which surprised the industry last year. Patients on Jardiance showed a 38% reduction in death from cardiovascular causes, a 35% reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure, and a 32% cut in deaths from all causes. If the FDA approves the label expansion, Lilly's sales reps will be able to use this in marketing the drug.The problem, according to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, is that those were not the primary endpoints of the trial; they were secondary, ""exploratory"" endpoints. The primary endpoint was a three-point measurement of major adverse cardiac events (MACE): the time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack and non-fatal stroke. On that, results were more mixed: Only on the first point did Jardiance achieve a statistically significant difference, while the non-fatal stroke incidence was actually slightly higher than in the placebo group.When the FDA released its briefing documents for the panel Friday morning, in fact, the conclusion affirmed that the study does show a reduction in CV death, but advised against including the MACE, heart-failure and all-cause death info on the label. This was nonetheless interpreted positively by analysts, and Lilly stock was up 0.5% on the stock market today despite the general Brexit sell-off.""The panel also consists of a substantial portion of cardiologists, which will help tilting the balance towards highlighting the CV benefit during the panel, in our view,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note Friday. Previewing the event on June 2, Fernandez had predicted the panel would be ""a battle of 'statistical purists' vs 'clinicians,' "" adding that ""clinically, the large and consistent CV death benefit seen in the EMPA-REG trial is viewed to be precedent-setting.""That precedent will also be of interest to Novo Nordisk (NVO), which recently reported that a similar study of its diabetes drug Victoza also brought a reduction in cardiovascular deaths, though not to the extent that Jardiance did. Novo Nordisk has said that it will also file for a label addition but hasn't yet decided on the language. The Danish diabetes specialist fell 4.4% Friday.Tuesday will also be the deadline for the FDA to decide whether to approve Gilead's latest hepatitis C pill. Gilead's last two hepatitis C launches, of Sovaldi and Harvoni, broke financial records, but those were restricted to certain genotypes of the virus. The new pill would be approved for all genotypes, not only enlarging the market, but also removing the need to test the patient's genotype before writing a prescription.Wall Street has no doubt that the FDA will approve the drug, but the interesting question is how Gilead will price it. When it launched in December 2013, Sovaldi gained notoriety for its price of $84,000 for a 12-week regimen, while Harvoni (launched in October 2014) was more than $94,000.However, when AbbVie (ABBV) launched its competing Viekira Pak in December 2014, the two companies started a rebating war that hit Gilead's income.Then this January, Merck (MRK) priced its new HCV drug Zepatier well below both, which both Gilead and AbbVie acknowledged hit their Q1 financials. It remains to be seen how Gilead values the pan-genotypic nature of the new drug.Gilead stock was down 3.5% Friday, hitting a 2-year low. AbbVie sank 2.4% and Merck 3.1%

14,REG,"With the market back in a confirmed uptrend and Wall Street seemingly getting more comfortable with a Federal Reserve rate hike sooner rather than later, is it time to shun defensive, dividend-paying names in favor of growth? The short answer is that both areas must be respected. Breakouts in the growth space are starting to emerge, but at the same…

15,REG,"As one-size-fits-all regulation and top-down mandates continue to strangle our economy, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 has proven to be a breath of fresh air. This truly bipartisan accomplishment that I helped shepherd through Congress has led a resurgence in the initial public offering market and allowed more companies to raise capital through private channels. Simply put, the JOBS Act opens doors for capital to flow into growing and innovative businesses.But the JOBS Act may not reach its full potential. That’s because many provisions of the JOBS Act were not self-effectuating upon becoming law. Instead, the bill directed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement these new provisions through regulation, leaving the SEC a great deal of discretion as to how the JOBS Act will work in practice.The SEC has a mixed record when it comes to fulfilling its obligation to promote capital formation, one of the agency’s three core missions. Take the issue of the SEC’s performance on crowdfunding. While the SEC was required to issue rules nine months after the JOBS Act passed, the SEC took three years to do so. When the SEC finally got around to issuing the rules, the final regulations diluted the ambitious goals laid out in Congress.Crowdfunding was intended to give all Americans, regardless of income level, the ability to make financial investments. However, the SEC added burdensome requirements and placed arbitrary caps on investment -- imposing its judgement over that of working Americans seeking to invest their hard-earned savings. This nanny-state mentality creates a system in which wealthy Americans have a greater ability to earn a return on investment than lower- or middle-income households who are restricted by SEC regulation.Additionally, the SEC missed the mark when it proposed new restrictions on issuers under Regulation D of the 1933 Securities Act, which lays out three exemptions for securities sellers from registering their offering with the SEC. Under the JOBS Act, Congress allowed Regulation D issuers the ability to advertise their shares to the general public for the first time.However, the SEC’s proposal would hinder the ability of all Reg. D issuers to raise capital through private channels -- not just those who take advantage of the new opportunity to advertise their shares. While the SEC has not implemented these proposals, its attempt to impose new barriers to investment was seriously misguided.There are some parts of the SEC’s record that deserve recognition. Its modernization of Regulation A, which provides an exemption that allows companies to raise capital from the public markets without having to issue a full-fledged IPO, was commendable. The SEC’s actions ensured that most Regulation A issuers would be spared the burden of complying with a conflicting web of individual state registration requirements, and subsequently companies are starting to raise capital under the modernized Regulation A.Monitoring the implementation and impact of the JOBS Act remains a top priority of the Capital Markets Subcommittee, and we intend to move legislation to fix the mistakes made by the SEC. But the JOBS Act was just a beginning -- and there is more that Congress can and should do to help entrepreneurs grow and prosper.For example, while the JOBS Act did a great deal to reduce the cost of an initial capital raise, more should be done to help issuers trade in the aftermarket. Lack of liquidity and competition in the secondary-market trading of small-capitalization companies has long made access to capital difficult. As SEC Chair Mary Jo White noted in a recent speech at Stanford University, some 70% of startups die within 20 months of their last financing.To spur competition and increase liquidity, I introduced the Main Street Growth Act, which would establish the legal framework for the creation of venture exchanges -- stock exchanges specifically designed for the trading of small-capitalization stocks. Businesses that use provisions of the JOBS Act -- such as the IPO “on ramp” or the modernized Regulation A -- would be eligible to list and trade on a venture exchange. Venture exchanges are a logical next step to increase the flow of capital throughout our economy.Congress and the SEC should consider other solutions, such as reform of intrastate offering regulations and micro offerings, which would allow a business to solicit investments from a group of known investors without running afoul of SEC rules. Such reforms warrant further congressional consideration to achieve the goal of removing roadblocks to capital formation for startups.The lesson of the financial crisis is that Keynesian economics can never replace the free market as a source of prosperity for the American people. When government stops the regulatory squeeze, the creativity of the American people will quite literally pay off.

16,REG,"During the drug-stock boom, the newer biotech companies tended to get the most play as growth stocks. But last year, one of the top-performing large-cap drugmakers was none other than 140-year-old Eli Lilly.Like other big pharmas, Lilly (LLY) has spent the last few years climbing out of an earnings trough brought on by the loss of patent protection on some of its biggest drugs. While growth is still slow, investors have gotten ever more interested in the company's pipeline:Lilly's late-stage drug candidate solanezumab could bring a breakthrough in a currently untreatable disease -- Alzheimer's.Psoriasis treatment ixekizumab is expected to launch anytime now and eventually achieve blockbuster sales. Another immunology drug, baricitinib, which Lilly co-developed with Incyte (INCY), was also recently filed with the FDA.Meanwhile, the already marketed diabetes drug Jardiance shocked Wall Street last year by reducing deaths from heart failure by 32% in a large-scale study called Empa-Reg.Recently, Lilly CEO John Lechleiter sat down with IBD to explain Lilly's strategy for 2016 and beyond.IBD: I'm interested in your immunology strategy. Given that there are a lot of medicines out there in that area, how do you see yourself fitting into the space?Lechleiter: Well, I think the only way we can enter that space -- and lay claim to any of these disease areas -- is to offer something better. And I believe the data we have on ixekizumab, which is our anti-IL17 antibody for psoriasis, is excellent. You look at clearance rates: 31% to 41% of people across three studies had 100% clearance of their plaque. So while there are competitors there, we feel very good about the profile of that product.I think with baricitinib, in four studies we established, in one of them superiority to methotrexate, which is the current first-line standard of care; and in another study, superiority in terms of signs and symptoms of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) to (AbbVie's (ABBV)) Humira, which is the biggest drug in the world.I think we’re bringing something new to these categories. In the case of RA, we know people cycle between different courses of therapy, and I think there’s no question, even with the drugs we have in that space today, there’s still an unmet need.IBD: In the diabetes area, you have this impressive data from Jardiance, and people are wondering is this going to be a class effect? If it is, do you have a point of differentiation?Lechleiter: Well, I think first of all, the people (who are) asking if it’s a class effect (meaning the entire class of drugs would all perform the same) are the people who don’t have Jardiance. The fact is, we have the data. Anything else about any of the other ones is speculation. So I think the advantage we have is first-mover advantage. Obviously, as soon as we get the label changed, we will exercise that. We filed that with the FDA ... (and) expect to get updated labeling reflecting the outcome of Empa-Reg later this year.IBD: The overall diabetes market has been under pressure lately. Sanofi (SNY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) have been warning of slower growth. Is this true of the market in general or just certain segments?Lechleiter: I think that several categories are still growing in the diabetes space. It’s very competitive. Each of these drug categories has three or four different players. We happen to be the only company that has a complete spectrum across the treatment paradigm, along with Boehringer Ingelheim.The growth of insulins is slowing a bit, because we believe that more and more people using insulin are using an sglt2 inhibitor like Jardiance that are lowering insulin requirements. So I think there’s some interplay between the drugs. But we also know that SGLT2 category growth is coming at the expense, in many cases, of generic sulfonylureas. So that brand category is expanding.I think from a market standpoint, there’s a lot of competition. That’s great for consumers (and) great for physicians. But it remains for us to differentiate our products and to compete in that mix.IBD: Building the complete portfolio of diabetes medicines -- what is the advantage of that? Is it a marketing advantage?Lechleiter: Well, at a fundamental level, we can work with physicians to address, “What’s the right drug for a given patient?” vs. “How do you fit the patient into our drug?” if that makes sense. Let’s understand, diabetes is a progressive disease. So understanding where the patient is in that journey, and how our medicines can best help the patient. We can be agnostic about what choice a physician makes, because we have an offering at every step of the way.Ultimately, we can also, hopefully, better understand what the right combinations are. We have a fixed-dose combination of a DPP4 along with Jardiance -- we’re the only company that offers that today. We have not just orals, we have insulins. We have not just insulins, but our GLP-1 drug Trulicity. So I think there’s some advantages in terms of being able to optimize treatment. And ultimately there may be some marketplace advantages to having a full basket of products -- if you think about negotiating with payers and insurers, for example.IBD: In Alzheimer’s, you have different programs going. Do you anticipate there will be multiple drugs in this category?Lechleiter: First of all, if solanezumab is positive -- we’ll know by the end of the year -- that’s going to generate a tremendous amount of interest in companies developing BACE inhibitors, antibodies and other drugs. We believe that ultimately this will probably be treated with a combination, not unlike the way diabetes is treated today, not unlike the way cancer is treated. It may be an antibody with an oral BACE inhibitor, for example. But we’re also developing agents that act against tau (protein), which is a downstream aspect of the disease progression.It remains to be seen, but our best guess is that it will be a combination. If (solanezumab) is successful, others will follow, and we aim to be in that group.IBD: In oncology, again I’m thinking about your positioning -- there's been lot of drug industry activity in cancer. Can you talk about your strategy?Lechleiter: The pillar of our oncology business, going back eight or nine years ago, was Alimta, and it still is today. We bought ImClone in October of 2008. We’ve had two drugs approved from that ImClone pipeine: Cyramza, which now has four indications -- two gastric cancers, colorectal cancer and lung cancer -- and then late last year we got approval for Portrazza, and that’s indicated for squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer. And that’s a type of lung cancer that, in the first line, has not seen an improvement in survival for 20 years. So we’re excited about that.We have a third ImClone product that we’ve commenced filing with the FDA, called olaratumab. That is for soft-tissue sarcoma. Behind that we have three drugs in the clinic today that have immune-system components associated with them, as we begin to build an immuno-oncology portfolio. We also have a drug that I think everyone is excited about called abemaciclib. That’s a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We’ll have the phase-two data for breast cancer this year. We also have a phase-three (trial) underway. We also have a phase-three underway for our CDK4/6 inhibitor in lung cancer.So we’re focused on immuno-oncology, microenvironment -- which would be Cyramza, in other words anti-angiogenesis drugs -- and cell cycle inhibitors. So it’s a three-pronged approach, and I think we’ve got a good portfolio of products in the pipeline to address all three.

18,REG,"Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped to a more than 14-year high Thursday as the company presented more evidence that its diabetes drug Jardiance reduces death from heart failure.At the annual European Association for the Study of Diabetes, Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim presented details on the massive Empa-Reg Outcome Trial studying the long-term cardiovascular effects of Jardiance, which they first headlined last month. Lilly and Ingelheim reported that Jardiance reduced death by cardiovascular causes by 38% — although oddly enough, it did not reduce the risk of nonfatal heart attack and stroke. All-cause mortality was cut by 32%, while hospitalizations for heart failure were down 35%.Lilly noted that Jardiance was the first diabetes drug to show this kind of effect.""Addressing the burden of cardiovascular events, including death, is at the core of diabetes care, and until now no single diabetes medication has been associated with a reduction in mortality,"" lead investigator Bernard Zinman said in a statement.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum reported that the slides from the study generated applause at the meeting. He also noted that it has larger implications in the field of diabetes care. Jardiance is an SGLT2 inhibitor, the same class of drug as Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana and AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga.On the other hand, Merck's (MRK) similar outcomes study of its Januvia, a drug in a different class called DPP4 inhibitors, did not find a cardiovascular benefit, though it didn't do any harm either.""Based on these data, I think the SGLT2 class is likely to be bigger than the DPP4 class in 3-6 years,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Remember, every $1 billion (per year) in additional sales adds $0.25 to Lilly EPS. Peak sales estimates are currently under $2 billion. Merck sells $6 billion of Januvia today. These could invert.""Schoenebaum added that J&J and AstraZeneca are also conducting outcomes studies on the SGLT2 inhibitors — with results due in 2017 and 2019, respectively — that should give a clearer idea of whether this is a class effect.The new data were announced just before noon ET Thursday, sending Lilly stock up nearly 7% to above 90 later Thursday afternoon. Merck stock was down more than 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.
