0,NLSN,"Despite concerns about price hikes hurting Netflix's (NFLX) domestic business, Pivotal Research Group predicted Friday that the company's new U.S. subscribers in the June quarter will beat expectations.Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak forecast that Netflix will add 750,000 U.S. streaming video customers in the second quarter. That compares with the consensus estimate of 515,000 and Netflix's guidance of 500,000.He left his international subscriber forecast unchanged at 2.25 million net new subscribers, vs. guidance for 2 million.Wlodarczak reiterated his buy rating on Netflix stock with a price target of 145. The ""Netflix investment story (remains) intact,"" he said in a report.Netflix stock rose 2.1% to 97.06 on the stock market today. Netflix stock is 27% below its all-time high of 133.27, reached on Dec. 7.The internet television network has been weighed down by worries of slowing growth and rising content costs. It has an IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of just 21, putting it among the lowest 21% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.Wlodarczak based his U.S. subscriber forecast on the latest Nielsen (NLSN) household survey data. The Nielsen data showed little if any effect from Netflix's initial price hikes. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based started rolling out grandfathered price increases to longtime subscribers in Q2.""While a nice Q2 U.S. subscriber beat should help alleviate concerns around the churn effect from beginning of grandfathered price increases, the key for the stock will be Q3 U.S. subscriber guidance given there will substantially more households with price increases in Q3 vs. Q2,"" he said.Netflix is scheduled to report Q2 earnings on July 18.Wlodarczak left his Q3 U.S. subscriber forecast unchanged at an increase of 750,000, vs. consensus of 730,000.Netflix ended the first quarter with 81.5 million streaming video subscribers worldwide, including 47 million in the U.S. It guided to 84 million subscribers for Q2.RELATED:Netflix Stock Downgraded On U.S. Growth Concerns

1,NLSN,"Google is using the interest surrounding the 2016 elections to vault more deeply into the political polling arena with its own polling service.Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google is offering its survey products to presidential and congressional campaigns -- and getting them into newsrooms, according to The Hill.Google collects its data through survey boxes that appear online before people can read a news article, as well as through an application for the Google Android operating system that provides credits to the Google Play store to people who answer questions, The Hill reported. The product is known as Google Consumer Surveys. Nielsen Holdings (NLSN) also remains a major player in the survey industry.Online polling has long faced skepticism, however, since most Internet polls rely on self-selecting groups of respondents. Getting a representative sample including the elderly or poor, for example, can be difficult since they are less likely to have Internet access and would be excluded from sampling as a result.On the other hand, getting voters to participate in phone-based polling is becoming more difficult. The rate of people responding to phone surveys had already fallen to less than 10% in a 2012 Pew study, according to the Silicon Valley Business Journal.Google specifies that its sample is representative of the population on the Internet, according to the report. Google makes money from the surveys, but its data work also keeps the search company's brand prominent in the political conversation.""As we started to get ready for the 2016 cycle, that's when things really started to pick up a bit on my side,"" Karen Sheldon, the Google account executive on the sales team for the product, said in The Hill's report.The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have both used Google's tools for political polling, and the company has struck a longer-term partnership with the Independent Journal Review, a right-leaning news website that has attracted attention for its viral videos starring presidential candidates, The Hill said.Other Silicon Valley companies focusing on political polling include SurveyMonkey, which The Hill said hired Mark Blumenthal, a well-respected pollster and writer, away from the Huffington Post in October. SurveyMonkey has a partnership with NBC News to produce polls for the 2016 election.Alphabet stock was up a fraction in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 764.Image provided by Shutterstock.

2,NLSN,"Hit anti-superhero flick ""Deadpool"" got made with what's been called an all-Adobe workflow. No wonder Adobe Systems (ADBE) CEO Shantanu Narayen sounds a fan.In a keynote address kicking off the Adobe Summit 2016 digital marketing conference Tuesday, he used the cheeky comic book movie to illustrate how the content world's gone digital.Adobe, of course, makes the Creative Cloud digital tools, such as Photoshop and Premiere Pro video editing software, and the Adobe Marketing Cloud tools used to track online content popularity and to power advertising decisions. The company gets a near-top IBD Composite Rating of 97, and the stock hit a new high in high volume Friday, after Adobe beat analyst views in its first-quarter earnings report and lifted its annual sales and earnings guidance. After February's market dip, Adobe stock is back where it was in early January.""Last year one of the biggest media companies in the world decided to make an unknown superhero as big as Captain America without the usual big media and TV spots,"" Narayen said in a livecast keynote from the event in Las Vegas that he said drew more than 10,000 attendees. ""Deadpool, a brash antihero most people had never heard of, wove his way into their lives through using one of the most innovative digital and social media campaigns ever.""""Deadpool,"" by film folks at Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX), ""shattered all box office records and is on the way to becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie in film history,"" Narayen said. He went on to talk about how MasterCard (MA), too, had moved to ""pivot"" a bit from traditional ad strategy toward online and social forms, exemplified by its #Priceless Surprises campaign that included things like winning a trip to the Grammy Awards.""Businesses must re-imagine how they interact with customers in a digital-first and digital-enabled world,"" Narayen said, adding that ""getting content to the right person at the right place at the right time takes data"" -- that is, the ability to analyze and target.Adobe made several announcements in conjunction with its annual Summit show, including these three Adobe Marketing Cloud enhancements, among others:After viewing started migrating away from the television itself toward online viewing via devices such as mobile phone screens and tablets, some online video viewing is now ""going back to the living room,"" Jeremy Helfand, Adobe's vice president of video solutions, told IBD. ""Over 20% of 'TV Everywhere' viewing is happening on (television-) connected devices -- Apple (AAPL) TV, Roku or (Sony (SNE)) PlayStation or (Microsoft (MSFT)) Xbox, which is quite remarkable.""Historically, ""there was one currency -- it was Nielsen -- that's what was used in order to purchase advertising,"" Helfand said, ""largely through upfronts and some residuals -- that's how advertising was bought and sold.""But tracking how many people are watching what these days, across a bunch of devices and websites, hasn't been easy and that has hampered online video monetization efforts. Adobe Certified Metrics, which involves a developing partnership with ComScore following last year's link-up with Nielsen, is one way that Adobe aims to make audience measurement easier and more standardized.""You've seen ComScore merge with Rentrak trying to bring digital and linear together just as Nielsen is,"" Helfand said. ""And you're also seeing some media companies build their own definitions of who their audiences are, and go out to (ad) buyers and say 'here's my audience'.""The partnerships and platform development further Narayen's goal of Adobe products and services being able to ""make, monetize and measure"" the digital experiences that people have in today's world of content. The hope is that in turn will make Adobe software more crucial across a breadth of industries.In its Q1 report last week, digital marketing segment revenue at Adobe reached $406.2 million, which Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle said, in a research note, was ""better than the expectation of $402.7 million."" He added that the Summit event this week was ""likely  to  provide  additional  positive  announcements  on  the marketing business.""Adobe added 798,000 new subscribers for its Creative Cloud businesses last quarter, and Barnicle noted that 30% of them were new to Adobe. He sees more CEOs driving adoption of Adobe products.""Like Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), Adobe is seeing more CEOs make purchasing decisions,"" he wrote. ""In the 2016 Pacific Crest CFO Survey, both CIOs and CMOs saw a decline in the portion of the IT budget that they control. We believe that CEOs are making more IT decisions than ever before. They are looking to move their businesses to digital and to the cloud, and Adobe is one of several beneficiaries.""The Adobe Summit runs through Thursday, with actor George Clooney among speakers listed for the event -- albeit most come more from the tech side than from Tinseltown.San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe has offices around the globe, including in Diegem, Belgium. It's just outside Brussels, where terrorist attacks hit the airport and a subway station early Tuesday. Narayen started his talk with condolences, and despite its Summit event @Adobe said it was keeping its Twitter account silent for the day, in light of the Brussels situation.

4,NLSN,"Nielsen (NLSN) isn't just watching what people say about television shows on Twitter (TWTR) anymore. The measurement company announced that it is incorporating Facebook (FB) conversation — and later, Facebook's Instagram — into its service that tracks social media conversations about what's hot on TV.Nielsen's Twitter TV Ratings, which will be renamed Social Content Ratings, will be the ""first solution to measure aggregate-level program-related conversation on Facebook and Twitter,"" the company said in a release. The service aims to assess audience engagement and provide advertisers with broader data as they make buying decisions.For those concerned about the privacy of their Facebook feeds: Nielsen won't be able to read individual messages on Facebook, but it will have access to anonymous aggregate information. The metric doesn't include private messages on the social network; it does include posts on family and friends' walls, and posts shared with followers and the public.Nielsen said its social content ratings will be available commercially in the first half of the year in the U.S., Australia, Italy and Mexico (markets where Twitter TV Ratings are already available).Facebook shares closed down 1% in the stock market Wednesday after undercutting the 200-day line intraday.

"
6,NLSN,"""If you think about business strategy, where to start fishing next, where the next gold rush is — the mobile ad market is undervalued and underdeveloped,"" Brian Angiolet, Verizon's (VZ) senior vice president of consumer products and marketing, told IBD in an interview.

48,NLSN,"More people are using smartphones and tablets while watching TV shows, but second-screen applications like chatting about the show on social media are secondary to distracted viewer activities like surfing the Web.A study of second-screen use in the U.S. by Nielsen (NLSN), released Monday, indicates mobile device users might not be paying close attention to the shows they have on the television. The most popular application for smartphones and tablets while watching TV shows is surfing the Web, Nielsen reported.Among tablet users, two-thirds report surfing the Web while watching TV, with shopping being the No. 2 activity, at 44%.Among smartphone users, 49% report surfing the Web while TV viewing. But two second-screen applications tied for second with 29%: ""Looking up actors, plots, athletes, etc."" and ""Emailing, texting friends about program.""Checking sports scores ranked highly with tablet users (29%) and smartphone users (27%).Tablet users appear to be more distracted TV viewers than smartphone users, according to the report. The study doesn't indicate when people tend to tune out and use their mobile devices for applications other than those involving the show. Whether that's during commercials or during the TV shows would hold different implications for broadcasters.Still, Nielsen's report on second screens is primarily positive. Mobile devices from Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) Android vendors combined with social media sites like Twitter (TWTR) are helping viewers become more engaged with TV shows and other fans, the researcher said.In general, survey respondents reported enjoying TV shows more and watching more live TV because of second-screen applications.

98,NLSN,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) surged over 10% on Thursday to inch near their 52-week high after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Investors were also likely pleased to see that the grocery chain’s e-commerce initiatives started to pay off. The question is should investors think about buying grocery stocks as Amazon-based (AMZN  -  Free Report) fears seem to have been overblown.Kroger Kroger posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share, which came in well above our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.63 per share and marked a nearly 26% climb from the year-ago quarter.

Kroger also expanded its partnership with grocery delivery startup powerhouse Instacart, which works with companies from CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) to Aldi.Kroger stock is currently a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold), and might not experience Thursday’s gains for a while now. With that said, the rest of the grocery industry has also made some significant changes in order to compete in the age of online shopping and delivery.Industry OverviewNielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) and the Food Marketing Institute released their second-ever ""Digitally Engaged Food Shopper"" study earlier this year, which stated that within the next five to seven years 70% of consumers will do at least some grocery shopping online.

The big-box giant also offers an order online and curbside pickup up service called “Grocery Hero” at 1,200 stores, with the company expected to add the service at 1,000 more locations by end of the year.Investors should note that Walmart’s first-quarter e-commerce sales surged by 33% in the U.S. Looking ahead, the company is projected to see it quarterly earnings climb by 12%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s revenues are expected to pop 1.8% to $125.53 billion.

The company also expanded its same-day delivery service to “most metropolitan” areas through an updated partnership with Instacart.The wholesale retailer’s quarterly revenues popped by 12% to $32.36 billion, with e-commerce comp sales up 36.8%. Looking ahead, Costco’s full-year earnings are projected to surge nearly 18%, while its full-year revenues are expected to reach $139.98 billion, representing an 8.5% jump. COST is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but sports an overall “A” VGM score based on its strong Value, Growth, and Moment grades.Target (TGT  -  Free Report)Target introduced its online ordering and curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” in more than 250 stores last quarter and expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, which allows customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery.  The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its digital sales surge 28% in Q1, on top of a 21% climb in the year-ago period. Target also introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations, which was made possible by its $550 million December 2017 purchase of grocery delivery startup Shipt.Target is expected to see its quarterly earnings climb by 13%, while its revenues are projected to reach $17.3 billion, which would mark 5.3% growth.

102,NLSN,"Nielsen Holdings Plc (NLSN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 18.67%.Last quarter, Nielsen reported earnings of 52 cents per share, which excluded a provisional non-cash tax charge of 29 cents per share. The figure increased 18.2% year over year and 26.8% sequentially.Revenues increased 6.3% year over year and 7.3% sequentially to $1.76 billion. Top-line growth was driven by contribution from the acquisition of Gracenote, continued strength in the company’s Watch segment and growth in emerging markets, partially offset by weakness in the U.S. Buy segment.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Robust Product Portfolio to Boost ResultsNielsen’s regular investments in innovative technologies bode well for its product portfolio expansion.Recently, Nielsen launched Advanced Audience Forecasting tool which provides forecasts of TV audiences defined by advanced audience segments to its clients.Further, the company introduced Connected Partner Program, which helps companies to connect their network, discover new connected partners and utilize the measurement data provided by Nielsen.Also, the company launched Nielsen Branded Integration Intel, which provides standardized measurement of brands appearing within video content, including TV programs.These endeavors are likely to benefit the company’s first-quarter results.Strategic Partnerships Remain PositiveStrategic partnerships have been shaping Nielsen’s growth trajectory over the past few years.Recently, Nielsen extended its partnership with Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), post which, the latter will increase the use of Nielsen's insights and solutions. This is likely to benefit the Buy segment of the company which did not perform well in the last quarter.However, the segment is expected to witness sluggish growth in the first quarter due to weakness in the U.S. market.Earlier this year, Nielsen entered into a multi-year renewal agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI  -  Free Report). This partnership will allow the Sinclair Broadcast to deploy Nielsen TV ratings in its business model.Last year, the company also signed an agreement with Cumulus Media, post which Nielsen has started providing radio and network radio ratings services to 446 radio stations across 90 local markets.These partnerships will continue to aid the strong performance of Watch segment of the company.We believe the above-mentioned moves taken by the company will boost its top-line growth by improving its clientele in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Nielsen Holdings Plc Price and EPS Surprise Nielsen Holdings Plc Price and EPS Surprise | Nielsen Holdings Plc QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

108,NLSN,"Consumer analytics firm Nielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) just released its second-ever online food shopping study, which found that the industry Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and meal-kit delivery companies such as Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) helped popularize is set to grow into a $100 billion market soon.On Monday, Nielsen, in partnership with the Food Marketing Institute, released its “Digitally Engaged Food Shopper” study. The joint venture found that within as few as five to seven years, 70% of all U.S. consumers are expected to buy at least a portion of their groceries online.Previously, Nielsen and FMI projected it would take the U.S. online grocery business until 2025 to reach the $100 billion milestone. “The grocery industry is currently in the age of digital experimentation, where the roadmap on how to navigate and achieve real and profitable growth continues to evolve,” Nielsen executive Chris Morley said in a statement.The Digitally Engaged Food Shopper study found that the online grocery industry is set to expand rapidly, but investors should know that it is already widely popular in the U.S. CNBC noted that 49% of all U.S. shoppers bought a packaged good online within the last three months.Looking at the generational breakdown, 61% of Millennials purchased at least some type of grocery item online, while 44% of Baby Boomers also joined the new online shopping trend.This growth hardly comes as a shock to many investors and certainly won’t surprise many retailers. In fact, over the last year, big-box giants Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have attempted to bolster their online grocery businesses in order to better compete with Amazon.Looking ahead, grocery companies such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) will likely invest more money in online ordering technologies and infrastructure.On top of investments from industry giants, grocery delivery startups such as Instacart have become popular in cities around the country. Now, as Instacart partners with everyone from Petco to CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), investors might see more shake-ups and mergers akin to Amazon’s Whole Foods purchase sooner than later.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

111,NLSN,"Nielsen Holdings plc (NLSN  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 24.24%.Notably, Nielsen missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 26.48%.Also, shares of Nielsen have lost 0.45% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 25.3% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Watch Segment Strength to Drive RevenuesIn the second quarter, Watch business revenues of $821 million contributed 50% to the total top line and were up 10.3% on a year-over-year basis. This figure is expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter driven by continued strength in Audience Measurement and Marketing Effectiveness. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Watch revenues is currently pegged at $845 million.Partnerships & Agreements to Boost ResultsNielsen has been partnering with big companies to extend its TV ratings service beyond the Nielsen Local TV Ratings Service. Recently, Nilesen announced that it will start crediting Facebook, Alphabet (GOOGL) owned YouTube and Hulu distributed video content through its Digital Content Ratings system launched in September last year. With the new move, both digital and TV publisher clients of Nielsen will be able to get a comprehensive view of the different ways their digital content is watched across these platforms. These partnerships will help Nielsen to expand its client base and boost its Watch segment revenues in the upcoming quarter.Weakness in the Buy Segment Could Hurt ResultsIn the second quarter, Buy business revenues of $823 million declined 3.4% year over year and 2% on a constant-currency basis. The figure is further expected to decrease in the upcoming quarter due to softness in the U.S. market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Buy revenues is currently pegged at $798 million.Increased Investments Could Weigh On ProfitsIn the last quarter, the company’s diluted net earnings of 50 cents per share, missed the Zacks Consensus estimate by 16 cents. Nielsen has been making continuous investments to expand its client base and increase its international presence. Although these investments will increase the company’s top-line figures, it is likely to impact the company’s bottom line in the upcoming quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nielsen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 69 cents. Therefore, Earnings ESP for Nielsen is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nielsencarries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Nielsen N.V.

115,NLSN,"The earnings season is in full swing with about 183 S&P 500 companies reporting this week. About 97 S&P 500 companies have already released their results till Jul 21, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than expected earnings. Total earnings for these 97 companies (accounting for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.4% year over year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the Apr–Jun 2017 quarter is anticipated to register high single-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.  Per the Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 8.6% on 4.7% growth in revenues. Although it represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the previous quarter, the dollar amount of the total earnings is likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. The relative improvement in the quarterly performance is largely due to a turnaround in the economy, better job market scenario and rising oil prices. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to be in double digits in 2018 and beyond.For the April–June quarter as a whole, about five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline, with Autos, Conglomerates and Utilities being the biggest drag.The Business Services sector appears reasonably healthy. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 9.4% year over year while sales are touted to rise 4.4% due to higher disposable income and new business initiatives.Let’s take a sneak peek at five major Business Services stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell.

"
118,NLSN,"    You might have missed one of the bigger M&A deals this week, but advertisers and those in ad-tech certainly didnt. Rentrak (RENT) agreed to merge with
"
119,NLSN,"    Chicago based ComScore (SCOR  -  Free Report) and the stocks of both companies launched higher. This spells trouble for another advertising metric firm, Nielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report).
"
120,NLSN,"The Merger
"
121,NLSN,"    Both RENT and SCOR are both Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, and both carry some pretty large forward multiples. RENT is trading for around 125x forward
"
122,NLSN,"    earnings and SCOR carries a forward multiple of more than 85x.
"
123,NLSN,"    The merger calls for SCOR shareholders to end up with 66.5% of the combined company and RENT shareholders to hold 33.5% of the company on a fully diluted
"
124,NLSN,"    basis. The combined company expects the deal to be mildly dilutive to its Non-GAAP EPS in 2016 and accretive in 2017.
"
125,NLSN,"Analyst Actions
"
126,NLSN,"    Following the deal, Needham downgraded shares of RENT to buy from strong buy and lowered their target from $85 to $60. The analyst noted that for every $1
"
127,NLSN,"    in upward move in SCOR, RENT should move higher by 1.15x that amount.
"
128,NLSN,"    Albert Fried upgraded their rating on shares of RENT to Market Perform from Underweight following the transaction. Analysts that were even slightly
"
129,NLSN,"    bearish on the firm before the deal pretty much have to move their rating to neutral as the stock could be pegged to an acquisition price. In this case it
"
130,NLSN,"    is an all stock deal, so there isnt a designated purchase price.
"
131,NLSN,"The 800 Pound Gorilla Nielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) is the powerhouse in the world of advertising metrics. The company has a $16B valuation (SCOR $1.8B RENT $0.8B) and trades at a much more
"
132,NLSN,"    reasonable forward multiple of 17x.
"
133,NLSN,"    So while this deal might not make NLSN change all that much, the winds of change are blowing in the ad tech space. Programmatic Ad Buying is spreading from
"
134,NLSN,"    the digital world to a place that still uses the fax machines for buy orders.
"
135,NLSN,"    The question becomes, which is the best way to play this as an investment?
"
136,NLSN,"The Google Way
"
137,NLSN,"    One of the reasons Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) became a behemoth was that it made its customers their own service agents. The self-serve platform allowed Google to focus on
"
138,NLSN,"    refining the product, and it allowed its customers to buy what and where they wanted. This idea has finally moved to how TV commercials are being
"
139,NLSN,"    purchased.
"
140,NLSN,"TubeMogul (TUBE) is among the very first companies to offer advertisers the ability to buy spots on digital media as well as TV and do so via a
"
141,NLSN,"    programmatic platform. The efficiencies certainly make this an interesting candidate for publishers (TV stations) and advertisers alike.
"
142,NLSN,"    As an investment prospect, TUBE is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is young enough of a company to see sequential revenue growth continuing for several
"
143,NLSN,"    quarters to come. Aggressive growth investors love to see sequential revenue growth as explosive moves generally dont come from companies that are seeing
"
144,NLSN,"    seasonality.

169,NLSN,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) might have forever changed the grocery industry exactly one year ago when the e-commerce giant bought Whole Foods for roughly $14 billion on June 16, 2017. Today, grocery delivery is commonplace across the entire industry.OverviewNielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) and the Food Marketing Institute released their second-ever ""Digitally Engaged Food Shopper"" study earlier this year, which stated that within the next five to seven years 70% of consumers will do at least some grocery shopping online. Furthermore, FMI and Nielsen estimated that people will spend $100 billion year in this budding industry.Amazon’s e-commerce dominance sparked this growth and forced Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and many other grocery players to dive headfirst into e-commerce, delivery, and curbside pick-up.Before we jump into what the individual companies are doing on these vital fronts, let’s take a quick look at their price performances since Amazon bought Whole Foods last year.  Investors will note that Target stock has outperformed some of its peers over the last year, by a pretty wide margin. With that said, Amazon stock has soared nearly 78%, but it operates a much bigger and more diversified business than these grocery and big-box retailers. WalmartIn March, Walmart announced its plan to expand its online grocery delivery option to more than100 metro areas by the end of the year. At the time, the service was only available in six markets.The big-box giant also offers an order online, curbside pickup up service called “Grocery Hero” at 1,000 stores, with the company expected to add that service at 1,000 more locations by end of 2017. Investors should note that Walmart’s first-quarter e-commerce sales surged by 33% in the U.S.TargetTarget also introduced its online ordering, curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” at more than 250 stores last quarter. The company also expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, allowing customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery.  The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its digital sales surge 28% in Q1, on top of a 21% climb in the year-ago period. Target also introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations, which was made possible by its $550 million December 2017 purchase of grocery delivery startup Shipt.CostcoBig-box powerhouse Costco (COST  -  Free Report) launched CostcoGrocery last fall. The service offers two-day delivery for non-perishable food and household supplies to Costco customers nationwide. Meanwhile, the company expanded its same-day delivery service to “most metropolitan” areas through an updated partnership with grocery delivery startup giant Instacart.The company’s most recent quarterly financial results helped demonstrate how well Costco’s online ordering and delivery business has performed. The wholesale retailer’s quarterly revenues popped by 12% to $32.36 billion, with e-commerce comp sales up 36.8%.KrogerGrocery chain Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) recently started its “Restock Kroger” initiative, aimed to accelerate its digital and e-commerce offerings. The company currently offers online ordering and curbside pickup through its ClickList service.Like Costco and many others, including CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Aldi, and Jewel-Osco, Kroger works with Instacart for same-day delivery. It’s unclear exactly how effective Kroger’s new e-commerce and delivery initiatives have been, but its upcoming first quarter might give investors a better idea. The company is expected to report its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, June 21 (also read: Upcoming Earnings to Watch: FDX, KR, DRI).Bottom LineAmazon changed the retail grocery business forever before it even bought Whole Foods. Today, consumers have online delivery and curbside pickup options at nearly every major U.S. chain, with most of the company’s rapidly expanding their same-day delivery offerings on their own or through partnerships.Going forward, don’t be surprised if a company like Costco, which is projected to pull in nearly $140 billion this year, buys grocery delivery superstar Instacart before the company decides to go public. There is no clear winner at the moment, aside from customers around the U.S. who have exponentially more online and grocery delivery options than they did one year ago.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

171,NLSN,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nielsen Holdings Plc (NLSN  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NLSN due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsNielsen Holdings reported first-quarter 2018 net earnings of 20 cents per share, flat with the year-ago quarter.RevenuesReported revenues came in at $1.610 billion, increasing 5.5% year over year. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 2.4%.The increase was driven by continued strength in the company’s Watch segment and growth in emerging markets, partially offset by weakness in the U.S. Buy segment.Revenues by SegmentWatch business revenues were $834 million (52% of total first-quarter revenues), reflecting an increase of 8.5% year over year or 7.1% on a constant-currency basis. The increase came on the back of continued strength in Audience Measurement. Audience Measurement of Video and Text revenues increased 12.0% from the prior-year quarter, driven by ongoing investments and continued client adoption. Marketing Effectiveness revenues increased 24.6% year over year, driven by consistent investment in product portfolio and continued strength in product initiatives.Buy business revenues were $776 million (48% of total revenues), reflecting an increase of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter but a decrease 2.1% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding foreign currency impact, revenues from the Developed market declined 5.2% on a constant-currency basis due to softness in the U.S. market. However, revenues from emerging markets were up 10.1% or 6.1% on a constant-currency basis, driven by coverage expansion and broad product offerings.Operating ResultsReported gross margin was 55.3%, down 140 basis points (bps) from the year-ago period.Nielsen’s operating expenses, namely selling, general and administrative expenses of $493 million, increased 4.2% from the year-ago figure. Therefore, operating margin decreased 50 bps year over year to 12.9%.Adjusted EBITDA was $423 million in the first quarter, increasing 0.7% from the prior-year quarter but decreasing 0.7% on a constant-currency basis.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, Nielsen registered net profit of $72 million or 20 cents per share compared with $71 million or 20 cents in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowNielsen exited the quarter with cash balance of approximately $462 million compared with $656 million in the last quarter.Net debt (gross debt excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $8.18 billion and net debt leverage ratio was 4.04x at the end of the quarter.Cash flow from operations was ($117) million, capex was $128 million and free cash flow was ($245) million in the first quarter.Share RepurchaseThe company repurchased $20 million of shares in the first quarter of 2018. It has a total of $278 million shares remaining under the existing share repurchase program.On Apr 19, 2018, the company approved a $0.01 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.35 per share. The dividend is payable Jun 20 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Jun 6, 2018.OutlookFor full-year 2018, management maintained its guidance. It expects total revenue growth of 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin improvement of approximately 60 bps on a constant-currency basis. Also, free cash flow is expected to be nearly $800 million.However, the company increased its GAAP net income per share to range within $1.50-$1.56, higher than its previous expectation of $1.40-$1.46.Our TakeNielsen Holdings is an information and measurement company, offering media and marketing information on what consumers watch and buy locally.The company's regular investments in innovative technologies bode well for its product portfolio expansion. Recently, Nielsen launched Advanced Audience Forecasting tool that provides forecasts of TV audiences, defined by advanced audience segments to its clients. Further, the company introduced Connected Partner Program, which helps companies to connect their network, discover new connected partners and utilize the measurement data provided by Nielsen.Continued share repurchase reflects Nielsen’s financial strength and commitment toward returning value to its shareholders. However, continued investments in technology and infrastructure could weigh on margins and profitability, going forward.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been six revisions lower for the current quarter.Nielsen Holdings Plc Price and Consensus  Nielsen Holdings Plc Price and Consensus | Nielsen Holdings Plc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, NLSN has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a C.

Notably, NLSN has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.
"
172,NLSN,"In a bid to develop a solution that will help advertisers focus their ads among various individual groups, Nielsen Holdings plc (NLSN  -  Free Report) recently partnered with CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report).The solution will use frame-accurate video recognition technology and will bring Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI) to live linear national broadcast television by leveraging Nielsen Gracenote ACR.With the latest move, both companies are likely to benefit from the emerging concept of addressable advertising which targets ads among individuals based on behavioral and demographic attributes and not only on age and gender. Thus, it will create more value for advertisers as well as viewers.This seems to be a win-win scenario for both companies. We believe Nielsen’s product portfolio will strengthen and client base will increase with the launch of this solution. This will boost the company’s top line.Also, CBS’ advertiser base will improve by providing them insights on household behaviors using Gracenote ACR generated data.Coming to the share price, shares of Nielsen have lost approximately 24.7% in the past 12 months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 27.2%.  Addressable Advertising Holds PromiseThe concept of addressable advertising is gaining traction. Advertisers are focusing their ads on households that have preference for their products instead of showcasing the ad universally. This helps advertisers or brand to strengthen their customer base by improving their advertising effects.According to data from a research firm, eMarketer, advertiser spending on targeted ads is expected to reach $3.04 billion by 2019.Nielsen’s Gracenote is incorporated in several smart TVs and provides data on viewer’s taste behavior. Hence, the company is poised to reap benefits from the growing popularity of addressable advertising meaningful data. Nielsen Holdings Plc Revenue (TTM)  Nielsen Holdings Plc Revenue (TTM) | Nielsen Holdings Plc Quote Strong Product Portfolio & Partnerships — Key CatalystStrategic partnerships have been shaping Nielsen’s growth trajectory over the past few years with the support of its innovative product portfolio.

This partnership will allow the Sinclair Broadcast to deploy Nielsen TV ratings in its business model.Further, the company partnered with Tribune Media Company (TRCO  -  Free Report) for Nielsen TV ratings across Tribune's local television stations and digital subchannel network, Antenna TV.Recently, Nielsen extended its partnership with Dollar General, post which, the latter will increase the use of Nielsen's insights and solutions. This will benefit the Buy segment of the company.Additionally, the latest extension of the multi-year agreement between Nielsen and Del Monte Foods exhibits the strength of the company’s product portfolio which provides data and insights.Currently, Nielsen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which shows its potential to perform well in future with its expanding product portfolio and strengthening partnerships.

"
173,NLSN,"Increased digitization, mobile adoption, international expansion and better analytics are key drivers.
"
174,NLSN,"Ecommerce discussions often exclude online travel because this segment is relatively more mature with a lot of the growth coming from international expansion and continued to shift from offline to online channels. Moreover, the market is highly fragmented with just a few big players in a position to make a difference.
"
175,NLSN,"But the many small players mean that there is stiff competition and rapid innovation that also drives up their costs. This in turn makes it difficult for them to operate, increasingly driving them toward acquisitions in order to take their technology and expertise to scale.
"
176,NLSN,"The main drivers of the market are increased digitization, mobile adoption and international expansion. The stronger economy and higher spending levels provide the perfect backdrop for growth, but currency will remain a headwind this year.Travel
"
177,NLSN,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. In 2014, visitor volume increased 7%, well over the expected range of 3.7-4.2% a year from 2013 to 2017. Visits from 16 of the top 20 countries grew, of which 8 grew double-digits.
"
178,NLSN,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest. According to the BEA, the industry spending grew 2.0% in the first quarter of 2015, a deceleration from 4.9% growth in the previous quarter although it compared favorably with the real GDP decline of 0.7%.
"
179,NLSN,"Transportation-related commodities and food services & drinking places were the points of weakness, growing just 1.9% and 2%, respectively in the last quarter. Spending on passenger air transportation improved to 3.9%. Traveler accommodation also grew. Overall pricing weakened sequentially. 
"
180,NLSN,"According to the TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), stronger average daily rates (ADRs) will drive first-quarter and full-year 2015 revenues in North America. Based on bookings and commitments up to the report date (Jan 28), the research firm sees a 4.5% increase in ADRs offsetting a 0.2% decline in occupancy. ADRs for the full year are expected to increase 4.5% with occupancy increasing 2.8%.
"
181,NLSN,"According to the TravelClick North American Distribution Review for the first quarter, digital channels comprising OTAs, hotel websites and GDS continued to gain in popularity. The OTA channel grew 15.1% from a year ago, hotel websites grew 7.1% and GDS 1.1%. Direct-to-hotel and CRO declined 8.4% and 6.1%, respectively.
"
182,NLSN,"Based on current booking trends, growth projections for the seasonally strong second and third quarters are a respective 4.3% and 5.9%.
"
183,NLSN,"But with rapid technology-driven international expansion, collaborations and acquisitions/consolidations, global travel trends have become an important consideration for domestic operators. As a result, the rising middle class, increased digital sophistication and Internet connectivity in emerging high-growth markets are now important drivers.
"
184,NLSN,"STR Global data for May 2015 shows that while occupancy is increasing across regions, this is coming at the cost of prices in emerging regions. Europe on the other hand is seeing currency headwinds while in the Americas the increased demand is being absorbed in higher prices.
"
185,NLSN,"eMarketer is not very optimistic about global digital travel sales growth. According to the research firm, this is a more mature segment, so growth rates are decelerating compared to retail ecommerce where they are growing faster. As a result, it expects travel’s 34.1% share of U.S. ecommerce sales in 2013 to drop to 26.2% by 2018.
"
186,NLSN,"However, mobile travel sales are expected to increase share of total mcommerce sales from 31.1% in 2014 to 32.8% in 2018. Overall, desktop travel sales will see continued declines over the forecast period with mobile travel sales decelerating but continuing to grow at double-digit rates.
"
187,NLSN,"Further, Mexico, India, Spain, Italy and Norway are expected to have the highest shares of digital travel sales in the next five years, with Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Italy being the fastest growers.
"
188,NLSN,"A recent PhoCusWright report mentions the top seven technology trends influencing the travel market. Accordingly, it appears that video is essential to draw customers and content marketing, guides, travel information and ROI tracking can all benefit from it.
"
189,NLSN,"Trend two was with respect to search engines. The report says that Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) algorithms are now favoring site design rather than keywords, making SEO somewhat redundant. So site design and navigability are becoming essential to capture search traffic. Social media has increased the availability of reviews, so companies are increasing focus on the overall travel experience.
"
190,NLSN,"Trend three is increasing mobile usage, which the report says will account for 27% of online travel revenue by 2015.
"
191,NLSN,"The fourth trend is in wearables, with Virgin Mobile and a tourism board in Florida already using Google Glass effectively for customer interaction and advertising, respectively. Using big data analytics and social media marketing are the sixth and seventh major trends, respectively.  
"
192,NLSN,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and the others a part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline and Expedia. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International, MakeMyTrip and Qunar, which floated its IPO this year.
"
193,NLSN,"TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) is also leveraging its strength in referrals to enter the crowded travel booking space.Digital Advertising
"
194,NLSN,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, such that the discussion has shifted to its most effective channel, which is mobile. eMarketer estimates that while the total digital ad market will grow 47.6% from 2013 to 2017, mobile will grow 271.0%, with desktop declining 17.5%.
"
195,NLSN,"Total growth rates are expected to continue declining: 10.3% in 2015, 9.2% in 2016 and 7.1% in 2017. Retail, financial services, consumer packaged goods (CPG) and travel in that order, are expected to be the growth drivers. The mobile platform will remain particularly strong, growing 41.8% in 2015, 33.1% in 2016 and 26.0% in 2017. Spending on mobile ads is expected to increase as a percentage of total spending on digital as well as total media ads in each of the years.

196,NLSN,"The underlying drivers of growth are the continued increase in the number of netizens, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
197,NLSN,"But the market is getting increasingly competitive and pushing players to investment and innovation. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) hurts pricing at market leader Google and rivals Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report).
"
198,NLSN,"Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) large and growing user base and trove of personal data is driving prices on the platform. A lot of other networking companies, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pintertest are also entering the digital advertising space.
"
199,NLSN,"International expansion (where rates are lower) and transition to mobile (where conversion tends to be lower) are near-term negatives for these players.
"
200,NLSN,"Digital advertising spend continues to move beyond search to social networks and content sites like Facebook, Netflix and Pandora, so the analytics side has been racing to catch up. Most of these players are acquiring or developing their own analytics capabilities, but content providers still have a preference for third-party solutions from companies like Nielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report), comScore and WPP.
"
201,NLSN,"To Begin With
"
202,NLSN,"Business services sector can be defined as ancillary services provided by companies to other players in the market. Hence, the core business of one company can be a business service for another.
"
203,NLSN,"Operating efficiencies demand companies to focus on functions and activities that are close to their core competence. This not only helps them to reap the benefits of scale economies in those core functions, but also improves their competitive positioning. Importantly, this dynamic opens the door to business services companies to provide those services.
"
204,NLSN,"The business service sector is highly fragmented, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. As per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to the overall revenue of this sector. However, given its unique nature, Zacks has classified the group as one of 16 sectors (the S&P’s official GIC classification has only 10 sectors where business services are grouped within the ‘Industrials’ sector).Stand-Alone Zacks Sector – Zacks Industry Rank
"
205,NLSN,"This industry covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenue of about $620 billion, though many companies mentioned below do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry.
"
206,NLSN,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries (at the medium or M-level) and 260+ industries at the expanded or X-level. We rank all 260+ X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
207,NLSN,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #177 and higher) is negative. The outlook of the middle one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #88 to #176) is therefore neutral.
"
208,NLSN,"Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks, which is at the core of our Industry Rank, has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (1 to 3 months). We have 7 X-level industries within the Business Services sector, namely, Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services, Business Services, Consulting, Financial Transaction Services, Outsourcing, Staffing, and Waste Removal Services.
"
209,NLSN,"Outsourcing at Zacks Industry Rank #38, Consulting industry at #36, Auction/Valuation at #46 and Financial Transaction Services industry at #84 currently rank among the top 1/3rd of all Zacks industries and have a positive outlook. Staffing at #93 and Business Services at #105 have a neutral outlook. Business Information Services at #206 and Waste Removal at #218 have clear negative outlook. This distribution of industry ranks within the sector show that the overall bias for the sector is positive to neutral.Earnings Review
"
210,NLSN,"With almost 95% of the companies under the Business Service sector having reported their third quarter results, let’s take a look at how things shaped up for the sector.
"
211,NLSN,"Earnings for the business sector grew 8.6% in the third quarter faring better than the overall 4.6% growth for the S&P 500 as a whole. The earnings growth pace, however, moved south compared with 9.9% growth in the second quarter.
"
212,NLSN,"Revenues showed an improvement of 3.9% faring much better than the S&P 500’s year-over-year average of 2.9%. Revenue growth also improved sequentially.
"
213,NLSN,"In terms of surprises, the sector’s performance was stronger than the broader market, with 84.2% of Business Services companies beating earnings expectations, compared to the ‘beat ratio’ of 65.7% for the S&P 500.
"
214,NLSN,"Looking ahead at the fourth quarter, earnings are expected to improve 15.2% compared with 9.5% for the broader market. Revenue growth is expected at 3.6% for the sector compared with a minimal improvement of 0.3% for the S&P 500.

The sector offers immense employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning. Business reports indicate that the two most populated countries, China and India, are together expected to create 300 million employment opportunities in the global job market by 2030.Global Reach: Companies can reach their consumers or prospective buyers across the world when Advertising & Market Services and Direct Marketers act on behalf of these in informing consumers about new products or added features in existing products. Thus, these service providers help in widening a company’s customer base and/or maintaining a better retention ratio. It also opens the door to international trade.Cost Effective: All business operators prefer to minimize costs of operation and maximize margins. This sector offers cost effectiveness to the companies that opt for their services which would otherwise be far more expensive.
"
216,NLSN,"With specialized services, these providers reduce the operational cost and in turn the overall costs of companies. Notably, an increased number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for the service providers. This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies.Specialized Service: The industry offers specialized services based on the latest technologies. This is evident for the security and consulting services. To safeguard data, companies are compelled to engage security service providers, which are required to have the latest and most efficient technologies in place to persuade their clients and win business contracts.
"
217,NLSN,"Also, with increasing mergers and acquisitions across the globe, the prospects for legal service providers look good. Consulting service is another wing of this industry that is fast gaining traction.
"
218,NLSN,"Business complexities are on the rise, and companies are opting for expert advice before entering into any new venture rather than risking losses due to trial and error. Hence, this service sector also looks promising as it is indispensable for companies that are fighting to survive in a competitive market.CHALLENGESGrowth Tied to Health of Economy: One of the major factors that could impact the growth of the service sector is the overall health of the economy. The companies in the business service sector generate revenues by providing essential services to other companies.
"
219,NLSN,"Spending by companies to avail services might reduce drastically if the pace of economic growth is slower than the expected level. This would naturally dampen the business of the service providers and affect their fundamentals.Requires Continuous Spending for Research and Development: Importantly, consulting service providers need to remain abreast with the latest technologies through continuous spending on research and development. The performance of these providers can be hampered if they do not acclimatize or adopt new services to account for the ongoing developments.Training, Maintaining Skilled Workforce: Since skilled workers are always in demand, there remains a possibility of a high turnover rate within the sector. The training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs, thereby affecting margins. This sector needs to have a more skilled workforce to take advantage of technology that develops at a relatively rapid pace.Competition: Maintaining or increasing market share remain challenging for business service providers. As discussed earlier, the main business of one company can be a business service for another; hence target customers for both may be the same at times.
"
220,NLSN,"Therefore, a business service provider is always required to be adequately equipped to win over customer demand. While larger providers bank on the broader variety of their service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures, the relatively smaller players compete in the industry backed by their specialized services.To Conclude
"
221,NLSN,"The dearth of skilled labor in the business services sector can have an impact on future growth possibilities. Non-availability of quality workforce at a reasonable rate might increase overall operational costs.
"
222,NLSN,"Mergers and acquisitions play a key role in not only strengthening a company’s foothold by grabbing more market share but also in edging out competition. In the last reported quarter, Healthcare Services Group, Inc. (HCSG  -  Free Report) inked an asset purchase agreement with Platinum Health Services, LLC to acquire substantially all of its operating assets. Cardtronics USA, Inc., wholly owned subsidiary of Cardtronics, Inc. (CATM) acquired ATM business assets from Chandler, AZ-based CGI, Inc. or CGI Direct ATM, adding approximately 1,000 merchant-owned ATMs to its nationwide U.S. fleet.
"
223,NLSN,"Avis Budget Group, Inc. (CAR) acquired Payless Car Rental, the sixth largest car rental company in North America, for approximately $50 million in cash. The addition of the Payless brand will give Avis Budget Group a strong position in the fast-growing deep-value segment of the car rental industry. Furmanite Corp. (FRM), agreed to acquire certain professional service assets of ENGlobal Corporation (TENG). Further, Mac-Gray Corp. (TUC) agreed to be acquired by CSC ServiceWorks, Inc. for $524 million.
"
224,NLSN,"However, due to the highly fragmented nature of the industry, it is difficult to set a distinct trend or predict a concrete future for it. The expected annual compounded growth rate for this sector is 4% from 2010 to 2015.
"
225,NLSN,"According to the report released by Staffing Industry Analysts, the staffing industry is expected to grow in mid-single digits in 2013 and 2014, declining from growth of 7% in 2012 and 13% in 2011.
"
226,NLSN,"The sector might also attract new investors as nearly one-third of the companies under our coverage in the business service industry share profits with their shareholders via dividend payments. Dividend payments help in retaining stockholders confidence in the company. Dividend yield ranges from 1.16% at Core-Mark Holding Company to 7.42% at National Research Corp. (NRCIB). Notably, almost every company’s dividend yield betters the industry average.
"
227,NLSN,"With an ever-increasing population and economic turmoil being a constant drag, generating employment is a burning issue. This sector, being labor intensive, involves lower capital investments and confidently addresses this problem. The emerging economies such as India and China are also becoming important destinations for the business service sectors. On the flip side, the same poses challenges to employment growth in developed economies.
"
228,NLSN,"Nevertheless, we can safely say that despite all the hurdles, this industry is crucial for business operations going forward.
