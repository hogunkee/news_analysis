1,VRSN,"The Dow Jones industrial average stood head and shoulders above other key indexes at midday on Thursday, even after a mild pullback in early-afternoon trade.At 1:15 p.m. ET, the Dow gained 0.7% after rising more than 1% thanks to early two-point gains from at least 10 of the Dow's 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and McDonald's (MCD).Home Depot and McDonald's are in base-building phase, and a well-built base could give investors a chance to buy at a key moment of market strength.Low weekly jobless claims helped sustain confidence in the U.S. economy, and comments by White House economic advisor Peter Navarro, broadcast on CNBC, apparently helped relieve anxiety over the potential for a major trade war.Bullishness among market pundits polled each week by Investors Intelligence, meanwhile, jumped this week to 54.9%, but optimism is not excessive. In mid-January, ahead of the early-February market sell-off, the bulls ratio reached as high as 66.7%.The Nasdaq composite erased an early-morning loss of 0.3% to turn more than 0.2% higher before slumping to the breakeven point. Overall, the intraday swing is light, though. The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1%. Discount and variety retail, hospital, mining equipment, ethical drug and truck transport firms paced the upside. Volume is running slightly lower vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.The Dow transports is now up just 0.4% after being up as much as 0.7%.Despite the indexes' gains, breadth was slightly dour. Falling stocks beat gainers by more than 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by fewer than 200 issues on the Nasdaq.Home Depot is trying to bottom out after falling more than 15% below a 207.60 all-time high. The do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me home improvement products chain had rallied 28% following a September breakout from a solid flat base with a 160.96 buy point.Home Depot sports a decent 87 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, boosted by a strong 92 EPS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99.McDonald's, which has dropped 18% from its all-time peak of 178.70, rallied nearly 2% and is trying to regain its critical 200-day moving average. The fast-food chain's 50-day line has been sloping lower for more than five weeks, a negative sign.When high-quality stocks rally 20% to 25% from a proper buy point, it's an excellent idea in terms of portfolio management rules to take at least partial profits. IBD research has found that many leading stocks will top out and begin a serious correction after rising 20% to 40% past a breakout point.Software remains an important growth theme in the stock market today. While Palo Alto Networks (PANW), a big stock market winner in 2015-16 and former Leaderboard stock, has shown renewed strength, its group peer VeriSign (VRSN) is also acting well.The former is aiming for a 14th gain in 15 sessions; at 189.30, the large-cap network security leader has risen nearly 21% from a base breakout at 156.95. The latter rose nearly 2% to 125.35 in volume running double its usual levels and has climbed nearly 6% past a 118.38 entry in an 11-week flat base.Four highly dynamic and fast-growing companies in the business software space maintain a position currently within Leaderboard.The Dow transports rallied 0.3% as Covenant Transport (CVTI) launched a breakout, gapping up at the open and rising nearly 18% to 32 in huge turnover. That move catapulted the trucking services firm past a 30.71 proper buy point in a five-month base.The 5% buy zone extends up to 32.24. Buying more than 5% past a proper buy point can hand a new investor the added risk of being shuffled out of the stock with a fast loss of 7%-8% during a normal pullback to or even slightly below the breakout price.The golden rule of investing is to cut losses short, even if a stock has a history of outperforming. You don't want to get caught with a stock that has finally topped after a huge price run.IBD's research on big stock market winners over the past century has found that when a true market leader breaks out, it rarely falls 7% to 8% below the correct buy point. But after a 10% or 15% move up or more, it's not uncommon for the stock to dip back and test holders' resolve. So if an investorThe base built by Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Covenant doesn't have the look of a well-formed cup-with-handle or a double-bottom, but the months long base was built on top of an even longer, deeper consolidation. The chart has elements of base on base patterns, which can be very bullish.The company has notched earnings gains of 56% and 52% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters as revenue rose 9% and 6%. The top-line growth is an improvement from declines and much smaller increases in the prior six quarters.RELATED:Hot New IPO Stocks: Who Are The Next Home Depot, AOL, Yahoo, Cisco?How To Find The Correct Buy Point In Bullish Chart PatternsInside The Big Picture: Big Banks Crushed Wall Street 10 Years Ago; Can It Happen Again?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWho Are The Global Stock Leaders?

The Nasdaq composite also climbed 0.3%, its fifth straight advance, to a record close, less than nine points below its all-time high set last week. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 did set an intraday best Thursday. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.8%, retaking its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco Systems is trading close to a proper entry point. The latest Investing Action Plan highlights five more Dow stocks near buy range that hail from a variety of industry sectors.Several cybersecurity plays have been showing positive action, with five crafting bases or consolidations worth watching.Cisco Systems is a networking giant, with the bulk of its revenue still hailing from routers, switches and other hardware. But Cisco is moving into software and services, including network security. For its latest quarter, security revenue rose 14% to $528 million, the best growth of any segment, while total sales dipped 2% to $11.6 billion.Cisco, which has been trading tightly, is working on a flat base, needing one more day to make it a valid pattern with a potential buy point of 34.63. Cisco shares were unchanged at 33.74 on Thursday.Symantec has made some sizable acquisitions over the past year, beefing up key areas as it competes with Cisco, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and others. Earnings growth has revived, fueling the stock.Symantec shares broke out of a flat base on Jan. 13, continuing to advance on its earnings report in early February and peaking at a record-high 31.10 on March 13. Symantec has traded in a narrow range for nearly three weeks. Like Cisco, Symantec needs one more day to complete a three-weeks-tight pattern, which would have a 31.20 buy point.Fortinet tried to clear a 38.43 flat base entry on Thursday, hitting 38.56 intraday — the highest since October 2015 — before reversing lower to close at 37.85. The stock had found support at its rising 50-day line on Monday.Fortinet is on IBD's Leaderboard, a premium service that provides annotated charts of a careful selection of growth plays and other stocks that are at or near buy points or other actionable areas.VeriSign is a leading domain name registration company, along with having network security offerings. Profit and revenue growth have slowed modestly in the past two quarters, with analysts expecting further EPS slowing in the current quarter.But shares, which have been consolidating for the past 11 months, have been steadily rising in 2017. The stock has formed a handle with an 88.18 buy point.Qualys rose as high as 38.38 on Thursday, a five-month high and above a 37.62 buy point. But the stock pared its gain to 1.8%, at 37.60, just below that entry. Much like Fortinet (and the broader market), Qualys found support at its 50-day line on Monday.Asian trading was mixed in Friday intraday trading, with Japan's Nikkei and China's Shanghai composite up modestly and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lower.A Chinese manufacturing index rose in March to the highest level in nearly five years.RELATED:Stocks Aren't Waiting For Trump To Make America GreatAcquisitions Bolster Symantec Vs.

10,VRSN,"Stocks remained mixed but rebounded off intraday lows by lunchtime in New York on Friday amid another flurry of quarterly earnings reports. Microsoft (MSFT) was a star performer, bursting past a 58.80 flat-base buy point after roasting Wall Street's profit target.The stock gapped up at the open and rose nearly 5% to 59.90. Volume was running more than six times normal. In late-morning trade, Microsoft saw 43 million shares change hands, nearly double its average daily turnover of 22.6 million shares.Microsoft's strength, and outperformance of security-software stocks, helped the Nasdaq erase opening losses to rise nearly 0.3% higher. But the Dow Jones industrial average was still off nearly 0.2%, hurt by sharp declines by Travelers (TRV),  IBM (IBM), and 3M (MMM). Earlier in the week, Travelers and IBM reported falling third-quarter profits.The S&P 500 was down less than 0.2% after falling 0.5% in the early going. Tobacco, media, oil royalty trust, coal and super regional banks paced the upside; apparel, medical software and diversified medical firms fell the hardest.Volume was running slightly lower on the Nasdaq but sharply higher on the NYSE.Microsoft reported a 9% rise in fiscal first-quarter earnings to 76 cents a share, breezing past the Wall Street 68-cent consensus estimate to achieve profit growth for a second quarter in a row as revenue edged slightly up to $20.45 billion, up from $20.38 billion a year ago.Net margin improved to a record 29.3% vs. 27.8%.In July, Microsoft broke out of a nearly three-month base with a 56.87 buy point. While the stock made limited progress, gaining just 3%, it did not trigger any sell signals. Today, the stock's RS line spiked higher, a sign of outperformance vs. the S&P 500.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to C+, indicating institutions are on net accumulating shares in the mega-cap name. Watch to see if its middling 65 RS Rating improves quickly.The company credited strength in cloud offerings, which include Azure and Office 365. Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin noted Microsoft is seeing growth in new services such as Service Fabric, microservices and serverless infrastructure.Elsewhere in the stock market today,  VeriSign (VRSN) gained more than 6% to 81.42, briefly piercing its 200-day line in surging trade. The expert in domain names is slated to report results on Oct. 27 after the close. The Street sees Q3 profit rising 12% to 87 cents a share. VeriSign has notched EPS gains of 11% to 23% in each of the prior four quarters.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Give Thumbs Up On Microsoft

11,VRSN,"Innovation seems fun and easy when you bat around ideas with friends. But consider the advantages of innovating with diverse teams who don't know each other well:Creative sparks fly. A diverse mix of people might engage in a livelier debate. That can promote breakthrough thinking.A former executive at VeriSign (VRSN), Mack McKelvey led rapid response teams to decide whether to pounce on business opportunities. Each group varied in age, gender and race.""I learned the less homogeneous your team is, the better it is,"" said McKelvey, now a partner at the Chameleon Collective, a marketing firm. ""With diverse teams, you don't have a lot of agreement out of the gate. That's good. Disagreement fuels better discussions that lead to more innovation.""Assumptions carry less weight. When you gather a well-worn team of like-minded people, they might finish each other's sentences. If they're used to working together, they may assume they know what their colleagues are trying to say.But with diverse groups, all bets are off. Their lack of a common history can spur fresher, bolder insights.""On a homogeneous team, you can say, 'Yeah, we've tried that before and it doesn't work,'"" McKelvey said. ""Diverse teams are not OK with quick, easy, yes-or-no answers. They don't have shared assumptions, so there's more thought and discipline involved.""People communicate more freely. Brainstorming with people from wide-ranging backgrounds leads to more open communication. Participants tend to listen attentively and learn new ways of seeing the world.When McKelvey set up her marketing firm last year, she chose an advisory board with an emphasis on diversity. She recruited five women and four men, and they came from different countries and industries.""I wanted to find different styles,"" she said. ""That enables everyone to improve communication rather than just protect their own turf. With diversity, you don't have just one approach. Because everyone is processing things differently, you get an interesting blend of ideas that leads to innovation.""Everyone gets heard. In a room that lacks diversity, participants tend to fall into predictable patterns. The most opinionated individuals can dominate the proceedings.In diverse groups, it's less likely that one or two vocal personalities will drown out everyone else. That's because people might present their best selves to make a better impression with a wider cross-section of colleagues.When Angie McArthur leads training sessions for innovators, she emphasizes the importance of creating a vibrant environment where everyone contributes. In one of her exercises, participants jot their ideas on sticky notes and post them on a central bulletin board for everyone to see.""It shakes things up and prevents habitual thinking,"" said McArthur, acting chief executive of Professional Thinking Partners in Park City, Utah. ""It gets people moving around, and everyone has a voice.""Fresh perspectives emerge. When you convene a group of people with divergent backgrounds and outlooks, you tap a broader range of experience and expertise. Just make sure everyone feels comfortable chiming in.""You want them to show up with wild and crazy ideas with no editing of their thoughts,"" said McArthur, co-author of ""Collaborative Intelligence."" ""Give them permission to be raw.""Newbies thrive. Ideally, your team should be both diverse and fairly new to the topic at hand. That maximizes the odds that the group will gel and make breakthroughs.""It's good if the diverse group has little or no experience with the topic,"" said Braden Kelley, author of ""Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire."" He suggests assembling a mix of participants from outside your industry who can bring openness and free-flowing creativity.Related:Inspired Solutions Require Mental Sweat; Try Creative CogitationLeap Creativity Hurdles And Brainstorm Creative Ideas

12,VRSN,"FireEye (FEYE) curbed its loss expectations for 2016 by a nickel at the midpoint of its guidance range as the cybersecurity firm slashed its capital expenditures view by $15 million, but its shares still fell.FireEye stock was down 2.5%, near 18, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, after shares had risen for nine straight trading days. Shares edged up last week during the cybersecurity RSA Conference in San Francisco.At the conference, FireEye announced a partnership with agent-less vendor ForeScout Technologies and unveiled an endpoint exploit-protection product. And its $275 million iSight Partners acquisition is already bearing fruit, FireEye executives told IBD.Tuesday, FireEye cut its 2016 capital expenditures view to $35 million vs. its earlier guidance for $50 million. FireEye sees $1.20 to $1.27 losses per share ex items, trimming earlier views for $1.25 to $1.32.FireEye reiterated sales guidance for $815 million to $845 million, which would be up 33% vs. 2015.

13,VRSN,"It isn't just gold and gold mining stocks that are glittering on the ETF investing scene. Small caps have shown glimmers of a rebound too.Smaller companies, which tend to magnify the S&P 500's moves, benefited from the recent bullish turn in investor sentiment. However, it may be a little too early to call a big recovery for this asset class that's little-loved lately, say investing experts.""I'm not sure we're out of the woods yet from a broad index standpoint,"" says Simeon Hyman, head of investment strategy for ETF firm ProShares.Small-cap companies are a riskier bet on the market. They may have puny balance sheets or iffy prospects. In 2016's choppy market, ETF investors have dumped them for the safety of large-cap names.Investors yanked $927.7 million from iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), the bellwether small-cap ETF, in January.However, IWM has paced the broader stock market as it has rallied in the past two weeks. The ETF briefly regained its 50-day line Monday for the first time since early December, before reversing on the stock market today.A slew of its quality holdings have started to emerge from the downtrend in the most bullish way possible -- gap-ups. Among the breakouts: Stamps.com (STMP), a provider of electronic postage services that has grown sales 20% annually for the past three years, Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH).Each leapt over buy points last week.Andy Kapyrin, director of research at New Jersey-based RegentAtlantic Capital, has watched the bounce-back for small caps with interest. But for now, he's waiting in the wings.Kapyrin is wary of small caps' underperformance, not just so far this year but over longer periods of time. He also finds their valuations unattractive. Plus, he thinks they run a bigger risk than more stable large-cap peers in a wobbling global economy.""They might be a better buying opportunity sometime in the future,"" Kapyrin said, adding that his company has a 50% underweight to small caps in its portfolio.Still, Kapyrin describes small caps as ""a great example of a part of the investment universe where you can look further afield than cap-weighted indices"" for successful investing.Smaller companies tend not to be well-researched. Picking stocks one at a time could be a chore. With alternatively weighted ETFs, investors may get to buy quality stocks without overpaying for names that have run up in price, Kapyrin said.He likes Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company (FNDA). The relatively young ETF is down 5% year to date through Feb. 26, vs. an 8% fall for IWM. It has also held up better than its older peer over the past two years.FNDA selects and weights stocks based on fundamental measures such as adjusted sales, retained cash flow and dividends. Its top three holdings out of 873 stocks are First Solar (FSLR), Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) and Verisign (VRSN), at about 0.3% of assets each.ETF investors can also look beyond large caps for quality by focusing on dividend-growing companies.ProShares Russell 2000 Dividend Growers (SMDV) boils down the 2000 stocks in the underlying index to 56 high-quality names.Hyman compared small-cap investing to hunting for a needle in a haystack. ""A lot of hands-on work as an old-school stock picker may not be as effective (as SMDV) in picking out these names,"" Hyman said.He describes dividend growth as ""a signal that is telling you that there is an opportunity for the stocks to outperform.""Small-cap dividend growers enjoy robust balance sheets and favorable industry dynamics, as well as a stronger ability to withstand market turmoil, despite their size, Hyman told IBD in a phone call.SMDV invests in companies that have grown dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.SMDV launched in December 2015. It's up 4% year to date.

"
48,VRSN,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is expected late Wednesday to report triple-digit earnings growth for the second consecutive quarter, but revenue growth is forecast to hit record deceleration.For its fiscal Q4 2015, the consensus of 34 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Palo Alto Networks pulling in 25 cents earnings per share ex items, up 127% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is forecast to increase 44% up to $256.25 million.While still robust, the revenue increase would be Palo Alto Networks' smallest percentage gain since the company's IPO in December 2010. Over the past year, the Silicon Valley firm has posted revenue growth above the 50%-mark every quarter.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks has handily beat consensus earnings and revenue estimates every quarter this year.Wall Street's Q4 forecast mostly mirrored the company's. During its Q3 earnings conference call, Palo Alto Networks guided to between 24 and 25 cents non-GAAP EPS on $252 million to $256 million in revenue.CEO Mark McLaughlin expressed revenue optimism during a recent company sales event, Wells Fargo analyst Gray Powell wrote in a research report.McLaughlin claimed revenue would breach $2 billion over the next two years, Powell wrote.The growth will happen organically, McLaughlin said. But, Powell points out, analysts don't see Palo Alto Networks nearing the $2 billion line. For the year, the consensus models $900.6 million in revenue.""PANW's unofficial target is some 20% above current Street forecasts and implies 40% per year growth vs. the Street (estimate) at 29% for the next two years,"" Powell wrote.Powell acknowledged the comments were likely aspirational, but ""we view the fact they were made just three weeks after the close of FQ4 '15 as an indication that current trends remain strong.""The company's position on Wall Street hasn't been strong recently, however. Palo Alto Networks stock has declined 18% over the past six weeks vs. the Nasdaq drop of 8%.Powell saw the silver lining.""We think this creates a compelling entry point into a high quality/high growth security company that benefits from favorable secular trends,"" he wrote.Palo Alto Networks' marketing efforts have paid off, Powell wrote. Currently, the marketing focus is on endpoint software Traps, the next generation firewall and WildFire, a cloud-based malware analysis machine, he wrote.Powell maintained his outperform rating on Palo Alto Networks stock.Palo Alto Networks closed up fractionally Friday at 162.39. With the market in a correction, Palo Alto stock dropped 3.3% for the week after hitting a four-month low at 140.39 on Aug. 24.The same day, IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group fell 3.4%, hitting a seven-month low.Palo Alto Networks leads the group with a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

192,VRSN,"With the Q2 earnings cycle in full swing, a number of tech companies are slated to report their quarterly numbers over the next few days. So far, the earnings scenario for the overall sector has been pretty impressive.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, 37% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index has already reported, as of Jul 25. According to the article, approximately 90.9% of the companies delivered positive earnings surprises, while 81.8% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies are up 13.2% from the same period last year, while revenues increased 11.1%.Technology is one of the three sectors contributing significantly to second-quarter earnings. The other two are Finance and Energy. Technology giants such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report quarterly numbers this week.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as on management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s see what’s in store for these tech stocks, all of which are expected to release quarterly numbers on Jul 27.Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report) is likely to beat second-quarter 2017 expectations as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +2.9%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, as per our proven model, a company needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or at least 3 (Hold) to deliver an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 69 cents. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.3%.

193,VRSN,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 86 cents that were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprise track record for the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.80%.Revenues increased 2.4% year over year to $288.6 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.6 million.We believe increasing domain name registrations and strong demand for VeriSign’s cyber security products, following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya, are key growth drivers.Cyber security companies like VeriSign are doing well because of increasing instances of cybercrimes. Its shares have massively outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock returned 30.1%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names are likely to drive VeriSign’s top line.According to the company’s latest “The Domain Name Industry Brief”, domain name registrations across all top-level domains (TLDs) have signaled a positive trend, with 1.3 million domain name registrations being added in the first quarter, an increase of 0.4% sequentially and 3.7% year over year. Thus, an increase in domain name registrations coupled with price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will drive revenues in our view.The company is also benefiting from strong gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs, investments in intellectual properties as well as growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. It has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space as well.Moreover, the divestiture of iDefense Security Intelligence Services has helped the company to focus on core operations, which will have a positive impact on results.Going by the sequential decline trend in marketing expenses over the last few quarters, we expect it to remain muted in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Notably, management plans to defer marketing spend to the latter half of the year.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization is a concern.VeriSign, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  VeriSign, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that VeriSign is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: VeriSign’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at earnings of 91 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: VeriSign’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

194,VRSN,"Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price. Notably, earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time.But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price. Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement.Spot the OutperformersBasically, earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be referred to as earnings acceleration.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven’t caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. On the other hand, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.The Winning StrategyLet’s look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods’ growth rates.EPS % Projected Growth (Q1)/(Q0) greater than EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1): The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1).EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2): The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2).EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-2)/(Q-3): The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters:Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks.Average 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,889 stocks to only ten. Here are the top four stocks.Verisign, Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is a provider of domain name registry services and Internet security.

200,VRSN,"The technology sector has lately been spooked by a spate of negative news from some of its key companies. Among the worst hit were FANG stocks as Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data scandal raised concerns over stringent regulations for the social media space, and a series of allegations from Donald Trump via Twitter on its business practices spurred Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) sell-off.The attack from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM  -  Free Report) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) added to the latest chaos. Taiwan Semiconductor warned of waning mobile demand for the second quarter and thus reduced its sales growth target for this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year.Notably, TSM is Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) biggest supplier and the negative news has taken a toll on shares of the technology giant. Apple shed $60 billion in two days following the news. Several global chipmakers also lost market value, including Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report).While a number of these headwinds have spread negative sentiments in the space, the rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology and solid corporate earnings are expected to fuel growth. In particular, Q1 earnings from 29.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are up 36.3% on 13.7% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating on earnings and 85.7% exceeding top-line estimates. Overall, earnings and revenues for Q1 are expected to grow 22.6% and 11.9%, respectively.Given the optimism, a number of stocks in the sector have seen their Rank surging to the top-most rung in a couple of days. These are also backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others. Any of these could be a compelling choice to beat the ongoing tech turmoil and make for great picks this earnings season.

201,VRSN,"The Q1 earnings cycle is in full swing, with a number of tech companies, including Facebook and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), slated to report their quarterly numbers this week.According to the Earnings Preview dated Apr 20, technology, along with the finance sector, will bring in more than 40% of the S&P 500 index’s total earnings this year. Per the report, Q1 total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 20.9% on 11.5% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from the rising demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.The sector is also poised to benefit from President Trump’s pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure. Furthermore, Gartner’s latest prediction on IT spending bodes well for the sector. The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to increase 6.2% year over year to $3.74 trillion this year, breaking the earlier highest ever mark of $3.71 trillion in 2014.Not All Companies Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all firms in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment, as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company might perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that the chance of beating earnings estimates is high when a stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s see what’s in store for these four tech stocks, all of which are expected to release quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), a broad-based technology provider, is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company is likely to beat estimates as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.90%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s revenues is pegged at $25.71 billion, representing a 9.1% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 85 cents, reflecting an increase of 16.4% from the year-ago reported figure.The company’s Azure Cloud Platform is expected to have majorly contributed to its growth. In the last few years, Microsoft has strengthened its position in the public cloud-service space through acquisitions and data-center expansions. Notably, revenues from Azure were up a whopping 98% in the fiscal second quarter, on a constant-currency basis. This trend is likely to have continued into the to-be-reported quarter as well. Additionally, strong adoption of Office 365 and Windows 10 is anticipated to have driven the fiscal third-quarter revenues. (Read more: Microsoft's Q3 Earnings to Benefit from Azure Growth)The world’s largest semiconductor company, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results. The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.74%.Intel’s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum, as investors have become increasingly concerned with this chipmaker’s competition. Of late, the company has been sensing pressure from the likes of NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Avanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report). Nvidia’s AI processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment.However, we anticipate the company’s impressive growth at the data-center group segment to have cushioned its top- and bottom-line performance in the quarter. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment’s growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices increases, along with the rise of AI and cloud computing, Intel’s data-center business will expand. (Read: Intel to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Intel’s revenues is pegged at $15.05 billion, representing a 1.7% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 71 cents, reflecting an increase of 7.6% from the year-ago actual figure.VeriSign, Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results. The company is likely to beat estimates as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.83%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VeriSign’s revenues is pegged at $298 million, representing 3.3% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.06, indicating rise of 10.4% from the year-ago reported figure.VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Per the company’s agreement with ICANN, the annual fee for a .net domain name registration has been increased from $8.20 to $9.02, effective Feb 1, 2018. We believe increasing domain-name registration, along with price hikes for domain names, to have bolstered revenues in the quarter. (Read more: What's in the Cards for VeriSign in Q1 Earnings?)Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 4 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.58%. However, the company’s top and bottom lines are anticipated to record significant year-over-year improvement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VeriSign’s revenues is pegged at $640.6 million, representing a 10.2% year-over-year gain. The consensus estimate for earnings is 69 cents, indicating 23.2% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Maxim’s well-diversified product portfolio is helping the company perform well in all its end markets, especially in the automotive and industrial sectors. Moreover, it is aiding the company to win clients and expand globally. However, weakness in the smartphone market and high dependence on Samsung poses significant threat to the company’s revenues from the consumer end market.

203,VRSN,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.   We note that the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.30%.Last quarter, VeriSign reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 96 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but marked an increase of 4 cents from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 3.2% year over year to $296 million and came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $295 million.For the first quarter of 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for VeriSign’s earnings per share and total revenues are pegged at $1.06 and $298 million, respectively, representing an increase of 10.4% and 3.1% from the year-ago period.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteDomain Registration to Drive Growth VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Per the company’s agreement with ICANN, the annual fee for a .net domain name registration has been increased from $8.20 to $9.02 effective Feb. 1, 2018.We believe that increasing domain name registration coupled with price hikes for domain names will drive the top line.According to the company’s latest “The Domain Name Industry Brief”, domain name registrations across all top-level domains (TLDs) signal a positive trend, increasing 0.5% sequentially to approximately 332.4 million across TLDs at the end of the fourth quarter. Domain name registrations increased 3.1 million or 0.9% year over year.On a combined basis, .com and .net domain names improved 2.4% year over year to approximately 146.1 million in the December quarter. Reportedly, new .com and .net registrations were 9 million compared with 8.8 million in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active domain names ending .com and .net for the first quarter stands at 148 million, indicating an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago figure.We note that the company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as in international markets. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).For the first quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 1.5 million to 2 million.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.83%. This indicates a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +2.30% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Paycom Software (PAYC  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #1.Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +6.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

204,VRSN,"Some of the biggest tech names are slated to report earnings this week. These results come at a time when the technology sector is grappling with several crises which have sprung up at short intervals. Of the companies, slated to report earnings this week, Facebook, Inc. (FB) has had to battle the fallout of a data leak scandal. Meanwhile, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has been the target of several attacks from President Trump.Given this backdrop, investors would be wondering whether upcoming results can help override recent concerns. Fortunately, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select tech stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.Can Strong Results Outweigh Recent Concerns?The variety of concerns plaguing technology, a sector which largely powered an unprecedented Bull Run, has had the strongest proponents of the sector scurrying for cover. Only recently, poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) pulled down other tech majors like Apple Inc. (AAPL).But not all the worries the sector faces at the moment could snowball into threats of significant proportions. For instance, most market watchers believe that a divided Congress is unlikely to regulate data gathering of the kind practiced by Facebook or Google. Online advertising spends, therefore, are likely to remain largely unchanged.However, higher user engagement will still be topmost on the list of investor priorities. Ultimately, earnings would not only have to be good overall. They would have to be strong enough to outweigh recent sector concerns.Earnings Prospects Remain PromisingUnlike the Finance sector whose earnings performance notably improved this earnings season compared to other recent periods, the Tech sector’s earnings performance has been strong over the last many quarters. This strength is expected to continue in the Q1 earnings season as well.Total Q1 earnings for the Tech sector are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 11.5% higher revenues. This would follow 24.2% earnings growth for the sector on 11.1% revenue growth in the preceding quarter. (Read: Can Tech Earnings Live Up to Expectations?)That’s head and shoulders above the autos and conglomerate sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 9.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the first quarter. Overall, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 18% from the same period last year on 5.3% higher revenues.Our ChoicesTech stocks have been battered on several fronts this year, the latest being poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor. However, several of the concerns surrounding the sector are unlikely to build up into something larger.For instance, U.S. lawmakers are unlikely to impose stringent regulation on tech majors in the near term. Meanwhile, in keeping with stellar fourth-quarter results, first-quarter numbers are likely to be impressive.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

"
226,VRSN,"Global markets appear to be shaking off the recent unprecedented withering of the financial system and are looking for an upturn. But is it sustainable or is it a short-term event?
"
227,VRSN,"So far, a string of drastic actions by the Federal Reserve and both the Bush and Obama administrations has yet to turn around a bunker mentality. Banks fear lending money to each other and to their customers. Businesses are reluctant to hire and boost capital investments. Consumers have hunkered down.
"
228,VRSN,"All the economy's problems are feeding off each other, creating a vicious cycle that Washington policymakers are finding difficult to break. Even if the turmoil gripping Wall Street were to let up and badly shaken confidence in the banking system were fully restored, a ""broader economic recovery will not happen right away.""
"
229,VRSN,"Obviously, the technology industry is not immune to the current economic downturn. Companies in technology groups will not only be impacted by the downturn, overall technology spending may also be curtailed significantly going forward. While lower prices on consumer electronics may help carry the tech industry through a difficult holiday shopping season, corporate spending on computer servers, PCs and business software is entering a period of slower growth that may last well into next year.

230,VRSN,"The impact on businesses is also not encouraging: Forrester is projecting that overall business information-technology sales will grow 6 percent in 2009, compared with 5.4 percent in 2008 and 7.2 percent in 2007.
"
231,VRSN,"Software Sector
"
232,VRSN,"While software stocks have suffered in kind with the market recently, we believe they generally represent a compelling opportunity, even if we are in a recession, especially relative to other technology sectors. Part of this is because many of them cater to corporations, not consumers, and corporations will likely continue spending money on maintenance even if they reduce spending on new software licenses.
"
233,VRSN,"The overwhelming majority of the current profit of corporate software companies is driven by maintenance, not license or consulting services. As such, profits at these companies will likely suffer less, and relative to most other technology sectors against a difficult economic backdrop.
"
234,VRSN,"Business and corporate across various sectors like finance, retail, telecommunication, etc. are deploying IT-enabled business solutions in order to increase their productivity and keep themselves updated with the rapidly changing global IT industry trends, translating into a high demand for IT-enabled business solutions. Other than this, the shooting rates of Internet adoption across the world and rising threats on Internet (like malware, spam and hack attacks) are bolstering the demand for IT security solutions and related software.
"
235,VRSN,"Opportunities
"
236,VRSN,"In spite of the bleak outlook, companies in the Application/Business Software sector are making only modest spending cuts so far. According to Gartner Inc., a market research firm, spending on technology won't increase the previous forecast 5.8%, but it won't decline either. Gartner is looking for a modest increase of 2.3%, mostly pushed up by emerging markets. The firm expects the U.S. to be flat, and Europe to be slightly negative.
"
237,VRSN,"While most software companies are implementing a series of internal cost-cutting measures, these are steps that companies typically take in an economic downturn -- a hiring freeze, no non-essential travel, and so on. Generally speaking, a downturn is when investment in IT is most critical because these investments can make operations more efficient. This idea is one reason why we think that the tech sector would weather a downturn better than other parts of the economy.
"
238,VRSN,"Software giant SAP (SAP  -  Free Report) is apparently not halting its own tech spending. Instead, the company continues to make strategic investments in IT projects that directly impact its ability to grow business globally. SAP expects its customers and prospects to continue strategic IT spending over the next months, while somewhat narrowing their focus more to IT projects that deliver quick returns.
"
239,VRSN,"More importantly, what would help many of these companies to withstand economic headwinds are category leadership, performance based marketing offerings, higher international exposure, strong & seasoned management team, product innovations and a strong balance sheet. Companies that may fit the bill are Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report) and Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report). 
"
240,VRSN,"Weaknesses
"
241,VRSN,"The biggest risk to the tech market comes not from the Wall Street collapse, but from a collateral U.S. recession. While tech spending grew 8% in the U.S. in 2007, Forrester was forecasting tech purchases to be up 5% in 2008, and up 6% in 2009. Given that the economy is still in a recession mode, this represents the second downward economic cycle for the IT sector in recent times.
"
242,VRSN,"Each Internet and Application Software company is at a different phase of its evolution in terms of scale, market share, investment in IT infrastructure, geographical expansion, operating leverage, new product release, pricing model and strength of balance sheet. A recession will be felt harder by those companies that have been delivering extremely high organic growth rates, have high operating leverage, or are approaching minimum operating scale levels in 2008/2009.
"
243,VRSN,"Also, due to the US dollar appreciation, Internet Software companies with significant non-US revenues such as Digital River (DRIV) and VeriSign (VRSN  -  Free Report) are continuing to experience FX headwinds in addition to a slowing international economy.

Earnings beat the Zack Consensus Estimate of 98 cents.Revenues increased 1.7% year over year to $292.4 million and came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $291.8 million.

There has been one revision lower for the current quarter.VGM ScoresAt this time, VeriSign's stock has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is equally suitable for momentum and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect below average returns from the stock in the next few months.

Earnings beat the Zack Consensus Estimate of 98 cents.Revenues increased 1.7% year over year to $292.4 million and came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $291.8 million.

The company continues to benefit from strong demand for domain name registrations in the United States as well as in international markets.Rise in bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is also contributing to an increase in domain name registrations, which is a tailwind for the company. Furthermore, the agreement with ICANN, under which the annual fee for a .net domain name registration will be increased from $8.20 to $9.02, effective Feb. 1, 2018, will drive the company’s top-line going ahead.Moreover, VeriSign’s focus to utilize its robust cash flows to return value to investors through share buybacks is a positive.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider VeriSign carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

246,VRSN,"The technology sector is now in the spotlight as we head into the busiest week of the Q3 earnings cycle.According to the Zacks Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members or 24.7% of the index’s total membership have reported quarterly numbers as of Oct 20. Of these, approximately 71.3% of the companies posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.1% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies grew 9.4% from the comparable period last year, while revenues were up 7.3%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally witness back-to-back five quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 2.6% from the year-ago period, while total revenues will be up 5%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutshineTechnology is one of the four sectors expected to report impressive earnings growth. The other three are Oil/Energy, Industrial Products and Construction. Various technology giants, including Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 9.9% on 7.1% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies are Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How GOOGL, MSFT, INTC, CDNS and VRSN are PlacedThe world’s largest semiconductor company, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results. We expect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to post earnings of 80 cents per share and revenues of $15.71 billion. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figures, represent almost flat growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation QuoteIntel’s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with the chipmaker’s competition. Of late, the company has been sensing the pressure from the likes of NVIDIA and Avanced Micro Devices. Nvidia’s artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment. (Read: Will Competition From Nvidia and AMD Hurt Intel's Earnings?)However, we anticipate the company’s strong growth at the data-center group segment to cushion its top- and bottom-line results. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment’s growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices escalates, along with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Intel’s Data Center business will expand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $4.82 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6%. As Intel’s data-center business accounts for nearly half of the company’s operating margin, the benefit of increase in segment’s revenues will trickle down to the bottom line as well.We expect Alphabet’s third-quarter 2017 results to benefit from strength in paid clicks, solid advertising revenues, mobile search ads and increasing momentum in the Other Bets segment. Also, increasing use of machine-learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will drive top-line growth.We expect paid clicks to grow in the to-be-reported quarter, driven partly by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube. YouTube remains a strong contributor, benefiting from the heightening online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged in the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.The company’s advertising revenues will likely be driven by healthy growth in its mobile search ads, YouTube ads and programmatic advertising. Furthermore, given an encouraging performance of the Other Bets segment during the second quarter, we estimate the segment to continue its momentum this quarter as well.In addition to this, the increasing use of machine-learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will continue to drive top-line growth in the upcoming quarter. (Read: Will Paid Clicks Help Alphabet Beat on Q3 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $21.94 billion for the quarter under review, up 20.1% from third-quarter 2016. Moreover, the Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $8.39 per share and the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alphabet Inc. QuoteLet’s take a sneak peek at Microsoft which is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Microsoft’s cloud computing service — Azure — has been the major growth driver in recent times. In the last quarter, Azure revenues soared a whopping 94% at constant currency on a year-over-year basis. We believe robust adoption of this cloud computing service will continue to drive the company’s top line in the soon-to-be reported quarter. According to data from Synergy Research, Azure trailed only Amazon Web Services (AWS) in terms of market share and revenue growth in the cloud infrastructure services market.Also, Microsoft now leads the enterprise SaaS market that gained almost 31% year over year to reach $15 billion in quarterly revenues. The outperformance was attributed to the buyout of LinkedIn that contributed revenues of $1.1 billion in the last quarter. Microsoft projects approximately $1.1 billion of revenues from LinkedIn in the fiscal first quarter.Additionally, we note that strong Office 365 and Windows 10 adoption are other growth drivers for the quarter. (Read: Microsoft's Q1 Earnings to Benefit From Azure Growth)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $23.53 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, up 15% from the year-earlier quarter. In addition, the Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 73 cents and the stock has a Zacks Rank #3.Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Microsoft Corporation QuoteAnother tech company, VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is also set to report its quarterly numbers. We expect this Zacks Rank #3 company to post earnings of 98 cents per share and revenues of $291.78 million, marking year-over-year growth of 5% and 1.5%, respectively.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). We note that the company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as international markets. Reportedly, in the last quarter, new .com and .net registrations were 9.2 million compared with 8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).Thus, strong gTLD growth, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results, in our view. We believe increasing domain name registration, along with price hikes for domain names, will drive the top line.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and escalating operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds. (Read: VeriSign Q3 Earnings: Is Another Beat in the Cards?)Lastly, Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) is another company scheduled to release earnings numbers. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, this Zacks Rank #3 company is likely to report earnings of 34 cents on $482.39 million revenues. Earnings and revenue estimates represent year-over-year growth of 14% and 8.1%, respectively.We believe Cadence’s third-quarter results will be driven by a number of projects won during the period.

However, the other terms of the agreement remained unchanged.Our TakeVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will continue to drive VeriSign’s top line. Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results. The company continues to benefit from strong demand in the U.S. as well as in the international markets.Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. VeriSign also has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space. Strong demand for VeriSign’s cyber security products, following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya is also a key growth driver. Also an increase in annual fee for a .net domain name registration will drive the company’s top-line results from next year onward.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider VeriSign carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
