0,DOV,"General Electric (GE) reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, after several months of lamenting an environment marked by ""slow growth.""And while CEO Jeff Immelt in October said the industrial giant's orders and organic growth would pick up steam in the fourth quarter, analysts remain cautious.""GE had a rough 2016 and 4Q is an important quarter to show order stability, margin gains, and cash flow improvement,"" Barclays analyst Scott Davis said in a research note, also predicting sequential improvement in 2017.Wall Street expects fourth-quarter earnings per share to fall 11.5% to 46 cents, with revenue dipping 0.5% to $33.66 billion.The company's power and renewables segments are expected to be strong, while transportation and oil & gas — which are still shaking off the effects of a global commodity oversupply — are expected to be weaker, Credit Suisse said in a recent research note.And despite GE's attempts to cut costs, strip back its finance operations to focus on its core industrial segments as well as become more of an industrial analytics firm, Credit Suisse sees earnings lagging those of its peers due to ""sluggish"" orders while consensus forecasts for the first half of the year look too high.But, as with other sectors, investors could be more focused on any guidance. The energy sector has rallied as crude prices recovered late last year, and investors will look for an update on GE's prospects in that market.In October, GE and Baker Hughes (BHI) in October announced a deal to combine GE's oil and gas operations with the oilfield services giant, whose merger with Halliburton (HAL) was called off earlier in the year due to antitrust concerns. Halliburton has said it's willing to sacrifice market share to boost profits as discounts offered during the oil bust are rolled back.Meanwhile, the U.S. oil-rig count has shot up and shale companies are ramping up 2017 exploration and production budgets, boosting demand for oilfield services and equipment.GE shares were down 0.1% at 31.21 on the stock market today. The stock broke out last month but dropped below its 31.59 entry last week. A strong Q4 report could send GE back in buying range.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has attempted to turn more into a tech company, with a big, long-term focus on the so-called Industrial Internet. GE's Q4 report kicks off big industrial earnings and will come after a Q3 earnings season in which a variety of industrials offered cloudier forecasts. Honeywell (HON), citing in part weakness in aerospace, cut its sales and profit outlook, while Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) warned of a weaker economy.The election sent industrials surging on expectations of an infrastructure spending package and corporate tax cuts. But the market appears to be tiring of its fling with President-elect Donald Trump, and Q4 results will test the sentiment of new shareholders.""Are the new owners in it just for the Trump infrastructure/tax trade and likely to jump at the first sign of weakness?"" Barclays analyst Davis wrote. ""Are they prepared for what will likely be another very soft quarter?""He said investors are likely to ignore short-term struggles and look ahead toward the second half of the year, when the rebound in oil and gas could strengthen and Trump's policy proposals become clearer either at that time or later.""We think 2017 is a year to buy into any dips,"" Davis said, ""and we do expect some.""RELATED:Apple, General Electric, Microsoft Lead Field In Stock Buybacks

2,DOV,"Machinery makers Dover Corp. (DOV), Flowserve (FLS), Parker Hannifin (PH) and DXP Enterprises (DXPE) rallied again Thursday on higher oil prices and hopes for more infrastructure spending. Stronger manufacturing data and a Parker Hannifin acquisition also may have helped.U.S. oil prices rose 3.3% to $51.06 on Thursday, after surging more than 9% Wednesday on OPEC's agreement to cut production. Higher prices should spur more exploration and drilling in U.S. shale and elsewhere, boosting machinery makers that have seen profit and sales decline.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale plays are big winners from the OPEC deal, but here's why U.S. oil production won't ramp up quickly.Dover, an industrial equipment maker than serves the oil and gas industry among others, climbed 4% to 75.53 at the close on the stock market today. That cleared a buy point of 75, with the stock trading at the highest levels since June 2015.

3,DOV,"Defense contractors and investors are celebrating Donald Trump's plan to boost weapons spending, but Pentagon budgeting experts say he's counting on savings that won't come true -- the old Washington saw of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.""It's a fantasy,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of the president-elect's campaign pledge to finance a more robust military partly by slashing bureaucracy and duplication at the Pentagon. Eaglen has briefed Trump's advisers.""I tried several times to disabuse them of the notion that this could ever pay for even a fraction of Trump's buildup costs,"" she said.As a candidate, Trump called for defense initiatives that analysts such as Eaglen say would add $55 billion to $80 billion annually to a spending request that totals $583 billion this year. Trump envisions a Navy with dozens more ships than the service has sought and an Army as big as the one President George W. Bush sent into Iraq and Afghanistan for full-scale invasions.Encouraged by those prospects, the S&P Aerospace & Defense index climbed 3.9% on Wednesday, outperforming the broader S&P 500, to the highest level since 1989. It was led by Raytheon (RTN), L-3 Communications Holdings (LLL), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD). The index climbed an additional 2% Thursday.Fulfilling campaign promises is only part of the defense spending challenge facing the new president.There's an immediate issue: delivering on Trump's pledge to remove caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act that would constrain Pentagon spending over the next four years. President Barack Obama, backed by Democratic lawmakers, has resisted eliminating the defense caps unless those on domestic spending are eased as well.Howard Rubel, a defense analyst with Jefferies Inc., said in a note that ""the election appears to embolden fiscal conservatives and military hawks. The prospects for eliminating"" the caps ""jumps substantially. The problem is that domestic safety net-type spending may suffer"" and ""addressing the deficit may be an afterthought.""The caps, which have been temporarily modified three times, are due to return in fiscal 2018, the first budget of the new administration. Through 2021, the caps would force about $106.6 billion in Pentagon cuts if no agreement is reached and the automatic cuts known as sequestration kick in, including about $33 billion in fiscal 2018.Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is Trump's top defense adviser and is said to be a leading candidate for defense secretary, told Defense News last month that ""it is painful for me as a budget"" hawk ""to acknowledge that we can't stay at a sequester-like level. We are just not going to be able to do that.""Trump also faces pending weapons decisions such as whether to increase purchases of Lockheed's F-35, the Pentagon's costliest weapons system, to 70 in the fiscal 2018 budget from the 63 requested this year.And then there are long-term funding questions that require advanced planning, including how to cope with what the military calls a ""bow wave"" of spending after 2021. That includes the planned modernization of all three legs of the air-land-sea triad of nuclear arms, which Trump has endorsed.Trump's broad aspirations are clear. In April he said his ""administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.""Among his promises were to increase the Army to 540,000 soldiers from about 475,000 today, reversing Obama's downsizing that would reduce the force to 450,000 in the next fiscal year. Trump also has vowed to ""build a Navy approaching 350 surface ships and submarines,"" up from about 272 today and the service's goal of 308 ships.For now, at least, the familiar -- and elusive -- Washington refrain of cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse,"" as President Ronald Reagan put it in the 1980s, remains the centerpiece of Trump's financing plan.His campaign website site used a variation on the Reagan theme, saying he would ""pay for this necessary rebuilding of our national defense by conducting a full audit of the Pentagon, eliminating incorrect payments, reducing duplicative bureaucracy, collecting unpaid taxes, and ending unwanted and unauthorized federal programs.""Eaglen, who has worked for Republican lawmakers and served in the Pentagon under Bush, said those are goals that should always be pursued but ""cannot yield $55 to $60 billion per year in new money to reinvest -- period.""""Some of Trump's ideas for a larger Navy, etc. will take a lot more money up front than any reform agenda"" can generate, Michael O'Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an e-mail. ""Unambiguously, what he wants to do will take more money,"" said O'Hanlon, author of ""The $650 Billion Bargain: The Case For Modest Growth in America's Defense Budget.""Other passages in the Trump campaign statement ""seem to indicate he would raise revenues or cut other parts of government to pay for defense,"" Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an e-mail. ""That is much more realistic, but the devil is in the details and no details are provided.""But ""the idea that auditing the Pentagon is going to uncover billions of dollars of waste is a myth,"" he said.Dov Zakheim, who was Pentagon comptroller under Bush, said that while an audit ""will not save money per se,"" it can focus attention on needless bureaucracy.""Some 70,000 positions have been added since 1990,"" Zakheim said. ""Has DoD become more efficient as a result? I don't think so.""

4,DOV,"General Electric (GE) on Friday cut its full-year organic growth outlook, making it the latest industrial to offer a cloudier forecast amid a sluggish global economy.Despite a rebound in oil prices, management sees GE's oil and gas business to remain weak, though the strong dollar should have less of an impact.The company said it now anticipates full-year organic growth being flat to up 2%, compared with a forecast for 2%-4% the company stuck with during its second-quarter earnings call in July. Back then, the company said it expected strong organic growth in the second half of the year.General Electric held to the midpoint of its earnings-per-share guidance for 2016, but narrowed its outlook. The company said it expects full-year EPS of $1.48-$1.52, compared to an earlier forecast for $1.45-$1.55. Analysts see $1.49. A tough foreign exchange environment continues to weigh on the company.The industrial conglomerate also upped its stock repurchase program by $4 billion.GE shares fell as low as 28.33 on the stock market today, undercutting the low end of the flat base that was forming, but recovered to closed down just 0.3% at 28.98. Honeywell (HON), which reported earnings in line with views, rose 0.8%.Prospects for the industrial sector are looking grimmer. Honeywell earlier this month cut its profit and sales outlook, partly on aerospace woes. Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) also warned on financial results, in part due to a weaker economy.General Electric's Q3 earnings per share rose 10% to 32 cents, topping views for 30 cents. Revenue rose 4% to $29.27 billion, missing estimates for $29.64 billion.Industrial segment organic revenue rose 1%. Oil and gas revenue fell 25%, with the effect of low oil prices still making its way through the energy sector. Power unit revenue jumped 37%, and aviation revenue rose 5%.Organic industrial orders fell 6% during the quarter. Digital and software orders, however, rose 11%.The results come as General Electric undergoes an evolution into more of an industrial tech and analytics company. The company in June also shed its ""systemically important financial institution"" label as it offloads GE Capital's assets.IBD'S TAKE: Even as General Electric makes its way through messier short-term conditions, its long-term ambitions are vast. For more information, see this story about GE's plans to become a leader in industrial Internet technology.  GE said in September it plans to buy two European 3D printing companies, raising speculation it might buy U.S. counterparts, though a Pacific Crest Securities analyst has said GE probably wouldn't buy 3D Systems (DDD).But GE said Friday that it won't raise its price for one of those European companies, Germany's SLM Solutions, after shareholder Elliott Management called it too low.""Elliott Management's objection to the terms of GE's offer for SLM won't likely impact GE's strategy to make bolt-on acquisitions in adjacent product markets like 3-D printing,"" Fitch said in an email. ""There will still be opportunities in other businesses to target acquisitions that offer relatively high sales growth or synergies, and where GE can leverage its technological expertise and scale.""RELATED:General Electric HQ Is Now In Boston, But GE Stock Isn't MovingApple, General Electric, Microsoft Top Q2 In Stock Buybacks

5,DOV,"Since July 21, the day before General Electric (GE) reported second-quarter results, the conglomerate's shares have lost around 10% of their value.Even though earnings per share and sales jumped during that quarter, orders fell 16% organically, and industrial organic revenue missed some expectations. Revenue in the company's oil and gas segment sank 22%, with low oil prices continuing to hurt the business. Lower commodity carloads in North America hurt the company's transportation segment. A difficult foreign exchange environment also weighed.On the second-quarter earnings call, CEO Jeff Immelt said General Electric faced a ""slow growth and volatile environment."" However, he added that GE was ""positioned for strong organic growth in the second half.""For the third quarter and further out, analysts will be looking to see if GE can deliver on that position. Wall Street expects General Electric's Q3 earnings per share to rise 3% to 30 cents on revenue up 6% to $29.636 billion. But industrial orders and organic revenue will watched closely.Investors will likely also be watching for continued strength in the company's aviation and power segments.And oil prices have rebounded, potentially shoring up future demand for GE's oil equipment, or at least stopping the bleeding. Analyst forecasts indicate that the drag the energy sector has put on the S&P 500 in recent quarters could subside in Q4.Immelt in July said that GE's oil and gas segment ""faces major cyclical headwinds but by the second half, they have easier comps."" However, he also said improvement in that segment and GE's transportation business was unlikely next year.IBD'S TAKE: Even as General Electric makes its way through messier short-term conditions, its long-term ambitions are vast. For more information, see this story about GE's plans to become a leader in industrial Internet technology.  Barclays analyst Scott Davis said the third quarter was likely to be ""sloppy"" for industrials, according to commentary cited by Barron's. He added that ""business spending hiccupped"" during the period, though it was unclear why, and that the quarter tends to suffer from seasonal weakness.""Some blame the Presidential election, some just cite recovery uncertainty,"" he said. ""It doesn't appear to be a long-term issue, and we have spoken to folks who have seen more stabilization in October and expect projects to move forward post the U.S. election.""""At this point, however, 2016 seems a lost year and all eyes will likely move toward 2017 order books to see if even a modest recovery is realistic,"" Davis later added.Elsewhere in the sector, Honeywell (HON) this month cut its profit and sales outlook, partly on aerospace woes. Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) also warned on financial results, in part due to a weaker economy.The results will come as General Electric undergoes an evolution into more of an industrial tech and analytics company. While General Electric in September said it plans to buy two European 3D printing companies, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst has said GE probably wouldn't buy 3D Systems (DDD).General Electric rose 0.3% to 69.42 in the stock market today, after falling last week to its lowest level in nearly eight months. The stock's 50-day line this week crossed its 200-day line, a bearish sign. Honeywell rose 0.4% while PPG dipped 0.3%.Dover closed up 2.8% as it released official Q3 results before the open.RELATED:General Electric HQ Is Now In Boston, But GE Stock Isn't MovingApple, General Electric, Microsoft Top Q2 In Stock Buybacks

6,DOV,"Manufacturer Dover (DOV) on Monday cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts, due in part to weakness in some oil and gas markets, and a global economy that it expects to remain sluggish, adding to similar warnings from industrials like Honeywell (HON) and PPG Industries (PPG).Dover — which makes equipment that helps oil and gas producers, as well as refrigeration equipment — slashed its full-year earnings per share forecast to $3.00-$3.05 from an earlier outlook for $3.35-$3.45. Dover also now sees full-year revenue down 4% to 5%, compared to earlier guidance for a 3%-5% decline.Analysts see EPS of $3.34 on a 1.3% revenue decline.""The primary factors driving this revision are generally weaker capital spending across several industrial end-markets, continued weakness in longer cycle oil & gas exposed markets, and continued headwinds in our retail refrigeration business related to production inefficiencies,"" the company said in a statement.Shares sank 7.7% to close at 66.69 in the stock market today, breaching support at their 50-day line and nearly blowing through the bottom of a cup base after climbing closer to a breakout last week. Among other diversified manufacturers, General Electric (GE) fell 0.8% and United Technologies (UTX) lost 0.6%.Dover also said it would complete its acquisition of Wayne Fueling Systems in the first quarter of 2017, later than initially expected, due to U.K. regulators' concerns over competition. In June, the company said that acquisition would likely close in the back half of 2016.Dover's downbeat forecast comes after Honeywell late Thursday trimmed its own full-year guidance, saying a weaker oil industry, along with struggles in emerging markets, have hurt aircraft demand.IBD'S TAKE: Even as energy markets remain a concern, IBD's Oil & Gas U.S. Exploration and Production group has surged to the second best among 197 groups tracked. To learn about some of the most promising stocks in the group, read this Industry Snapshot. PPG Industries, which makes paints and coatings for the construction, industrial and other markets, on Friday also warned on its third-quarter results.PPG said it was ""disappointed with this quarter's EPS growth rate as we continue to operate in a sluggish economic environment with no clear near-term catalyst for improving global GDP growth.""Honeywell stock dipped 0.1% Monday after sinking 7.5% Friday, while PPG edged up 0.1% Monday after diving 8.3% Friday.Despite concerns about the energy sector, it is expected to cease being a drag on the overall S&P 500 in the fourth quarter as oil prices rebound.RELATED:Diamondback Raises 2016 Production Outlook, Ends Buyout TalksU.S. Oil Tops $50 On Hopes For Output Deal; Saudis Hint At $60

14,DOV,"When you start a company from scratch, things rarely go according to plan. That's why it's vital to stick to it and keep going, even if it means being flexible and changing directions.Here's how to make sure you keep driving forward:Deal with change. Those investing in startups know companies' business plans seldom unfold as expected.""Our experience has told us that leadership of a firm is more important than what the firm is and how effective the strategy is,"" said Jack Wyant, founder and managing director of Cincinnati-based venture capital firm Blue Chip Venture, which has invested more than $1 billion in startup companies. ""That's because the leader will persist in developing the company. So the characteristics of a leader, starting with persistence, become imperative. You have to never, ever give up.""Expect trouble. Problems will arise. Be ready to deal with them by working with others who have been through the wringer. And prepare to fight through anything.""The world of startups is a minefield,"" said Dov Baron, who runs West Coast leadership consulting firm Dov Baron International. ""You need people who have made it across the minefield to say, 'Here's where you put your foot.' And make sure you do it in the most efficient way.""Make it personal. Figure out why you're doing your job or starting a business. Baron says your purpose is far different from a mission statement. It's your own reason for launching a firm. It might be that you, like Baron, grew up watching people fail because they kept making the same mistakes and you want to help people avoid that. Or you might be driven by a personal fear of poverty or of failure.""That's what gets you out of bed in the morning,"" Baron said. ""Now your venture becomes the catalyst for fulfilling that. Persistence is in your emotional purpose. If you forget your purpose, persistence goes away.""Get the edge. When business owners tell people their strategy or ideas, it rarely put them at risk, Wyant says. That's because the main differentiator is executing those strategies and ideas.""That means persistence,"" he said.Stick to beliefs. Tom Arington, chairman of Langhorne, Pa.-based Aprecia Pharmaceuticals, made perseverance pay off. He and his partners funded the startup for 12 years while it struggled to get Food and Drug Administration approval for its innovative drug-delivery system. A year ago it finally got the go-ahead for the first 3D printed drug product. Aprecia uses 3D printing to create an epilepsy drug that quickly dissolves in liquid, making it easier to take.""Tom absolutely never gives up,"" Wyant said. ""He overcame technical, regulatory, manufacturing and financial obstacles. It would've been so easy to stop.""Pick the right way. Know the difference between dumb and smart persistence, Baron says. If you stand by your idea and push it no matter what, that's not wise. Use the smart kind to build off your idea with input from mentors and other pieces of information that'll help you adapt it to make it a success.""You need to have the idea that you'll do anything you can to make it work,"" Baron said.Get the dough. Entrepreneurs looking to raise money have to be particularly willing to stick to it. Most meet with dozens and even hundreds of investors before finding one to put money in their ideas.""You almost never go one place and get money,"" Wyant said. ""You have to keep pounding away, hoping there's a spark."" Get advice. Form your own personal board of advisors who have been through the process and can guide you through problems, Baron says.""Lone wolves die in the forest,"" he said. ""You need to have a tribe. And if you're the smartest person in the room, then you're in the wrong room.""RELATED:High-Growth Startups Require Sure Steps, Follow Savvy PacesettersUnderserved Customers Are Niche Sweet Spots For Striving StartupsInculators: A New Trend For Startups?

Don't tell us that it has nothing to do with Islam.Violating the sacred space of one of the world's founding religions, the two cousins used guns, meat cleavers and axes in a barbaric rampage that left a floor full of bloody torahs, religious clothing, and dead bodies. The victims included a prominent and beloved rabbi along with three others, all dual U.S. or British Israeli citizens. A policeman was also murdered, and eight others were wounded.""This is roughly comparable to terrorists invading a cathedral and killing a Cardinal among other clergy,"" wrote David P. Goldman, known as Spengler, on his Facebook page in a note to Christian friends. ""Of course, we do not have a hierarchy in the Catholic sense, but Rabbi Moshe Twersky H'yd, a grandson of Rav Joseph Dov Soloveitchik, was one of our sages. Our grief and outrage are past description.""It was clearly the sort of attack that shocks the conscience, comparable to the 1170 murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral or maybe the 1980 killing of El Salvador Archbishop Oscar Romero.The response from the White House, however, was pure boilerplate, attributing the savagery to ""tensions"" between Israelis and Palestinians and equating it to every act of force instead of acknowledging it for the new low in terrorism it really was.""I strongly condemn today's terrorist attack at a synagogue in Jerusalem, which killed four innocent people, including U.S. citizens Aryeh Kupinsky, Cary William Levine and Mosheh Twersky, and injured several more,"" President Obama said in a statement.""At this sensitive moment in Jerusalem, it is all the more important for Israeli and Palestinian leaders and ordinary citizens to work cooperatively together to lower tensions, reject violence, and seek a path forward towards peace.""It was almost as if he was blaming the bloodied in the temple, peacefully worshipping their God, for the lack of any civilized activity by the terrorists.What's more, it comes on the heels of the White House's refusal to admit that any terrorist attacks in this day and age have a common denominator in radical Islam.An American Muslim convert, Abdul-Rahman Kassig, was beheaded in Syria last weekend, and Obama insisted the barbaric act had nothing to do with Islam.""ISIL's actions represented no faith, least of all the Muslim faith, which Abdul-Rahman adopted as his own,"" the White House statement read.It's a failure to recognize the blood on the ground in Jerusalem, spilled by extremists murdering in a religion's name. The place attacked, after all, was a synagogue, a religious institution. Its attackers bellowed ""Allahu Akbar"" during their unprovoked attack.After Israeli cops shot the attackers dead, Palestinians erupted in celebration, dancing in the streets and flinging candy among themselves, smiling, laughing and singing — proud of their ""martyrs,"" who, in their minds, had made it to heaven.If that has nothing to do with religion, what does?The viciousness of the attack leaves no people of faith safe and calls for renewed thinking about a harder response to stop this barbarism. It will only succeed once the Islamic nature of the problem is confronted.

43,DOV,"With as many as seven oil and gas-related industry groups rising 1.8% or more in stocks today, an investor shouldn't be surprised to see more names in that sector run to new highs. On Thursday, they included brand-new IPO Apergy (APY), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), and oil drilling firm Transocean (RIG).Apergy, which debuted on the NYSE as a spinoff of industrial equipment firm Dover (DOV) on May 9, moved to a new high after rising 4.3% to close at 43.90. That marked a fourth straight advance.While cup bases should be a minimum six weeks in length and flat bases at least five weeks, IPO bases can be extraordinarily narrow in width, as short as seven days. In Apergy's case, the five-day pullback was too short to be a proper IPO base.Apergy hit a high of 43.11 on its market debut, then fell the next two sessions. Notice on a daily chart how Apergy refused to go below the intraday low of its first trading session as an independent new company.That said, what tail winds benefit the drilling technology expert?Apergy's oil drilling industry group has scaled up the six-month performance rankings among IBD's 197 industry groups. As of Wednesday's close, the group ranked No. 22, up from No. 91 just six weeks ago.Given that oil is a commodity and thus the industry is highly cyclical, investors should expect Apergy's annual results to swing. And swing they have.In 2014, the Woodlands, Texas-based firm earned a robust $2.88 a share. But the next year, earnings plunged 77% to 67 cents a share. And in 2016, Apergy suffered a net loss of 16 cents a share. In 2017, it returned to the black, earning $1.43 a share as sales picked up 34% to $1.01 billion.Sales fell sharply in 2015 and 2016, down 30% in both of those years.Analysts expect Apergy's earnings to fall 11% to 32 cents a share in the first quarter of 2018.Apergy's products include plunger lifts, rod pumping systems, progressive cavity pumps, and electric submersible pump systems.Transocean, Apergy's industry group mate, rallied past 14 for the first time in more than 14 months. The stock climbed 0.11 to 13.71 after erasing most of the day's gains.Transocean is climbing out of a deep first-stage bottoming base. Go to a monthly chart, and you'll see why. The stock remains 92% below an all-time peak of 163, set in May 2008. (Go to MarketSmith to see historical daily, weekly and monthly charts.)In the near term, the global expert in offshore deep-ocean drilling surpassed a 12.50 buy point in a 13-week cup without handle on April 18. The stock didn't get very far, though, and pulled back for nearly three weeks. That decline, in turn, can be seen as a downward slanting handle on the giant cup base.Thus, a new buy point emerged at 12.85, 10 cents above the handle's high. Transocean rushed past that new entry on May 9 in excellent volume, up 65% vs. its 50-day average.Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell, the global integrated energy giant, rose more than 1% to 73.33 in about average volume. On May 9, the stock cleared a 71.79 buy point in a nearly 15-week cup with handle.Royal Dutch Shell remains in buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 75.38.In other sectors, Baozun (BZUN) gained more than 18% as it moved past a 52.43 buy point in an undefined seven-week cuplike base.

48,DOV,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry. Look for the relative strength line to get closer to new high ground and for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average. Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation.

51,DOV,"General Electric (GE) is a leaner, meaner industrial machine under new leadership, but has it been strengthening its free cash flow? Investors may find out when GE reports Friday.XAt the heart of anxiety about GE's industrial FCF (free cash flow) is the dividend that springs forth from it. GE currently pays an annualized dividend of 96 cents, translating to a tasty 4.1% yield. That has made this Dow component a favorite blue chip for income investors.But some analysts have warned of a potential dividend cut as GE prepares to report earnings amid major turnover in its corporate leadership.New CEO John Flannery has slashed expenses and trimmed the portfolio since assuming the reins on Aug. 1, though the effect on FCF going forward isn't clear yet. Next month, he is expected to unveil the results of a strategic review that calls for ""thousands of corporate-level job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure,"" including the closure of three research centers, according to the Wall Street Journal.Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research see EPS increasing 56% to 50 cents as revenue climbs 9% to $31.92 billion.Organic revenue and industrial orders are two key closely watched metrics. GE must increase attachment rates on service contracts, which can underpin sustained growth in organic revenue, writes Morningstar analyst Barbara Noverini.The industrial giant's profit target of $2 per share for next year is another key issue to watch. Analysts who cover GE, as well as GE management, are turning cautious about its ability to achieve that goal. The company could address its forecast Friday or reserve the topic for Flannery's update to investors on Nov. 13.Shares of GE slipped 0.3% to 23.12 on the stock market today, after pegging a two-year-plus low of 22.83 last week. The stock has plunged more than 25% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: As earnings season heats up, here's a list of Dow and other stocks near buy points to watch ahead of third-quarter results.Meanwhile, fellow industrial giant Honeywell (HON) reports the same day, while Dover (DOV) precedes its larger peers with a report Thursday.Analysts see Honeywell's EPS growing 4% to $1.74 on a 1.6% rise in revenue to $9.96 billion.The company recently said it will spin off its automotive turbocharger business as well as its home HVAC, fire and security business, following a portfolio review. It kept its aerospace business, which hedge fund Third Point has targeted for divestiture.Analysts expect Dover's EPS to jump 28% to $1.11 on a 16% increase in revenue to $1.98 billion.As with Honeywell, progress on efforts to streamline a diverse portfolio will be closely watched. Dover is considering a sale, spinoff or merger of its upstream energy businesses, known as Wellsite.Honeywell shares rose 1 cent to 143.44 Wednesday and are still in buy range from their Sept. 21 breakout. Dover fell 0.5% to 93.57.RELATED:Why GE Stock May Get Worse Instead Of Better As Leadership Turns OverDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisGE Shakes Up Top Execs While More Perks Fall To Cost-Cutting Drive

54,DOV,"Baker Hughes (BHGE) is reportedly looking to resume takeover talks with Subsea 7, a U.K.-based company that offers construction and engineering services to the offshore energy industry, after the talks broke down earlier.XNegotiations between Baker Hughes, which was formed by the merger of GE's (GE) oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and Subsea 7 had collapsed over price but could resume, sources told The Wall Street Journal. Subsea 7 said it would not comment on speculation or rumors, but its shares rose on the news, Reuters added.Baker Hughes, officially known as Baker Hughes, a GE Company, is 62.5% owned by GE, with Baker Hughes shareholders owning the rest.Morningstar analyst Preston Caldwell called the prospective merger odd, noting Subsea 7 has long been a partner with rival Schlumberger (SLB) and would presumably end that relationship if a deal is realized.A combined Baker Hughes-Subsea company also would still have gaps in subsea equipment, he added, warning that those holes should be filled before entering the engineering, procurement, and construction business.BHGE closed down 1.7% at 34.39 on the stock market today. GE gave up 1.2% to 23.07, pegging a fresh 52-week low as Wall Street analysts warn that the industrial giant is fundamentally challenged and its prized dividend could be at risk.Rival oilfield-service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger rose 1.1% and fell 0.9%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is getting underway in earnest. Here's a list of Dow stocks in or near buy points ahead of third-quarter results, including one of GE's industrial peers. The oilfield services industry is consolidating amid the need for greater scale to grow and as oil prices have crashed since 2014.Helix Energy Solutions (HLX) and Dover (DOV) are also said to be exploring strategic sales of all or part of their businesses.Meanwhile, analysts are said to be in wait-and-see mode as to whether Baker Hughes can deliver hoped-for synergies from the merger with GE, and compete effectively with Halliburton and Schlumberger.Amid a slew of executive and board changes this month, GE announced Oct. 2 that Lorenzo Simonelli, president and CEO of BHGE, would succeed Immelt as chairman of BHGE.RELATED:Why GE Stock May Get Worse Instead Of Better As Leadership Turns OverDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisDow Leads Slim Gains; Oil Giant Breaks Out To Buy Point As Crude Soars

59,DOV,"United Technologies (UTX) predicted Wednesday its Pratt & Whitney unit will ramp up deliveries of its latest jet engine this year, as production problems come under control.Delays with the new geared turbofan prompted Qatar Airways to cancel an order last year for Airbus (EADSY) A320neo jets.United Tech earlier had cut its 2016 forecast for turbofan deliveries to 150 from 200. On Wednesday, the company said it sees 2017 deliveries of 350-400, including about 50 spares.The industrial conglomerate also reported fourth-quarter earnings rose 13.9% to $1.56 a share, in line with Wall Street forecasts, as revenue rose 2.5% to $14.66 billion, missing views for $14.7 billion.Sales at Pratt & Whitney rose nearly 4% to $3.99 billion. Sales at its Otis elevator unit dipped 1% to $3.06 billion. Sales at the climate, control and security business rose 3% to $4.25 billion. Aerospace systems sales grew 4% to $3.6 billion.The company also backed its full-year 2017 EPS view of $6.30-$6.60, with the midpoint below consensus for $6.56, on revenue of $57.5 billion-$59 billion,  also light vs. Wall Street views for $58.86 billion.United Tech said it plans to buy back $3.5 billion in shares this year and is setting aside $1 billion-$2 billion for acquisitions.""Despite an uncertain global macro environment, our growing aerospace backlog and strategic investments in the commercial businesses position us well to generate higher organic growth in 2017,"" Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said in a statement.Shares fell 0.6% to 110.95 on the stock market today, staying in buy range and finding support at their 50-day line after undercutting both key points intraday.In the latter part of last year, other industrials, like Dover (DOV), Honeywell (HON) and PPG Industries (PPG), gave dim forecasts about the months to come.Last week, General Electric (GE) reported fourth-quarter results that offered up more of the same: slow growth globally, volatility, an oversupplied oil & gas sector that has less need for GE's oil-related equipment. GE, however, said it remained more upbeat heading into this year.When asked about how potential regulatory changes under the new administration might affect its businesses, CEO Jeff Immelt said they ""could see some caution"" over the Affordable Care Act, which the GOP has been eager to dismantle, from customers who buy medical equipment from its health care division.GE shares were up 1.2% Wednesday.RELATED:Trump Claims Twitter Win On Indiana Jobs; Carrier Stresses State IncentivesTrump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'United Technologies, Costco Upgraded; Shale Producers Mixed

74,DOV,"There's nothing like a promising corporate marriage to make a big splash on Wall Street.
"
75,DOV,"That's how the scenario has played out for water products industry leader Pentair (PNR). Its stock has spurted up about 62% since the company tied the knot with Tyco International's (TYC) Tyco Flow division, in September 2012, six months after announcing plans.
"
76,DOV,"The $10 billion stock-for-stock merger created a roughly $8 billion-a-year powerhouse in flow control, filtration and equipment protection. Tyco Flow complements Pentair's offerings and gives it a strong position in fast-growing markets, including the energy arena, while giving a nice lift to revenue and profit, as well as generating cost synergies.
"
77,DOV,"The combo also gives Pentair an opportunity to apply its Pentair Integrated Management System to Tyco Flow's business with the goal of boosting efficiency, performance and productivity — in turn driving earnings growth, analysts say. The PIMS approach, as Pentair calls it, involves a studied set of methods and processes for finding new market opportunities, speeding product development and planning rollouts, while trying to stay lean and sharp as a company.
"
78,DOV,"Pentair was already a big player in the water and fluid systems arena prior to the merger, with products ranging from energy-efficient pumps and point-of-use filtration to engineered pumps and fluid processing systems. It also had a strong position in technical solutions with products that guard and protect electronics and electrical equipment such as enclosures and cases, and made heat management equipment and thermal management systems.
"
79,DOV,"Tying With Tyco
"
80,DOV,"Tyco Flow, a maker of flow control products, added to the mix a lineup including highly engineered valves and controls used in energy, general process, mining and water industries.
"
81,DOV,"""The deal was transformational,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst John Quealy. ""It gets Pentair into the energy market where they weren't a player, and from a financial perspective it doubled the size of the company.""
"
82,DOV,"Pentair posted revenue of $4.4 billion in 2012. It estimates 2013 sales will grow to $7.4 billion.
"
83,DOV,"The rationale behind the deal was diversification, says Quealy.
"
84,DOV,"Prior to the merger, he says, Pentair was ""very strong"" in water and electrical equipment, but had ""de minimis"" exposure to energy. Meanwhile Tyco was ""very strong"" in energy-related applications, he adds, and energy was an area in which Pentair intended to participate.
"
85,DOV,"The combination gives Pentair more exposure to energy applications in industrial sectors and doubles its presence in the energy sector as a combined company, said CEO Randall Hogan on a conference call in March 2012 announcing the deal. Pentair expected the transaction to be ""highly accretive"" to earnings, adding 40 cents a share to 2013 earnings. It estimates combined company earnings will be greater than $5 a share by 2015, reflecting synergies through efforts such as streamlining operations and economies of scale.
"
86,DOV,"Since closing the deal, adds Quealy, Pentair has ""encouraged the Street"" it can hit the 2015 earnings target. Most recently, on Dec. 10, Pentair said in a statement that it ""remains committed to the target synergies from the transaction, and its $5 per share 2015 EPS goal.""
"
87,DOV,"Pentair is able to drive earnings through operating efficiencies and continuous improvement processes, says Wedbush Securities analyst David Rose.
"
88,DOV,"""It's still very early in the process, but right out of the gate it looks like the company is a little ahead of expectations in cost-saving synergies,"" he said. ""The outlook so far is encouraging.""
"
89,DOV,"Fruits Of Synergy
"
90,DOV,"Investors believe the merger was a good move for the company, he says, and consequently the stock has made a fairly large move.
"
91,DOV,"""We think there are a lot of opportunities ahead and clearly see the path to more operating efficiencies and cost reductions,"" Rose said, ""probably on the higher end of expectations.""
"
92,DOV,"Pentair now expects its ""realized synergies"" relating to the merger integration in 2013 to be about $120 million, above the $90 million previously estimated, said Hogan on the company's Oct. 22 third-quarter conference call.
"
93,DOV,"""The increase over previous estimates is being driven by sourcing and lean savings in Flow Control and is the result of building momentum around our proven PIMS operating system,"" Hogan said.
"
94,DOV,"Quealy figures Pentair is in about the ""third or fourth inning"" of the merger integration process.
"
95,DOV,"Pentair will likely shed more light on its prospects in the wake of the merger when it gives its full-year 2014 outlook on Tuesday.
"
96,DOV,"Quealy says he expects the forecast to be ""consistent with other industrials,"" and that he doesn't expect any ""major surprises.""
"
97,DOV,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see 2014 earnings rising 24% to $3.96 a share.
"
98,DOV,"Meanwhile, Pentair is faring well on the financial front, with double-digit profit gains the past two quarters. Earnings rose 34% to 86 cents a share in the third quarter. Sales jumped 111% to $1.8 billion. Analysts expect full-year earnings to rise 34% to $3.20 a share.
"
99,DOV,"""The third quarter met our expectations on the bottom line, as margins expanded 210 basis points to 13.6%,"" said Hogan on the quarter's conference call. ""Price and productivity more than offset inflation, mix was positive and synergies read out better than expected. Our adjusted EPS grew 25%, even though sales declined 1% organically.""
"
100,DOV,"Regional Ups And Downs
"
101,DOV,"But sales were $50 million below Pentair's expectations, he added, due primarily to weak results in Australia. The weakness was not only related to the local economy, but also ""a significant foreign exchange head wind,"" he said.
"
102,DOV,"On a brighter note, Pentair continues to see strength in the residential end market as it benefits from an improving housing market in North America and more spending on dwellings amid rising home values.
"
103,DOV,"Pentair's huge lineup for this market ranges from treatment products that filter and purify water to energy-efficient systems that ensure water pressure is just right. Pentair is also a leading provider of pool and spa equipment.
"
104,DOV,"Sales in the residential and commercial end markets, which accounted for about 45% of the company's Water & Fluid Solutions segment revenue in the quarter, rose 12% from a year earlier.
"
105,DOV,"The food and beverage sector — also a part of the Water & Fluid Solutions segment — remained ""very strong"" in the quarter, Hogan says. Sales to that market grew 20%.
"
106,DOV,"In the Valves & Controls segment, created after the Tyco Flow merger, sales declined 1% in the quarter. They would have been up 1% if Australia were excluded, said Hogan on the call.
"
107,DOV,"Sales to the oil and gas industry were flat, he added, as many ""downstream"" customers deferred annual maintenance shutdowns due to high activity.
"
108,DOV,"Pentair is the fifth-largest company by market cap in IBD's Machinery-General Industrial industry group, after Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Parker-Hannifin (PH), Ingersoll-Rand Co. (IR) and Dover (DOV). The group currently ranks No. 20 of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.
"
109,DOV,"On Tuesday Pentair announced that its board has authorized a share buyback program of up to $1 billion through Dec. 31, 2016. The buyback will leave Pentair with another $2 billion in cash and balance sheet capacity for additional business reinvestment or share repurchase by 2015, Hogan said in a statement.
"
110,DOV,"The same day, Pentair said that its board has approved changing the parent company's place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. Shareholders are expected to vote on the proposed change at an anticipated second-quarter shareholders meeting.

119,DOV,"When company leaders engender trust among employees, it's easier to hire and retain workers, the firm gets more innovation and profits tend to rise, according to leadership experts. Many firms struggle to achieve that. A recent poll by St. Louis-based employee research firm Maritz Research found that 25% of workers have less trust in management than a year ago. Just 10% trust management to make the right choices in shaky times. Still, leaders can overcome those trends.
"
120,DOV,"• Make values clear. Leaders need to act consistently with their firm's principles, says Rick Garlick, senior director of strategic consulting at Maritz. Southwest Airlines (LUV) founder Herb Kelleher exuded the culture of a fun, leisure-friendly airline. Steve Jobs did the same with Apple's (AAPL) culture of innovation, says Garlick.
"
121,DOV,"If you value innovation, don't cut your research and development budget or quickly quash new ideas.
"
122,DOV,"""You can't panic and change strategies at the first turn,"" Garlick told IBD. ""Leaders create values that attract people with like values.""
"
123,DOV,"• Shoot straight. Just 14% of those surveyed said they believe their leaders are ethical and honest. Only 7% said top managers' actions were completely consistent with their words. Some of that ties to the tough economy, Garlick says. Bosses try to paint an optimistic picture for employees. They might say people are their most valuable asset. But when the firm's results weaken, they cut jobs.
"

131,DOV,"• Open up. Give your people more information and you'll build a better environment, Seidman says. Be transparent and use technology to quickly tell employees things like why a person left the firm or why someone was hired.When company leaders engender trust among employees, it's easier to hire and retain workers, the firm gets more innovation and profits tend to rise, according to leadership experts. Many firms struggle to achieve that. A recent poll by St. Louis-based employee research firm Maritz Research found that 25% of workers have less trust in management than a year ago. Just 10% trust management to make the right choices in shaky times. Still, leaders can overcome those trends.• Make values clear. Leaders need to act consistently with their firm's principles, says Rick Garlick, senior director of strategic consulting at Maritz. Southwest Airlines (LUV) founder Herb Kelleher exuded the culture of a fun, leisure-friendly airline. Steve Jobs did the same with Apple's (AAPL) culture of innovation, says Garlick.If you value innovation, don't cut your research and development budget or quickly quash new ideas.""You can't panic and change strategies at the first turn,"" Garlick told IBD. ""Leaders create values that attract people with like values.""• Shoot straight. Just 14% of those surveyed said they believe their leaders are ethical and honest. Only 7% said top managers' actions were completely consistent with their words. Some of that ties to the tough economy, Garlick says. Bosses try to paint an optimistic picture for employees. They might say people are their most valuable asset. But when the firm's results weaken, they cut jobs.""Then you come across as a hypocrite,"" Garlick said.

150,DOV,"On Jun 30, Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The downgrade can be attributed to concerns regarding retail refrigeration business and cost woes.Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #5 have strong chances of underperforming the broader market.Also, Dover’s share price movement has not been much impressive. Over the past year, the company has underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has declined around 11% compared with 3% growth recorded by the industry during the same time frame. Why the Downgrade?Dover lowered its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2018 to $4.70-$4.85. Separation costs pertaining to Apergy and continued weakness in retail refrigeration remain headwinds for Dover. The company will incur separation costs related to Apergy between $33 million and $35 million in second-quarter 2018. This will impact the quarter’s margins.Notably, Dover experienced temporary operating efficiencies, including parts-availability issues in retail fueling and weaker-than-expected market conditions in the retail refrigeration business. The company remains concerned that the business will continue to be impacted by tough comparisons related to last year's strong shipments and softer overall markets.Also, analysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock over the past 60 days, with estimates moving south. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings declined 11% to $4.81. In addition, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 moved down 9% to $5.42 during the same time frame.Dover Corporation Price and Consensus  Dover Corporation Price and Consensus | Dover Corporation Quote Furthermore, Dover carries an unimpressive VGM Score of C.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Chart Industries, Inc.

151,DOV,"Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for DOV broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 9.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for DOV stock.If that wasn’t enough, DOV isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 4 estimates have been reduced, while 1 has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for DOV.

152,DOV,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in DOV.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen seven estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with two upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $5.72 a share a month ago to its current level of $4.82.Also, for the current quarter, Dover Corporation has seen five downward estimate revisions versus one revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.22 a share from $1.55 over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 16% in the past month.Dover Corporation Price and Consensus Dover Corporation Price and Consensus | Dover Corporation QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

153,DOV,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Dover has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Dover’s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Dover has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Dover stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Dover has a P/S ratio of about 1.5. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, DOV is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Dover currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Dover a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Dover is just 1.0, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.6. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 11.7, which is far better than the industry average of 16.3. Clearly, DOV is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Dover might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B. This gives DOV a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the next year estimate has seen one upward and six downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current year consensus estimate has inched lower by 0.5% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has inched up by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Dover Corporation Price and Consensus  Dover Corporation Price and Consensus | Dover Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDover is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 12% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:However, with a Zacks Rank of 3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

154,DOV,"We issued an updated research report on Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) on May 11. The company will benefit from its efforts to simplify portfolio, share repurchases as well as strong momentum in its segments. However, separation costs pertaining to Apergy and continued weakness in Retail refrigeration remain headwinds. Upbeat Q1 Performance Dover delivered first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $1.16, which increased 26% from the prior-year quarter, mainly driven by continued strength in businesses. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. Total revenues increased 6% year over year to $1.92 billion in the quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billion. The year-over-year increase can be attributed to acquisition growth of 1%, organic growth of 4%, and a favorable impact from foreign exchange of 4%, partly offset by an impact of 3% from dispositions. Dover’s bookings at the end of the first quarter 2018 were worth $2.11 billion, up from $2.03 billion reported at the end of first-quarter 2017. Organic bookings increased across all of Dover’s businesses with the exception of Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Backlog increased to $1.41 billion at the end of the reported quarter from $1.29 billion at the year-ago quarter end. Backed by strong bookings growth, the company is poised for an improved second-quarter 2018 performance. Upbeat 2018 Guidance Backed by Continued Momentum in Segments For 2018, Dover guides adjusted earnings per share between $4.70 and $4.85, reflecting an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. This guidance factors in full-year revenue growth of 4-5%, which is comprised of organic growth of 3-4%. Acquisitions will contribute around 1% to growth while favorable impact from foreign currency translation will add 3%. These benefits will be partially offset by an impact of 3% from dispositions. The guidance also includes the impact of incremental share repurchases and impact of tax reform. Dover’s segments are poised for delivering growth in fiscal 2018. The company anticipates strong bookings in Engineered Systems and Fluids along with strong book-to-bill to drive organic revenues in 2018. Also marking and coding, digital printing and waste handling are expected to continue to performing well. In the Fluids segment, strong growth in the Pumps and hygienic and pharma businesses will drive results. Bearing and compression will be solid and retail fueling will sequentially improve. Within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, the company expects continued strong performance in heat exchangers and can-shaping equipment while retail refrigeration is anticipated to improve in the back half of the year as several customers step up the remodel activity. A Leaner Portfolio Will Drive Growth Dover persists with its efforts to simplify portfolio. In sync with this, the company has successfully completed the spin-off of its upstream energy businesses — Wellsite — which has been later named Apergy. Dover will now be a standalone company focused on industrial products and manufacturing equipment, while Apergy will be an independent public company. The Apergy spin-off is anticipated to enable Dover to concentrate on its less volatile core platforms by delivering innovative equipment and components, specialty systems, consumable supplies, software and digital solutions, and support services. Consequently, Dover's core platforms, which compete in lower volatility industrial markets, will be well poised to provide a strong foundation for reinvestment, long-term sustainable revenues, earnings growth and robust free cash flow generation. Earlier, Dover sold the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn for $250 million in the fourth quarter-2017. The company also completed the sale of Performance Motorsports International, a manufacturer of pistons and other engine related components serving the motorsports and powersports markets, for total proceeds of $0.1 million in first-quarter 2017. These steps will aid the company in streamlining business by investing in market-leading platforms with strong margin profiles, resilience to market volatility and bright prospects. Dover is also reviewing cost structure to right size the company and boost margins. The company plans to achieve around $55 million of cost savings in 2018. Headwinds Remain Dover expects to incur separation costs related to Apergy in the second quarter of 2018 in between $33 million and $35 million. This will impact the quarter’s margins. Also, Retail refrigeration in the second quarter will continue to be hurt by tough comparisons related to last year's strong shipments and softer overall markets.  Dover underperformed its industry with respect to share price performance in the past year. The stock has dipped 5.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 9%. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Dover carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Graco Inc. (GGG  -  Free Report) and IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report). While Applied Industrial Technologies and Graco sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), IDEX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Applied Industrial Technologies has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. Its shares have gone up 13% in the past year. Graco has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 10%. The company’s shares have surged 24% in the past year. IDEX has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 11%.

162,DOV,"On Apr 3, we issued an updated research report on business services provider, Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have been witnessing an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From 2010-2017, revenues of the company have recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues increased 26.6% year over year to $1,589.1 million while organic growth improved 7.8%.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is further likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to more than 1 billion customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has outperformed the industry with an average return of 3.9% in the last three months compared with a gain of 3.4% for the latter.At the same time, Cintas continues to benefit from the U.S. tax reform and provided bullish guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected to be $1,625-$1,645 million. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. This assumes a fiscal fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on its margins. Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, some customers have started to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.  Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and EnPro Industries, Inc.

Shares have lost about 14.8% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DOV due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Dover Beats on Q1 Earnings & Sales, Trims '18 EPS ViewDover Corporation reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.16, which increased 26% from 92 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by continued strength in businesses. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13.On a reported basis, Dover posted earnings per share of 84 cents for the quarter, which declined around 23% year over year. Earnings in the reported quarter included the Apergy separation-related costs of 6 cents, and rightsizing and other costs of 2 cents. It also comprised acquisition-related amortization costs of 24 cents.Total revenues increased 6% year over year to $1.92 billion in the quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billion.

166,DOV,"Despite starting the year on a positive note, the benchmark stock indexes lost most of their sheen in the last few weeks, thanks to elevated concerns over an impending trade war between the United States and China.Given the situation, the U.S. manufacturing sector is rife with apprehension regarding the rise in near-term prices of major inputs, skilled labor shortage and an increase in transportation costs.However, healthy growth drivers like Trump's impetus to foster infrastructure spending, reduced corporate tax rates as well as a rise in new orders and inventories have proved to be the pillars of strength for the industry.Although month over month performance has dipped this March, we envision that the U.S. manufacturing industry has enough credentials to spring back to its normal activity levels in the next couple of weeks.Henceforth, allocating your hard-earned money in selective industrial picks should bear fruit.        Supply-Side Restraints Ailing U.S. ManufacturingOverall anxiety regarding the probable impact of tariff had intensified after the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) polled its March manufacturing numbers. Falling shy of market expectations of 60.1%, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) touched 59.3%, down 1.5 percentage points from the preceding month.  U.S. manufacturers were worried about a trade war, even before Donald President had formally smacked tariffs on steel and aluminum in late March.The price index for March was 78.1%, up 3.9 percentage points from the previous month, striking the highest level since 2011. “There’s really no reason the price index went up except for the tariff issue” — per one-third of respondents to the ISM’s monthly survey.Situations worsened when Trump announced his plan to impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum, on Mar 9.Domestic steelmakers viewed this move as Trump’s initiative to revive the steel and aluminum industry that has been declining over the last few decades. However, manufacturing companies that use these metals as raw materials were hit hard with high price volatility.Industry players indicated that the tariff notice resulted in panic buying, which in turn raised near-term prices and caused a decline in inventories for non-contract customers. Especially electronic companies, hurt by one side-effect of the tariffs started to hoard steel in the expectation that prices will dramatically increase, going forward.Additionally, U.S. manufactures are also dealing with other supply-chain issues relating to skilled labor paucity, price upsurges in transportation and delivery delays. Notably, backlogs are building up in the American seaports, as cargos are more closely scrutinized for aluminum and steel content.Extended lead times and supply constraints have forced some companies to postpone or miss sales deadlines.Amid Qualms, U.S. Manufacturing Shows PromiseThe March PMI reading of higher than 50% verifies that economic activity is booming in the U.S. manufacturing sector. In fact, 17 out of the total 18 manufacturing industries that were surveyed, reported growth in March. This clearly shows that the U.S. industrial sector is progressing steadily.In February, industrial production made a turnaround after a blink-and-miss activity in January. The Fed’s board of governors stated that industrial production inched up 1.1% in February, as against the decline of 0.3% in the prior month. Also, capacity utilization moved up 0.7% to 78.1 in February, touching the record level since January 2015.Manufacturing upturn is currently backed by growth in production activity, new orders and inventories, with struggling supply side conditions.Per March data, ISM’s New Orders Index and Production Index were both above 60%, signifying that production expansion prevailed amid demand-supply glut, along with capacity and labor restraints.As per an economist at Capital Economics, “the near-term prospects for the manufacturing sector and the broader economy still appear brighter than they have been at any point over the past five years.”We note that the Industrial Products sector (counting the U.S. manufacturing stocks) is currently placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors.Per the latest Earnings Preview (dated Apr 6, 2018), earnings and revenues of all the Industrial stocks on the S&P 500 group will climb 23.9% and 12.3%, respectively, year over year, for the January-March quarter.Improved spending in non-residential construction and residential housing, entry of smarter products and Internet of Things (IoT), rise in new orders, sturdier production activity, heavier inventories and reduced corporate tax rates are anticipated to fuel the sector’s growth going forward.5 Hot Manufacturing PicksIn order to cash in on the solid growth potential of the industry, we have handpicked five manufacturing stocks that will likely enrich your portfolio.These companies have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and delivered a positive average earnings surprise in the last four quarters.Notably, over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for these picks has been revised upward for 2018 and these stocks also showcase positive earnings per share (EPS) growth for 2019.Let's dig a little deep into these five choices to get a fair idea of their individual skill sets.Axon Enterprise, Inc.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

167,DOV,"We have issued an updated research report on Colfax Corporation (CFX  -  Free Report) on Apr 11.Exposures in emerging markets, focus on innovative products and gains from buyouts are to benefit Colfax in the years ahead. However, industry competition, rising costs and expenses remain prime concerns.Despite solid growth opportunities that are stemming from inorganic strategies — including both acquisition of meaningful businesses and divestment of non-core assets — and healthy segmental businesses, we believe that this machinery company faces several headwinds that can jeopardize financial performance in the near-term.The company, with $3.8 billion market capitalization, currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Below, we have briefly discussed the prevalent headwinds for Colfax. Share Price Performance and Earnings Estimate Revision: In the last three months, Colfax’s shares have edged down 25.8%, worse than 7.3% decline recorded by the industry.Also, earnings estimates of the company for both 2018 and 2019 were decreased by two brokerage firms. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $2.10 for 2018 and $2.34 for 2019, reflecting the decline of 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively, from the 60-day ago tallies.Colfax Corporation Price and Consensus  Colfax Corporation Price and Consensus | Colfax Corporation QuoteThreats From Order Weakness, High Costs and Huge Debts: In 2017, orders for Colfax’s Air and Gas Handling segment suffered from weakness in power generation, oil, gas & petrochemical and mining markets. We believe that persistence of such weakness might be detrimental to the segmental performance. The company expects organic revenues for the Air and Gas Handling segment to be flat to down 2% in 2018.Also, rising costs and expenses, as well as a high debt level, if unchecked, can prove detrimental to the company’s profitability. For instance, cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 7.8% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17%. Gross and operating margin slipped 20 and 200 basis points, respectively, in the quarter. Also, long-term debt was roughly $1.1 billion while exiting the quarter. Overseas Operations Raise Risks: Expansion of business in international arenas exposed Colfax to risks, arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies. Also, uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served can severely impact the company’s businesses. Moreover, Colfax also procures raw materials, including metals, castings, motors, seals and bearings, from international suppliers. Changes in foreign nations’ pricing policies can hurt the company’s supply channel. Industry Competition an Issue: Colfax faces stiff competition from companies that are offering similar products and services or those which are producing different items for same uses. Some key players in the industry are DXP Enterprises, Inc. (DXPE  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and Kadant Inc. (KAI  -  Free Report). While DXP Enterprises sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Dover and Kadant carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

169,DOV,"The Q1 earnings season performance so far has been promising and seems on track to deliver the best quarterly performance in more than six years. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 20% for this earnings season driven by a 8% rise in revenues. If this materializes, it would surpass fourth-quarter 2017 results where the S&P 500 recorded 13.4% earnings growth on 8.6% revenue growth. To date, 154 S&P 500 members have released results, logging year-over-year earnings growth of 25% on 10.3% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends. Industrial Sector Poised for Double Digit Growth The Industrial Products sector, currently placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors, is one of the sectors which are expected to record double-digit earnings growth, mainly driven by the U.S. tax reform. According to our latest projections, the sector is anticipated to log an earnings growth of 34.5% in first-quarter 2018 on the back of 15.2% rise in revenues. So far, 45.8% of the members in the sector have reported first-quarter numbers delivering 58% growth in earnings and 18.7% rise in revenues. Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks. For first-quarter 2018, industrial production — a measure of output at factories, mines and utilities — rose at an annual rate of 4.5%. Further, the U.S Architecture Billings Index (“ABI”), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine-to-12 month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 51 in March — increasing for the sixth straight month. Notably, any score more than 50 indicates billings growth and reflects a healthy business environment. Per the latest report of the Institute for Supply Management (“ISM”), Purchasing Managers Index (""PMI”) was 59.3% in March. This indicates strong growth in manufacturing for the 19th consecutive month, led by continued expansion in new orders, production activity, employment and inventories. A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding. New orders index is at 61.9, remaining at or above 60 for the 11th straight month.  Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 17 industries reported growth in March. The only exception being Apparel, Leather & Allied Products. It will be interesting to see how some of the machinery stocks fare when they release first-quarter 2018 numbers on Apr 27. Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report), a global diversified manufacturer of industrial products, is set to release quarterly results before the opening bell. Dover reported a year-over-year increase in both revenues and earnings in the last reported quarter and also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates. Dover has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 7.26%. Dover Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Dover Corporation price-eps-surprise | Dover Corporation QuoteStrong booking trends and significant drilling activity will drive the company’s performance in the first quarter. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Fluids, Energy and Engineered Systems segments is likely to witness revenue growth. However, the Refrigeration and Food Equipment segment is likely to observe a decline in revenues due to prevalent softness in the commercial cooking equipment markets.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dover is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Thus, the company appears to be a potential investment proposition at the moment.Above the Industry: Over the past year, Dover has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have jumped around 15% compared with 14% growth recorded by the industry during the same time frame. Upward Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for 2018 has surged 30% to $2.09 in the last 90 days. The same for 2019 has gone up 25% to $6.42 in the same time period.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Dover has an impressive earnings surprise history. It outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 7.26%.Strong Q4 Results: Dover’s fourth-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues climbed 49% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis, and also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The mid-point of the earnings guidance range reflects year-over-year growth of 19%. The company expects adjusted segment margin to expand 110 basis points to approximately 15.3% from 2017 levels. Dover’s results will witness positive impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.In addition, sound growth in the Pumps, and hygienic and pharma businesses, as well as improved productivity, especially within the retail refrigeration business will stoke Dover’s growth.Commercial excellence programs, productivity and retail fueling integration will continue to drive margin expansion. Moreover, its Energy businesses are likely to witness double-digit growth as a result of volume leverage.Growth Drivers in Place: In December 2017, Dover decided to spin-off its Wellsite business into a stand-alone, publicly-traded company in order to simplify its portfolio.

174,DOV,"On Apr 3, we issued an updated research report on business services provider, Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have been witnessing an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From 2010-2017, revenues of the company have recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues increased 26.6% year over year to $1,589.1 million while organic growth improved 7.8%.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is further likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to more than one million customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has outperformed the industry with an average return of 3.9% in the last three months compared with a gain of 3.4% for the latter.At the same time, Cintas continues to benefit from the U.S. tax reform and provided bullish guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected to be $1,625-$1,645 million. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. This assumes a fiscal fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on its margins. Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, some customers have started to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.  Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and EnPro Industries, Inc. (NPO  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

178,DOV,"On Mar 23, the U.S. Commerce Department published durable goods orders data for the month of February. The report showed strong business spending at US factories for expensive durable items such as machinery and vehicles.Positive durable goods orders data came as a huge relief following the retail sales decline in February, which roused fears of an impending recession. Notably, the data was also an improvement from the contraction experienced in January.Fundamentals of the economy remain solid. Recently, the Fed revised 2018 GDP projection to 2.7% from earlier estimate of 2.5%. Investor confidence remains high buoyed by a robust labor market, low inflationary expectations and anticipation of sustained earnings momentum. At this stage, it will make good sense to invest in those stocks from the industrials arena which possess strong fundamentals.Robust Durable Goods Data The Department of Commerce’s data showed that new orders for durable goods increased 3.1% in February after two straight monthly declines. The figure outpaced the consensus estimate of 1.7%. This strong showing can be attributed to a jump of 7.1% in transportation equipment orders. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft grew 1.8%, reflecting biggest gain in five months.Core capital goods shipments increased 1.4%. This was the largest increase experienced since December 2016. This metric is used for calculating equipment spending which is part of the government’s GDP measurement. A jump in industrial production supported by strong demand for machineries utilized mainly in factory production clearly indicates that the likelihood of a near-term recession is uncalled for. Trump’s Tariffs and Trade War Remain Concerns Earlier this month, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium import to shore up these struggling industries. Many industry researchers have stated that imposition of tariffs by the United States will prompt affected countries to retaliate by imposing tariffs on U.S. products, paving the way for a full blown global trade war.Fear of trade war has shaken the U.S. stock markets in the last week. Over the last five days, Dow 30 was down 5.7%, S&P 500 declined 2.1% and Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.4%. Consequently, S&P Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) also declined 5.01% in the last five days.However, spending on capital goods surged in February supported by solid business confidence, improvement in international economic growth and a weakening dollar. A cheap dollar makes U.S. manufacturing sector competitive boosting the demand for home-made goods. Notably, manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 12% of the U.S. GDP. These are the factors which are likely to outweigh trade related concerns in the weeks ahead.Our Top Picks Rising Durable Goods Orders are normally associated with stronger economic activity.  At present, the U.S. economy is firmly placed on growth trajectory barring minor corrections. Additionally, Trump administration’s decision to cut tax rate from 35% to 21% has been a shot in the arm for the United States.Further, the government has taken a decision to spend a whopping $1.5 trillion on several infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years. This decision is likely to create about 25 million new jobs over a decade, which will spur higher consumer spending. This in turn will fuel long-term economic growth.Considering these positives, investment on durable-goods producing stocks with high growth potential will be a wise decision. We narrowed down our choice to five stocks each of which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows how our five picks outperformed the S&P 500 benchmark in the last three months. Dover Corp.

180,DOV,"Trump’s long-awaited $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan, rising employment levels, upbeat wage rates, increasing consumer confidence and a modest inflation will likely bring to the forefront some bullish stocks within the industrial products market.The Zacks Industrial Products sector flaunts a Zacks Rank #1, at present (out of 16 sectors). Hence, top-performing stocks from this sector will make valuable additions to any portfolio.Among the numerous potential gainers, adding RBC Bearings Incorporated (ROLL  -  Free Report) to your portfolio will be a promising move.Over the last month, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have rallied 8.1%, outperforming 4.9% growth recorded by the industry.Promising AspectsTactical Business Strategy: RBC Bearings intends to become the leading provider of precision engineered components and bearings in the market. The company intends to meet this goal backed by strategic acquisitions, customer-base enlargement, business expansion in new end-markets, higher aftermarket sales and development of innovative solutions.Top-Line Prospects: RBC Bearings believes robust industrial original equipment manufacturers’ (OEM) demand, and higher industrial distribution and aftermarket sales will drive its industrial sales in the quarters ahead. On the other hand, elevated Aero OEM’s demand and augmented build rates of single-aisle planes are expected to bolster the company’s aerospace revenues.The company intends to report revenues in the range of $172-$175 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (estimating year-over-year increment of 7.4-9.2%).Notably, the stock’s projected sales growth rates for fiscal 2018 and 2019 are pegged at 8.84% and 9.14%, respectively.Profitability: RBC Bearings has been strengthening its bottom-line performance with higher revenues and wider margins.The above graph shows that the company’s earnings per share (EPS) have been improving for the last few quarters. Notably, we notice that in the fiscal third quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings per share was up 43.8% year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.09%.During the fiscal third quarter, the company’s adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points year over year. Per management, this upside stemmed from the company’s cost-reduction initiatives, consolidation programs and production-process improvements. These moves will likely continue to enhance RBC Bearings’ profitability in the near term.Also, we believe lower corporate tax rates (as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act) will help boost the company’s profitability.Liquidity: RBC Bearings has been improving its liquidity on the back of increased cash generation over the past few quarters. The company intends to lower its debt burden, fund new growth-oriented investments and provide higher returns to shareholders with these proceeds. For instance, in third-quarter fiscal 2018, RBC Bearings lowered its debt by $73.1 million.Upward Estimate Revisions: Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RBC Bearings moved 8% upward to $3.91 and 13% to $4.68 for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively.The positive earnings estimate revision indicates upbeat sentiments and substantiates the Zacks Rank #1 for this stock.The stock’s projected EPS growth rates for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 are pegged at 23.3% and 19.8%, respectively.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

181,DOV,"On Mar 26, we issued an updated research report on Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (APOG  -  Free Report). The company is poised to gain from a growing construction market, focus on operational improvements and the impact of the U.S. tax reform. However, rising costs are expected to dent its performance in near future.Let’s illustrate the factors in detail.Growing Construction Market to Aid ResultsFor fiscal 2019, Apogee anticipates double-digit revenue growth and triple-digit basis-point improvement in its operating margin. Apogee believes that the North American commercial construction markets will grow throughout fiscal 2020 as market activity, Architecture Billings Index (ABI), office employment and office vacancy rates exhibit a positive momentum.In February 2018, the ABI score was 52.0. A score above 50 indicates sustainable growth in architectural activity. With internal market visibility from backlog, commitments and bidding activity, along with external metrics moving in the right direction, the company foresees continued market growth for next few years.Operational Improvements Remains on TrackIn January 2018, Apogee announced closing its Viracon architectural glass plant in St. George, UT, to counter the headwinds of the glass business. It remains confident that despite the closure, given the capacity additions elsewhere and productivity investments made over the past five years, it will have adequate glass capacity to cater to the peak commercial construction market demand.U.S. Tax Reform to Boost EarningsApogee anticipates a favorable impact of one or two cents per share in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 favored by a lower federal tax rate due to the tax reform. For fiscal 2019, Apogee expects a tax rate of 23-24% compared with prior estimates of around 33%, which will be beneficial to its bottom line.Elevated Costs Led to Guidance CutApogee lowered its fiscal 2018 guidance due to lower-than-expected volume and pricing in the Architectural Glass segment and higher-than-expected healthcare costs. In addition, the trimmed outlook reflects charges that will result from the restructuring activities in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. It expects to incur $4.5 million or 11 cents per share of restructuring costs in the fiscal fourth quarter.The company also narrowed its revenue growth guidance to around 20%, due to hurricane-related delays and other project timing. The reduction is mainly driven by lower volume leverage, higher healthcare costs and price mix at the Architectural Glass segment. It also trimmed its earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2018 to $2.58-$2.68.Share Price PerformanceApogee’s shares significantly underperformed the industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The industry edged down 5.7%, while the stock lost around 24.2% over the same time frame. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderApogee currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Dover Corp. (DOV  -  Free Report), Ashtead Group PLC (ASHTY  -  Free Report) and Cimpress N.V. (CMPR  -  Free Report). Each stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Dover has long-term earnings growth rate of 13%. Its shares rallied 26% over the past year.Ashtead Group has long-term earnings growth rate of 15%. Its shares increased 36% during the past year.Cimpress has long-term earnings growth rate of 14.5%. The stock gained 96% in a year’s time.Today's Stocks From Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

183,DOV,"We believe Sandvik AB (SDVKY  -  Free Report) is a solid choice for investors, seeking exposure in the machinery space. Solid order intake, divestment initiatives to strengthen core business and a focus on innovative products will bode well for the company.The stock, with roughly $23.8-billion market capitalization, was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on Mar 22.In the last three months, the company’s shares have rallied 6.3%, outperforming 3.8% decline of the industry. Why the Upgrade?Sandvik delivered better-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 with earnings of 27 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents by 42.11%. Profitability improved on the back of higher demand for products, focus on product innovation and initiatives to control costs. Revenues grew 15% year over year while order growth of 15% clearly signifies growing customers’ preferences for its products.For 2018, Sandvik anticipates capital expenditures to be approximately SEK 4 billion. Favorable metal prices are likely to be in excess of SEK 100 million on Sandvik Materials Technology’s operating profit in the first quarter of the year. Also, the company proposed a dividend of SEK 3.50 per share to be paid for 2017. This represents an increase of 27% over the year-ago dividend rate.Sandvik’s consolidation efforts will help to strengthen its core businesses. Notably, it closed the divestment of its Mining Systems in November 2017 while some of its businesses in South Africa were sold in March 2018. Also, it sold off the welding wire business in January 2018 while divested its Process Systems business in December 2017. The company reached an agreement of divesting Hyperion; closure is anticipated in the first half of 2018. Hyperion divestment will generate capital gain upon closing.Offering new and innovative products to its customers as well as investing in leverage benefits from new business opportunities has been a priority for Sandvik over time. In February 2018, it invested SEK 200 million in a plant for the development of titanium and nickel powders. In the future, it anticipates a large market for these metal powers in additive manufacturing. The company also set up a new manufacturing facility in South Africa, which will assist in the production of Sandvik LH115L five-ton LHDs for local markets. New products, including Ranger DXi and the new screening media, Sandvik WX6500 titanium and nickel fine metal were introduced in August 2017.In the last 60 days, the company’s earnings estimates for 2018 was revised upward by two brokerage firms while that for 2019 was revised upward by one brokerage firm.

186,DOV,"On Feb 19, we issued an updated research report on Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report). The company is poised to gain from the Wirtgen acquisition, higher housing starts, and improving oil and gas sector. However, the company’s lackluster agriculture business and elevated expenses are expected to dent its performance in the near future.  Let’s illustrate the factors in detail.Wirtgen Acquisition to Boost Deere’s Construction BusinessIn December 2017, Deere acquired world’s leading road-construction equipment maker — Wirtgen — for $5.2 billion in cash and debt. This buyout will aid Deere’s North America-centric construction business expand to a global scale and also catapult it to the position of an industry leader in global road construction. The transaction is also anticipated to add about 56% of its Construction & Forestry segment’s sales in fiscal 2018.Higher Housing Starts a Boon for DeereDeere projects global sales for the Construction & Forestry equipment to be up a massive 80% in fiscal 2018, driven by higher housing starts in the United States. Single-family housing starts are strong across all regions in the nation. Further, increasing wages and job growth reinforce the outlook for growing housing starts.Per the latest report of the U.S. Census Bureau, housing starts in January 2018 came in 9.7% higher than the December tally and are up 7.3% year over year. This January, U.S. new-home construction grew to the highest level since October 2016. It is expected that this momentum in the housing market will continue through the year.Stabilizing Oil Prices to Fuel GrowthDeere estimates that its construction investment will be up 2.2% in fiscal 2018, higher than the previous forecast of 1.4%. The increase is primarily being led by oil and gas, and residential activity. Oil prices are estimated to average above $58 a barrel for the fiscal. In addition, machinery rental utilization rates continue to improve and rental pricing continues to gain positive traction.Agriculture Business a Concern for DeereDeere’s agriculture business will be affected in fiscal 2018 by the expectation of high global grain and oil seed stocks-to-use ratios. This is because abundant crops have offset strong demand around the world. Further, the U.S. farm cash receipts are estimated to be $372 billion, approximately 1% lower than fiscal 2017, as gains from oil crops are offset by declines in feed crops.Adverse Impact of Tax ReformDeere’s earnings will be hurt by the impact of the tax reform in fiscal 2018. The company recorded equipment operations tax rate of 422% in first-quarter fiscal 2018, primarily due to the impact of the tax reform. For the remainder of the fiscal, the effective tax rate is projected in the range of 25-27%, which implies an effective tax rate of approximately 62% for fiscal 2018.Escalating Expenses to Impede Deere’s ProfitIn addition, Deere will be affected by elevated expenses in the current fiscal. Its guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales is about 75% for the fiscal. The company believes an unfavorable product mix, elevated overhead spending and increased incentive compensation will drive the cost of sales guidance. Deere also forecasts SA&G expense to flare up nearly 23% in the fiscal. These expenses will dampen earnings.Share Price PerformanceDeere has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance in a year’s time. The stock has appreciated around 54.5%, while the industry has recorded growth of 44.8% during the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDeere currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report), W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) and H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

188,DOV,"We issued an updated research report on Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) on Mar 19. A vast customer base in various end markets, gains from 80/20 business process and sound capital allocation strategies are key drivers for the company. On the flip side, risks related to international operations, high debts and industry competition remain concerning.The industrial tool maker, with a market capitalization of approximately $58.4 billion, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Illinois Tool WorksShare Price Performance and Earnings Estimates Revision: Illinois Tool Works’ financial performance remained better than expected over the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.16%. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.70 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.94%.In the last six months, the company’s shares yielded 15.7% return, outperforming 10% gain of the industry.In the last 60 days, nine brokerage firms raised the company’s earnings estimates for 2018, while five increased for 2019. However, estimates for both the years were lowered by one brokerage firm. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $7.71 for 2018 and $8.39 for 2019, representing growth of 5.6% and 4.9% from their respective tallies, 60 days ago.Near- and Long-Term Growth Potential Solid: Illinois Tool Works operates through seven business segments — Test & Measurement and Electronics, Automotive OEM, Polymers & Fluids, Food Equipment, Welding, Construction Products and Specialty Products — largely minimizing its risks of loss from the poor performance of any group. Also, a vast customer base in various end-markets, including automotive original equipment manufacturer, automotive aftermarket, general industrial, commercial food equipment, construction and others, is beneficial. Moreover, its 80/20 business process will help it achieve higher operating margins, better capital efficiency and solid return on invested capital.For the first quarter of 2018, the company anticipates GAAP earnings to be $1.80-$1.90 per share. Organic revenues are expected to grow 3-4% in the quarter. For the full year, GAAP earnings guidance has been increased to $7.45-$7.65 per share, reflecting 40 cents growth at the mid-point. The increase reflects the positive impact of tax rate cuts to 25-26% and forex gains.Over the long term (2018 to 2022), the company anticipates organic revenue growth to be 3-5%, operating margin to be in excess of 25%, incremental margin to be 35% and earnings per share to grow 8-10% in each year. Also, after-tax return on invested capital is projected to be above 20%. Free cash flow will likely be more than 100% of the net income.Capital Allocation Strategies: Illinois Tool Works follows sound capital allocation strategies, under which it makes meaningful acquisitions for business expansion, invests for the enhancement of its organic growth and rewards shareholders handsomely.Over time, acquisitions have helped in the development of the company’s core segments while creating new platforms for expanding long-term growth opportunities. Since it got acquired in July 2016, the Engineered Fasteners and Components business has strengthened the company’s Automotive OEM business.The company remains committed toward returning value to shareholders. It raised quarterly dividend rate by 20% in August 2017 and intends to increase the dividend payout rate from 43% to 50% of free cash in August 2018. Earlier, the company expected the dividend rate increment in 2020. However, this increment is still subject to the company’s board approval.Factors Working Against Illinois Tool WorksThreats From International Expansion: Global expansion has exposed Illinois Tool Works to risks rising from adverse movements in foreign currencies. Also, uncertainties in economic growth of the countries served can severely impact its businesses. Its products are sold in 56 countries. Notably, it sourced nearly 56% of its revenues from its international operations.Huge Debts Raise Concerns: Illinois Tool Works’ long-term debt was approximately $7.5 billion exiting the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe, if unchecked, huge debt levels will increase its financial obligations and hence, prove detrimental to its profitability.Industry Competition: Illinois Tool Works faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Also, difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services, apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market, might hurt its competitive edge.Some key players in the industry, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for each of these stocks improved for the current year and the next year.

189,DOV,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) recently unveiled a Low-Lead Brass body (LLB) series of solenoid valves for the beverage dispensing industry. The latest LLB series of solenoid valves is suitable for various potential uses in dispensing systems like cold, hot and superheated water shut-off, boiler water-loading control, steam control, steam mixing and steam pressure control.Notably, the valves feature stainless steel pilots and are designed to improve valve life, endurance as well as resistance to limescale accumulation. The valve body is composed of CW510L brass (containing less than 0.25% lead) and the design maintains high system reliability that minimizes equipment failure risk apart from avoiding potential downtime. The metal structure also allows high temperature variations, heat transfer and high durability required in beverage dispensing systems.Our TakeParker-Hannifin has benefited tremendously from the global restructuring initiatives undertaken in the past few quarters. Apart from this, the company is streamlining business and corporate functions as well as removing complex bureaucracy from organizational structure to create a leaner frame. Furthermore, it has devised a complimentary business realignment action, which when combined with the simplification initiative is likely to strengthen the manufacturing footprint, going forward.Moreover, the company’s eye on strategic acquisitions and alliances has bolstered its core business. For instance, the CLARCOR buyout has strengthened the company’s filtration product suite consequently driving revenue growth. Also, its other acquisitions including Arnold Jäger Holding GmbH‘s operating units, President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation might prove to be major catalysts for the company’s growth moving ahead.In the past six months, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock yielded a return of 15.8% outperforming the industry’s growth of 12%.This apart, the company recently completed two years of implementation of the Win Strategy and remains bullish about delivering fundamental financial goals. The strategy has started delivering immediate results and unlocking further opportunities to drive ongoing EPS growth for the next several years. We believe that the improvised Win Strategy will aid Parker-Hannifin to stay firmly on the growth track.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the same space include Cimpress N.V (CMPR  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and CIRCOR International, Inc.

190,DOV,"We issued an updated research report on Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) on Feb 2, 2018. Dover will benefit from its efforts to simplify its portfolio, cost-saving actions, drilling activity and opportunities in the fast-growing digital textile printing market. Upbeat Q4, Fiscal 2018 Guidance Dover’s fourth-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues surged 49% and 13% respectively on a year-over-year basis, and also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The strong performance was driven by strong global markets along with cost and productivity improvements.  Bookings at the end of the fourth quarter were worth $1.97 billion, up from $1.74 billion at the end of fourth-quarter 2016. Backlog also increased to $1.23 billion at the end of the quarter from $1.08 billion at the year-ago quarter end. The company is thus poised for an improved first-quarter 2018 performance. Further, significant drilling activity over the last few quarters has created a large backlog of drilled but incomplete wells. Dover anticipates many of these wells to be completed over the coming quarters, consequently driving performance. Dover guides its earnings per share for full-year 2018 to be in the range of $5.73-$5.93, reflecting a 45% rise over the prior year. Full-year revenue growth is projected in the 3-5% range, which comprises organic growth of 5-7% and a favorable impact from foreign exchange of 1%, partially offset by a 3% impact from dispositions. Going forward, Dover anticipates its effective tax rate to be 22-23%, 4 to 5 points lower than its prior effective rate, due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A Leaner Portfolio Will Drive Growth Dover continues efforts to simplify its portfolio. Dover has decided to spin-off its Wellsite business into a stand-alone, publicly-traded company and expects the transaction to close by May 2018, subject to certain customary conditions. Dover's Wellsite business that includes Dover Artificial Lift, Dover Energy Automation and US Synthetic, operates in the oil & gas drilling and production industry. This spin-off will help Dover focus on its less volatile core platforms.  Dover had earlier sold the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn and Performance Motorsports International. These steps will aid the company in streamlining business along with investing in market-leading platforms that have strong market positions, margin profiles and are less volatile with bright prospects. Dover is also reviewing cost structure to right size the company and boost margins. The company plans to achieve around $55 million of cost savings in 2018. Strategic Acquisitions Bode Well Dover has a long tradition of making successful acquisitions in diverse end markets. During fiscal 2017, the company acquired three businesses in separate transactions for a total consideration of $43.1 million. The businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Engineered Systems and Energy segments. Recently, Dover acquired Ettlinger and its affiliated entities, in a bid to boost its presence in the plastics and polymers-processing equipment industry. Per the deal, Ettlinger will become a part of the Maag business unit within Dover's Fluids segment. Ettlinger’s high-performance filtration systems will fortify Maag’s position in the plastics-processing equipment industry. Segments Poised for Long-Term Growth Dover will benefit from the opportunities in the fast-growing digital textile printing market. From the current 3-4% rate, the company anticipates the penetration rate of digital technology to surge 30% over the next decade. The company’s comprehensive solutions, including equipment, ink and software, positions it well to fully capitalize on this technology shift. Within retail fueling, the EMV upgrade cycle in the United States will accelerate, as customers begin preparing for compliance with payment regulations that go into effect in 2020. Further, Dover’s offering expansion in remote monitoring and software-as-a-service provides ample scope for future expansion.  In refrigeration, food retailers in an effort to manage operating cost and differentiate themselves in the market, are now investing in closed-door refrigeration cases, energy-efficient systems and in specialized display cases. Dover will benefit from this demand as it has a leading position in these categories. The industrial pump business will gain, driven by the increased use of plastics globally and customers' need for improved efficiency. The company commands a leading position in pelletizers and other polymer processing equipment due to its high output, faster changeovers and more compact designs. These catalysts, along with its margin improvement initiatives will drive growth over the next few years. Upward Estimate Revisions Notably, over the past seven days, the estimates for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 have witnessed upward revision of 20% and 17%, respectively, following its upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is pegged at $5.53, depicting  year-over-year growth of 37.2%. The same for fiscal 2019 is $6.23, reflecting 12.5% year-over-year growth.  Dover carries a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 13%. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four trailing quarters, leading to an average positive earnings surprise history of 13%.   Given these positives, Dover outperformed its industry with respect to share price performance in the past year. The stock has gained 34%, while the industry recorded growth of 31%. Dover carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Some other stocks in the same sector include Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), Graco Inc. (GGG  -  Free Report) and Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry the same rank as Dover. Caterpillar has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%. Its shares have appreciated 70% in the last year. Graco has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 10.5%. The company’s shares have surged 51% in the past year. Applied Industrial Technologies has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. Its shares have gone up 22% in the past year. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.

192,DOV,"A few industrial machinery companies have lined up to report quarterly numbers on Jan 30.  The industrial products sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors) is among the Zacks sectors anticipated to rack up the strongest gains in the fourth quarter. Overall fourth-quarter earnings for the sector are projected to climb 29.5% while revenues are expected to go up 13.7%, per the latest projections. The fourth-quarter earnings projections for the industrial sector is backed by upbeat manufacturing data, strong housing and commercial construction markets, growth in job additions and an improving U.S economy. Industrial production, which is considered one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks, jumped 8.2% at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. It is a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. The upbeat performance can be attributed to a 7% jump in manufacturing and 12.7% in mining output in the quarter. Further, it has gained 3.6% in a year, logging its biggest calendar-year gain since 2010. Manufacturing activity also closed on a high in 2017 as evident from the December PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) reading of 59.7, per the Institute for Supply Management (“ISM”). The reading also marked the fastest pace of expansion since 2011. The PMI is an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector with a reading above 50 signalling increased factory activity. The score can be attributed to strong expansion in new orders and production, both delivering positive growth trends for 16 straight months. Further, 16 of 18 industries delivered growth during the month. With this reading, manufacturing has delivered positive growth for 16 consecutive months. Notably, in 2017, the ISM manufacturing index averaged the highest readings for a calendar year since the last 13 years. In the past year, the industrial products sector has clocked a gain of 27.1%, ahead of the S&P 500’s advance of 19.6%. The industrial products sector is currently enjoying a Zacks Sector Rank of 5.

194,DOV,"Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) remains well poised for growth, banking on synergy benefits from the Rexam acquisition, the U.S. tax reform and the company’s focus on expanding geographic footprint. However, decline in domestic beer consumption, demand volatility in the EMEA region and competition in Brazil remain concerning.The metal packaging products supplier, with a market capitalization of approximately $14 billion, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Ball CorporationNorthbound EstimatesInvestors should consider the positive trends on the estimate revision front. Analysts have been raising their estimates for Ball Corporation lately, resulting in a favorable earnings picture.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and current quarter moved up around 2.7% and 4.9%, respectively.The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 5.5%.Value Growth Momentum (VGM) ScoreBall Corporation currently has a Zacks VGM score of B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of B, along with some other key metrics, makes the company a solid choice for investors.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryBall Corporation has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.51%Price PerformanceThe company has outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past year. The stock has gained 8.8%, while the industry recorded growth of 5.8%.Higher Inventory Turnover RatioOver the trailing 12 months, the inventory turnover ratio for Ball Corporation has been 5.8% compared with the industry’s level of 5.5%. A higher inventory turnover than the industry average implies that inventory is sold at a faster rate, suggesting inventory management effectiveness.Growth Drivers in PlaceIn 2018, Ball Corporation will focus primarily on expanding its geographic footprint, aligning with the right customers and markets, growing with new products and capabilities, and leveraging the company’s technical knowhow. In sync with this, Ball Corporation’s construction of a state-of-the-art specialty beverage can-manufacturing facility in Goodyear, AZ, is right on schedule and budget, with production beginning early in the second half of 2018. Further, construction is on track at the company's new aluminum beverage-can facility in Madrid, Spain, which is scheduled to commence production by mid-2018. The company also stated that the Colorado facility expansions in Westminster and Boulder, CO, are on track for completion in the fourth quarter this year.Further, Ball Corporation remains optimistic about the tax reform which will likely benefit its end markets. The company estimates that the Act will reduce its effective tax rate on comparable earnings from approximately 25% in 2017 to around 23% in the current year.Ball Corporation’s Aerospace segment will benefit from its focus on world-class technology and proficiency, and year-over-year earnings growth. Regarding the Rexam acquisition, the company remains on track to achieve its 2019 targets largely through the stated synergy benefits from the transaction. From the synergy perspective, it had a three-and-a-half year plan to realize $300 million of net synergies.Headwinds for Ball CorporationIn 2018, Ball Corporation continues to be plagued with headwinds in domestic beer consumption due to pressure on domestic mass beer declines. In Brazil, Ball Corporation’s volume growth in 2018 is predicted to be slower than the market rate due to intense competition. The company also anticipates tougher year-over-year comparison in the second half of 2018 for the business, due to the lack of profit recorded on the INS manufacturing contract in 2017. Also, the company’s performance will be marred by volatile volumes in the EMEA beverage can business driven by governmental regulation.Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock, at present, as it has ample prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Mobile Mini, Inc. (MINI  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and Ashtead Group plc (ASHTY  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

197,DOV,"On Feb 7, we issued an updated research report on the mining and construction equipment behemoth, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report). With its end markets — construction, mining and energy showing positive momentum lately, the company seems poised for an improved 2018. Stellar Q4 Performance Caterpillar delivered an upbeat fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share soaring 160%, while revenues improved 35%. The improvement can be attributed to higher sales volume, owing to improved end-user demand across all regions and most end markets. This marked the company’s fourth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom-line growth, after a string of dismal performances for four years. Retail Sales on a Growth Path Caterpillar reported a 34% rise in global retail sales for the three months ended December 2017, with improvement noted across all regions — registering its best performance last year. Within Machines, Resource Industries and Construction Industries reported positive gains for the sixth and eleventh consecutive months, respectively, and scaled 2017-peak levels in December. Energy & Transportation’s retail sales improved for the fourth consecutive month. The company’s overall retail sales growth graph has remained in the positive territory since March 2017. In fact, the company witnessed a 1% rise in machine retail sales in March, which put an end to its unprecedented 51-month long stretch of declining sales. Retail sales averaged 10.3% in 2017.  Given its turnaround performance, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year. Shares have surged 64.3% while the industry registered growth of 63.8%. 2018 View Upbeat Strong sales momentum resulting from strong order rates, lean dealer inventories and an increasing backlog bode well for an improved 2018 performance. Given these factors, along with positive economic indicators globally and many of the company’s end markets, Caterpillar initiated adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.25-$9.25 for fiscal 2018. The midpoint of the guidance range reflects 27% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 for revenues and earnings is at $50.5 billion and $9.09, respectively. Estimates for Caterpillar have moved up in the past 30 days, reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts. The earnings estimate have gone up 16% for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 10.33%. Segments Poised for Growth Caterpillar expects growth in Construction Industries in 2018, with some moderation in the latter part of the year due to anticipated seasonality of sales in China. Most other APAC countries are expected to grow, attributed to investments in infrastructure. In North America, continued improvement in residential and non-residential construction as well as revival in infrastructure demand will drive revenues. President Trump’s plans of big spending in infrastructure would boost Caterpillar’s revenues, since it is expected to play a major role in the national infrastructure plan. Global economic momentum and increasing commodity prices is restoring miners’ profitability and resuming capital spending. This bodes well for the Resource Industries segment. Rebuild and aftermarket demand should continue as fleet utilization increases. Demand for new equipment also grows with an extension of existing mines. Coming to the Energy & Transportation segment, sales into Oil and Gas applications are expected to increase in 2018, led by reciprocating engines for gas compression and well-servicing activity in North America. Sales to Transportation sector will benefit from recent acquisitions in rail services. Restructuring, Expanded Offerings to Drive Growth In September 2015, Caterpillar set out with significant restructuring and cost reduction initiative, with actions expected through 2018. Once fully implemented, the plan would lower annual operating costs by about $1.5 billion. This includes the consolidation or closure of more than 30 facilities and reduction of workforce by more than 16,000. Caterpillar continues to focus on customers and on the future by continuing to invest in digital capabilities, connecting assets and jobsites along with developing the next generation of more productive and efficient products. The company is readying factories and suppliers to meet increased demand, while remaining focused on developing a more competitive and flexible cost structure. This should enable it to respond quickly if economic fundamentals change. The company is in the early stages of implementing its strategy for profitable growth. During 2018, the company will continue to make additional investments in expanded offerings and services important for long-term success. It will use Operating & Execution Model to divert resources to areas that represent the greatest opportunity for return on investments. Caterpillar currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  Other top-ranked companies in the industrial product space include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.(AIT  -  Free Report), H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report) and Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) . All these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Applied Industrial Technologies has an expected long-term growth of 12%. Its shares have surged 26% in the past six months. H&E Equipment Services has expected long-term growth of 18.6%. It shares have rallied 69% over the past six months. Dover has expected long-term growth of 13%. Over the past six months, its shares have gone up 15%. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

However, speculations regarding a probable inflation spike (due to outstanding growth in U.S. wage rates) and a subsequent hike in interest rates remains a cause of concern.Consequently, investors must not invest in typical bets without a clear roadmap.Among the numerous potential gainers, adding Xylem Inc. (XYL  -  Free Report) to your portfolio would likely be a promising move.Over the last month, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 4.6%, as against the 4.2% loss incurred by the industry. Notably, the attractiveness of this stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable VGM Score  B.Reasons for the Bullish RunTop-Line Prospects: Xylem reported better-than-expected revenues in fourth-quarter 2017.

The company expects to widen its EBITDA margin by 70-100 basis points and secure cost savings of $160 million in 2018.Business Buyouts: Xylem perceives that strategic business acquisitions will boost its competency in the quarters ahead. The company successfully acquired Pure Technologies on Jan 31, 2018, in a bid to reinforce its progressive infrastructure analytics business.

The strong bookings trends, along with consistent rig count additions and higher-than-expected well completions, have poised the company for a stellar fourth quarter. Moreover, solid outlook for Dover’s Engineered Systems and Fluid segments will drive the quarter’s performance. In third-quarter 2017, Dover reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.16, which surged 40% year over year. Total revenues increased 17% year over year to $2 billion in the quarter backed by acquisitions, organic growth and favorable impact from foreign, partly offset by an impact from dispositions. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts.  Shares of Dover have gained 25.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.0%. However, despite the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, it has an average negative earnings surprise history of 1.22%. Dover Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Dover Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Dover Corporation QuoteLet’s delve deeper and take a look at factors that might influence the fourth-quarter results.Factors at Play The Energy segment grew sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter in third quarter-2017, delivering year-over-year growth for the third straight quarter. We believe this feat will be repeated in the fourth quarter given that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $649 million for the segment displays a sequential increase of 0.5% and year-over-year growth of 4%. Revenue growth continues to be driven by significant improvement in early-cycle oil and gas fundamentals, particularly U.S. rig count and well completions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s operating earnings is pegged at $54 million, a 75% projected increase year over year. In the Engineered Systems segment, Dover’s Printing & Identification platform will consistently deliver solid performance, backed by continued strong growth in digital printing and solid activity in marking and coding markets. The estimate for the segment’s revenues for the fourth quarter is pegged at $649 million, a 4% projected year-over-year growth. The segment’s operating earnings is projected at $102 million, a 5% annual growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Dover’s Refrigeration and Food Equipment segment is pegged at $363 million, a 3% year-over-year decline. Results in the segment remain affected by persistent softness in the commercial cooking equipment markets. The segment’s earnings will fall 65% year over year to $41.6 million, as projected by the Zacks Consensus model, due to the decline in sales as well as higher raw material costs. For the Fluids segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $622 million, a projected 29% year-over-year rise on acquisition growth.  The retail fueling integration continues to be on track and the segment continues to witness strong sequential margin improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s operating earnings is $90 million, a substantial improvement of 160% year over year and a 3% sequential rise. Dover’s bookings at the end of the third quarter were worth $1.94 billion, up 15% year over year. Backlog increased 18% to $1.27 billion at the end of the reported quarter. Backed by strong bookings growth, the company is poised for a solid fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Dover is at $1.99 billion, a 12% year-over-year growth. Based on the latest Zacks Consensus Estimate, we expect Dover to report earnings of $1.04 per share in the fourth quarter. This would mark growth of 37% from the 76 cents per share posted in the year-ago quarter. Currently, Dover carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Stocks Worth Considering Here are a few industrial products stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.29% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Also, solid booking trends and backlog growth bodes well.The stock has surged 32.2% in a year, higher than the S&P 500's growth of 20.0%. Dover has also outperformed the industry's 29.9% gain.Growth DriversDover has decided to spin-off its Wellsite business into a stand-alone, publicly-traded company, in order to separate the company’s upstream energy businesses in the Energy segment. The company's Wellsite business, which includes Dover Artificial Lift, Dover Energy Automation, and US Synthetic, operates in the oil & gas drilling as well as production industry.Dover estimates that the spin-off will be in the form of a distribution of 100% of the stock of Wellsite, which will be tax-free for the company and U.S. shareholders, for income tax purposes.  As part of the transaction, Wellsite is projected to raise new debt in the range of $700-$800 million — the proceeds of which will be paid to Dover in the form of a dividend. The company expects to return the proceeds to shareholders as the primary source of funding for its $1 billion of share repurchases. The share buyback is expected to be completed in 2018.It has also recently signed an agreement to sell the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn for $250 million. The divestment is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter. These steps will aid the company in streamlining business along with investing in market-leading platforms that have strong market positions, margin profiles and are less volatile with bright prospects.The company has also announced to expand the scope of its previously-announced rightsizing initiatives. These include headcount reductions and facility closures, as well as consolidations due to the company’s focus on reducing cost structure to prepare for Wellsite’s spin-off. The anticipated 2018 benefits, before associated costs, of these actions are now estimated to be $50 million.The company’s bookings at the end of the last reported quarter were worth $1.94 billion, up from $1.69 billion. Backlog increased 18% to $1.27 billion at the end of the reported quarter. Consequently, the company is poised for a solid fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results. For 2017, it projects earnings per share to in the range of $4.23-$4.33. The mid-point of the guidance reflects an increase of 38% over 2016 on an adjusted basis. The company estimates revenues to grow in the range of 14-15%, comprising organic growth of 6-7% and acquisition growth of approximately 10%. This will be partially offset by a 2% impact from the dispositions.Dover anticipates Printing & Identification platform to deliver consistently solid performance, backed by unique position in the digital textile market along with focus on consumables in marking and coding. From the current 3-4% rate, Dover projects the penetration rate of digital technology to surge 30% over the next decade. The company’s comprehensive solutions, including equipment, ink and software, poises it well to fully capitalize on this technology shift. In refrigeration, food retailers in an effort to manage operating cost and differentiate themselves in the market are now investing in closed-door refrigeration cases, energy-efficient systems and in specialized display cases. The company is anticipated to benefit from this demand as it has a leading position in these categories.Further, its Energy segment has a large backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells in the last few quarters due to significant drilling activity. It expects most of these wells to be completed over the coming quarters.All these factors are anticipated to boost the company's share price in the days ahead.

206,DOV,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) posted impressive results in the first half of fiscal 2018, after charting robust earnings beats and strong top-line growth in 2017. Recently, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company reported its 10th consecutive earnings beat in second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.The company’s top line has been gaining momentum on the back of contribution from the CLARCOR acquisition and continued outstanding performance in the company’s Diversified Industrial segment, particularly in North America.Further, its diligent global restructuring initiatives are proving conducive to profits. These initiatives helped Parker-Hannifin offset weakness in some vital regions, which strengthened its position in the end markets.Buoyed by the competency of the revamped Win Strategy and its strategic acquisitions, Parker-Hannifin is bullish about delivering fundamental financial goals for fiscal 2018. Concurrent with second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Parker-Hannifin raised its fiscal 2018 guidance once again.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations are projected in the range of $9.65-$10.05 per share (up from the previous band of $9.10-$9.70). The guidance is adjusted for expected business realignment expenses of approximately $58 million, a net one-time adjustment in income tax expense of $224.5 million and CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses of $52 million. Parker-Hannifin expects to generate synergy savings of about $58 million from CLARCOR integration in fiscal 2018.The company expects sales to grow in the range of 15.3-18.9% from the previous fiscal, with organic growth projected at around 6.5% and acquisitions to contribute roughly 8.1%. Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Parker-Hannifin Corporation Quote Further, analysts too seem to be optimistic on the stock over the last two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings has inched up from $9.57 to $9.93, supported by 11 upward estimate revisions versus none downward.In spite of so many growth drivers and positive developments, the company’s shares have declined 6.6% year to date, underperforming the industry’s upside of 0.1%.  The reason for the disappointing performance could be investors’ concern over the company’s margin trends. It is true that Parker-Hannifin is suffering from near-term margin issues. The reason for the same is that the company is in the middle of integrating CLARCOR and targeted plant closures (23 in fiscal 2017, 39 in fiscal 2018) are also disturbing margins as well as operational efficiency. However, these factors are expected to smoothen in the near term.The fact that the company’s orders are accelerating should pacify investors. Orders increased 13% in aggregate in fiscal second quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of order growth for the company, which indicates improving demand in the key end markets and regions.Also, the company is well placed when compared with its peers in terms of valuation. Parker-Hannifin’s trailing 12-months PE ratio is pegged at 20.73, which is quite a bit lower than the industry’s PE of 24.75. This indicates that investors who want exposure to industrial recovery should consider the company as an investment right now. Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the same space worth considering now include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

Though this is a deceleration from the 11.2% increase in earnings in the second quarter and 13.6% in the first, growth graph will pick up from the fourth quarter onwards. Per projections, earnings growth will be 9.1% in fourth-quarter 2017, 8.8% in first-quarter 2018, 8.9% in the second and 12.8% in the third quarter.In this write-up, we take a sneak peek into three industrial products stocks that are slated to report their third-quarter results on Oct 19.Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report), which manufactures and sells a range of equipment and components, specialty systems, software and digital solutions, and support services worldwide, will report financial numbers after the opening bell.Our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

We estimate the segment to report operating earnings of $54 million, significantly higher than the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $13.3 million.Further, solid outlook for Dover’s Engineered Systems segment (that generates around 33% of its revenues) will drive the quarter’s performance. In the segment, the Printing & Identification platform will continue to deliver consistent solid performance, backed by its unique position in the digital textile market and focus on consumables in marking and coding. Moreover, the industrial platform will fuel growth, led by its strong position in vehicle service and waste handling.

Its bookings increased 19.5% year over year in the second quarter. Backlog also improved to $1.33 billion in the last reported quarter from $1.09 billion recorded at the year-ago quarter end.

217,DOV,"Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) has decided to spin-off its Wellsite business into a stand-alone, publicly-traded company, in order to separate the company’s upstream energy businesses in the Energy segment. This spin-off will help Dover focus on its less volatile core platforms.Reasons for the Spin-OffDover’s upstream energy business, which comprises Dover Artificial Lift, Dover Energy Automation, and US Synthetic, is jointly known as the Wellsite business. The business operates in the oil & gas drilling and production industry. Dover anticipates the Wellsite business to generate approximately $1 billion revenues and $250 million earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2017.Dover announced separation of its upstream energy businesses in September 2017 anticipating that its oil & gas exposed businesses will remain turbulent due to volatile oil prices. The company was looking for sound alternatives to separate the business either by a tax-free spin-off, sale or other strategic combination in order to ensure the best shareholder value.Dover Corporation Price  Dover Corporation Price | Dover Corporation QuoteSpin-Off DetailsDover estimates that the spin-off will be in the form of a distribution of 100% of the stock of Wellsite, which will be tax-free for the company and U.S. shareholders, for income tax purposes. The company expects the transaction to close by the second quarter of 2018, subject to certain customary conditions. The name of the new entity will be announced later.As part of the transaction, Wellsite is projected to raise new debt in the range of $700-$800 million — the proceeds of which will be paid to Dover in the form of a dividend. Dover expects to return the proceeds to shareholders as the primary source of funding for its $1 billion of share repurchases. The share buyback is expected to be completed in 2018.Emerging Company from Spin-OffThe spin-off will create a robust company poised to outshine in the upstream oil and gas markets, with particular strength in U.S. shale basins. Upon completion of the spin-off, Wellsite will be a leading provider of a full range of oil and gas production technologies and solutions, wellsite productivity software, and IIoT solutions.Wellsite will also be the industry leader in the development and production of polycrystalline diamond cutters used for oil and gas exploration. Further, Wellsite’s strong balance sheet and free cash flow will provide ample financial flexibility to the company.Wellsite LeadershipDover announced that Sivasankaran (""Soma"") Somasundaram, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of its Energy segment, will become the president and CEO of Wellsite upon completion of the transaction. Somasundaram has a deep understanding of Wellsite`s operations, and the oil and gas industry, which will help drive the company’s growth going forward.Other InitiativesDover has also announced to expand the scope of its previously-announced rightsizing initiatives. These include headcount reductions and facility closures, as well as consolidations due to the company’s focus on reducing its cost structure to prepare for Wellsite’s spin-off.The anticipated 2018 benefits, before associated costs, of these actions are now estimated to be $50 million, up $10 million from the previous forecast. Dover expects charges related to its rightsizing initiatives and other costs to be in the range of $60-$65 million, with the majority of the costs to be realized in the fourth quarter of 2017.Share Price PerformanceSince the announcement of Wellsite’s spin-off, Dover’s shares have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have gained around 10% over the past three months compared with 9.7% growth recorded by the industry.Summing UpDover continues to focus on margin expansion through productivity initiatives, including supply-chain activities, diligent restructuring activities, strategic pricing and portfolio shaping. In sync with this, the company divested a significant portion of its technology business with the spin-off of Knowles Corporation in 2014. Dover will remain keen on restructuring actions in the future also to better align its cost base.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Dover carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the sector are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Chart Industries, Inc. (GTLS  -  Free Report) and IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

218,DOV,"On Nov 30, Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $98.00 during intraday trading, finally closing lower at $97.71.Investors are optimistic on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's efforts to streamline business, solid booking and backlog growth, potential opportunities in the fast-growing digital textile printing market and an improving Energy segment.The stock surged 31.3% in a year, higher than the S&P 500's growth of 20.2%. Dover has also outperformed the industry's 26.2% gain.Growth DriversDover continues to simplify portfolio. Earlier, the company had announced that it is searching for sound alternatives to separate its Wellsite business either by a tax-free spin-off, sale or other strategic combination. Dover's Wellsite business, which includes Dover Artificial Lift, Dover Energy Automation, and US Synthetic, operates in the oil & gas drilling as well as production industry.During the third-quarter conference call, the company stated that the Wellsite business is on track to be separated in early 2018. Dover added that the company has recently signed an agreement to sell the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn for $250 million, anticipated to close in the fourth quarter. These steps will aid the company in streamlining business along with investing in market-leading platforms that have strong market positions, margin profiles and are less volatile with bright prospects.Dover is also reviewing cost structure to right size the company and boost margins. It plans to achieve around $40 million of cost savings in 2018.The company’s bookings at the end of the third quarter were worth $1.94 billion, up from $1.69 billion. Backlog increased 18% to $1.27 billion at the end of the reported quarter. Backed by strong bookings growth, the company is poised for a solid finish to this year. For 2017, it projects earnings per share to in the range of $4.23-$4.33. The mid-point of the guidance reflects an increase of 38% over 2016 on an adjusted basis. The company projects revenues to grow in the range of 14-15%, comprising organic growth of 6-7% and acquisition growth of approximately 10%. This will be partially offset by a 2% impact from the dispositions.Dover anticipates Printing & Identification platform to deliver consistently solid performance, backed by unique position in the digital textile market along with focus on consumables in marking and coding. From the current 3-4% rate, Dover projects the penetration rate of digital technology to surge 30% over the next decade. The company’s comprehensive solutions, including equipment, ink and software, positions it well to fully capitalize on this technology shift. In refrigeration, food retailers in an effort to manage operating cost and differentiate themselves in the market are now investing in closed-door refrigeration cases, energy-efficient systems and in specialized display cases. Dover will benefit from this demand as it has a leading position in these categories.Further, the company’s Energy segment has a large backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells in the last few quarters driven by significant drilling activity. It expects most of these wells to be completed over the coming quarters.All these factors are anticipated to boost the company's share price in the days ahead.Dover Corporation Price and Consensus Dover Corporation Price and Consensus | Dover Corporation QuoteFurther, Dover's estimate revision trend for the current year is favorable.

219,DOV,"Global marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 20. In the last reported quarter, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Omnicom’s earnings track record has been quite healthy, having beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.71%.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Key Factors Omnicom remains poised on its strategy of making internal investments and accretive acquisitions to further strengthen its core capabilities.The company maintains a balanced growth model through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and strategic acquisitions. The companyexpects to witness higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of prudent acquisitions and organic growth.In addition, Omnicom is witnessing a healthy performance in developed markets like the U.S. and developing markets like Asia. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs helped it boost earnings. It is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. The company is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology firms in key markets. Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets.However, a significant portion of Omnicom’s revenues comes from Europe. In the present scenario, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. In addition, the company is susceptible to market risks of losing contracts related to media purchases and production costs. This is likely to affect the bottom line and undermine its organic growth to some extent.Furthermore, a significant portion of the revenues is derived in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This is likely to adversely impact the company’s financial results due to volatility in currency exchange rates. As Omnicom expands its international operations, it exposes itself to risks from foreign exchange barriers and uncertainty from monetary devaluation. The company also faces huge concentration risks as it relies on a few big clients for its businesses. These developments might prove to be a strain on Omnicom in the impending quarter.  For the to-be-reported-quarter, Omnicom’s revenues are anticipated to be affected by the volatility in the market. In addition, client spending patterns in the global markets are likely to be constrained by a challenging macroeconomic environment and geopolitical scenario.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Omnicom is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is  -0.72%.

Buyout and Forex Gains Drive RevenuesIn the quarter, Colfax’s net sales grew 7.6% year over year to $874.1 million.

The improvement came on the back of 1.9% positive impact from price, 4% gain from acquired assets, 5% rise in volume and 3.63% positive impact from foreign currency translations.As noted, the segment’s North American businesses were solid.

222,DOV,"We issued an updated research report on Altra Industrial Motion Corporation (AIMC  -  Free Report) on Feb 26. Strengthening of the end markets, focus on cost control and buyout gains are likely to benefit the company in the quarters ahead. However, industry competition, rising costs and expenses remain its prime concerns.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $1.3 billion.Altra Industrial’s financial performance was better than expected in three of the last four quarters and below expectations in one quarter. Average earnings surprise was a positive 11.13%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings is pegged at $2.44 per share, representing 5.2% growth from the tally a month ago.Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Altra IndustrialLong-Term Growth Potential Solid: Altra Industrial’s focus toward penetrating into the new and unexplored markets and expansion of existing ones will work in the stock’s favor. The company’s three business segments — Clutches & Brakes, Electromagnetic Clutches & Brakes and Gearing — serve various end-markets including energy, general industrial, material handling, metals, mining, special machinery, turf and garden and transportation.Also, measures undertaken to control costs and improving the margin profile will work in its favor. Per these restructuring and cost-saving strategies, the company intends to lower the strength of its facilities by 20-30% and improve its supply chain worldwide.In the long term, the company anticipates revenue growth in excess of the Gross Domestic Product while it aims to expand its operating margin by 150 basis points on strategic pricing.Buyouts — Key to Expansion: Over time, acquired assets have helped Altra Industrial leverage benefit from easy penetration into markets and expanded product offerings. In December 2016, the company acquired Stromag — a well-known tailored-engineered solution provider for customers in various markets — from GKN plc. The buyout added Stromag’s products including clutches and brakes, flexible couplings, limit switches and friction discs to the company’s portfolio. Notably, synergistic benefits from the Stromag acquisition contributed 20.3% to net sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2017.Impressive Projections for 2018: Altra Industrial Motion anticipates gaining from improvements in the majority of the end markets, especially in turf and garden, material handling, metals and mining plus a solid product portfolio.The company’s net sales are anticipated within $895-$915 million range in 2018, above $876.7 million generated in 2017. While non-GAAP earnings are projected at $2.30-$2.43 per share, up from $2.05 in the previous year. Estimated tax rate of 25-27% will result in cash benefits of $3.7 million.Factors Working Against Altra IndustrialRising Costs & Expenses Remain Issues: Altra Industrial is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2017, its cost of sales grew 31.8% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses rose 18.7%. Moreover, research and development expenses increased 38.5%. Margin profile was weak in the quarter as gross margin slipped 120 basis points (bps) year over year and non-GAAP operating margin fell 30 bps. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses can be detrimental to the company’s profitability in the quarters ahead.Industry Competition and International Expansion: Altra Industrial faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Also, difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services, apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market might hurt the company’s competitive edge. In addition, global expansion has exposed the company to risks arising from negative movements in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues. Also, as the company has to procure raw materials from suppliers in both domestic and international markets, it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations associated with policies and issues of the source countries.Headwinds From Global Uncertainty: End markets served by Altra Industrial are susceptible to global economic conditions. Lower level of industrial activities and difficult financial positions in countries wherein the company operates, are likely to affect its sales, earnings and cash flow.In the last three months, Altra Industrial’s shares have declined 5%, underperforming 4.6% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

223,DOV,"Atlas Copco AB (ATLKY  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it will acquire Germany-based Klingel Joining Technologies. Financial consideration of the buyout has not been disclosed. This buyout deal follows the company’s acquisition of Walker Filtration Ltd. on Mar 1.Klingel Joining Technologies, specializing in flow drill technology — a mechanical joining process — primarily operates in the automotive industry. The to-be-acquired assets are a business arm of Klingel GmbH. In 2017, Klingel Joining Technologies generated revenues of €8.5 million.In the last three months, Atlas Copco’s American Depository Receipts have yielded 0.3% return, outperforming 0.1% decline recorded by the industry.

Atlas Copco’s Inorganic Initiatives: A BoonThe above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Atlas Copco’s policy of acquiring meaningful businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product line. Earlier in March, the company acquired Walker Filtration Ltd., a British company engaged in making equipments used in the treatment of compressed gas, vacuum and air. The acquired assets will enhance the company’s medical-gas business in the Compressor Technique business area.In February, the company completed the acquisition of Australia-based Hy-Performance Fluid Power Pty Ltd. It will be integrated with the company’s existing Mining and Rock Excavation Technique business. In January, the company closed the buyouts of French company Location Thermique Service SAS, U.S.-based mining equipment distributor Cate Drilling Solutions LLC, Australia-based Rockdrill Services Australia Pty. Ltd. and South Africa-based mining consumables provider Renegade Drilling Supplies Proprietary Ltd.Also, Atlas Copco believes in disposing of non-core assets to enhance its business opportunities from the profitable ones. In this regard, the company’s divestment of its concrete and compaction operations, from the Power Technique business to the Construction division of Husqvarna Group in February 2018, is worth mentioning.

224,DOV,"We issued a research report on Nordson Corporation (NDSN  -  Free Report) on Mar 5. A well-diversified business portfolio and meaningful buyouts are key drivers for the company. On the flip side, cost and debts, as well as risks related to international operations, remain concerns.The company, with a market capitalization of approximately $7.9 billion, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below, we briefly discussed the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring NordsonShare Price Performance and Earnings Estimates Revision: Nordson’s financial performance was better than expected in three of the last four quarters and in line with expectations in one quarter. Average earnings surprise was a positive 3.91%.In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 6.9% return, outperforming 1% decline of the industry.Underpinning the favorable sentiments reflects positive revisions in earnings estimates for the stock. In the last 30 days, five brokerage firms have raised estimates for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.33 for fiscal 2018 (ending October 2018) and $7.05 for fiscal 2019 (ending October 2019), representing the growth of 0.8% and 2.8% from their respective tallies, 30 days ago.Near- and Long-Term Growth Potential Solid: Nordson operates through three business segments — Adhesive Dispensing Systems, Advanced Technology Systems and Industrial Coating Systems — largely minimizing its risks of loss from poor performance of any single group. Also, a vast customer base in various end-markets, including packaging, non-wovens, polymer processing, products assembly, electronic systems, fluid management, test and inspection, container coating, curing and drying systems, liquid finishing and powder coating, is beneficial. Moreover, the company’s commitment toward rewarding shareholders through dividends will continue building positive sentiments. In August 2017, the company hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 11%.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company anticipates sales to increase in the range of 9-13% year over year, including the 7% contribution from buyouts and 5% from favorable foreign currency movements.Over the long-term (2018 to 2023), the company anticipates revenue growth to be roughly twice the global GDP percentage while aiming to improve its operating margin in excess of revenue growth percentage.Buyouts — Key to Expansion: Over time, acquired assets have helped Nordson penetrate into the new and unexplored markets and expand operations in existing ones. In calendar 2017, the company acquired certain assets of ACE Production Technologies, Inc., 100% shares of Plas-Pak Industries, Inc., InterSelect GmbH and Advanced Technologies business of Vention Medical. All these assets have strengthened the company’s businesses under Advanced Technology Systems segment.Further, the company acquired Sonoscan, Inc. in January 2018, while its subsidiary — Nordson ASYMTEK — added the PCP product lines of Infiniti Dosing o.m.s. to its portfolio in the same month. The Sonoscan buyout will strengthen the company’s test and inspection business, while the PCP product line buyout will expand the company’s reach in the dispensing and dosing markets. These buyouts will be integrated with Nordson’s Advanced Technology Systems segment.Factors Working Against NordsonRising Costs & Expenses, Huge Debts Raise Concerns: Norson is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, its cost of sales grew 36.8% year over year while selling and administrative expenses rose 22.8%. Also, the company’s long-term debt was approximately $1,258.8 million while exiting the quarter. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses, and huge debt levels can be detrimental to the company’s profitability in the quarters ahead.Threats From International Expansion: Global expansion has exposed Nordson to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies. Also, uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served can severely impact the company’s businesses. Notably, the company has operations in more than 35 countries with manufacturing facilities in the United States, the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Mexico, Netherlands, Thailand and the United Kingdom.Industry Competition: Nordson faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Also, difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services, apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market, might hurt the company’s competitive edge.Some key players in the industry, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

230,DOV,"This week we have several very important economic reports and new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s first Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  These top tier reports, will give us key data on future indicators regarding factories, jobs, consumer confidence, and insight to the Fed’s policy direction.The biggest econ report is coming out on Thursday; the ISM Manufacturing Index.  This forward looking report has a long track record of accurately gauging the direction of production, employment, new orders, and inventories.As you can see in the chart, the ISM index has been on an upswing since the end of 2016 and has stayed above the 50 level -which indicates growth in the manufacturing sector- all the way through February of 2018.  The index has remained elevated due the expansion of both the domestic and global economies, strong new orders, and positive employment data. Current expectations are for the index to dip just slightly from its previous reading.  In last month’s report, new orders hit its highest level in almost 10 years.  Another solid report from the ISM would be an overall positive for the industrial, factory, manufacturing, and production segments of the economy. On Wednesday, we will get a preview of the ISM report as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, or PMI is released.  The Chicago PMI is the most important of the regional manufacturing reports, as it is seen as having a strong correlation to the national ISM manufacturing index.You can see the high correlation between the two manufacturing reports, with the Chicago PMI represented by the bars, and the ISM represented by the purple line.    Last month the Chicago PMI showed extraordinarily strong growth with a reading of 65.7, and Wednesday’s report is expected to come in just barely below that.  This would still be very positive news for the manufacturing sector, as last month’s reading was near its historic high.  If these reports come in as expected, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Industrial companies like Terex Corp (TEX  -  Free Report), Century Aluminum (CENX  -  Free Report), Roper Tech (ROP  -  Free Report), and Dover Corp (DOV  -  Free Report) will benefit from the positive news.  Also on Wednesday, the GDP report will be released at the opening bell.  This report is considered an all-inclusive measure of domestic economic activity.  This report will also be important to bond traders due to its correlation with inflation measures. A bit after the GDP report is released, new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will make his first major speech where his tone regarding inflationary issues will be very closely monitored. We will also hear reports regarding the Consumer’s view of the economy.  On Tuesday, the Consumer Confidence report comes out, and on Friday, we get the Consumer Sentiment report.  Of the two, the Consumer Confidence data, is the most closely watched.The Consumer Confidence report shows the consumer’s views on the overall economy, and their expectations for the next six months.  This data, is also highly correlated to retail sales as you can see in this chart.Consumer confidence has historically been a key indicator for the future of both the stock and bond markets.  This is due to the fact that consumer spending impacts two thirds of the economy, and a consumer who views the economy in a positive light tends to spend more. The index has stayed near its 17 year high for the past few months.  The February reading is expected to improve slightly from its January levels.  A strong repot would be a positive for several sub sectors in the retail segment which include companies like Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), and Lowe’s Companies (LOW  -  Free Report), all of whom currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.     Overall, this is an important week of reports, and if they come in as expected, it will set a positive tone for the markets for the near term. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

232,DOV,"We have issued an updated research report on Colfax Corporation (CFX  -  Free Report) on Feb 20. Exposure in emerging markets, focus on innovative products and buyouts gains will benefit Colfax in the years ahead. However, industry competition, rising costs and expenses remain prime concerns.Colfax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $4.1 billion.Colfax’s financial performance was better than expected in two of the last four quarters and in line with expectations in the other two quarters. Average earnings surprise was a positive 4.74%. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.12 for 2018 and $2.36 for 2019, representing growth of 2.9% and 3.5% from their respective tallies 30 days ago.Below we briefly discussed the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring ColfaxBuyouts Keys to Expansion: Over time, acquired assets have helped Colfax leverage benefit from easy penetration into unexplored markets and expanded product offerings. In 2017, TBi and HKS were added to the company’s portfolio. While TBi is a leader in robotic torch technology, HKS is a developer of advanced process analytics and sensors. Since these were acquired, the buyouts have been strengthening the company’s welding process analytics and robotic welding torches operations in the Fabrication Technology segment. In addition, acquisition of Siemens AG’s Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH business has strengthened the company’s Howden trading platform.Notably, acquired assets increased the company’s revenues by 2.7% in 2017.Long-Term Growth Potential Solid: Colfax’s focus toward the expansion of existing platforms and gaining exposure in new ones will work in its favor in the years ahead. Its two solid platforms are Fabrication Technology and Air & Gas Handling. These businesses have been serving customers in the oil & gas, general industrial, mining, marine and many others end markets. Also, the company is working hard on improving its operations in emerging markets including China, India, Brazil and others.Over the long run (three to five years), the company anticipates organic growth in the range of 1-2% above GDP and segment margins in the mid-teens level.Impressive Projections for 2018: For 2018, Colfax anticipates that its Fabrication Technology business will gain from new products and its initiatives directed to improve customer service and operational efficiency while its Air & Gas Handling business will improve on the back of investment in growth markets and restructuring initiatives.Adjusted earnings per share in the year are anticipated to be within the $2.00-$2.15 range, increasing from $1.74 recorded in 2017. Organic revenue growth is predicted to be flat to up 2%.Factors Working Against ColfaxRising Costs & Expenses, High Debts Remain Issues: Colfax is currently dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2017, its cost of sales grew 7.8% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses expanded 17%. Margin profile was weak in the quarter as gross margin slipped 20 basis points (bps) year over year and adjusted operating margin fell 200 bps. Moreover, the company’s long-term debt balance at the quarter-end was approximately $1.1 billion. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses and high debt levels can prove to be detrimental to the company’s profitability in the quarters ahead.Threat From Industry Competition and International Expansion: Colfax’s Air and Gas Handling business faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Also, other companies operating in the welding space provide stiff competition to its Fabrication Technology business.In addition, international expansion has exposed the company to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues. Also, as the company has to procure raw materials from suppliers both in the United States and international markets, it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations associated with policies and issues of the source countries.Headwinds From Global Uncertainty: End markets served by Colfax are highly susceptible to global economic conditions. Lower level of industrial activities and difficult financial conditions in countries, where the company operates, will adversely hurt its sales, earnings and cash flow.Share Price Performance & Key PicksIn the last three months, Colfax’s shares have lost 9%, underperforming 3.3% gain recorded by the industry.Some stocks worth considering in the industry are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report). All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Operating profit at the segment climbed 78% year over year to $387 million, driven by higher shipment volumes and lower warranty costs, partially offset by escalated production costs.Construction & Forestry sales surged 57% year over year to $1.73 billion, mainly as a result of the Wirtgen acquisition. Sales also increased due to higher shipment volumes and the favorable impact of currency translation. This segment reported operating profit of $32 million, down 14% from $37 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.

The segment’s operating profit came in at $217 million, up 30% year over year. Net income at the segment was $425.3 million compared with $114.4 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.

Cash used in operations was $1,296.8 million in  the quarter compared with $736.7 million in the prior-year quarter.

The forecast also includes a positive foreign-currency translation impact of about 3% for the fiscal and about 4% in the fiscal second quarter. For fiscal 2018, Deere expects net sales to increase about 25% year over year and projects net income of about $2.1 billion.Segment wise, Deere estimates Agriculture and Turf equipment sales to increase about 15% in fiscal 2018, including a positive currency-translation effect of about 3%. Industry sales for agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada are estimated to be up about 10% for the fiscal, aided by higher demand for large equipment.In the EU28 region, sales are projected to be up about 5% backed by improving conditions in the dairy and livestock sectors.

We believe that sound financial performance and growth prospects have lifted investor sentiments for the company. In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 7.44% return, outperforming the gain of 5.36% recorded by the Zacks categorized Machine Tools & Related Products industry.Let us see whether Stanley Black & Decker will be able to maintain its earnings streak this quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Stanley Black & Decker is likely to pull off a surprise this quarter. That is because the stock has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: Stanley Black & Decker has an ESP of +1.53%, with the Most Accurate estimate of $1.99 exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.96.Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Stanley Black & Decker’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, its positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?We believe that Stanley Black & Decker is poised to benefit from constant innovation of new products and development of existing ones within the Industrial, Security and Tools & Storage segments in the quarter. Improved demand for products like FLEXVOLT might be advantageous for the Tools & Storage segment. Also, the company’s restructuring activities in the past few months, including acquisitions of Newell Brands and Craftsman tool brand, and disposal of a majority portion of its Mechanical Security businesses, might positively influence the quarter’s results.In addition, we believe that operating conditions in the industry have been favorable for toll makers like Stanley Black & Decker in the quarter. Industrial production – a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country – grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities. New orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 4.6% in the first five months of 2017. Also, the government’s policies encouraging better trade relations, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will support growth of machinery companies.On a separate note, we believe that the company’s shareholder-friendly policies will work in its favor in the quarters ahead. Recently, it declared a 5 cents increase in its quarterly dividend rate, which now stands at 63 cents per share.     However, Stanley Black & Decker’s exposure to headwinds including uncertain global economic conditions, unfavorable foreign currency movements, commodity inflation, industry rivalry and high debt levels remain major causes of concern.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the machinery industry you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.
