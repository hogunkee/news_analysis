0,XEL,"Electricity consumption tied to Bitcoin and other digital currencies on computer networks could give a boost to some U.S. utilities and create partnership opportunities for renewable energy developers, says a Morgan Stanley report.""Though the overall impact from increased demand seems minimal at this time, the key utility beneficiaries we would highlight include: American Electric Power (AEP), Xcel Energy (XEL), and Entergy (ETR),"" Nicholas Ashworth, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a report to clients published Wednesday. ""These utilities serve the regions with the lowest cost of electricity, and American Electric Power and Xcel are taking advantage of low-cost wind (power) to drive rates even lower.""""There is also the potential for wind and solar developers, we would highlight NextEra Energy (NEE) and Pattern Energy (PEGI), to get involved in supplying 'firm' renewable power solutions to concentrated mining operations,"" Ashworth added.Digital currency transactions require energy-intensive computer networks. A public ledger, called a blockchain, provides a record of where every digital token was first ""mined"" using computing power. For Bitcoin, verifying a transaction and adding it to the blockchain earns a miner a specific number of bitcoins.By design, Bitcoin mining software makes it very expensive — in terms of computing power and electricity — to add new blocks. Cryptocurrency power use is facing more scrutiny, particularly in China, where officials are concerned miners are taking advantage of low electricity prices.Some parts of the U.S. — such as the Midwest and Northwest — could also offer mining networks low power costs, Ashworth said in the report.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.""Electricity consumption from Bitcoin in 2018 could be as great as we forecast for global electric vehicles in 2025,"" Morgan Stanley added.""However in theory Bitcoin's energy usage should decline in the long run. The network is designed to produce one block every ten minutes, regardless of energy use. The Bitcoin reward for mining a block however halves every four years — the next time is in 2020. If it becomes unprofitable to mine, then in theory less mining will occur.""RELATED:Is Resistance In These 2 Stocks A Warning For Chip-Sector Investors?Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetJust How Many More 'Blockchain Pretenders' Could 2018 Bring?Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

3,XEL,"Xcel Energy (XEL) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 76 to 81 Friday. X This unique rating measures technical performance by showing how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of the other stocks in our database. History shows that the top-performing stocks tend to have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves.Xcel Energy broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 48.60 entry from a flat base. In the scenario where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to form. Also keep in mind that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. The company posted 15% earnings growth in the latest quarterly report. Revenue gains came in at 6%. Xcel Energy holds the No. 14 rank among its peers in the Utility-Diversified industry group.

"
6,XEL,"Amid a somewhat turbulent session for the major indexes Tuesday, many of the stocks making IBD's Utility Leaders screen showed stability.That's not all. At least four names have built sound-looking bases. Here is a brief review of their chart work.Utilities may continue to offer stable cash payouts and the prospects of capital gains so long as the Federal Reserve does not quickly raise interest rates and the prices of natural gas do not spike. The strong jobs market also benefits utilities in terms of attracting new customers and keeping current ones.Eversource Energy (ES), last covered in this column March 22, has arguably built a pair of handles on its nine-month saucer base. The first handle shows a 59.21 buy point, 10 cents above the Feb. 24 intraday high. The second handle shows an intraday peak of 60.36 and began with the reversal March 29. Add a dime to that price and you get an alternative buy point of 60.46.Notice how in both cases, Eversource did not rebound all the way back to the saucer's left-side high of 60.44.Handles that form within 5% to 15% below the left-side peak of a cup or double bottom tend to lead to successful breakouts. Remember, not all breakouts work. When the electric power utility, serving New England, cleared a 59.19 entry in an unusual-looking saucer base June 30, 2016, Eversource rallied for just two weeks, then dropped more than 16% over the next five months. Fortunately, shares did not venture far below the 10-week moving average, and a new saucer base was born.Eversource has a 3.2% annual dividend yield. It paid 47.5 cents a share March 31.Ameren (AEE) (3.2% yield) rallied past a 53.49 entry in a nearly eight month, cup-with-handle base on Feb. 21 this year. Now, shares are testing support at the rising 50-day moving average.Xcel Energy (XEL) (3.2% yield) has formed a nearly nine month, cup-with-handle base. The Minneapolis-based diversified utility has moved steadily after rising past a 44.19 entry on March 15. CMS Energy (CMS) (2.9%) has built a nine-month cup with handle, and a three-week handle offers a 45.65 entry. Again, like in Eversource and Xcel, one can see mildly lower handles within the base that are not too far off the left-side high in the cup itself.The S&P 500's annualized yield is around 1.93%.RELATED:The Income Investor: 4 Reasons Why This Dividend Play Might Soar In 2017The Income Investor: Should You Invest In These 3 Financial Plays?

An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- and Up/Down Volume of 1.5 show a stock that has been getting steadily accumulated.

The company reported after the close Monday. In an earnings conference call Tuesday morning, the Midwest utility explained a 17 cents per share variance due to temperature that turned the morning's drop in share price to a breakout by the end of the day. Shares continued into 52-week high territory Wednesday but reversed course by the close.Xcel Energy (XEL) sports similar numbers. It has a stronger earnings record but is more sluggish on the Accumulation/Distribution Rating with a C+. At a more than $20 billion market cap, it has earned a frequent spot in the IBD Big Cap 20. The stock broke out in late January at 37.45 and just recently got extended from its buy range.

"
20,XEL,"Tesla already has started making some battery packs for SolarCity. More insights on synergies might come out when SolarCity reports its Q4 earnings after the close Monday. And more clues could emerge from the ""Tesla Gigafactory"" conference call that Musk plans in the coming week.

53,XEL,"But ""applications abound"" for Tesla-produced battery technology, Dougherty & Co. analyst Andrea James said in a research note Feb. 14. Those applications include ""use in grid storage, military operations, and unmanned aerial vehicles,"" she said. ""As the biggest buyer and producer of cylindrical lithium ion battery cells, which are chemically optimized for automotive use, Tesla also gets the first shot at new technology.""
"
54,XEL,"The company also gets a chance to lower costs.
"
55,XEL,"""There should be a cost benefit for Tesla to produce its own batteries,"" James wrote. ""It is unclear to us just how much, but we estimate it could be as high as 8 cents per watt-hour, which would lower Tesla's cost per kilowatt-hour on its battery pack to about $180.""
"
56,XEL,"Tesla's agreement with Panasonic lets it take delivery of at least 1.8 billion lithium-ion cells over four years, James points out, which would allow Tesla to produce a minimum of 64,000 vehicles a year at 7,000 cells per vehicle.

One outfits a model solar neighborhood with a 25-kw/50-kilowatt-hour sodium nickel chloride system made by Fiamm SoNick. The other project for larger applications evaluates a 1.5-megawatt/1.0-megawatt-hour advanced lead-acid system made by Xtreme Power.While Tesla explores ways to make the most of its battery expertise and plans, Musk told analysts on Wednesday that the Gigafactory ""is really there to support the volume of the third-generation car"" that Tesla plans.But ""applications abound"" for Tesla-produced battery technology, Dougherty & Co. analyst Andrea James said in a research note Feb. 14. Those applications include ""use in grid storage, military operations, and unmanned aerial vehicles,"" she said. ""As the biggest buyer and producer of cylindrical lithium ion battery cells, which are chemically optimized for automotive use, Tesla also gets the first shot at new technology.""The company also gets a chance to lower costs.""There should be a cost benefit for Tesla to produce its own batteries,"" James wrote. ""It is unclear to us just how much, but we estimate it could be as high as 8 cents per watt-hour, which would lower Tesla's cost per kilowatt-hour on its battery pack to about $180.""Tesla's agreement with Panasonic lets it take delivery of at least 1.8 billion lithium-ion cells over four years, James points out, which would allow Tesla to produce a minimum of 64,000 vehicles a year at 7,000 cells per vehicle.Tesla says it expects to deliver over 35,000 vehicles this year, up from 22,477 in 2013.

58,XEL,"Investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s price performance is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. But betting on stocks depending totally on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on revenues and not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) usually reflects a company’s future earnings performance. Notably, in contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Also, a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense saving measures while maintaining stable revenues. However, superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth. Further, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. But there are limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales figure does not necessarily convert to profits. Hence, considering a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

60,XEL,"The first four months of 2018 have been eventful, with a Fed rate hike, U.S.-China tariff war threats and tensions in Syria wiping out yearly gains from all the major indexes. The S&P 500 index is off its highs for the year and currently remains barely in positive territory, while the Technology-heavy Nasdaq composite is up +2.1% in the year-to-date period.Stock market investing is no doubt a risky venture, and even well-thought out investment strategies at times fail to generate desired returns. Against this backdrop, let us focus on the domestic-focused, capital-intensive utility stocks that assure investors steady performance and regular dividend yields. Utility stocks are subject to heavy regulation, both at the federal and state levels. Utilities are known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow.Utilities, aside from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amounts of emissions, are also focused in improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. They are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity. We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the U.S. due to increasing production of electricity from renewable sources and support to the power grid.Utilities are also undertaking long-term plans to shift transmission lines underground in weather-sensitive areas to lower chances of power outages. The introduction of smart meters are helping users make efficient use of electricity.Natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver their product to end users. Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains. The utilities are using the latest technology to upgrade and maintain their existing infrastructure to increase reliability of their services. Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) received approval from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to use drones beyond their operators’ vision to survey transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring.So, to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure, utilities depend on capital markets. Though regulated utilities are cash generators, the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long-term projects. The rate-sensitive, capital-intensive utility stocks also had to accommodate the Fed rate hike.The rise in interest cost will no doubt increase cost of capital for utilities and might limit their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares. These developments could lower the attractiveness of utilities, and investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment.However, utilities across the United States have gained from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from January 2018. Utility operators decided to pass on the benefits to their customers, and the majority of them have enjoyed a decline in monthly bills.The unemployment rate in the United States was static at a historical low of 4.1% for the last six months. In addition, the United States Building Permits increased 4.4% in March 2018 to 1,379 thousand. The new permits had exceeded the U.S. building permit average of 1355.99 thousand from 1960 to 2018. All these factors indicate an increase in demand for residential utility services.All other industries depend on utilities for the basic requirements of electricity, gas and water. The ongoing growth will result in higher demand from industrial, commercial and residential space for utility services and boost its performance.Utilities TransformingIn August 2015, President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32% by 2030 from the 2005 levels. President Trump has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan. Trump believes that such plans will make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive in the global markets. This new development will help in running the coal-fired electricity generation units for a longer period than previously expected.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) estimates that U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions declined by 861 million metric tons or nearly 14% from 2005 to 2017. EIA now projects that carbon dioxide emissions will rise 1.8% from 5,143 million metric tons in 2017 to 5,237 million metric tons in 2018, primarily due to an increase in coal usage in power plants. In 2019, energy-related CO2 emissions will be about 13% lower than 2005 levels.However, utilities are focusing overall on sources of fuel that help to lower emission levels. Large solar power plants and extensive development of wind farms are indicating a shift in preferences relating to fuel sources among utilities. We notice that utility operators like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) have already invested and plan to spend more on creating green energy generation portfolio.Zacks Industry Rank - PositiveWithin the Zacks Sector classification, utilities are a stand-alone sector, one of 16 Zacks sectors. The rural wire-line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector, but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power, Gas Distribution and Water Supply.We rank the 265 sub-industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries in two groups — the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)Two out of three industries related to the utility sector — Gas Distribution, Electric Power and Water Supply — fall into the first group, having the Zacks Industry Rank of #81, #110 and #232, respectively.Our present outlook for the utility sector is positive, with two major industries placed in the first group of the Zacks Industry Rank.Utilities Trading at Mid-RangeThe valuation of the sector (Considering Gas Distribution, Water Supply and Electric Power industry) looks attractive at present. The Water Supply industry is currently trading at 19.4X forward 12-month EPS estimates, the Gas Distribution industry is trading at 20.7X while the Electric Power industry is trading at 13.4X compared with the S&P 500 trading average of 17.5X.The current 20.7x multiple for Gas Distribution companies compares to the five-year range of 17.2X to 24.6X (median of 20.5X) while the 19.4X multiple for Water Utilities compares to the five-year multiple range from a low of 12.4X to a high of 23.3X (median of 18.7X). The current 13.4X multiple for Electric Utilities compares to a five-year range of 11.4X to 16.2X (median of 13.5X).The above study shows that the current multiples are within the five-year ranges, but trading above their historic median level (except Electric Power), offering some room for an increase from the current levels.Earnings Review & OutlookFirst-quarter earnings in the utility space (till Apr 25, 2018) were up 7.7%. Utilities gained from favorable weather in the first quarter, while tax reforms and ongoing infrastructure spending helped the utilities.We expect cost control, new electric rates and customer growth will help the utility sector to come up with earnings growth in the first-quarter reporting cycle. First-quarter earnings from the utility sector are expected to improve 12.5% on the back of revenue growth of 0.4%.The defensive Utility sector’s earnings for first quarter 2018 are expected to improve 13.9%, on the back of revenue growth of 1.4%. Read more in the latest Earnings Preview.Utilities Worth BuyingThe first quarter is expected to be the sector’s best in the last seven years. Last year was profitable for investors, and we expect the major indices to maintain the momentum in 2018.Investors may keep an eye on utilities that witnessed positive estimate revisions, paid regular dividend and returned higher than the market.IDACORP Inc.

63,XEL,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) received the approval from Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) to use drones beyond the operators’ vision and utilize them to survey the transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring.Over the past three years, Xcel Energy is using drones in their coal-fired plants to inspect equipments. In 2017, the company got the approval from FAA to use them for power lines inspection, within the operator’s vision. Following the approval, Xcel Energy will deploy the drones for the survey of their transmission line in Denver area. The company plans to seek further permission from FAA to inspect its 320,000 miles of electricity and natural gas infrastructure located in different regions.Technology to Boost Operations    Xcel Energy operates in eight Western and Midwestern States. Half of the states are tornado prone areas. The electric transmission and distribution lines as well as natural gas pipelines are expected to be weather resistant. Proper maintenance and repair of infrastructure enables the company to provide 24x7 services amid difficult climatic conditions. Drones ensure early detection of faults and damages of the electric transmission and distribution lines, which lower chances of outages and increase reliability of services.However, the drones will not replace previous modes of inspection and detection. The company believes that drones have advantages over trucks, helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft.  The inspection of lines will be completed at a faster pace and lower related costs, which will benefit consumers.Drone used by PeersUtility companies are investing regularly to provide safe, clean and reliable service to customers. Additionally, the companies are adopting new technologies to maintain and inspect their expansive infrastructure. Usages of drones are yet to become common among all utility service providers in the United States. However, we have seen FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) and PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) among others to use drones for the maintenance of infrastructure.Considering the advantage of drones over traditional methods of inspection and maintenance of essential electrical infrastructure, we expect to witness increasing usage of the same among other providers as well.    Price MovementIn the last 12 months, shares of Xcel Energy have returned 4.7% compared with its industry’s rise of 2.3%. Zacks Rank & Other Stock to ConsiderXcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can consider CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) from the same space, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

65,XEL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Xcel Energy is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for XEL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 43 cents per share for XEL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for XEL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.38% heading into earnings season.Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Xcel Energy Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that XEL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Xcel Energy, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

66,XEL,"The Q2 earnings season is gradually unfolding. As of Jul 25, 128 S&P 500 members came up with earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 7.0% from the same period last year on 4.2% higher revenues. 77.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 70.3% topped revenue estimates.It is going to be another busy week with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results. Combining results of the reported index members (97 members till Jul 21) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for the investors.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

68,XEL,"Black Hills Corp.‘s (BKH  -  Free Report) natural gas utility subsidiary announced that it has submitted a review proposal for its natural gas rate, with the Arkansas Public Service Commission.Notably, the review is anticipated to result in a rate increase, which in turn is expected to generate additional revenues of $29.9 million per year, for the company. If the proposal is approved, increased rates for the 166,000 natural gas customers that the company serves across Arkansas will definitely benefit Black Hill’s operating results.Per the filing, the company is seeking to derive a return on equity of 10.2% for investments that Black Hills has been making in its natural gas system in Arkansas. The company is looking forward to implement the new rates in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to approval.Reason for Rate ReviewSince 2016, Black Hills has made investments worth $160 million toward replacing, upgarding and manitaining its natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines in Arkansas, that is stretched over 5,500 miles.Notably these infrastructural investments have been made keeping in view the increasing needs of customers. Further, these have been directed to provide safer and more reliable natural gas delivery services to homes and businesses.Our ViewUtility companies operate in a regulated, yet highly competitive market structure. Upgrading and modernizing infrastructure from time to time is consequently important for providing better service to the customers. Further, investments to improve reliability of existing infrastructure become essential, especially in meeting the ever increasing growth in demand for electricity and other utility services.Being no exception, Black Hills has also made such huge investments, to ensure steady and uninterrupted supply of utility services for its customers in Arkansas. Further, a steady economic growth in Northwest Arkansas might have encouraged the company to invest in this state, for ensuring smoother and improved services.Notably these investments in improving its transmission and distribution system have been paying off well for Black Hills’ operating results, as is evidenced by its performance in the third quarter of 2017. Toward this, Black Hills witnessed an increase of 2.5% in revenues of $342 million.Now, a rate increase aids a utility operator to recover the costs of investments. In recent times, other few utilities have also proceeded in the same path like Black Hills, to enjoy the fruits of hiked rates in the form of enhanced profits.For instance, in June 2017, it was announced that Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report)  is gearing up to place a rate increase request to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission for natural gas, which would be effective for three years starting 2018.Price MovementShares of Black Hillshave underperformedthe industry in the last three months. The company’s shares lost 12.3%, against the industry’s gain of 1.3%.Such underperformance can be attributed to lower contribution from the company’s natural gas business that was negatively impacted by lower irrigation demand, during the third quarter of 2017.Zacks RankBlack Hills carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Investors can consider some better-ranked stocks from the same space such as IDACORP, Inc. (IDA  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc.

Of 55% of the total energy generated, nearly 21 gigawatt (GW) added in the United States during 2017, was from a renewable source. Also, 22% of the total electricity generation in the United States comes from a renewable source as of Feb 2018.In 2017, electricity generation from solar resources touched nearly 77 million megawatthours (MWH) in the United States and by 2018 end, EIA expects an additional 5,067 MW of solar power to come online. According to the forecast, solar capacity is anticipated to grow by 127 gigawatt (GW) from 2020 to 2050. Also, electricity generation will likely account for nearly 14% of the total energy output to be generated during the same period.Per Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the consistent growth over the years across some of the renewable energy sources is attributable to U.S. federal policies. Electricity generation from solar enjoys a special Federal Solar Tax Credit, scheduled to expire by 2022. This tax credit has enabled the growth of solar power generation companies as the credit allowed to power generators is transferred to end users via lower solar prices.Price MovementSince the release of the news, shares of PPL Corporation have lost 1.3% compared with its industry’s decline of 1.9%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksPPL Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are as follows:CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

These notes can be converted to equity at a 25% premium according to the closing price of $42.29 per common unit on Sep 6, 2017.Purpose of the OfferingThe capital accumulated from this offering will be utilized to fund the company’s expansion plans in the current year. The partnership is aiming to use a portion of the proceeds from this offering to acquire renewable assets either from NextEra Energy Resources or third parties. The partnership might utilize the proceeds to fund the initial cost of the capped call transaction and use the balance proceeds for general partnership purposes.The partnership has already received offers to buy the following assets from NextEra Energy Resources — 25.9% interest in Desert Sunlight 250 and Desert Sunlight 300 at Riverside County, CA; Brady Wind I and Brady Wind II at Stark and Hettinger counties, ND and Javelina I at Webb County, TX. However, the partnership is under no obligation to buy these assets.Expansion of Renewable PortfolioNextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) formed NextEra Energy Partners to own, manage and acquire contracted clean energy projects with stable and long-term cash flows.The partnership evaluates and adds high-quality renewable assets to its portfolio. During the second quarter, it completed the acquisition of 250 megawatts (MW) Golden West Wind project from NextEra Energy Resources for approximately $238 million.Why Renewable Energy?With global warming on the rise, it is important to plan energy consumption carefully. It is important to note that non-renewable energy sources are limited and will be exhausted in the near future. Therefore, major energy providers like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) and others are gradually switching to low or no-emission energy resources, such as solar, wind, hydro etc., which are available abundantly.According to U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2016, approximately 10% of total energy consumption in the United States was from renewable energy sources. We expect contribution from the renewable sources to the total generation mix to rise due to lower cost of power production from renewable sources and government’s initiatives to provide more impetus to renewable generation projects.Price MovementUnits of NextEra Energy Partners have returned 49%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 14.6% in the last one year.This outperformance could be attributed to the company’s growing renewable portfolio which has boosted its performance.Zacks RankNextEra Energy Partners carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

84,XEL,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) announced that it has filed a stipulation with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to invest in clean energy in rural Colorado. The filed stipulation is a broad collaboration between Xcel Energy and 14 other diverse groups.According to the filing, Xcel Energy seeks permission from CPUC to invest approximately $2.5 billion in rural Colorado, to increase its clean energy portfolio. The company has vouched that the approval will not increase customers’ bill.The Colorado Energy PlanXcel Energy stated that their aim is to provide low-cost power and increase the use of cleaner energy in its service area. If approved, the proposal will increase the company’s renewable energy portfolio to 55% by 2026.

As of now, Xcel Energy has lowered its emission level by 30% from 2005 levels and is on track to lower it by 45% through 2021.

Xcel Energy is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources. To this end, it is planning to invest about $4.2 billion in wind assets over the next three years.Focus on Green Energy by Utility Service ProvidersXcel Energy is not the only company undertaking additional measures to reduce carbon emission by reducing coal usage and increasing use of renewable energy, even when President Trump is actively promoting the usage of coal, to revive the industry.NextEra Energy's (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), has bought out existing contracts with two independent coal-fired power plants with the goal of shutting down both plants, thereby saving hundreds of millions of dollars for customers and reducing green house gas emission.Another utility giant who is investing heavily in clean power is Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report).

90,XEL,"FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Jul 27. Last quarter, this power management company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.86%.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFirstEnergy expects earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of 54 cents to 64 cents per share. The company secured regulatory approvals for base rate increase in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Ohio which are expected to boost the company’s top line.However, rising debt level remains a headwind for the company. FirstEnergy’s debt/capital ratio stands at 74.3% compared with the industry’s average of 49.7% and the S&P 500’s 41.9%. Moreover, the company’s current ratio stands at 0.36, which indicates that rising interest rates do not bode well for FirstEnergy. Also, the choppy return from competitive electric markets might adversely impact the company’s second-quarter result.FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | FirstEnergy Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FirstEnergy is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate is at 58 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 59 cents, resulting in an Earnings ESP of -1.70%.Zacks Rank: FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the utility sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Pattern Energy Group Inc.

91,XEL,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on July 27. Last quarter, this public utility company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe sign of economic improvement is prominent across Xcel Energy’s service territories, especially in Minnesota, compared with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in the company’s service territory was 3.2% in Dec, 2016, lower than the nation’s average of 4.7%.The optimism in the market continues to drive the company’s sales and is likely to boost top line in the second quarter.Additionally, the company has seen a consistent rise in the number of customers over the last few quarters. We expect this trend to continue in second quarter as well boosting its earnings.However, rising debt level remains a matter of concern for the company. Xcel Energy’s debt/capital ratio stands at 55.3% compared with the industry’s average of 49.7% and the S&P 500’s level of 41.9%. Moreover, the company’s current ratio stands at 0.71, so the rising interest rates do not bode well for Xcel Energy. This is because the resulting increase in cost of capital will escalate cost of operations, thereby denting its margins.Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Xcel Energy Inc.

94,XEL,"Electric services provider, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), has laid down a request for rate increase with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). If the requested new rates are approved by the NCUC, it will come in to effect spring 2018.Other DetailsThis recent filing would reflect an overall 2.5% increase annually, as Duke Energy Carolinas' last rate adjustment request in North Carolina was way back in 2013. Once approved by the state regulators, revenues are expected to increase by $647 million, for an overall average rate increase across customer groups by 13.6%. The average rate increase will be 16.7% for residential and 10.9% rate increase for commercial and industrial customers.Reason for Filing- Duke Energy’s TakeThe current rate request filing by the company is in sync with its aim of modernizing power plants, generating cleaner electricity, by responsibly managing coal ash and improving reliability. This, in turn is likely to increase value for customers and shareholders for a smarter energy future.Energy saving initiatives such as implementation of modern technologies at its facilities to expand scale of operations is likely to bode well, going forward. Notably, the company’s robust five-year capital plan and current plans of investing about $37 billion in growth projects over the 2017-2021 time frame support this notion.Our ViewThe solar energy market in the United States has evolved massively in the past few years. In fact, Duke Energy Carolinas has retired half of its older, less-efficient coal plants which lack state-of-the-art emission controls and had them replaced with cleaner, natural gas-fueled plants. The utility has also supported the sustainable growth of solar energy, helping move North Carolina to second in the nation for overall solar power.We appreciate the company’s efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing newer renewable projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.Another company that is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources is Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report). This utility is currently planning to invest about $4.2 billion in renewables over the next five years. The company expects to bring 3,400 megawatts of renewable generation online by 2020.Price MovementDuke Energy has outperformed industry in the last 12 months.

97,XEL,"Electric services provider, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), recently revealed its plans of constructing three solar facilities in Northern Kentucky. These solar units will incorporate 31500 solar panels and generate over 6.8 megawatts (MW) of electricity. Notably, these stations will directly serve the customers of Kentucky.Details of the ProjectOut of the three units, Walton Solar Power Plants 1 & 2, will be built in Kenton County. The site will have 19,000 solar panels installed and the capability of generating more than 4 MW of electricity.The third one – Crittenden Solar Power Plant – will be located in Grant County and will incorporate 12,500 panels. This plant will produce more than 2.7 MW of electricity.The company has laid down plans of completing a major part of the construction by the end of 2017. On being operational, these plants will be able to offer electricity to almost 1,300 average-sized homes.Duke Energy’s Take on the ProjectWith increasing demand for electricity in Kentucky, Duke Energy aims at making most of the opportunity by setting up more solar power plants in the state. Moreover, cost of building solar projects is cheaper than before, making it more cost-competitive compared with other sources of power generation. Being an experienced solar power supplier, Duke Energy enjoys a competitive edge over peers in reaching out to more customers. The company already serves 850,000 customers in the Ohio/Kentucky region.The three solar power plants set to be constructed in Northern Kentucky will complement Duke Energy Kentucky's existing power generation fleet in Kentucky, which incorporates a 650 MW coal-fired plant and a 500-MW gas-fired facility.Our ViewThe solar energy market in the U.S has evolved greatly in past few years. Since 2008, solar installations in the country have grown seventeen-fold from 1.2 gigawatts (GW) to an estimated 30 GW today.Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider offering efficient power and energy services across various states in the U.S. and other international areas. We appreciate the company’s efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing solar projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.In pursuit of green energy, the company has invested more than $5 billion since 2007. As of Mar 2017, Duke Energy Renewables owns and operates about 2,894 MW of renewable energy out of which 583 MW is solar.Despite President Trump’s withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris agreement and the strong steps taken by his administration to abolish the Clean Power plan, utilities are still inclined toward adopting renewable as source of energy. This is because, although Trump is currently aiming to revive the coal industry, no one can deny the fact that renewable energy is the future.Notably, 2,044 MW of solar PV were installed in the U.S., in first-quarter 2017 to reach 44.7 GW of total installed capacity, enough to power 8.7 million American homes. Moreover, the industry is forecasted to nearly triple over the next five years, surpassing 100 GW nationwide, according to the U.S. Energy Department.Naturally, other utilities like Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) and Westar Energy, Inc.  are also expanding base in solar power production to triumph in the long run, which can pose stiff competition to Duke Energy.Price MovementDuke Energy has outperformed the Zacks categorized Utility- Electric Power industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares gained 2.7% compared with the industry’s increase of 0.5%.Duke Energy’s strong focus on core domestic regulated and highly-contracted renewable business has augured well for its stable financial position and streamlined portfolio, which can primarily be attributed for this outperformance.Zacks RankDuke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors can also consider another top-ranked stock, Atlantica Yield PLC  which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Atlantica Yield reported an earnings surprise of 36.84% in the last quarter.

98,XEL,"Investors interested in Utility - Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with Xcel Energy (XEL  -  Free Report) and Alliant Energy (LNT  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system.

Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.XEL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.08, while LNT has a forward P/E of 19.38. We also note that XEL has a PEG ratio of 3.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. LNT currently has a PEG ratio of 3.47.Another notable valuation metric for XEL is its P/B ratio of 1.95. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LNT has a P/B of 2.25.Based on these metrics and many more, XEL holds a Value grade of B, while LNT has a Value grade of C.Both XEL and LNT are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that XEL is the superior value option right now.

This utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 2.33% in the last quarter.Why a Likely Positive SurpriseOur proven model shows that Xcel Energy is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

The upward revision in both electric and natural gas customers is expected to have a positive impact on demand.Continuous improvement in productivity through technology has lowered Xcel Energy’s O&M expenses. We expect the company’s initiative to keep O&M expenses flat, boosting margins in the first and coming quarters.Other Stocks to ConsiderIn addition to Xcel Energy, here are a few more players from the industry that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.CenterPoint Energy Inc.

(NRG  -  Free Report) etc. All of these companies are striving to bring down their carbon footprint.According to the projected figures, its coal usage is expected to drop to 42% of its generation mix by 2023, from the current level of 78%. The company will do the same by retrofitting emission control equipment in its existing coal plants, retiring old plants and replacing the coal fired units by renewable sources.Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) continues to execute its seven-year, $845 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. NIPSCO is also working to execute its seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to its electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability.Rising Debt LevelNiSource’s long-term debt was $6,777.4 million for the period ended Jun 30, 2017, compared to $6,058.2 million for the period ended Dec 31, 2016.The rise in long-term debt level is a matter of concern as it can lead to rise in interest expense and can erode the company’s profit margin. This newly issued debt will increase interest expenditure by approximately $30 million.Interestingly, during the second quarter the company was able to successfully refinance about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower-rate debt. This would help in saving a good amount on interest expense in the next few years. NiSource also expects that its strategic investments will allow the company to deliver its targeted earnings and dividend growth of 5-7% through 2020.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of NiSource have gained 15.3% outperforming the Zacks categorized industry's gain of 5.1%.This outperformance could be attributed to NiSource’s consistent investment to strengthen existing infrastructure and focus on clean energy.Zacks RankNiSource carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

104,XEL,"Southwest Gas Corporation (SWX  -  Free Report) filed an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to increase statewide overall general rate of $32.5 million including the benefit of reduced tax liability associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for its Nevada service areas. Through this rate increase filing, the company intends to recoup the capital investment made since the last rate filing in April 2012 in Nevada as well as for the planned capital investment going ahead.The previous rate hike came into effect from November 2012, which raised the company’s annual revenues by $7 million, lower than the filing rate hike of $26.9 million. Since the last rate filing in Nevada, the company’s total investment amounted to nearly $2,402.4 million for customer support, enhancement and replacement of gas infrastructure across all its three service territories, namely Arizona, California and Nevada.The company also received an approval for its planned proposal to expand its natural gas services to Mesquite, NV. The expansion approval calls for a capital investment of approximately $28 million, for construction of 17 miles of approach main and 20 miles of distribution pipelines.Infrastructure Replacement & Capex PlanCompanies distributing natural gas require a huge amount of capital spending to fund infrastructure needs. Over the past decade, the company’s expenditure to build, replace and upgrade its aging infrastructure has increased.The company is expected to incur a capital expenditure of nearly $2 billion over the period of 2018-2020 and estimates to recover 63% of the annual investment within a year’s time. It included a capital expenditure on replacement of 6,700 miles of vintage pipelines.Southwest’s Position in NevadaThe company is the largest distributor of natural gas in Nevada by serving the Las Vegas metropolitan area and Northern Nevada. At the end of 2017, the company had more than two million residential, commercial, industrial and other natural gas customers, of which, almost 0.75 million are based in Nevada alone. Also, the company derived 35% of the total operating margin in 2017 from Nevada.Nevada does not have significant amount of natural gas resources and hence, producing only a limited amount of the demand required in the region. Nearly, 88% of the total energy consumed in Nevada comes from outside the state.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2016, 73% of the electricity generated in Nevada came from natural gas. This demand for natural gas is greater than the usual supply in Nevada. Plus, three of five households use natural gas as the primary source of energy for home heating fuel. Therefore, this rise in requirement for natural gas in the region calls for more capital investment as well as exploration of growth opportunities for companies like Southwest Gas.Price MovementIn the last six months, the Southwest Gas stock has gained 12.8%, outperforming its industry’s rise of 6.8%. Other Stocks to ConsiderSouthwest Gas carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

107,XEL,"Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report) recently announced that Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) has signed a seven-year contract renewal for managed services, purchases of new Gen5 hardware and professional services.About the Previous DealThe renewal of the deal follows FPL’s contract award to Silver Spring Networks, Inc.  in 2007 before its acquisition by Itron. This contract involved the deployment of Silver Spring’s wireless IPv6 mesh networking technology, as well as management and control software to connect and control FPL’s meters.What’s New Under the Renewal Contract?Under the renewal contract, FPL will deploy Itron’s new Gen5 network hardware and 2,100 new automated feeder switches which will help the former in achieving its network reliability targets.

Birds of prey habitually nest on tall structures like electric transmission towers and poles. Drones can track and identify these nests quickly. Early removal of nests will lower the possibility of power outage and provide safety to the bird.Need for Regular MaintenanceIt’s mandatory for a utility electric company to maintain its network of transmission and distribution lines to supply uninterrupted electricity to customers. Expansion of business operation requires large investment toward maintenance of electric poles, lines and grids. Such initiative enhances resilience of the system against natural events and heightens reliability of services.Steps Taken by All SubsidiariesFirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $10 billion in regulated business through 2021 to strengthen and augment infrastructure. Recently, its subsidiaries completed the inspections of transmission lines. Since 2014, the company has upgraded or replaced existing power lines and incorporated smart technology into the grid. FirstEnergy upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features to serve customers more efficiently.The company has initiated a modernization drive plan named “Energizing the Future.” Aiming for upgraded and expanded regulated transmission capabilities, the company expects to invest $1-$1.2 billion annually through 2021.Modern Technology Used by FirstEnergyRegular monitoring and servicing involves more expenses, time and manpower.  Usage of modern technology offers a fast and safe method of surveying locations.

115,XEL,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark. So far, the results reflect a favorable trend, with an above-average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations.Total earnings for the 251 S&P members that have released results as of Feb 2, improved 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 80.5%, while that for the top line was 78.1%.Notably, we expect total Q4 earnings to rise 13% from the year-ago period on 7.7% higher revenues. At present, 14 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an improvement in earnings.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on Zacks Utilities sector this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to improve 5.5% in the fourth quarter.  Read more details in our weekly Earnings Preview.A Quick Glance at the Utility SectorUtility business is known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow, with the primary growth driver being consistent demand for electricity and utility services. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) predicted that annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 2.6% in 2018.Therefore, staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks assure investors a steady performance and regular dividends.However, utility stocks remain subject to heavy regulation, both at the federal and state levels. Moreover, being capital intensive in nature, higher interest rate environments tend to deter growth of these stocks. Notably, in 2017 Federal Reserve increased interest rates thrice, in March, June and December. This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector.Nevertheless, to maintain their performance level, utilities are resorting to cost-savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity with lower emission. Further, new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness growth in earnings in the fourth quarter.Projections for the Zacks Utilities sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its Q3 performance.The sector’s earnings are likely to improve 5.5% on 1.3% higher revenues. In the third quarter, earnings for this sector declined 3.6% on 2.1% sales slump.EXC or XEL: Which One is Poised for Better Q4 Earnings?This is going to be another busy week with 482 companies expected to release earnings including 92 members of the S&P 500. Let’s take a look at the Utility stocks, Exelon and Xcel Energy that are scheduled to announce their Q4 results on Feb 7.Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.16% in the last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.76%.We believe that the rate hikes at Atlanta City Electric effective September 2017 will have a positive impact on Exelon’s performance. Also, the company is expected to benefit from its cost-management initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $7.60 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 3.6%. The same for quarterly earnings is pegged at 62 cents per share, which represents 40.9% annual improvement.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimates if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Exelon currently constitutes that right combination.The Zacks Rank #3 company has an Earnings ESP of +0.88%.

The company expects O&M expenses to remain flat in 2017 owing to these savings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.94 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5.2%. The same for the quarterly earnings is pegged at 43 cents per share, which represents 4.4% annual decline.Xcel Energy is unlikely to beat on earnings this quarter as the Zacks Rank #3 company has an Earnings ESP of -1.43%.

During the day, all the three key U.S. indexes reached record high levels initially, but finished lower following a pullback. Markets have already traded higher in the last few sessions on optimism over the passage of the tax cut Bill and witnessed a sell-off after both the Houses actually passed the Bill on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.1%, to close at 24,726.65.

Thus the sector is expected to tread on a growth trajectory.Therefore, staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks will provide investors with steady returns. Currently, the sector is undergoing a transition, wherein the primary fuel source — coal — is being replaced by natural gas and renewables.However, utility stocks are subject to stringent regulations, both at the federal and state levels. Moreover, being capital intensive in nature, higher interest rates dent the growth of these stocks. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since December 2015 when the Federal Open Market Committee began increasing rates from near zero. This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector.Nevertheless, to maintain their performance level, utilities are undertaking cost-savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity. Further, new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness improvement in earnings in the first quarter.The quarter was also a witness to a colder-than-normal winter in most parts of the United States.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Xcel Energy, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

121,XEL,"NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24. Last quarter, this utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayManagement expects NextEra Energy’s performance in the first half of 2018 to be softer in comparison to second half results. The company expects its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company’s (FPL) performance to be lower than expected, as tax savings will not immediately offset its typical reserve amortization requirements. This is going to have an adverse impact on earnings in the first quarter.In January 2018, FPL announced its plans to apply federal tax savings toward the Hurricane Irma restoration cost of $1.3 billion. Otherwise, it would have increased utility bills of 4.9 million customers in the first quarter of 2018.However, the economy of Florida remains sturdy, with its current unemployment rate below the national average. Plus, new building permits indicate customer additions and an increase in demand from the residential space.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra Energy is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.NextEra Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  NextEra Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | NextEra Energy, Inc.
