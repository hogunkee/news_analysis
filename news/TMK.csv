2,TMK,"Credit rating giant A.M. Best has revised the outlooks for Torchmark Corporation (TMK  -  Free Report) and its units. The rating agency has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a-” and the Long and Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR and Short-Term IR) for Torchmark. Simultaneously, A.M. Best revised the outlook for the abovementioned ratings from stable to negative.Concurrently, the rating agency affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of “aa-” to Torchmark’s key life/health units. The outlook for these ratings has been revised from stable to negative.As categorized by A.M. Best itself, the company’s strong balance sheet, impressive operational performance, favorable business portfolio and an appropriate enterprise risk management are reflected by the life insurance units’ credit ratings.The outlook revisions of the aforementioned ratings denote the balance sheet’s waning in the past few years including a decrease in risk-adjusted capitalization on a consolidated and entity level basis.It is important to mention here that the rating agency has pointed out a few core units of Torchmark remaining below its target levels, mainly due to the above average level of National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) class two securities, pertaining to its general account investment portfolio. Also, thanks to the long duration of the class two securities that a rise in unrealized loss can occur with the advent of continued increase in interest rates or widening of credit spreads.Torchmark and its subsidiaries have consistently delivered favorable operating earnings on a statutory as well as GAAP basis with substantially higher profit margins than industry averages. The life insurer’s adjusted GAAP financial leverage currently stands at about 20% (decreasing to an extent in the recent years) while interest coverage stays very strong at over 10 times earnings. Both these ratios remain well within A.M. Best’s guidelines for the company’s current ratings.Rating or outlook affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence as well as maintaining credit worthiness of a stock. While downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently, Torchmark holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of Torchmark have gained 7.1% in a year's time against the industry’s decline of 8.4%. We expect solid operational performance, niche market focus and a robust capital position to drive the shares higher in the near term. Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in other top-ranked stocks from the insurance industry can also consider First American Financial Corporation (FAF  -  Free Report), National General Holdings Corp.

9,TMK,"The Finance sector is set to kick off its earnings season this week with major banks reporting quarterly results. Improving rate environment and tax cuts should continue to drive the sector’s performance.  Per the Earnings Outlook, earnings for the sector are expected to increase 18.5% on 3.6% higher revenues.Insurers, an important component of the Finance sector, are shortly going to release their financial numbers. Earnings of the Insurance Industry are envisioned to grow 12.2% in the second quarter, given a slew of tailwinds favoring its operating environment.Progressing Rate EnvironmentThe second quarter of 2018 marked the second rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year, reflecting a robust economy. The rate now stands at 2% with the regulatory body’s intentions of two more raises in 2018 followed by three in 2019 as well as a couple of in 2020.A Benign Cat EnvironmentAlthough the second quarter escaped the harsh lashes of Mother Nature, a few cat events like rain storms in the United States and Canada still plagued the period. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss of about $7.1 billion in the quarter under discussion. The analyst also noted that the count is much lower than the general tally of around $14 billion insurers having suffered natural calamities in any given second quarter.However, price hikes, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and adherence to reinsurance covers will help insurers withstand the deficits.Also, lower cat loss means lower claims, which in turn, strengthens reserves. The insurance industry is already boasting an all-time sturdy capital position.While surplus capital is lending a cushion to more capital deployment in growth initiatives, mergers and acquisitions plus shareholder value addition, the same is also responsible for restricting the desired pricing. A Morgan Stanley analyst noted that Jun 1 renewals witnessed an average 1% increase, which is lower than expected.Tax Reforms and Capital DeploymentPer the implementation of the new tax rate effective first quarter, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. Not only will this aid in margin expansion but also increase dividend payouts owing to rise in net profit available to shareholders.W.R. Berkley Corporation approved a 7.1% raise in dividends as well as a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share. Chubb Limited announced a 3% hike in quarterly dividend to 73 cents per share. Unum Group too enhanced its quarterly dividend by 13% and approved a new $750-million share buyback program.Promising Economic NumbersJob growth has been solid through the second quarter of 2018 with an average of nearly 0.211 million.  Unemployment rate in June was 4%.Per Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations, the GDP growth rate for the quarter is estimated at 2%.Price PerformanceThe Insurance industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index during the second quarter.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer have gained 7% in a year against the industry’s 4.4% decline. Let’s focus on the factors that make Torchmark a stock to retain for attractive returns.Solid Performance at American Income: Torchmark’s most important distribution channel —American Income Exclusive Agency — has been witnessing higher net sales, driven by increased agent count. The company projects life sales growth between 5% and 9% in 2018. An estimated producing agent count between 7,000 and 7,400 in 2018 should drive premiums higher.Consistent Operations at Global Life: Global Life operates in a relatively non-competitive market, selling basic life insurance products to middle and lower middle-income households and thus, staying beyond the purview of stiff competition. Focus on expanding margins rather than increasing sales or sales levels or margins as a percentage of premiums bearing fruit. Torchmark anticipates the underwriting margin to range between 15% and 17%.Excess Investment Income: The company has been witnessing improved investment income since the third quarter of 2016, driven by a decline in the negative impact of the lengthy delays in receiving Part D reimbursements. In 2018, the company anticipates about 3% rise in excess investment income.Effective Capital Management: Torchmark enjoys a solid cash flow, helping it effectively deploy capital. By virtue of its intelligent capital management strategy, the company generated more than 80% returns for investors over the past 10 years. For 2018, Torchmark estimates free cash flow between $325 million and $335 million.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $6.04, representing a year-over-year increase of 25.3% on 3.3% higher revenues of $4.3 billion. For 2019, the consensus mark for the bottom line stands at $6.50, translating into a 7.5% year-over-year rise while the same for the top line is projected at $4.2 billion, up 3.6%.Torchmark has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 12.9%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: The company flaunts a stellar earnings surprise history, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last nine quarters.

However, the bottom line improved 13.9% year over year.The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Travelers Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Travelers Companies, Inc. Quote This year-over-year increase in earnings can be attributed to higher net favorable prior-year reserve development along with a solid underlying underwriting gain. Moreover, lower income tax expenses, driven by the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate also contributed to the upside. However, a benefit of $39 million in the prior-year quarter from the settlement of prior-year tax matters, partially offset this upside. Nonetheless, the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks.Behind the Q1 Headlines Total revenues of Travelers rose nearly 5% from the year-ago quarter to $7.3 billion. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.2 billion. Net written premiums displayed a 5.1% year-over-year increase to $6.8 billion owing to growth in each business segment, namely Business and International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. Net investment income slid 1.1% year over year to $603 million on lower private equity returns. Increase in fixed income returns due to higher average level of fixed maturity investments as well as short-term interest rates, led to this downside.Travelers reported an underwriting gain of $258 million, up 22.3% from the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio improved 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.5% owing to higher net favorable prior-year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss.

Adjusted book value per share was $84.54, up 3.7% year over year. Segment Update    Travelers’ Business Insurance unit reported net written premiums of $3.9 billion, up 3.6% year over year. A continued strong retention, an improved renewal premium change and a solid new business led to this upside. Combined ratio deteriorated 110 bps year over year to 97.5% due to higher underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss. However, higher net favorable prior-year reserve development partially offset this downside. Segment income of $452 million grew 2.3% on the back of lower segment income before income taxes, which was more than offset by decreased income tax expense. Bond & Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums rose 5.5% year over year to $574 million, primarily driven by improved domestic surety premiums, a sustained solid retention plus an increased new business in domestic management liability. Combined ratio improved 470 bps year over year to 74.7% owing to lower underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss along with higher net favorable prior-year reserve development. Segment income improved 19.3% year over year to $173 million, attributable to higher segment income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Personal Insurance: Net written premiums increased 7.6% year over year to about $2.3 billion. Combined ratio improved 210 bps year over year to 97.5%, backed by a higher net favorable prior-year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss, partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio. Segment income surged 44.9% to $129 million, attributable to higher segment income before income taxes, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Dividend and Share Repurchase Update The property & casualty (P&C) insurer returned total capital of $598 million to shareholders in the reported quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums at the Life Insurance business for the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $606 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 5.2%.Further, the life insurer is expected to have displayed premium growth at its Health segment with the consensus mark pegged at $252 million, reflecting a 2.9% rise year over year. As a result, Torchmark has likely experienced total premium growth, driven by a favorable performance at both its Life Insurance and Health segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $857 million, denoting an improvement of 4.4% on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, higher number of agent count has likely driven an upside in net sales at American Income Exclusive Agency, the largest contributor to life premium and net sales plus Torchmark’s most important distribution channel.On the back of an improving interest rate environment (currently in the range of 1.50-1.75%) and higher new money rates, the company is anticipated to have reported higher excess investment income in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $219 million, translating into a 5.3% year-over-year gain.Also, the company has likely delivered top-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, mainly fueled by the anticipated growth in premiums and investment results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion, representing an increase of 5.1% on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, continued share buyback will likely boost the bottom line. The consensus mark for the company’s earnings per share in the period to be reported is pegged at $1.46, up 26.9% year over year.However, higher administrative expenses are expected to weigh on insurance underwriting income in the quarter to be reported.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to also exceed estimates this time around are as follows:Brown & Brown, Inc.

22,TMK,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing with 251 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances indicate a 16% increase in total earnings on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 64.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now.Per the Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 5.7% on 2.8% higher revenues.Industry OverviewThe insurance industry as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third. However, the insurers’ underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December, having raised enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017 reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is estimated to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.With 482 companies (92 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of quarterly releases on Feb 7.Stocks to ConsiderThe Allstate Corporation’s (ALL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results are likely to be impacted by catastrophe loss, stemming from the California wildfires. This will not only put a dent in the company’s underwriting performance but also render volatility to the company’s bottom line. Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer expects to incur a loss of $516 million from the California wildfires.Nonetheless, the results are anticipated to gain from a decline in the frequency of auto accidents and improved profitability in auto insurance, reflecting the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015.Further, on the back of an improving interest rate environment, the company is likely to have witnessed investment income growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.57 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 27.6% year-over-year decline. Allstate carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, combined with an Earnings ESP of -8.28% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read More: Will California Wildfires Hurt Allstate Q4 Earnings?)Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s (CINF  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results might take a beating by the occurrence of Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires during the period to be reported. This might also affect the underwriting profitability and leave an impact on the combined ratio.Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer has projected a loss of not less than $1 million in each of the aforementioned catastrophe events.Nonetheless, Cincinnati Financial is likely to report top-line growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. This apart, a gradual improvement in insurance rates and several growth initiatives might have contributed to the possible upside.On the back of a progressing interest rate environment, the company’s net investment income is predicted to have significantly increased in the quarter to be soon reported. Also, investment results probably have risen on both higher interest and dividend income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 86 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter represents a 14.7% year-over-year improvement. Cincinnati Financial holds a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, when combined with an Earnings ESP of -2.92%, surprise prediction is left inconclusive.

(PRU  -  Free Report) is likely to have witnessed bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter owing to expanded product offerings and broader distribution capabilities. To top it all, share buyback is expected to have added to the bottom-line upside.Moreover, the company might experience favorable results at its U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management segment, driven by its penetration and leadership in the pension risk transfer business. Additionally, on the back of higher Asset Management fees, the company might have witnessed growth in asset under management (AUM) in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Further, the company has possibly benefitted from a gradually improving interest rate environment, favoring investment income from higher invested asset balances.However, rise in expenses is likely to have weighed on the desired margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall performance in turn.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s bottom line is pegged at $2.60 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 5.7% year over year.  Prudential Financial has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a favorable Zacks Rank of 2.

As a result, Torchmark’s total premium might have increased, riding on a favorable performance at both its Life Insurance and Health segments.On the back of an improving interest rate environment, the company is anticipated to have reported higher excess investment income in the quarter yet to be reported.However, higher administrative expenses have been forecast to weigh on the insurance underwriting income in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $1.23 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 6% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $217 million, translating to a 5.9% year-over-year increase.Additionally, continued share buyback will likely boost the bottom line. The consensus mark for the company’s earnings per share in the to-be-reported period is pegged at $1.23, up 6% year over year.However, higher administrative expenses are estimated to weigh on insurance underwriting income in the quarter to be reported.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to exceed estimates this time around are as follows:CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 12.

Last quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28.57%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Genworth’s fourth-quarter results are likely to benefit from a better performance at its U.S. Mortgage Insurance.

26,TMK,"The Finance sector will kick off its earnings season this week with major banks reporting quarterly results. The sector’s performance will largely be driven by an improving rate environment, tax cuts, favorable operating environment and better domestic growth scenario. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings for the sector are expected to increase 19.2% on 4.5% higher revenues.Insurers, an important component of Finance sector, are due to report results starting next week. Earnings of the Insurance industry are estimated to grow 15% in the first quarter, given a number of tailwinds favoring its operating environment.Progressing Rate EnvironmentLast quarter marked the sixth rate hike by the Federal Reserve testifying economic stability. The rate now stands at 1.75% with intentions of two more raises in 2018 followed by three in 2019 as well as two in 2020.A Benign Cat EnvironmentThe first quarter of 2018 escaped the inclemency of Mother Nature, though there were cat events like California mudslide and northeast winter storms. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between $5 billion and $10 billion.Nonetheless, insurers having already suffered the rigors of cat loss last year, could manage to weather its first-quarter shortfalls too. Underwriting profitability must have been affected, albeit at a lesser magnitude.However, price hikes, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and resorting to reinsurance covers will help insurers withstand the deficits.Tax Reforms and Capital DeploymentPer the implementation of the new tax rate effective first quarter, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. Not only will this aid in margin expansion but also increase dividend payouts owing to rise in net profit available to shareholders.Insurers Assured Guaranty Ltd. has already approved a 12% increase in dividend while FBL Financial Group Inc. has approved a special dividend of $1.50 per share, hiking quarterly dividend by 4.5% and authorizing a share repurchase program of $50 million. Horace Mann Educators Corporation hiked quarterly dividend by 3.6%.Promising Economic NumbersJob growth has been solid through the first three months of 2018 with an average of nearly 0.202 million, better than 0.182 million a year ago.  Unemployment rate in March remained steady at 4.1% for the sixth straight month.Per Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations, the GDP growth rate for the quarter is estimated at 2.9%.Insurance Space Abounds With Consolidation CrazeThe last couple of years has set the stage for insurers to adopt an aggressive and positive approach toward the deal-making environment in 2018, mainly driven by an evolving industry and a proactive M&A environment.Apart from revamping taxation to make U.S. insurers more competitive globally, the tax overhaul provides a few good changes to make the M&A milieu more conducive to the players concerned. Moreover, other catalysts like pricing pressure and divestment of noncore assets have pushed acquirers to vie for a competitive edge in the buyout arena. Also given a continued capital inflow, the insurance industry’s available resources remain at an all-time high, helping insurers build a strong liquidity profile.A few high-profile deals struck in the first quarter are American International Group, Inc.’s (AIG  -  Free Report) decision to buy reinsurer Validus Holdings, Ltd. for $5.6 billion in cash. AXA Group’s 100% acquisition of XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) for $15.3 billion and Fidelity National Financial, Inc.’s agreement to purchase Stewart Information Services Corporation for a $1.2-billion cash-stock deal.Price PerformanceThe Insurance industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index since the onset of the first quarter. While the industry has decreased 7.9%, the elite index has declined 2.5%.Q1 OutperformersRiding high on tailwinds, insurers enjoyed a favorable operational backdrop to generate improved results.

27,TMK,"An improving economic backdrop, reflected by optimistic employment outlook, inflation approaching 2% and a growing GDP rate, is further testified by an increase in interest rate. The Fed has hiked rates six times since the financial crisis, of which, three were approved in 2017. The heightened pace clearly signals toward strengthening the U.S. economy.Recently, the Fed has raised the interest rate by 25 basis points, currently standing at 1.75% under the new chairman Jerome Powell. With three expected hikes in 2019 and two more in 2020, the interest rate is expected to reach 3.4% at 2020-end.Life insurers are a major beneficiary of the improving rate environment because of their sensitivity to interest rate. Though the life insurance companies have lowered exposure to interest-sensitive product lines, redesigning and re-pricing products, yet investment income forms a major component of the top line. Insurers reinvest premiums they receive from policy holders to pay future claims. An improving rate environment will favor better returns.Also, the improving economy indicates more disposable income and hence people opting for more insurance coverages, will drive the premiums higher for life insurers. Fed officials project unemployment rate stay about 4.5% over the longer term.The new tax rate effective January 2018 trims the tax burden by $1.5 trillion. A lower tax incidence will likely boost earnings.The Life Insurance industry, currently ranked at #71 (among top 30% of the Zacks Industry Rank for 267 industries), has underperformed the S&P 500 in a year, registering a gain of 5.2%. The index has climbed 16.2%.  Here we focus on two life insurers namely Torchmark Corporation (TMK  -  Free Report) and Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA  -  Free Report).Torchmark provides annuities, whole and term life insurance, accidental death insurance, health insurance, Medicare supplements and long-term healthcare policies. It has a market capitalization of $9.2 billion. Whereas Reinsurance Group with a market cap of $9.9 billion is primarily engaged in traditional individual and group life, asset-intensive, critical illness and financial reinsurance services.Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It will be interesting to note which is better-positioned in terms of fundamentals.Investors interested in the life insurance industry can consider a couple of better-ranked stocks like American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (AEL  -  Free Report) and FGL Holdings (FG  -  Free Report), both sporting  a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank stocks here.Price PerformanceBoth Torchmark and Reinsurance Group have outpaced the industry in a year’s time. While Reinsurance Group shares have rallied 27.6%, the Torchmark stock has gained 10.2%. Reinsurance Group emerges a clear winner here. ValuationThe price-to-book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers. Compared with the Life Insurance Industry’s P/B ratio of 2.13, Torchmark is underpriced with a reading of 1.56. Meanwhile, Reinsurance Group is way cheaper with a trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 1.07. This round also goes to Reinsurance Group as the company’s shares are cheaper than Torchmark’s.  Debt-to-EquityTorchmark’s debt-to-equity ratio of 23.4 and that of Reinsurance Group at 29.1 are respectively higher than the industry average of 8.9.

Reinsurance Group with an yield of 1.26% has an edge over Torchmark with the same of 0.71%. Hence, Reinsurance Group has an edge over Torchmark on this front. Return on EquityTorchmark’s return on equity of 10.81% is higher than the industry’s average of 10.5% as well as Reinsurance Group’s 8.6%. Return on equity is a profitability measure, identifying how the company is effectively utilizing its shareholders’ money. Comparatively, Torchmark betters Reinsurance Group here. Earnings Surprise HistoryWith respect to the companies’ earnings surprise history, Torchmark has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.48%. While Reinsurance Group has delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average four-quarter beat of 8.52%.Here too, Torchmark lies ahead of Reinsurance Group.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsTorchmark’s estimates have increased 2.7% for 2018 but declined 0.3% for 2019 in the last 60 days.  Whereas the consensus mark for Reinsurance Group has moved up 1.7% for 2018 and 1.3% for 2019.For Torchmark, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $6.03 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 25.1%.

32,TMK,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.83%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterThe occurrence of the California wildfires is anticipated to have a significant impact on XL Group’s fourth-quarter results. In fact, the property and casualty insurer has projected total pre-tax catastrophe loss, net of reinsurance, reinstatement and adjusted premiums plus redeemable non-controlling interest amounting to $315 million. Losses at such level will thus hamper the company’s underwriting profitability.Such a massive loss might lead to noticeably deteriorating the combined ratio as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric in the to-be-reported period is pegged at 92%.Further, the company has likely witnessed an increase in operating expenses in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to higher net loss and loss expenses incurred, claims and policy benefits as well as forex loss. This in turn might restrict the operating margin expansion as well.Notably, for 2017 the company expects operating expenses to be about $1.77 billion.Thanks to the recent corporate tax rate cut, the P&C insurer might incur a charge of $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to revaluation of its net Deferred Tax Asset. However, it is important to mention here that the charge will not have a material impact on the company’s fourth-quarter operating net income.Despite the interest rate hikes, the company is anticipating a fall in net investment income due to the still low-interest rate environment.Nonetheless, the company is likely to witness improvement in gross premiums written in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher premiums at both its Insurance and Reinsurance segments.Additionally, continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 49 cents, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.3%.What Our Quantitative Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that XL Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: XL Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 49 cents. A company's 0.00% ESP also makes suprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.XL Group Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  XL Group Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | XL Group Ltd.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 8%.Notably, Unum Group expects 2017 operating earnings to grow at or slightly above 5-8% range.Also, continued share buybacks should have boosted the bottom line.Moreover, the company has likely experienced premium growth at both Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, driven by improving sales and persistency.Further, voluntary benefits sales at Unum U.S. have likely improved in the fourth quarter.However, the results of Unum U.K. are expected to have remained soft, due to a challenging economic environment.Also, the company is estimated to display lower operative revenues at both Unum U.K. and Closed Block segments in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to exceed estimates this time around are as follows:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (AEL  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 7.

34,TMK,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 50.00%.  Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Chubb’s fourth-quarter underwriting results will be affected by the California wildfires. The company has projected catastrophe loss from the same at nearly $249 million after-tax. While from all other natural catastrophe events, net insured loss is estimated at $34 million after-tax. Such losses are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio in the to-be-reported period is pegged at 89%, a deterioration of 120 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, such losses will render volatility to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.30, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 15.4%.Premiums earned have likely reduced in the soon-to-be-reported quarter due to the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is pegged at $6.6 billion, representing a fall of 6.8% on a year-over year basis.Additionally, the company might have incurred higher expenses, mainly due to higher loss and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, administrative expenses and policy benefits. This in turn will weigh on the Chubb’s operating margin expansion.Nonetheless, the company is anticipated to have witnessed higher net investment income in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $773 million, translating to an increase of 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. This is mainly because of improving rate environment. Also, the company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $845 and $855 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Chubb has an Earnings ESP of -1.06%.

35,TMK,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Torchmark Corporation (TMK  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Torchmark Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the company is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree.However, the stock’s PE compares unfavorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.8.We should also point out that Torchmark Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 18.9, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Torchmark Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is much lower than the industry’s average, which comes in at 2.7 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Torchmark Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Torchmark Corporation a solid choice for value investors.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.5, which is better than the industry average of 12.1. Clearly, TMK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Torchmark Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives TMK a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have rising. The current year consensus estimate has risen by 0.2% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has also inched up by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Torchmark Corporation Price and Consensus Torchmark Corporation Price and Consensus | Torchmark Corporation QuoteThe stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, Torchmark Corporation is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LineTorchmark Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a good industry rank (Top 40% compared to over 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past year, its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to grab the stock as it appears to be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

37,TMK,"With 2017 at its threshold, investors have many reasons to cheer for. The economic backdrop has improved with GDP rising, improving employment scenario and major indices gaining year to date. While the S&P 500 has rallied 20.3%, Nasdaq has gained 12.3%.Gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017, a nice pick up from 3.1% in the second quarter. The Fed now estimates GDP to grow at 2.5% in both 2017 and 2018, reflecting an increase of 2.4% for 2017 and 2.1% for 2018, projected earlier. The Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to grow at 4.1% for 2017 while the same is likely to decline to 3.9% in 2018 and 2019.The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes this year, reflecting President Donald Trump’s bias for higher interest rates and the Fed’s confidence in the progressing U.S. economy. The interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50% after hikes in March, June and December. The outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019.Insurers are major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. Life insurers are sensitive to interest rates. They have suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. To withstand the unfavorable environment, they have gradually shifted to riskier asset like equities only to fetch in more returns from the policyholders’ claims and even lowered exposure to interest-sensitive product lines. Life insurers have redesigned and re-priced products, which should help them write higher premiums.Stronger corporate bonds and bettering real estate market might aid to curtail the credit-related investment losses. Also, the improving economy and higher inflation induced bonds look to yield good returns. In fact, a progressing economy indicates more disposable income with people opting for more insurance coverages.The Life Insurance industry is currently ranked at #54 (out of 265 Zacks Industry), representing the top 20% of the Zacks Industry Rank. The industry has outperformed the S&P 500 in a year by registering a 24.5% rally so far this year, thereby outperforming the elite index.Assured Value PicksWe have zeroed in on five undervalued stocks that investors might add to their portfolio with the help of our Zacks Stock Screener. Value investing is for those looking to buy stocks with the value lower than the intrinsic one. Hence, these investors target stocks with a low price-to-book (P/B) ratio or with high dividend yields.

42,TMK,"The stock market is marching higher, hitting multiple fresh highs amid Washington turmoil, geopolitical risks and lofty valuation. In such a scenario, dividend investing seems a perfect choice. These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pay high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation.Why Dividend Growth Investing Is Better?Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds –– potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market. This is because these stocks belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, while simultaneously offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks quality and promising investments for the long term. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that hike is likely in the future.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are six of the 24 stocks that fit the bill:Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report): This Georgia-based company is America's fastest growing international carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States and internationally. The company has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 38 cents over the past 90 days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 3.26%.

44,TMK,"The second-quarter earnings season has rolled out with 19% members of the elite S&P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of 97 index members (accounting for 28.1% of index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 8.4% on 5.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 78.4% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 72.2% outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance so far. 53.3% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported quarterly results shows 7.2% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 81.1% for the bottom line and 66.7% for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which will weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Few insurers have estimated to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events occurred during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) projects $638 million in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion that has built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting their confidence in the improving economic conditions. The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters. An improving rate environment not only aided an increase in Net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Also, improving economy means more disposable income and better consumer sentiment. This in turn, is likely to have supported more policy writings, driving premiums higher, which contribute a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been easing pricing, leading to soft pricing.  Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were the once mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have benefited insurers.This week will see more than 800 companies reporting their quarterly results, including 183 S&P 500 members.Let’s find out how these four insurers might perform when they release their quarterly numbers on Jul 26.XL Group plc (XL  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s leading providers of insurance, reinsurance and financial risk solutions for enterprises and insurance companies. In the last reported quarter, XL Group beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.70%. The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -1.12% complicate the surprise prediction.

45,TMK,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.25%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect a high level of losses arising from catastrophic events like Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and Mexico earthquakes. These calamities are likely to leave a significant impact on the underwriting results of the company, which in turn is anticipated to weigh heavily on the property and casualty (P&C) insurer’s overall performance.Travelers has projected a pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax. This will weigh on underwriting profitability and lead to deterioration in the combined ratio. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 96%.Further, the company is expecting to witness a fall in net investment income in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, owing to the still low interest rate environment. Travelers estimates about $15-$20 million of lower after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with 2016. Travelers has provided this estimate on the basis of the current interest rate environment and the specific securities, scheduled to mature in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income is currently pegged at $558 million, a 6.7% decline on a sequential basis.Nonetheless, the company expects to see improvement in its premiums to drive its top-line growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is $7.1 billion that represents an increase of 1.5% from the prior-year quarter.Business Insurance segment, which contributes majorly to the overall premiums, have likely witnessed higher premiums primarily fueled by strong production results in select and middle markets, thereby boosting the company’s revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Business Insurance revenues is $4.1 billion, which comes in line with that of the previous quarter.Further, Travelers’ premium growth will primarily be fueled by improving premiums across each business segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net written premiums is currently pegged at $6.41 billion, indicating nearly 1% rise on a sequential basis.Additionally, the company expects to experience improved profitability in auto business at its Personal Insurance segment owing to implementation of favorable pricing and underwriting actions. Also, the company is on track to achieve a double-digit renewal premium change on a written basis in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Travelers is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 60 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Travelers carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Hence, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.88%.

Notably, the company projects a net operating income from continuing operations per share between $4.63 and $4.77 in 2017. The $4.70 per share midpoint reflects an increase of 3 cents from the midpoint of the life insurer’s previous guidance.Further, the company has likely displayed a higher excess investment income in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.With respect to the surprise trend, the company delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.01%.Torchmark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Torchmark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Torchmark Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Torchmark is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

Strong growth in Asia drove this improvement.Manulife’s total insurance sales were $0.9 billion (C$1.1 billion) during the period under review, up 10% year over year. This is because sales in Asia increased 15%, the U.S. life insurance sales increased 5% and Canadian sales improved slightly all on a year-over-year basis.Wealth sales remained flat year over year at $1.5 billion (CS1.9 billion). Improved wealth sales in Asia were offset by lower business from the bank channel in Japan. In Canada too, sales declined 8% year over year.Manulife Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirements ratio was 234% as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 230% as of Jun 30, 2017. This sequential decline may be attributed to growth in retained earnings and net capital issuance. However, a moderate increase in required capital was partially offset.As of Sep 30, 2017, Manulife’s financial leverage ratio deteriorated 30 basis points (bps) to 29.5% from Jun 30, 2017, driven by an issue of $350 million of subordinated debt and lower earnings.As of Sep 30, 2017, assets under management were $802.7 billion (C$1000 billion), up 8% year over year.Core return on equity, measuring the company’s profitability, expanded 80 bps year over year to 10.6%.Segmental PerformanceAsia division core earnings came in at $342 million, up 13.2% year over year, banking on growth in new business volumes and a continued rise of in-force business. However, a small charge related to policyholder experience in third-quarter 2017 compared with a small gain in the prior year, partially offset this upside. Annualized premium equivalents sales climbed 15% year over year to $734 million in the quarter.Manulife’s Canadian division core earnings of $372 million (C$466 million) increased 32% year over year, driven by higher fee income in wealth and asset management businesses and a release of provisions for uncertain tax positions of prior years.Insurance sales increased 2.8% year over year to $148 million (C$186 million) on the back of higher sales in the small and mid-market group benefits segments.The U.S. division reported core earnings of $355 million, up 1.2% year over year. This upside was fueled by higher wealth and asset management earnings, primarily from higher average assets, lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs on in-force variable annuity business and higher tax benefits. Life insurance sales shot up 5% year over year owing to strong growth in Accumulation Universal Life, Index UL and term sales.Dividend UpdateThe company’s board of directors approved a dividend of 20.5 cents per share to shareholders of record as of Nov 21, 2017.

55,TMK,"The third-quarter earnings season is gaining pace with 17.4% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far.  The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 50.7% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported results so far shows 7.8% earnings growth on 3.3% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 71.4% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 50% for the top line is lower than the same of the S&P 500. Insurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 1.5% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma to come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion. Mexican tremors have all the more added to the woes.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect pricings to have been strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though rate environment is improving at a very slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) set to report their results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 24.Torchmark Corporation’s (TMK  -  Free Report) premiums are expected to have increased on higher Life as well as Health premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums reflects an increase of 3.7% year over year.Torchmark expects excess investment income to grow about 75% and between 9% and 10% on a per share basis in the second half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for excess investment income reflects nearly 6% rise year over year.However, higher administrative expenses will likely weigh on insurance underwriting income in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $1.20 for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a 4.2% year-over-year increase. Torchmark currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and combined with an Earnings ESP of +0.14% makes us confident of an earnings beat this quarter.

This will heavily drag the bottom line.Gross premiums written are also expected to be lower due to non-renewal of large international casualty quota share treaty. Nonetheless, lower operating expenses and share buybacks might offer a cushion to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of $3.74 for the yet-to-be-reported quarter compared with 44 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.  XL Group currently has a bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and combined with Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult this quarter.
