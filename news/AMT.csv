1,AMT,"American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) is set to acquire transmission towers from Telkom Kenya. The move comes as part of American Tower’s expansion plans and in fact, the Kenya market will represent the company’s fifth in Africa and the 17th globally.Specifically, up to 723 transmission towers will be purchased for an undisclosed amount, per the Reuters report. Notably, Telkom Kenya is the third biggest telecom company, in term of user count, in Kenya. It is 60% owned by London-based Helios Investment Partners and 40% by the Government of Kenya.  This transaction, which is likely to completed in the second half of 2018, will help Telkom Kenya unleash capital from the sellout, which can be invested in its internet network and enhance service delivery. On the other hand, the move will enable American Tower to capitalize on the expansion of mobile broadband in Kenya and fetch long-term gains.   Notably, there is a rising trend of telecom companies to shrug off the tower infrastructure to wireless infrastructure companies like American Tower, Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). This is because it helps telecom companies to avoid huge outlay of money in maintaining the expensive infrastructure and rather channelize resources on service delivery.And this growing trend is offering ample scope to these infrastructure REITs to prosper. In fact, wireless services are advancing rapidly in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of towers and equipment. Moreover, with the advent of new technologies, especially 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), companies like American Tower and Crown Castle International have higher chances of growth.However, consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments. In fact, take the example of the recent merger news of T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report). If such a deal materializes, then it can be a concern for the tower operators. This is because T-Mobile US and Sprint are being facilitated by the same wireless tower operators to install their cellular networks. However, a merger of these two will result in elimination of many overlapping towers and consequently, tower operators will lose on lease rentals.Nevertheless, American Tower currently continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 4G LTE and 5G networks. Its tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers lend it a competitive edge over rivals.Nevertheless, the company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. Further, high customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Additionally, the company has been affected by change in rate of foreign currencies, stiff competition and integration risks. Additionally, flaring up operating expenses remain another challenge for American Tower.American Tower currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Moreover, shares of company have gained 7.6% in the past year against 2.4% decline of its industry.

4,AMT,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on May 1. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to witness a rise year over year.The company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) QuoteFactors at PlayAmerican Tower faces fierce competition in the global wireless tower market from large incumbents like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, the company had $802.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and around $19,430.3 million of outstanding long-term debt, compared with $787.2 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of December 2016. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation which is needed to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may keep the company from accessing the debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.Customer concentration is very high for American Tower and the top four customers account for nearly 65% of its quarterly revenues. Further, American Tower is rapidly expanding in the international markets, especially in the emerging Asian and Latin American markets. Although this geographic diversification will boost revenues, it might jeopardize the bottom line. Tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market.Further, American Tower’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of $1.76 for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month. However, the figure witnessed rise of 11.4% from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, the company generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Additionally, it provides on-site maintenance and servicing of antennas, amplifiers and base-station equipment. Since moving equipment from one tower to another is cumbersome, carriers normally renew these contracts upon expiration. This generates a strong long-term lease upcycle.Revenues generated from the leasing and management of such networks are remarkable and more than 95% are recurring in nature. Moreover, most of its towers are over 210 feet tall, consequently providing sufficient space for the company's customers to install transmission equipment. The company also owns 29% of the land under its towers in the United States.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.74 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.14%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: American Tower has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Key PickSimon Property Group, Inc.

5,AMT,"Crown Castle International Corp.’s (CCI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $1.36 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. It also compared favorably with the year-ago tally of $1.24 per share.Results reflect increase in site rental revenues. The company continues to benefit from its extensive tower portfolio, high demand for infrastructure and slew of fiber-operator buyouts. Also, the company raised its outlook for 2018.Net revenues for the quarter amounted to $1.29 billion and marked year-over-year growth of 27.9%. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 billion. Crown Castle International Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteSite rental revenues were $1,153 million, up 34.5% year over year that included organic growth, as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items. Particularly, site rental revenues in the quarter experienced a $12-million benefit due to a long-term agreement signed with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) that includes contracted new leasing activity across towers and small cells.However, network services revenues came in at $146 million, down 8.2% year over year.Operating MetricsQuarterly operating income jumped 36.9% from the prior-year quarter to $349 million. Operating expenses also escalated 24.8% year over year to $950 million. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was approximately $763 million, representing year-over-year increase of 31.3%.Cash Flow and LiquidityCrown Castle exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $220 million, down from $314 million reported at the end of the prior quarter. Further, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company generated $452 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $442 million in the year-ago period.Total debt and other long-term obligations aggregated approximately $15,616 million, down from $16,044 million at the end of 2017.Dividend PayoutDuring the reported quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividend of $1.05 per common share, up approximately 11% from the year-earlier quarter.Q2 OutlookFor second-quarter 2018, Crown Castle expects site rental revenues in the range of $1,153-$1,163 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the band of $348-$358 million. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated in the range of $757-$767 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $154-$164 million range. Meanwhile, FFO is anticipated in the $496-$506 million band, while AFFO is projected at $539-$549 million.2018 OutlookCrown Castle raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company expects site rental revenues in the range of $4,639-$4,684 million, denoting a projected increase of $57 million at the mid-point from the prior issued outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the band of $3,097-$3,142 million, reflecting an uptick of $48 million at the mid-point. In addition, AFFO is guided in the band of $2,255-$2,300 million, marking a rise of $36 million at the mid-point.Our TakeCrown Castle is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. Furthermore, the company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. The company is also well on track with the integration of its recent fiber-operator acquisitions. In fact, extensive tower portfolio, increased demand for infrastructure, healthy leasing activity, continued buyout of towers and growing demand for mobile broadband are the key positives.Nevertheless, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments, and consequently, it might impact Crown Castle’s top-line performance. Also, evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases and flare up expenses.Crown Castle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

6,AMT,"Blackrock launched a fund on Apr 5, focused on providing exposure to the infrastructure space of the United States equity market.  iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF (IFRA  -  Free Report) seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the performance of the NYSE FactSet U.S. Infrastructure Index. Fund Characteristics  The fund’s index seeks to provide exposure to U.S. infrastructure companies that can benefit from an increase in domestic infrastructure activities.  The ETF’s index splits potential holdings into two groups — owners and operators — which could include railroads and utilities, and enablers. Enablers could be companies that provide raw materials or construction services. Each of the groups account for 50% of the portfolio, with the component stocks under the groups receiving equal weight. “In particular, IFRA may allow investors to express a thematic view as it’s designed to offer exposure to U.S. companies that derive more than 50 percent of their revenue domestically, which could benefit from a potential increase in infrastructure activities in the U.S.,” per an etf.com article citing a statement by Blackrock.  The fund amassed $2.6 million in AUM within a few days of trading. It charges a fee of 40 basis points a year.  The fund’s top three holdings include Potlatchdeltic Corp (PCH  -  Free Report), Vistra Energy Corp (VST  -  Free Report) and Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG  -  Free Report), with 1.2%, 1.0% and 0.9% exposure, respectively.  How Does it Fit in a Portfolio? The infrastructure segment of the U.S. market has played an integral role in the expansion of the U.S. economy. President Trump made repairing America’s infrastructure one of the key points of his election campaign.  Trump unveiled a $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan in February, which is based on heavy investments from local and state governments. The Republican leader is pushing to use $200 billion of federal money to aid the ailing infrastructure in the United States.  ""Now is the time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, to fight for our great American workers,” Trump said in a union training center speech in Ohio. In case Congress ends up passing the infrastructure bill, this fund will be among the highest gainers. Moreover, it is a one-of-a-kind ETF since there are hardly any funds with such a high inclination toward U.S. infrastructure specifically.  Competition The fund faces slight competition, owing to its high focus on U.S. infrastructure. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the infrastructure sector. ProShares DJ Brookfield Global Infrastructure ETF (TOLZ  -  Free Report)  This fund seeks to provide exposure to infrastructure stocks and tracks the Dow Jones Brookfield Global Infrastructure Composite Index.

7,AMT,"We are in the first full week of the Q1 reporting cycle, and only a handful of the S&P 500 players have released their earnings numbers, so far. Notably, banking giants kicked off the season on an impressive note, courtesy improved earnings and revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for five of the 98 Finance Sector companies on the S&P 500 (accounting 23.7% of the total market cap), that have reported earnings so far, have climbed 20.4% year over year on 6.9% higher revenues.Further, for the first quarter, as a whole, earnings of the finance sector, which includes REITs too, are expected to be up 22.7% year over year on 4.7% higher revenues.While the banking sector is already bustling with activity, we have a handful of REITs reporting earnings this week. Among these are Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to release results on Apr 18, after the market closes.     Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Crown Castle International Corp.This Houston-based REIT, engaged in the operation of wireless communication towers in the United States, is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. The company’s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported. Also, leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong.Moreover, the company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. In 2017, it fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets. These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment from the company’s customers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at $747 million for the first quarter, reflecting a projected increase of 0.8% sequentially. Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at $392 million, denoting an estimated jump of 26.5%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1.31 billion, indicating year-over-year projected growth of 29.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.34, reflecting a rise of around 8.1%.However, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services might flare up volatility for Crown Castle’s revenues.Our proven model cannot conclusively predict if Crown Castle will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Crown Castle to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Over the trailing four quarters, Crown Castle delivered an average positive surprise of 5.67% in terms of FFO per share. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteSL Green Realty Corp.The New York City's leading office landlord has been enhancing its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. In addition, its leasing activity is expected to remain decent amid improving economy and job market environment.Nonetheless, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate which curbs its pricing power. Furthermore, elevated supply of office space has been adding to its woes.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter net rental revenues is currently pegged at $262 million, reflecting a 1.1% decline from the previous-quarter figure. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment income is projected at $48.4 million, indicating 7.2% rise sequentially.Finally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $268.7 million, 4.5% lower than the prior-year quarter.  The FFO per share is projected at $1.65, reflecting a 5.1% improvement from the year-earlier quarter.In addition to the above, our quantitative model predicts that the chances of a positive surprise for SL Green are low. The stock has an Earnings ESP of -0.23% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

8,AMT,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, after the closing bell on Apr 18.For this Houston-based REIT, which is engaged in operation of wireless communication towers in the United States, the bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the previous quarter. Results were backed by 28.6% year-over year increase in site rental revenues that included organic growth, as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items.Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 5.67% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. The company’s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported and leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong.The company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. In 2017, the company fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets. These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment by the company’s customers.For the first quarter of 2018, Crown Castle expects Site Rental revenues of $1,132-$1,142 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $1,138 million, denoting a projected increase of 8.3%, sequentially.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at $747 million for the first quarter, reflecting a projected increase of 0.8% sequentially. Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at $392 million, denoting an estimated surge of 26.5%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1.31 billion, indicating year-over-year projected growth of 29.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.34, reflecting a rise of around 8.1%.In addition to the above, the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company’s tower and small-cell assets. This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things (IoT), and fixed wireless broadband.Remarkably, the IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers. It is anticipated to boost the company’s revenues.However, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments and therefore is expected to impact Crown Castle’s top-line performance.Furthermore, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s revenues. Evolution of new technologies might bring down the demand for site leases as well. Developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services will likely weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.34 over the past 30 days.Crown Castle’s shares have inched up 0.3%, against the industry’s loss of 4.5% in the past three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of +0.00%.

9,AMT,"According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) have recently expressed renewed interest for a possible merger. Notably, this will be the third instance that the companies are negotiating the merger.Ever since President Trump came to power, the telecom industry circle has been rife with speculations that the Trump regime may pave the way for a merger between the two companies mentioned above. It is to be noted T-Mobile US and Sprint are the third and fourth largest national telecom operators of the United States, respectively.  Change in Regulatory Stance to Aid M&AsThe previous administration under Barack Obama was strictly against further consolidation of the U.S. telecom industry. The U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) firmly stated that it wanted at least four powerful national telecom operators in the country.However, the newly restructured FCC under Trump’s presidency has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration. The FCC is most likely to roll back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime. The FCC’s stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions.Why did Earlier Attempts to Acquire T-Mobile Fail?In 2011, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) placed the first bid of $39 billion for gaining full control of T-Mobile US. After a close inspection, the FCC thwarted AT&T’s attempt to acquire T-Mobile US, stating that it seeks a minimum of four national carriers in order to maintain competitiveness.In July 2014, Sprint offered $16 billion for a little over 50% stake in T-Mobile US. The deal was thoroughly evaluated by both the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice with the regulators coming to the same conclusion again. Consequently, Sprint opted out of the race. Sprint and T-Mobile US once again negotiated in last year which broke down on November over the leadership dispute of the merged entity.The WinnersBoth T-Mobile US and Sprint will benefit significantly from the proposed merger. At present, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T together control around 68% of the U.S. wireless market. The merged entity with around 32% market share will be a formidable challenger to both Verizon and AT&T. Yesterday, stock prices of Sprint and T-Mobile US jumped 17.1% and 5.7%, respectively.Notably, Verizon and AT&T will also benefit as these two large telecom carriers were facing severe pricing pressure from unlimited data offerings of T-Mobile US and Sprint. If these two companies merge then Verizon and AT&T will face lesser competition and won't have to invest as much in marketing and promotions to retain subscribers. A decrease in promotional expenditure will raise their operating margins. Share prices of Verizon and AT&T increased 2.9% and 1.8%, respectively, following the news.The LosersMajor losers of the proposed merger will be wireless tower operators like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Yesterday, these three stocks plunged by 4%, 4.8% and 5%, respectively.Consolidation of telecom operators generally results in lower capital spending. T-Mobile US and Sprint being facilitated by the same wireless tower operators to install their cellular networks. However, a merger of these two will result in elimination of many overlapping towers and consequently, tower operators will lose on lease rentals.  The chart below depicts the price performance of T-Mobile US and Sprint year to date.Both Sprint and T-Mobile US currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineThe U.S. telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition, as success to a great extent depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Moreover, the competition is likely to intensify further in the U.S. wireless industry in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators). The proposed merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint will enable the consolidated entity to strengthen its foothold.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

10,AMT,"Vident Financial launched a new fund on Mar 27, focused on providing exposure to the real estate space of the United States equity market.U.S. Diversified Real Estate ETF (PPTY  -  Free Report) seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the performance of the U.S. Diversified Real Estate Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund’s index seeks to employ a rules based approach to offer investors a multi-factor alternative to traditional market cap-weighted real estate funds. “If you ask for the three most important factors when investing in real estate, you’ll probably hear ‘location, location, location.’ To this we’d add property type and leverage,” per a Business Wire article citing Fred Stoops, head of real estate investments at Vident.The fund amassed $9 million in AUM within a few days of trading. It charges a fee of 53 basis points a year.  The fund’s top three holdings include Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Avalonbay Communities Inc (AVB  -  Free Report) and Terreno Realty Corp (TRNO  -  Free Report), with 3.8%, 3.4% and 3.0% exposure, respectively.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?The Real Estate segment of the U.S. market has played an integral role in the expansion of the U.S. economy. Although it requires immense knowledge about the sector and bears significant risks, equity funds providing exposure to the sector are a great way to diversify traditional portfolios.  Owing to its low correlation with other asset classes, the real estate sector is a great diversifier. Moreover, real estate investments are a great way to gain inflation protection, as rising prices increase the resale value of the property and it can also be used to generate rental income.   CompetitionThe fund faces intense competition. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the real estate sector.iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to real estate stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index.

12,AMT,"On Mar 5, we issued an updated research report on Crown Castle International (CCI  -  Free Report).Crown Castle is a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States. It owns, operates and leases more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 60,000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber solutions in every major U.S. market.Let’s have a look at what’s affecting the tower operator’s performance.UpsidesCrown Castle has been continuously trying to reposition itself from a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity), through the purchase of several fiber operators. Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators: FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in January 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in April 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in September 2014). On Jun 26, 2017, the company gained ownership of more than 28,000 route miles of fiber with the purchase of privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC. With the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) on Nov 1, 2017, Crown Castle attained ownership of more than 60,000 route miles of fiber. Crown Castle aims to leverage the fiber assets to serve two main business lines — small cell network deployments in top metro markets and other enterprise and adjacent wholesale opportunities.Meanwhile, wireless services are rapidly gaining ground based on technological advancements and network upgrades. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Crown Castle successfully addresses this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon, AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US. The company has acquired 9,700 wireless towers from AT&T and taken over 7,200 wireless towers of T-Mobile US.The deployment of 5G network should also drive growth in the company’s tower and small cell assets as wireless carriers are trying to expand and improve networks. The industry has become a battleground for the 5G race. Notably, completion of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) first implementable 5G New radio (NR) specification has set the stage for the global mobile industry to initiate full-scale development of 5G NR for large-scale trials and commercial deployments in 2019.Dividend PayoutsDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $427 million in aggregate or $1.05 per common share, up around 11% on a per share basis from the year-ago quarter.We are also impressed with Crown Castle’s board of directors’ decision to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share, payable on Mar 30, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 16, 2018. Notably, the company portrays an impressive record of dividend payouts.As investors prefer an income-generating stock, a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Hiked 2018 OutlookApart from the positives, Crown Castle’s bright outlook for 2018 is encouraging. The company expects Site Rental revenues in the range of $4,582-$4,627 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the $1,360-$1,405 million band. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $3,049 million and $3,094 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $642-$687 million range. FFO is expected in the range of $1,965-$2,010 million. AFFO is estimated between $2,219 million and $2,264 million. Net income is anticipated between $511 million and $591 million.Positive Earnings SurpriseCrown Castle has a positive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, the average beat being 5.67%.Estimates Trend UpWe note that sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Crown Castle have moved up for the first two quarters of 2018 as well as full-year 2018. Sales for first and second quarter of 2018 are estimated at $1.31 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, indicating year-over-year growth of 29% and 27.7%. For 2018, sales are projected at $5.34 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 22.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first and second-quarter 2018 EPS is pegged at $1.34 and $1.39, respectively, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.1% and 15.8%. For 2018, EPS is estimated at $5.54, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 14.2%.The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism on prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceCrown Castle has underperformed its industry in the past three months. Shares of Crown Castle have lost 3.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.1%. DownturnsCrown Castle continues to compete against behemoths like American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications (SBAC  -  Free Report) in the global wireless tower market. Moreover, consolidation in the wireless industry has reduced demand for cell tower and is therefore expected to dent Crown Castle’s top line. Further, new technologies are reducing demand for site leases and are driving costs. High customer concentration is also a concern for the company.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

14,AMT,"After three consecutive days of gains, benchmarks finished in the red on Tuesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments renewed concerns over increase in the pace of rate hikes. Powell in his speech to Congress indicated that the U.S. economy is strengthening and signaled that the key rate might be increased at a gradual pace. However, investors fretted that the central bank’s move to stop the economy from overheating might lead to not just three but even four more rate increases this year. How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.2%, or 300.96 points, to close at 25,410.03. The S&P 500 fell 1.3% to close at 2,744.28. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,330.35, losing 1.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 17.7% to close at 18.59.

On Nasdaq, a 3.07-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles as Rate Hike Fears LoomIn his first appearance on Capitol Hill, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell presented an encouraging picture of the U.S economy. Powell expressed confidence that the coming few years will be “good years for the economy”. After all, Americans are willing to spend more and business houses have ramped up their investments, helping to boost productivity.Consequently, traders predicted that an upbeat economy will fuel inflation further and prompt the Fed to step in and hike rates at a faster pace.  Many of them are already predicting the Fed will increase rates four times instead of three. According to data from the CME Group, odds of four rate hikes by year-end rose to 33% on Tuesday from about 20% on Monday.For the time being, Powell maintained that the Fed would keep to its plan of hiking rates three times this year. But, he did mention that “we’ve seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target”.Following a three-day long rally, all the key U.S. indexes declined as investors remained wary of an increase in the pace of rate hikes.

The movement lacked specific catalysts, but some of the gains came after the Fed released its semi-annual monetary policy report on Friday ahead of the new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s first testimony on monetary policy in the Congress on Tuesday.In the monetary policy report the Fed sees the labor market is “little beyond full employment,” but wage gains will grow moderately. The report indicated that inflation will remain near or lower than Fed’s target rate of 2% this year. However, the semi-annual report did not throw any light on the number of rate hikes this year.Additionally, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Monday that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will “do a lot of rate hikes” provided the Committee has enough data to support such a move. Bullard’s cautious tone was mainly because he argued that the economy is still in a low-inflation, low-growth ""regime.""Meanwhile, the Dow registered an increase of around 400 points.

17,AMT,"American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) is a real estate investment trust and a leading wireless tower operator. The firm through its subsidiaries owns, operates and develops wireless and broadcast communications real estate.Notably, American Tower has been aggressively buying towers in emerging markets. We believe the company’s acquisition spree should help drive its top line, going forward. Moreover, American Tower is certain that strength in its tower portfolio will help it double its AFFO per share by 2017. Further, higher adoption of smartphones/tablets, increased deployment of 3G/4G networks, significant margin improvement and dividend hikes also bode well.On the flip side, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may generate significant financial uncertainty for the company. Moreover, American Tower has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. High customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Expansion in the global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds.Zacks Rank: American Tower currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below:Earnings:  American Tower reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted AFFO per share of $1.59.

20,AMT,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 27.The company’s bottom-line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAmerican Tower faces fierce competition in the global wireless tower market from large incumbents like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).  The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of third-quarter 2017, it had $799.47 million in cash and cash equivalents and around $18,581.4 million of outstanding long-term debt compared with $787.16 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of December 2016. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation, which is needed to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may restrain the company from accessing the debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.Customer concentration is very high for American Tower and the top four customers account for nearly 65% of its quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation    among them will have a significant material impact on the top line. Moreover, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may generate significant financial fluctuations for the company.Buoyed by such headwinds, American Tower’s shares have lost 5.6% in the last three months. However, the stock performance was better than the industry’s decline of 13.3%.Meanwhile, the company generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Additionally, it provides on-site maintenance and servicing of antennas, amplifiers, and base station equipment. Since moving equipment from one tower to another is cumbersome, carriers normally renew these contracts upon expiration. This generates a strong long-term lease up-cycle.The revenues generated from leasing and management of such networks is remarkable and over 95% is recurring in nature. Moreover, most of its towers are over 210 feet tall, consequently providing sufficient space for its customers to install transmission equipment. The company also owns 29% of the land under its towers in the United StatesIndia, EMEA and Latin American markets together have contributed nearly 50% of the organic core revenue growth. Meanwhile, total international revenues amounted to $751 million, up 13.6% year over year. Within this, revenues from Asia totaled $298 million, up 10.4% year over year. EMEA revenues grossed $155 million, up 18.3% year over year. Latin America revenues totaled $298 million, up 14.6% year over year. The company’s total revenues from international business are likely to outperform the U.S. revenues in the next three to seven years.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

(SBAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Feb 26.The company’s bottom-line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missing the same in other two. Consequently, it recorded an average miss of 5.93%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that SBA Communications is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements.Zacks ESP: SBA Communications has an Earnings ESP of +24.82%.

Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of SBA Communications’ favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat at the company.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are impressed with SBA Communications’ innovative network expansion methodologies which have helped it to substantially add subscribers and compete against market behemoths like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) in the global wireless tower market.Wireless services are advancing rapidly in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. SBA Communications effectively addresses this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is anticipated to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video. SBA Communications is a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the United States and internationally, offering wireless customers in-depth management experience, scale and resources.The company offers wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks. Its services include site identification and acquisition as well as obtaining zoning approvals and permitting networks representing all technologies. SBA Communications also provides a broad range of cell site equipment installation, optimization and integration services. The company’s extensive site development experience includes participation in the development of more than 45,000 communication sites.Buoyed by such tailwinds, SBA Communications’ share price gained 15.9% in the past six months surpassing the industry’s growth of 10.7%.Meanwhile, customer concentration is very high for SBA Communications and the top four among its customers, namely, Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, account for majority of its total quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will lead to a significant material impact on the company’s top line.

23,AMT,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Jan 24.While the company’s bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, it lagged the same in the remaining two quarters with an average beat of 2.53%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry may reduce demand for cell tower deployments and therefore is expected to have an adverse effect on Crown Castle’s top line.The merger between AT&T and Leap Wireless had a bearing on Crown Castle as it has 1,300 towers with both the carriers. Likewise, the combined entity of T-Mobile US and MetroPCS negatively impacted Crown Castle that had 1,400 towers jointly shared by these companies. Also, the merger between Sprint and Clearwire served as a hurdle for Crown Castle as both share 2,700 of its towers.Furthermore, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. Historically, the top four among its customers, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, accounted for majority of its total revenues, of which AT&T contributes a handful amount of site rental revenues. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top line.Evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases as well. Developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services are likely to weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.On the flip side, Crown Castle’s continuous efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) looks impressive. Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators - FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in January 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in April 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in September 2014).On Jun 26, 2017, Crown Castle International completed the acquisition of privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC. Notably, Wilcon is the premier service provider of dark fiber, lit transport, Internet access and colocation services in Southern California. Currently, it owns 1,900 route miles of fiber in Los Angeles and San Diego. As a result, Crown Castle gained 28,000 route miles of fiber.On Nov 1, 2017, Crown Castle completed the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) from Berkshire Partners, Pamlico Capital and other investors for approximately $7.1 billion in cash (subject to certain limited adjustments). With this buyout, Crown Castle is anticipated to attain ownership over 60,000 route miles of fiber. These deals are expected to increase opportunities for small cell network deployments in top metro markets.Moreover, the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company’s tower and small cell assets. This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things (IoT), fixed wireless broadband.Markedly, IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers. Going forward, it is anticipated to boost the company’s revenues.Buoyed by such tailwinds, Crown Castle’s shares have gained 5.17%, against the industry’s loss of 2.99% in the past three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen.

24,AMT,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) announced that its fourth-quarter financial results will include certain items that will have a negative impact of 18 cents on its funds from operation (FFO) per share. However, this amount will be excluded in the adjusted FFO per share figure.The non-recurring items will have a loss impact of 20 cents per share, after non-controlling interests, on its net income for the quarter. Similar to FFO, the adjusted net income will exclude the impact.On account of a reduction in corporate tax rates under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as of Dec 22, 2017, this real estate investment trust (REIT) will recognize $34.8 million of tax expense. The tax expense pertains to a reduction in deferred tax assets — primarily 220 Central Park South — of Vornado’s taxable REIT subsidiaries.  The company will also record expense of $4.8 million that concerns the prepayment of $450 million of aggregate principal on its senior unsecured notes. Specifically, on Dec 13, 2017, the company prepaid the principal amount on the 2.5% notes due in 2019.Vornado will also report net loss from other items amounting to $1 million. This includes any losses from the real estate fund.  The company also stated that the aforementioned figures are preliminary estimates and are conditioned on the completion of the financial closing procedures. Hence, it does not assure any consistency between these estimates and the final results.Notably, Vornado, focused on improving its core business, has been making opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures in addition to business spin-offs. In fact, well-planned sell-outs provide it with the dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic acquisitions. The company also strives to improve its liquidity position and achieve decent leverage with well-manageable debt maturities.However, dilutive impact on earnings from divestitures of assets cannot be bypassed in the near term. Further, intense competition and hike in interest rates remain concerns.Shares of Vornado have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in six months’ time.

25,AMT,"Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) reported an in-line result in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Though the company experienced improved operating environment in the quarter, it did not recognize any promote income.However, Prologis has a mixed surprise history. The company surpassed the FFO per share estimates in two occasions and met in the other two, over the preceding four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 2.33%. This is depicted in the graph below:The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 66 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market has been experiencing solid growth, backed by the recovering economy and job-market improvements, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.Amid this, Prologis has the capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations. The company also has solid balance-sheet strength. Also, its build-to-suit activity remained impressive in the second half of 2017, with the company completing 13 development projects. With a total expected investment (TEI) of approximately $350 million (on a Prologis-share basis), these projects included more than 4.7 million square feet of space.Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) was awarded 21 build-to-suit development projects during the same period, denoting over 6.7 million square feet of space. The TEI of these developments totaled roughly $550 million on a Prologis-share basis.In fact, for full-year 2017, the company completed 33 build-to-suit projects, covering more than 12 million square feet of space. During the year, it also commenced 38 projects with a TEI of nearly $1.1 billion.Notably, this high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank as well as the sturdy network of multi-site customers which are increasingly focusing on e-commerce. In fact, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts has achieved the highest level since 2013.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long and chances of any sound improvement in rent and occupancy growth in the to-be-reported quarter seem limited.Rather, there is intense competition in the market. Also, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to elevated supply, and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at $532 million, denoting a drop of 5% from the year-ago quarter.Therefore, prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 66 cents per share over the past 30 days.Furthermore, Prologis has underperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. The company’s shares have dipped 4.6%, while the industry incurred loss of 4.3% during this time frame.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Prologis does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is +0.10%.Zacks Rank: Prologis carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

26,AMT,"Benchmarks closed in negative territory on Thursday following concerns over a likelihood of a government shutdown. Sectors like real estate and utilities, which are considered as alternatives to bonds, declined after yield on 10-year Treasury notes reached its highest level since 2014. Additionally, increase in U.S. gasoline inventories and sharp rise in domestic crude production weighed on oil prices, which in turn led the energy sector downward.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.4%, or 96.32 points to close at 26,115.65. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to close at 2,798.03. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,296.05, losing 2.23 points. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 2.6% to close at 12.22. A total of around 6.93 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.3 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Shutdown Specter Weighs on BenchmarksAfter closing at new all-time highs on Wednesday all the three key U.S. indexes fell on Thursday following concerns of partial government shutdown.  On Thursday, the House voted 230 to 197 in favor of passing a short-term spending bill, in order to avoid government shutdown. However, the bill is expected to face a setback in the Senate, which in turn raised concerns of a possible government shutdown. Following this development, nine of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors fell during the day.Higher rate environment and optimism of a steady economic growth weighed on bond prices. Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.579% to 2.611% on Thursday, reaching its best level since September 2014. Higher treasury yields weighed on steady dividend paying sectors like real estate and utilities.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) declined 1%, becoming the worst performing sector of the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) fell 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively. Additionally, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) decreased 0.6%, with its two major components Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc.

28,AMT,"On Jan 15, we issued an updated research report on Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA  -  Free Report), commonly known as MAA. The company has a well-balanced portfolio and its focus on making strategic investments augur well. Further, growing demand for residential units in its footprint and balance sheet strength should keep its growth momentum alive.However, concentration of operations in certain markets is a concern for MAA. Also, competition with other players and hike in interest rates add to its woes.MAA maintains a well-balanced, diverse portfolio with presence in around 39 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), located in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. The portfolio is diversified in terms of markets, submarkets, product types and price points. This shields the company from economic downturn in any particular market, choppiness in any product-type or assets belonging to specific price points.Moreover, strong job growth in the core markets has kept demand for MAA’s portfolio alive. Over the long run, positive demographic trends, supported by the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration, as well as migration of population to the Southeast and Southwest, are likely to give a boost to apartment rental demand in its markets.The company has been experiencing strong demand for apartments since 2016 and expects a further boost in 2018. This is evident from higher occupancy and effective rent per unit. Management also noted that job growth in the company’s operating markets of Austin and Dallas for 2017 compared favorably with the national average.Driven by such initiatives, analysts are optimistic about the prospects of the company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share going up marginally over the last 60 days. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gained 2.7% in 2017 compared with 2.5% rise for the industry.On the flip side, MAA’s operations are largely concentrated on the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. In fact, as of Dec 31, 2016, around 40% of the total portfolio of the company was located in the top five markets of Atlanta, Dallas, Austin, Charlotte and Tampa. Therefore, performance of the company has a high chance of being affected by the general economic conditions of these regions.Further, there is stiff competition in the residential real estate market with various housing alternatives like single-family housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and new and existing home markets. This curtails the company’s power to raise rent or increase occupancy.Stocks That Warrant a LookRexford Industrial Realty (REXR  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of nearly 1% for 2018 in the last 60 days.

29,AMT,"Cousins Properties’ (CUZ  -  Free Report) office assets have been experiencing decent demand from existing tenants. Recently, the company signed a renewal and expansion lease with Bank of America, N.A. for office space at Fifth Third Center.Specifically, the bank renewed its 294,000-square-foot lease and signed for another 24,000 square feet of space at the property. Per the deal, Bank of America will occupy nearly half of the 698,000-square-foot office tower in Charlotte’s Uptown submarket.  The deal enables the bank to occupy a total of 318,000 square feet of space and extend its lease maturity from 2022 to 2025. With its headquarters just one block away from the Fifth Third Center, this lease expansion is a strategic fit for Bank of America.  While such deals with well-known companies instill confidence in its assets, the company has also been making diligent efforts to develop other premium office assets. Recently, it signed a joint-venture (JV) deal with Riverside Resources and Ironwood Real Estate, for development of a 309,000-square-foot office tower — 300 Colorado — in Downtown Austin. Cousins Properties will hold 50% ownership interest in this property. With estimated development cost of $175 million, the office tower is expected to be delivered in December 2020.Cousins Properties’ high-quality office assets located in the Sun Belt region have the capacity to drive long-term growth. However, the company faces intense competition from other market players. This impacts its ability to retain and attract tenants at higher rents. Moreover, despite improvement in the job market, fundamentals of the office real estate market might be adversely affected due to rise in new deliveries of office space.Cousins Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

31,AMT,"Wireless tower operators in the United States had a robust 2017. We believe that there are several reasons for this dream run to continue in 2018, the primary being the thrust in the U.S. public safety network.  Recently, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) together revealed that all the 50 states of the nation, as well as two U.S. territories and Washington D.C., have entered the FirstNet project, the first dedicated nationwide wireless network for first responders.Notably, in March 2017, AT&T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.Per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for both commercial and consumer purposes. This is why several industry researchers believe that the FirstNet project may come as a boon to cell tower operators such as American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). SBA Communications became the first tower company to confirm that it has received applications from AT&T for the buildout of the FirstNet network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network. Additionally, Rivada Networks has also decided to lay out public safety network.Wireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers.Tower operators generally have long-term (typically five - ten year) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers. We believe that a strong business model coupled with growing deployment of public safety networks will give a major boost to wireless tower operators in 2018.Zacks RankCrown Castle has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

35,AMT,"U.S. wireless tower operators had a dream run in 2017. American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) was certainly one of the major beneficiaries. We believe there are a number of reasons for this stellar show to continue in 2018. We will discuss the reasons in short.Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U.S. wireless carriers. In this context, Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Strong Business ModelWireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers. Tower operators generally have long-term (typically 5 -10 years) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is expected to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video.Importantly, American Tower has a highly diversified business model. Apart from its leadership position in the United States, the company has a strong foothold in Asia (especially in India), Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. In 2016, American Tower generated 41% of its total revenues from outside homeland. Management expects international revenues to top U.S. sales in next three to seven years.American Tower is highly enthusiastic about its India operation where the company already controls over 58,000 towers. In November, 2017, American Tower entered into an agreement to buy about 20,000 towers from Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian business and Idea Cellular Ltd., for approximately $1.2 billion. The tenancy ratio is expected to rise to 2.9 times by March 2020, from about the 1.95 times average for India in 2015.Massive Spectrum Deployment by U.S. CarriersWireless networks will be integral to the future growth of the overall telecom industry. T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low-band airwaves. This year, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low-band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project.Moreover, AT&T will also install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network.Additionally, major U.S. telecom operators are exploring ways to commercialize usage of 3.5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. Notably, the 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard, thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally.Entry of New Players in the U.S. Wireless SpaceThe U.S. wireless industry is likely to get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators) in this space. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has already entered this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. At present the company is using its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network coupled with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Similar to Comcast, the company also has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. It has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands, which will be utilized in deploying 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that DISH Network has plans of building a wireless network on its own.Strong FundamentalsAmerican Tower has strong fundamentals.

36,AMT,"Recently, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) together revealed that so far more than 80% of the state governors have decided to enter the FirstNet project, the first nationwide dedicated wireless network for first responders. States still reviewing their options have until Dec. 28 to opt in or out of the project.Notably, in March 2017, AT&T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network aims to cover all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. AT&T has projected that this contract will create more than 10,000 jobs over the next two years.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. Importantly, per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for both commercial purposes and consumer services. This is why several industry researchers believe that the FirstNet project may come as a boon to cell tower operators such as American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).In October 2017, AT&T and FirstNet introduced a new developer programme focused on public safety innovation. The programme will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by first responders who will select appropriate solutions to work on the FirstNet network that AT&T is set to build. Importantly, AT&T will connect FirstNet users to the company's telecommunications network assets, valued at more than $180 billion. This contract can be considered a necessary boost to the company’s profile.Price Performance of AT&TAT&T’s shares have gained 2.03% compared with the industry’s growth of 2.31% over the past 90 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

37,AMT,"In a move to enhance shareholders' wealth, Liberty Global plc’s (LBTYA  -  Free Report) board of directors approved a new share repurchase program.

We believe that such initiatives not only enhance shareholders’ return but also raise the market value of a stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts companies bolster investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip.Recent Stock RepurchasesOn Dec 19, the board of directors of Pfizer, Inc. announced a 6% hike in the pharma giant’s quarterly dividend for 2018 while also authorizing a new $10 billion share repurchase program.

38,AMT,"Investors in the REIT space are usually jittery when a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve and there is no exception this time too. However, instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting, we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018, a positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a “strong” job market.This can be far more rewarding because REITs business usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario. And why not? A fatter purse obviously gives tenants more power to demand real estate space and shell out for higher rents.More importantly, the technology wave is not only helping tech companies but is also driving demand for the related real estates. Take for example the e-commerce boom that has hugely affected retailers’ business model.No doubt, this has adversely impacted mall traffic in recent times, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, this technological evolution is changing the dynamics of the real estate market and substantially driving up demand for space at a number of asset categories.In fact, right from the time we use our smartphones, tablets or computers for a purchase, demand for REITs get a boost. This is because as we place our demand, the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers. Finally, the order is fulfilled through the industrial/logistics facilities and delivered at our doorstep.Now, REITs happen to own many of these cell towers, data centers and logistics facilities. So without the offering of this critical infrastructure, the e-commerce value chain simply cannot sustain.Along with making purchases online, an increasing number of people are consuming digital content. Going by numbers, per a forecast from Cisco, from 2016 to 2021, global Internet video traffic and mobile data traffic are estimated to witness a CAGR of 31% and 46%, respectively.The estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years. All these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower REITs including American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International (CCI  -  Free Report) and data-center REITs such as Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty (COR  -  Free Report) and others.Moreover, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options. This is propelling demand for distribution facilities near population centers, which not only help in lowering delivery time but also reduce cost of delivery.Further, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. As such, demand from the e-commerce sector has been escalating and per a report by Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report), in third-quarter 2017, this sector accounted for nearly 25% of total U.S. leasing demand compared with 14.7% in the previous year.This is offering significant impetus for growth to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) and others. So shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Therefore, instead of being bogged down by the current rate hike news, tap the many novelties in the REIT sector. Since individual market dynamics play a critical role in determining performance of REITs, favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

39,AMT,"On Dec 5, we issued an updated research report on American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report). Let’s have a look at the overall performance of the stock.Bullish DevelopmentsAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE, 5G networks and increased usage of smartphones and tablets are driving demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s investments in Asia are paying off. Further, the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers will drive the top line.American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of organic core revenue growth. Toward this end, American Tower is enhancing prospects in India with the acquisition of tower businesses from Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. Vodafone India is the subsidiary of U.K.-based Vodafone Group plc (VOD  -  Free Report).Notably, America Tower’s majority owned subsidiary in India — ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (ATC TIPL, formerly Viom) — plans to add 20,000 communications sites. Per the deal, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular will receive service level and process efficiency benefits. ATC TIPL will secure certain preferential rights of new businesses on existing portfolio and sites acquired in certain Indian markets. The transactions are expected to generate approximately $320 million in property revenues and $120 million in gross margin within a year for American Tower. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals from respective authorities.American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents per share of the company’s common stock look impressive. The distribution was paid on Oct 17 to stockholders of record at the close of business as of Sep 29.Raised GuidanceFor 2017, American Tower has raised outlook.  The company anticipates property revenues in the range of $6,510-$6,580 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 14.6%. Net income is expected between $1,340 million and $1,380 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 40.2%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $4,070-$4,110 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 15.1%. Consolidated AFFO is expected in the range of $2,870-$2,910 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 16.0%.Estimates Trending UpWe note that the sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimate for American Tower has moved up for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018.Sales growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 are estimated to increase 9.9% and 8.8%, respectively. For 2018, sales are expected to rise 7.9%.The EPS growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 is estimated to increase 257.7% and 172.8%, respectively. For full-year 2018, EPS is expected to soar 12.9%.Positive Earnings SurpriseAmerican Tower delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.59% in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, with an average of 3.94%.Despite such positives, the company faces headwinds.The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of the third-quarter 2017, the company had $799.47 million in cash and cash equivalents and around $18,581.4 million of outstanding long-term debt compared with $787.16 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of Dec 2016. Such high debt levels may impede cash flow generation, which is required to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may keep the company from accessing debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.High customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Expansion in global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds. Additionally, the company’s upcoming results face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Also, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).We believe that such headwinds have led to the company’s disappointing price performance. Over the past three months, the stock has lost 4.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.7%. ConclusionIn view of the above write-up, we advise investors to wait for a better entry point before accumulating shares.

40,AMT,"The U.S. telecom industry remained rather subdued last week. Nevertheless, a few developments are worth taking note of.T-Mobile US Inc.’s (TMUS  -  Free Report) rating was recently upgraded to Ba2 (in certain metrics) by credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service. Moreover, the company’s rating outlook has been confirmed stable.Moody's upgraded T-Mobile US' corporate family rating (CFR) to Ba2 from Ba3.The company’s probability of default rating was upgraded to Ba2-PD from Ba3-PD. Its senior secured rating was upgraded to Baa2 from Baa3 and its senior unsecured rating to Ba2 from Ba3.

(AVGO  -  Free Report). The offer was turned down on grounds of inadequacy, as Qualcomm is currently a leading player in the mobile chipset market. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Sprint Corp.

If the deal were to go through, it would have made Broadcom the world's third-largest semiconductor company, behind Intel and Samsung. However,we believe Broadcom might have to raise the value of the buyout offer to impress Qualcomm’s shareholders. We currently await updates on this front if Broadcom raises its offer or engages in a proxy battle with Qualcomm.  (Read more: Qualcomm Rejects Broadcom's $130B Takeover Offer)3.    Sprint’s offering of Hulu is expected to be officially launched on Nov, 17 and will be available to new and existing Sprint unlimited subscribers.

41,AMT,"U.S. telecom service providers Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) are collaborating over a cell tower deal. Although, they compete fiercely in the domestic wireless market, their partnership marks a new move in the lucrative wireless-tower industry.AT&T and Verizon have inked a joint deal with Tillman Infrastructure to build cell towers in the United States. Privately held, Tillman is the owner and operator of towers, small cells and smart cities infrastructures. Per the deal, Tillman will construct customized towers and lease it to Verizon and AT&T. Construction work of the towers will begin in the first quarter of 2018. Installation of equipment in the already completed sites will begin as soon as possible.Currently, both Verizon and AT&T carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.These new structures will add to the overall communications infrastructure in the country and will fulfill the availability of towers in newer locations. The build-outs will also help the wireless carriers relocate equipment from their current towers.The companies are focusing on technology innovation, with further investment in the updated software platforms to provide the best customer experience in their network.The MotiveThe partnership implies that the biggest U.S. wireless carriers are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure prices for towers. Moreover, carriers are always looking for alternative partners to reduce their dependence on specific customer base, thanks to the already saturated domestic wireless market.Domestic telcos are moving away from traditional tower leasing model, in order to cut down spending as data consumption continues to rise. Notably, these companies plan to create a diverse community of suppliers and tower operators, to maintain a healthy market competition.Additionally, AT&T and Verizon are striving to expand their network capacity in order to meet consumers’ demand for more cellular data. The companies are also reviewing their long-term contracts for renewal and trying to gain new vendor partners to diversify their infrastructure lineup.The ConsequencesThe U.S. cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies — American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report).Customer concentration is very high for these tower companies as they heavily depend on the top four wireless carriers — Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile US — for a major part of their quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation will have a negative impact on the companies’ top line. Moreover, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable-TV operators may generate significant financial fluctuations for the company.In such a scenario, the joint venture move is sure to pose severe competitive threat to established tower companies.Price Performance Despite such positives, the wireless carriers portray a disappointing price performance. In the past month, shares of AT&T and Verizon have lost 4.9% and 10.9%, respectively, compared with the industry’s decline of 8.4%. Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

45,AMT,"The U.S. telecom industry continues to witness intense pricing competition as success depends largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition.Nevertheless, one sub-segment of the telecom industry, wireless tower operators, has had a strong showing in the last one year. We believe there are several reasons for this dream run to continue in 2018. We will discuss the reasons in short.Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U.S. wireless carriers. In this context, Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Massive Spectrum Deployment by CarriersWireless networks will be key to the future growth of the overall telecom industry. As wireless networks run on radio frequency, spectrums (airwaves) have become the most sought-after commodity in the industry. T-Mobile US has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low-band airwaves. In 2018, AT&T will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low-band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project.Furthermore, AT&T will also install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network.Additionally, major U.S. telecom operators are currently exploring ways to commercialize usage of 3.5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. Notably, the 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard, thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally.The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) at its next open meeting on Nov 16 will discuss on the proposal of making available 1,700 MHz of high-frequency spectrum for flexible terrestrial wireless use and providing 4 GHz for core satellite use. Entry of New Players in the Wireless SpaceThe U.S. wireless industry is likely to become get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators) in this space. Comcast has already entered this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. At present the company is using its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network coupled with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Similar to Comcast, the company also has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Charter Communications has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network.These trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to the company by the FCC. The company is actively testing licensed small-cell technologies and has petitioned the FCC to release 3.5 GHz spectrum, popularly known as the CBRS band, for both licensed and unlicensed use.DISH Network, the second largest satellite TV operator, has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that DISH Network has a clear plan to build a wireless network on its own.Strong Business ModelWireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers. Tower operators generally have long-term (typically five - ten year) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is expected to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video.Recent trend of tower operators diversifying as fiber providers (focused on the small cell opportunity) looks impressive. Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G. Dark fiber based wireless backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will eventually lead the company to significantly reduce its backhaul costs.Our ChoiceWe believe all three wireless tower operators, American Tower, Crown Castle and SBA Communications will maintain their ongoing momentum in 2018. Currently all the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Tower Corp.

48,AMT,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is a real estate investment trust and a leading wireless tower operator. The firm through its subsidiaries owns, operates and develops wireless and broadcast communications real estate.Notably, American Tower has been aggressively buying towers in emerging markets. We believe the company’s acquisition spree should help drive its top line, going forward. Moreover, American Tower is certain that strength in its tower portfolio will help it double its AFFO per share by 2017. Further, higher adoption of smartphones/tablets, increased deployment of 3G/4G networks, significant margin improvement and dividend hikes also bode well.On the flip side, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may generate significant financial uncertainty for the company. Moreover, American Tower has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. High customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Expansion in the global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks.

49,AMT,"Leading international wireless tower operator, American Tower Corp (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Oct 31, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.35%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.91%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE, 5G networks and increased usage of smartphones and tablets are driving demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s increased investments in Asia are paying off. These benefits are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. Further, we believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers should drive top line and lend it a competitive edge over rivals. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth.We are also impressed with American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents per share of the company’s common stock. The distribution was paid on Oct 17 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Sep 29.However, American Tower has a substantially leveraged balance sheet with around $17,509.9 million of outstanding long-term debt in the last reported quarter. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation, which is rerquired to meet future debt obligations.High-customer concentration is likely to have an adverse impact on the company’s top line. Expansion in the global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds. Additionally, the company’s upcoming results face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Also, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).We believe that such headwinds have led to the company’s disappointing price performance. Over the past three months, the stock has declined 0.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.7%.  A Closer View on Certain Important MetricsAmerican Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will generate $295 million from Asia, $165 million from EMEA, $293 million from Latin America and $904 million from the United States. Meanwhile, total international revenues are estimated at $753 million.As of Sep 30, the company is projected to own 1,48,047 towers, with 39,843 towers in the domestic market and 1,07,911 towers internationally.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Tower has an Earnings ESP of -1.54%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.64, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.67. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Tower has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise  American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) Quote Key PickBoston Properties, Inc (BXP  -  Free Report) from the broader Finance sector has the right combination to deliver an earnings beat when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.

50,AMT,"Investors in American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 20th 2017 $100.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AmericanTower, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AmericanToweris a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the   REIT and Equity Trust - Othe rindustry that ranks in the Top 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.66 per share to $1.67 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about American TowerTherapeutics right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

51,AMT,"On Oct 10, U.S. national wireless carrier Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) was upgraded by a notch to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeSprint remains on track with network modernization and integration efforts, to fortify its position in the wireless industry. Sprint is also known for its unlimited offerings, which are a counteractive competitive measure against rival carriers.We believe these offerings have helped Sprint register an impressive number of customer additions during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In the reported quarter, Sprint witnessed net additions of 61,000 wireless customers, including prepaid net additions of 35,000, wholesale and affiliate net additions of 65,000. The company lost 39,000 net postpaid customers. Sprint's focus on delivering the most attractive value proposition in wireless resulted in 88,000 postpaid phone net additions in the quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of net additions. As of Jun 30, 2017, Sprint had 53,698 million wireless connections, up 0.63% year over year. Backed by such subscriber gain, Sprint has raised its outlook for full-year 2017.Meanwhile, Sprint’s wholly-owned prepaid subsidiary, Virgin Mobile USA, has extended the unlimited service offer to existing iPhone owners who are switching over to the carrier. Earlier, Virgin Mobile USA inked a deal with Apple to relaunch itself as an exclusive iPhone carrier.In August 2017, the company unveiled its Sprint MultiLine, an enterprise-grade solution within its Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) portfolio. Sprint MultiLine delivers a solution that allows businesses to add a company-owned number to their employees' personal phones for calling and texting on any mobile device and any underlying carrier. This will aid large enterprises as well as small and medium size businesses (SMB) to overcome challenges in the ever-growing BYOD environment.We also look forward to Sprint’s alliance with telecom service provider, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) to launch massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) radios. In September, Sprint carried out field tests of 2.5 GHz Massive MIMO using Sprint’s spectrum and Ericsson’s 64T64R (64 transmit, 64 receive) radios, in Seattle, WA and Plano, TX. The trial demonstrated capacity surge of about four times compared with an 8T8R antenna. Notably, both the companies are planning to launch Massive MIMO radios across the United States by 2018. These devices are expected to raise the network capacity of Sprint by up to 10 times and will also influence Gigabit LTE services, thus aiding the company’s 5G networks.The company further tried to save costs by relocating its mobile towers from the expensive space leased from Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) to the lesser expensive plots on government-owned properties.Hiked GuidanceFor full-year 2017, Sprint has raised its outlook. The company expects fiscal 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $10.8-$11.2 billion compared with the previous expectation of $10.7-$11.2 billion. Sprint anticipates operating income of $2.1-$2.5 billion versus the previous expectation of $2-$2.5 billion. Capital expenditures will be approximately $3.5-$4 billion, which is similar to the previous expectation.Positive Earnings SurpriseSprint delivered a positive earnings surprise of 600% in the last reported first quarter of 2017 result (ended Jun 30). Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 129.47%.Estimates Trending UpWe note that the Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimate for Sprint has climbed for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.The EPS growth for the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017 is estimated to accelerate 43.8% and 57.8%, respectively. For fiscal 2017, EPS is expected to soar 89.1%.The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism over prospects of this stock.Favorable  Style ScoreGrowth investors look for stocks with aggressive earnings or revenue growth potential, which propel share price. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1  or 2 offer the best opportunities in the growth investing space.Notably, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Price PerformanceHowever, the price performance has been impressive. Over the past year, shares of Sprint have soared 5.2% as against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.  When compared with the market at large, the stock’s performance looks dismal, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 18.4%, over the same time span.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

52,AMT,"On Oct 2, we issued an updated research report on Boston, MA-based, leading international wireless tower operator,American Tower Corp (AMT  -  Free Report). Let’s have a look at the overall performance of the stock.Price PerformanceOver the last three months, the price performance of American Tower has been impressive. The stock has inched up 3.3%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.5% over the same time span. When compared to the market at large, the stock’s performance looks depressing, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 3.6%, over the said time frame.Considering the stable performance of the stock, we expect American Tower to scale higher in the coming quarters.A Broker FavoriteWe note that earnings estimates for American Tower have exhibited a healthy uptrend.Over the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 has moved up 0.6% to $1.67 per share and 0.6% to $1.70, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has increased by 10 cents to $6.71.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Estimates Trending UpWe note that the sales and Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimate for American Tower has moved up for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.The sales growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to accelerate 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively. For 2017, sales is expected to surge 15.1%.The EPS growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to accelerate 202.9% and 262%, respectively. For fiscal 2017, EPS is expected to soar 238.9%.The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism over prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE and 5G networks along with increased usage of smartphones and tablets are boosting demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s increased investments in Asia are paying off.We believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets have driven its top line and lent a competitive edge. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth. Notably, within the Property segment, revenues from the United States totaled $897 million (in second-quarter 2017), up 8.07% year over year. Meanwhile, total international revenues amounted $741 million, up 24.12% year over year. Within this, revenues from Asia totaled $295 million, increasing a whopping 31.11% year over year. EMEA revenues grossed $160 million, up 18.52% year over year. Latin America revenues totaled $287 million, up 21.09% year over year. The company’s total revenue from international business is likely to outperform revenues from the United States in the next three to seven years.American Tower continues to generate most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Further, the company provides on-site maintenance as well as servicing of antennas, amplifiers and base station equipment. The $100-million tower lease agreement with telecom behemoth AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) has helped American Tower to raise 2017 revenue guidance.We are also impressed with American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents on shares of its common stock. The distribution will be paid on Oct 17, 2017 to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Sep 29, 2017.All these above factors have also played a pivotal role in driving the company’s outlook.Hiked GuidanceFor 2017, American Tower anticipates property revenue to be $6,480-$6,580 million. Net income is expected to be $1,355-$1,405 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $4,045-$4,105 million. Consolidated AFFO is expected in the range of $2,835-$2,885 million.DownturnsCustomer concentration is very high for American Tower. The company’s major customers include AT&T, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. They account for nearly 65% of American Tower’s quarterly revenues. The loss of any one of these customers or consolidations will have a significant material impact on the company’s top line. Rapid expansion in the international markets, especially in the emerging Asian and Latin American markets increases revenues. Geographic diversification may jeopardize the bottom line as tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market. Also, it increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks.Stiff competition, integration risks, rising operating expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet act as major dampener to American Tower. In addition, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may lead to serious financial fluctuation for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s upcoming results also face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Moreover, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

56,AMT,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is a real estate investment trust and a leading wireless tower operator. The firm through its subsidiaries owns, operates and develops wireless and broadcast communications real estate.Notably, American Tower has been aggressively buying towers in emerging markets. We believe the company’s acquisition spree should help drive its top line, going forward. Moreover, American Tower is certain that strength in its tower portfolio will help it double its AFFO per share by 2017. Further, higher adoption of smartphones/tablets, increased deployment of 3G/4G networks, significant margin improvement and dividend hikes also bode well.On the flip side, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may generate significant financial uncertainty for the company. Moreover, American Tower has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. High customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Expansion in the global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds.Zacks Rank: American Tower currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

57,AMT,"Leading international wireless tower operator, American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Jul 27, before market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.64%. Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.78%.The price performance of American Tower has also been impressive over the last six months. The stock returned 31.7%, outshining the industry’s gain of 3.4% over the same time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCustomer concentration is very high for American Tower. The company’s major customers include AT&T, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. They account for nearly 65% of American Tower’s quarterly revenues. The loss of any one of these customers or consolidations will have a significant material impact on the company’s top line. American Tower is rapidly expanding in the international markets. Although this geographic diversification will boost revenues, it may jeopardize the bottom line as tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market. Also, it increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks.Moreover, stiff competition, integration risks, rising operating expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet act as major dampeners to American Tower. In addition, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may lead to serious financial fluctuation for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s upcoming results also face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Moreover, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, American Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 4G LTE and 5G networks. We further believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers have driven its top line and lend it a competitive edge over rivals. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core-revenue growth.Earnings Whispers                                             Our proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.
