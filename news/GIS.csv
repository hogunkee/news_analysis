0,GIS,"Stocks staged a solid open Wednesday, as the Trump Administration eased some China-trade threats, and strong gains across Europe halted a sell-off begun earlier in China. The morning's backdrop showed China's bear market worsening, and oil prices rising as markets assessed whether U.S. sanctions threatened against buyers of Iranian oil had opened a new chapter in the global trade war.China trade-sensitive names Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) vied with oil names Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to lead the Dow. ""Smackdown"" owner World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) scored one of the market's strongest early wins. Conagra (CAG) fell hardest among S&P 500 stocks, after announcing its acquisition of Pinnacle Foods (PF).The Nasdaq Composite popped 0.4% at the start of trade. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each gained 0.3%.Markets in the U.S. and Europe strengthened after the Trump Administration backed away from threats to use executive authority to impose sweeping restrictions on China-based companies investing in U.S. technologies and businesses. Instead, news reports quoted senior administration officials saying the administration would rely on Congress to update existing laws, rather than assessing arbitrary restrictions based on national security threats.The official said the White House would work with Congress to update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. rules, in a way that ""maintains the open investment climate"" in the U.S. That was a sharp change in tone from Monday's announcement that the administration would seek to halt further technology exports to China and block targeted Chinese investments in U.S. technology firms.On the Dow, Caterpillar and Boeing rose in tandem, up 1.7% apiece.  Caterpillar has fallen in nine of the past 10 sessions, Boeing has dropped in eight of the past 11 days. Both stocks have broken below key levels of technical support, causing significant damage to their base-building efforts.Exxon and Chevron (CVX) were also among the Dow's early leaders, up 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively, as oil prices jumped to six-week highs. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday threatened sanctions against countries and companies who failed to end purchases of Iranian oil by November. Oil also was squeezed higher by industry data showing a 9.2 million barrel draw on inventories in the week ended June 22. Economists had projected a 2.6 million barrel decrease. Official weekly supply numbers are due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude vaulted 1.5% higher, to near $72 a barrel, in early trade.Conagra opened 6.8% lower — and Pinnacle Foods fell 4.1% — after Conagra said it would acquire the Parsippany, N.J.-based competitor in a cash/stock deal valued at $10.9 billion. Conagra owns the Chef Boyardee, Marie Callendar's and Healthy Choice Brands. Pinnacle's brands include Bird's Eye, Duncan Hines and Mrs. Paul's.The loss sent Pinnacle back below a 66.76 buy point in a 12-month saucer base. Conagra's tumble sent shares below their 10- and 40-week moving averages, snuffing a long-term basing effort.Also in the packaged food space, General Mills (GIS) notched an early 0.7% advance. The Minneapolis-based owner of Cheerios, Wheaties and Betty Crocker reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Revenue met analyst targets, and company management issued upside full-year earnings guidance.World Wrestling Entertainment jack-hammered an 6.7% gain in opening trade. The Stamford, Conn.-based company announced a five-year deal placing its ""Monday Night Raw"" program on Comcast's (CMCSA) USA channel, and its ""Smackdown"" series on Fox Networks on Friday nights. The company said the deal would more than triple the annual value of its U.S. distribution rights. WWE shares are up 132% since the start of the year,In other earnings news, AeroVironment shook of its premarket loss and traded with narrow gains. Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, reported late Tuesday, declined much less than expected and a 1% revenue gain that eked past the consensus target. The maker of remote-controlled drones remained in a buy range, after breaking out on Tuesday past a 61.25 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume.Drive-in burger joint Sonic (SONC) tanked 9.6%. The Oklahoma City, Okla.-based chain reported, after Tuesday's close, fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings narrowly above analyst consensus targets. Same-store-sales and drive-in margins declined, and management trimmed is full-year earnings guidance. The dive narrowed Sonic's gain from a June 7 breakout to 8%.China's markets rebooted Monday's sell-off as the yuan slid below the 6.6-per-dollar level, a key technical level. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.1%, digging deeper into bear market territory. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index swooned 1.8%, putting it more than 15% below its February high.Japan managed to buffer the selling somewhat. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 held to a 0.3% decline, despite the yen's safe-haven advance vs. the dollar.Stocks in Europe shook off early losses and rallied in afternoon trade. London's FTSE 100 jumped 1.1%, Frankfurt's DAX leapt 1.3% and the CAC-40 in Paris surged 1.4% higher.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Stocks Bounce Modestly But Hold At Key Levels; 3 Rules For A Weaker MarketStock Futures Fall; 4 Trade-War Resistant Watchlist StocksThis Dividend Stock And Gas Pipeline Play Faces Big Q2 ExpectationsIBD Stock Of The Day Forms New Base After 62% RunTime To Buy This China Growth Stock Again?

1,GIS,"Kraft Heinz  (KHC) reportedly is interested in buying Campbell Soup (CPB), which is mulling strategic options as packaged-food giants struggle. Rivals such as General Mills (GIS) also could want to take a bite of the soup and snack giant.Campbell Soup stock jumped 9.4% to close at 42.23, and Kraft Heinz stock edged up 0.2% to 63.32 in the stock market today. General Mills stock added 1.8%. All three packaged-food stocks are still trading near multiyear lows.A Kraft-Campbell deal could boost Warren Buffett's exposure to the ailing packaged-food industry. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is a major shareholder of Kraft Heinz, which believes the soup and snack maker will likely put itself up for sale soon, sources told the New York Post.Campbell Soup said in May it was reviewing all aspects of its strategic plans and expects to discuss the outcome in August. CEO Denise Morrison abruptly resigned last month as Campbell Soup cut earnings guidance.

But its $6.1 billion buyout of Snyder's-Lance came just as the packaged-food industry slumped.The company's bleak full-year forecast pummeled the stock in May, ultimately taking a toll on the reign of its seven-year chief executive.The B-class shares of Berkshire Hathaway dropped 1.15% to undercut the May low of 188.62.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (KO), another consumer products giant in which Berkshire holds a notable stake, rose 0.8%.Kraft Heinz arose through a 2015 merger of food giants Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz.Buffett owned 500 million shares of Heinz before the merger, while his investment partner, 3G Capital, owned a similar stake in Heinz. Buffett now owns 325.6 million shares of Kraft Heinz, valued at $20.3 billion as of March.Initially, Kraft Heinz stock rallied as the new owners boosted profits despite flat-to-falling sales by cutting costs. But like a ketchup bottle running low, cost-squeezing efforts seem to have run their course. Meanwhile, traditional branded food companies are facing multiple headwinds. They're struggling to appeal to changing consumer tastes toward organic and natural foods. Meanwhile, grocery sellers are stepping up house brands, with more attractive packaging and quality. Food companies also have cut marketing spending to boost short-term profit, but at the risk of losing long-term brand exposure.Kraft Heinz may see a Campbell Soup deal as a way to wring out more costs. Kraft in 2017 made a bid for Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever (UN), which rebuffed the offer.Buffett reportedly remains optimistic about companies that sell consumer packaged goods. Both Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola are top-five stock holdings in his widely followed investment portfolio.

2,GIS,"Deere & Co. (DE) could be among the big losers in a China trade war as Beijing targets U.S. agricultural commodities, but the prospect of lower prices also boosted Hormel (HRL) and other food companies that could see lower costs.XChina said on Wednesday that it would slap tariffs on $50 billion worth of American imports, including soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton and other agricultural commodities. China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the U.S. last year.A range of agricultural commodity prices, including soybeans and corn, fell on fear that lower sales to China would create slack.If the American farmers who buy Deere equipment are hurt by China tariffs, they'll be slower to replace or upgrade old Deere equipment.On the flip side, weaker demand from China would hold crop prices lower. Hopes for cheaper corn, wheat and other commodity prices lifted packaged food companies, while the prospect of cheaper soybeans, which are mostly used for animal feed, not human consumption, gave IBD's Food-Meat Products industry group a big boost.Hormel stock finished 4.8% higher on the stock market today, Kellogg (K) rose 2.5%, General Mills (GIS) 2.4%, Conagra Brands (CAG) 2.3% and Flowers Foods (FLO) 1.7%. The packaged food sector got slammed two weeks ago when General Mills cut its earnings outlook, citing higher input prices.Meanwhile, shares of Deere, which makes tractors, combines, harvesters and other agricultural equipment, closed down 3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

4,GIS,"Stock futures flattened, then fell in early premarket trade Wednesday, as markets continued to seek a foothold after Monday's global sell-off.The IBD 50 list and other leading stocks continued to show resilience in premarket action. Stocks including Five Below (FIVE) and Kemet (KEM) were set to open on Wednesday either in buy range or below buy points. Sonic (SONC) and AeroVironment (AVAV) dived late Tuesday after reporting quarterly results after the close. Oil prices closed at five-week highs, and are likely to be active during Wednesday's session.Nasdaq futures slipped 0.5% ahead of Wednesday's open. Dow industrials traded 0.4% below fair value and S&P 500 futures were down 0.3%.Oil prices could factor into Wednesday's market session, after comments from the U.S. State Department, and supply disruptions in Libya and Canada sent U.S. benchmark oil up more than 3% on Tuesday.

In addition, a U.S. State Department official told reporters that global oil buyers must cut imports from Iran to zero by November. Buyers who fail to respect the rule will face harsh U.S. sanctions. Iran exports more than 2 billion barrels per day to countries including China, India and Turkey, according to Bloomberg.Oil also received a late boost after the American Petroleum Institute released data showing U.S. oil inventories decreased by more than 9.2 million barrels during the week ended June 22.

Official weekly crude storage data are due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.Despite the choppy market, plenty of IBD 50 names ended trade on Tuesday well-positioned for acquisitive investors. Among those, kid-friendly dollar store Five Below ended Tuesday's session less than 3% below a 104.09 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.The IBD Leaderboard name scored a 22% breakaway gap on June 7, after crushing first-quarter expectations. Shares consolidated just below their June 13 high, completing a three-weeks-tight pattern on Friday. The June 7 breakout was from a third-stage base. That puts Five Below in late-stage territory, which adds some risk of failure to any further breakout attempts.While the Dow Jones industrial average has lost ground steadily since June 12, Kemet completed the right side of a base and added a handle for good measure. The handle presents a buy point at 25.79, and the stock traded less than 2% below that entry at Tuesday's close. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based maker of capacitors used in auto, telecom and aerospace applications has a best-possible EPS Rating of 99 from IBD. And its relative strength line is nearing new highs, a sign of strength before a breakout.Two other watchlist-worthy IBD 50 names are HealthEquity (HQY) and Mastercard (MA).  Both stocks are in industries largely unaffected by concerns over the U.S.-China trade brawl. Both remained extended after breakouts.HealthEquity was 5% above its 50-day moving average. Mastercard was 3% above its line. A touch back and rebound from that level of support would create a buying opportunity in both cases.AeroVironment ground out a 6% loss after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings declined much less than expected and a 1% revenue gain eked past the consensus target.

But you wouldn't know that from the share prices of publicly traded companies in the sector.""Consumer staples in general are extremely out of favor,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. ""Consumer staples have significantly underperformed the broader market.""IBD's confectionery industry group ranks near the bottom of 197 industry groups. It includes just four stocks: Mondelez International (MDLZ), Hershey (HSY), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF).Many makers of sweets and snacks are in IBD's packaged-food industry group, which ranks No. 161. It includes 29 stocks, among them Nestle (NSRGY), PepsiCo (PEP), General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), ConAgra Brands (CAG) and Hostess Brands (TWNK).Investors started rotating out of food stocks in mid-2016 in anticipation of rising interest rates, Weissman said.Amazon's (AMZN) acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced in June 2017, added to the worries, she said.The Amazon-Whole Foods merger, completed in August 2017, led to large grocery sellers like Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) gaining more negotiating power with manufacturers, she said. That's made it harder for food makers to pass on cost increases, such as rising grain and cocoa prices.Another factor hitting major candy and snack makers has been the rise of store brands. They include Kirkland Signature at Costco Wholesale (COST), Member's Mark at Walmart-owned Sam's Club and Wickedly Prime at Amazon.To combat these private-label products, the major candy and snack companies are focusing on product innovation to attract consumers. They're using new ingredients, different combinations, bold flavors and novel textures to entice customers.Many of these new products were on display at the annual Sweets and Snacks Expo, which ran Tuesday through Thursday in Chicago. The show had about 900 exhibiting companies and was expected to attract about 18,000 attendees.This year's Sweets and Snacks Expo is the biggest yet in terms of number of exhibitors and attendees, said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the show.Product trends among candy makers at this year's show include greater use of coconut and caramel in products, Gindlesperger said.Cocoa and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut is promoting its new ruby chocolate at the trade show. Introduced last September, it is the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white. Made from the ruby cocoa bean, the pink chocolate has a ""berry-fruitness and luscious smoothness,"" the Swiss firm said in a press release.Candy sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2018, up from $24.9 billion in 2017, marketing and consulting firm IRI said at the show.Snack sales are seen hitting $42.5 billion in 2018, up from $41.1 billion in 2017.""Consumers are still snacking,"" said Sally Lyons-Wyatt, executive vice president at IRI. ""On average consumers are snacking over 2.5 times a day. Younger consumers actually snack more than that.""Top growing categories in snacks include protein, fiber and energy snacks, she said. Consumers are also shifting more to crisps not made from potato or corn, she said. Consumers enjoy variety and are trying chips made from chickpeas, lentils, quinoa and other ingredients.Food companies are targeting millennials by offering products in smaller portion sizes suitable for snacking.""It seems like almost anything can be a snack right now,"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""You change the portion size and suddenly it's a snack. Everybody is focused on snacks. Yogurt went from breakfast to a snack.

Larger retailers like Kroger, Target (TGT) and Walmart are looking to put more organic products on their shelves, he said.The interest means that Big Food heavyweights — such as General Mills (GIS), Nestle and PepsiCo (PEP) — have been snapping up natural and organic food startups, a trend that NPD's food and beverage industry analyst, Darren Seifer, does not see stopping.Acquisitions give legacy packaged-food companies entry to the natural and organics market with a brand that has ""believability,"" said Seifer.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportJustin's Nut Butter, for its part, was acquired by Hormel (HRL) in 2016. That brought the almond- and cashew-butter company under the same umbrella as Spam, Hormel Chili and peanut butter stalwart Skippy.The added resources of a food titan like Hormel gave Justin's the fuel to ensure that all of its products' secondary ingredients could also be organic, something that Justin's could ""probably not"" have accomplished by itself, said Gold.But that doesn't mean every new food company out there is looking to ultimately be acquired.The idea of being acquired ""would worry me, at this stage,"" said Snow Monkey co-founder Rachel Geicke. Snow Monkey, a plant-based, nut-free, vegan ""superfood ice treat,"" lists banana puree as its first ingredient. It is sold in about 300 stores across a dozen states and comes in flavors such as passion fruit, goji berry and cacao.""We've technically only been on the market for about 14 months, so it's still very new, and I think what's really important for a young company is ensuring we're shaping culture and as we grow we never forget why we started,"" she said.Better-for-you ice creams were popular at this year's Expo West. Not surprising, given that indie brand and Expo alum Halo Top managed to outsell freezer staples Ben & Jerry's (owned by Unilever (UN)) and Haagen-Dazs (owned by Nestle) in the supermarket pint category last year.""Companies like Halo Top are sort of what the industry needed,"" Snow Monkey co-founder Mariana Ferreira told Investor's Business Daily at the expo. ""It needed a little bit of a shake, to show the big guys you can't be comfortable. You can't put out the same thing all the time.""Smaller brands are the ones bringing the innovation, she added, something that ""isn't fast enough with these big companies.""Nevertheless, they aren't ruling out the possibility of M&A down the road. An acquisition could provide strategic advantages, and ""there could be some really great big partner for us to do that with,"" said Geicke.Either way, the current eating trends are good for business.""What's really promising for us to see is that health has never been so mainstream, and it continues to be,"" said Geicke. ""When you walk into Costco and you're seeing products that you would usually only find at Whole Foods, that's amazing to see the industry shift.""

12,GIS,"Snack and beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP) reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday that topped analyst forecasts. So did sales growth.X Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.39, a 3% increase, as revenue advanced a percentage point higher to $15.59 billion, according to analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research.Results: Pepsi earned $1.50 a share, including 6 cents from a one-time Britvic sale. That's an 11% gain. Revenue climbed 2% to $15.71 billion. Organic revenue, which includes currency swings and structural changes, advanced 3.1%. Organic volume rose 2% for snacks and other food but fell 2% for beverages.Outlook: Pepsi sees 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.13 a share. Analysts expect $5.12, according to Zacks.Pepsi sees foreign exchange cutting full-year core profit by 2 percentage points vs. its prior estimate of 3 percentage points. The dollar weakened at the end of Q2. The weakening dollar likely will be a notable factor in multinationals' results and guidance during the current earnings season.Shares fell 0.5% to 113.69 in the stock market today. The stock on Monday pierced through support at its 50-day line in heavy volume.PepsiCo, whose brands include its namesake soft drink as well as Mountain Dew, Tropicana, Doritos and Quaker, has tried to offer more ""guilt free"" products to an increasingly wellness-focused population with a deepening distaste for soda.More than 45% of the company's net revenue comes from those products, the company said during its first-quarter earnings call in April. Meanwhile, U.S. soda sales more broadly have fallen for 12 straight years, according to Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication.PepsiCo has introduced healthier, non-carbonated drinks, tested natural sweeteners in sodas, tried out new frying methods to cut fat in potato chips, and offered up healthier, grain-based snacks, Zacks notes. Emerging markets abroad, where consumption is still low, and a growing middle class in some nations could also drive growth and help demand, Zacks said.But turmoil and currency swings internationally risk cutting into sales figures. Pepsi has tightened up its pricing, which can help protect revenue and make up for weaker volumes. But that tactic's durability could become a bigger issue over time.Volumes in the company's large Frito-Lay North America division fell 1.5% in the first quarter. That marked the first decline in some five years, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said in a report, according to Bloomberg. Management said in April that the dip was temporary and partly a product of shifts in holidays, and that volume had begun to rebound.But Amazon (AMZN) looms over consumer products too. The Amazon-Whole Foods Market (WFM) deal raises the prospect of more private-label goods vs. branded packaged consumer products from the likes of General Mills (GIS), Mondelez (MDLZ) and Pepsi's Frito-Lay. Packaged goods firms are cutting market spending, Marketwatch reported, citing James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt to support profits. Cakmak wrote in a Monday note that the cuts are in part reflect less of an emphasis of fighting for shelf space in the age of Amazon and other e-commerce options such as Jet.com and Walmart.com from Wal-Mart (WMT). But cutting ads and marketing may only spur the push to commoditize packaged goods, reducing margins further.Coca-Cola (KO) dipped 0.1%. Coca-Cola fell below its 50-day line last week.Monster Beverage (MNST) slid 0.1%. Monster Beverage recently found 50-day support after a failed late June breakout. Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) rose 0.2%.National Beverage (FIZZ) edged down 0.2%.

13,GIS,"Leo Durocher gets credit for saying ""nice guys finish last,"" so he could easily have twisted it into ""fiery fellows finish first."" Because that's exactly what happened in 1954, when his New York Giants pulled off one of baseball's greatest upsets.And in 1951, when he managed the Giants to a comeback for the ages.And in 1941, when he pushed the Brooklyn Dodgers to their first National League pennant in 21 years.""If he had more discipline and less anger, he would probably be the greatest manager of all time,"" Paul Dickson, author of the new book ""Leo Durocher: Baseball's Prodigal Son,"" told IBD. ""Lindsey Nelson, who for a time teamed with Durocher in the broadcast booth, said, 'If I needed one manager to win a game, I would choose Leo. He might steal it, or whatever, but somehow he would figure out how to win it.' ""Harvey Wineberg, who was Durocher's accountant and business manager for three decades, lauds the Hall of Famer despite the fact that ""in the end I was probably his only friend.""""He had a charisma about him,"" Wineberg said from his home in the Chicago area. ""He had a lot of guts. He defied a lot of people, and that made him a great leader. And he knew baseball really well. He had that charm about him.""Love him or hate him, but he was good at what he did. He knew how to get the most out of people. People followed him.""Jeff Marlett, who wrote about Durocher for the Society for American Baseball Research, calls him ""a celebrity manager,"" jazzing up TV shows hosted by such stars as Judy Garland and Dick Cavett. ""Not bad for a French-Canadian guy from the wrong side of the tracks in West Springfield, Mass.""Durocher (1905-91) won at once. A rookie shortstop with the Murderers' Row Yankees of 1928, he teamed with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig to capture the World Series.By 1934, Durocher was winning it all again, this time with the Gashouse Gang Cardinals of St. Louis.Durocher took his shortstop prowess to Brooklyn in 1938, and by this time his nonstop banter had earned him the ""Leo the Lip"" tag. The next year he became player/manager. He didn't mess around as skipper, even cracking down on drinking. Caught with one glass? A fine of $50 (worth $900 now).Durocher energized Brooklyn in 1941. With his Dodgers going 100-54 to stand atop the National League, fans flocked to Ebbets Field at a clip of 1.2 million, by far the best in the majors. Yet in the World Series, the crosstown Yankees beat Leo's bunch in five games.As America entered World War II, Durocher tried to join the military, but a bad eardrum kept him out. So he teamed with Hollywood pal Danny Kaye on USO tours of bases in the U.S. and Italy and regaled GIs with umpire stories.Durocher also fascinated fans with lines such as: ""If I was playing third base and my mother was rounding third with the run that was going to beat us, I'd trip her.""Oh, I'd pick her up and brush her off and say, 'Sorry, Mom,' but nobody beats me.""The war ended in 1945, as did Durocher's playing role. Now he was strictly a manager and involved in bringing up Jackie Robinson from the minors. The future Hall of Fame second baseman was about to cross the big leagues' color line in 1947 for the Dodgers, and Leo was all in: ""If he's good enough to play Major League Baseball, that's all I care about.""""He had no problem starting black players,"" said Marlett. ""He was from poor straits. He wasn't about to keep players from playing because of race.""Just as Durocher was about to manage those 1947 Dodgers — with a highflying contract worth $700,000 in today's money — Commissioner Happy Chandler benched him for the season due to consorting with gambling types.Durocher was back with Brooklyn in 1948, even managing the National League All-Stars. A few days later came an electric switch. Leo shed Dodger blue for Giant black.More Giant upsets were coming. In 1951, Durocher's club charged from 13-1/2 games behind in August to overcome his old Dodgers. The climax came on the last swing of the season, Bobby Thomson's homer that sparked Russ Hodges' radio call for the ages: ""The Giants win the pennant!""Dickson was 12 and playing pool in his family's Yonkers, N.Y., basement when Thomson roped his Shot Heard Round the World.And as the Giant hopped around the bases, Leo, doubling as third base coach, got caught up in the celebration. ""Like Hamlet, it was the greatest play,"" said Dickson.That Giant rush ranks sixth among all second-half season comebacks, according to the Baseball Gauge, which says the team had a 0.86% chance of pulling it off.""His greatest managerial accomplishment was after he was dealt to the Giants from the Dodgers,"" said Dickson. ""He realized he had managed too much on belittling his players. With great players, there was no need to badger players so they would perform to get back at you. When he got to the Giants, he had players such as Hank Thompson and Monte Irvin, who were with the Army at the Battle of the Bulge. Leo realized these guys were not kids. They'd seen combat, bloodshed. They were true men and were not going to be belittled by some guy.""Added the author: ""Leo built loyalty and support, and that comes to full fruition when he gets Willie Mays. Durocher takes him from the minors, throws him right into the lineup and tells him, 'You're going to be the greatest player.' ""Durocher backed Mays despite the Say Hey Kid's 1-for-26 opening of '51. Leo's confidence helped produce the National League's Rookie of the Year and a pennant.""Willie adored him till the end of Leo's life,"" said Wineberg. ""In 1951 Leo told him, 'That tough start doesn't matter; I'm with you all the way.' Willie never forgot it. Leo was a great judge of talent.""Said Dickson: ""Every brain cell was working for Durocher at that point. He was a chess master, moving players around to perform best. And when taking a guy out of the lineup, he knew how to explain it so he didn't feel penalized.""He platooned. He started an all-black outfield – Mays, Irvin, Hank Thompson – in the 1951 World Series, which the Yankees won in six games. ""Durocher was not afraid to put three black players on the field while other teams didn't have any blacks,"" said Dickson. ""He was truly colorblind. Even in the 1930s he was trying to sign black players. He would say, 'I don't care if you're black or purple; if you can help me win, you're on my team.' Of course, it helped that when he was with the Giants they were near Harlem, so he was playing to a mixed audience.""Durocher grabbed his greatest prize – the 1954 world title – in another drama. This time his Giants won the NL flag with 97 wins and by five games over the Dodgers. Waiting in the World Series were the Cleveland Indians and their 111 victories, an American League record at that point. Sports bettors were so sure New York was done, they posted massive odds against Leo's nine.And yet — between Mays' amazing catch in Game 1 and Rhodes' leap off the bench to pace the Giants' slugging, they toppled the Tribe in four straight.""To sweep the Indians, that was totally Leo managing with Willie playing,"" said Marlett. ""It was arguably the greatest managing feat. To dominate the greatest team in both leagues was stunning.""It reverberates to this day, with Fox Sports rating it as one of the 10 greatest World Series upsets and TotalProSports.com ranking it No. 3 among all baseball postseason stunners.""In 1954, Durocher had the team so sharp,"" said Dickson, ""he used it like a surgical instrument.""Durocher was done managing in New York after the 1955 season. He rejoined the Dodgers as a coach after their move to Los Angeles. Then came a rocky run as skipper of the Chicago Cubs, generating winning records but blowing a huge lead in 1969.Meanwhile, he grasped business. When Jockey Shorts offered $10,000 for a print ad, Durocher said to Wineberg, ""Tell 'em I want 15 and they'll leave me alone."" Eventually Jockey bid $25,000 (worth $150,000 now). Leo took it, with the ad bellowing, ""I wear 'em and I'm as much of a man as you are!""Durocher's final baseball year was 1973, calling the shots for the Houston Astros.When he died in 1991, he had lived 86 years that included four wives, a daughter and stepson, four MLB teams as a player and four as a manager.Finally, Durocher reached the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994.""He was an excellent tactician,"" Chub Feeney, an executive with Durocher's Giants, said in Gerald Eskenazi's book ""The Lip."" ""He ran a ballgame as well as anybody you've ever seen. … When he had the horses, he knew how to make them run.""In the National Baseball Hall of Fame for managing teams to 2,008 victories, three pennants and a world championship.Overcame: A daunting deficit in the 1951 pennant stretch.Lesson: Listen to your players and get all you can out of them.""When you're playing for money, winning is the only thing that matters.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Casey Stengel Managed To Win Eight World Series Titles In 12 YearsBranch Rickey Revolutionized Baseball In More Ways Than OneEwing Kauffman Applied His Winning Formula To Sales, Education, BaseballVin Scully Prepared To Become Baseball's Master Storyteller

14,GIS,"President Trump has reportedly decided to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. There was still no official word from the White House as of Wednesday afternoon, but such a move would be a big symbolic stiff-arm to global trading partners that may have negative implications for U.S. businesses.The potential intermediate-term consequences of an outright withdrawal from the Paris agreement are far from clear, although diplomats from a number of countries have raised the possibility of imposing a carbon tax on imports from the U.S. Still, any such economic measures seem unlikely in the near term, because few countries will want to rush a trade war and U.S. trading partners may want to coordinate their response, if any.Initial reports that Trump would scrap the agreement didn't dent the positive mood on Wall Street initially on the stock market today. But stocks lost ground as Bank of America (BAC) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said that low stock-market volatility would cut into second-quarter results and economic data pointed to slowing Chicago-area manufacturing activity. (Weaker oil prices also didn't help.)Trump previously made up his mind to notify Mexico and Canada of his intent to withdraw from Nafta, before reversing course. While another such reversal might be possible, Trump was set to meet with Paris pact supporter Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a pullout from Nafta would have had destabilizing consequences for businesses and their supply chains. By comparison, the decision to exit the Paris deal may be no more than a public relations black eye.Still, many U.S. businesses, not least those in the alternative energy business like Tesla (TSLA), were hoping that Trump would backpedal from his campaign pledge to rip up the deal signed by President Obama.Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned Wednesday on Twitter that if Trump does withdraw from the Paris accord, he will leave two presidential business advisory councils.Even Exxon Mobil (XOM), Tillerson's former employer, had encouraged Trump to remain a party to the agreement, calling it an ""effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change."" Increased use of natural gas helped the U.S. slash carbon emissions and ""this success can be replicated globally,"" Exxon said.Exxon shareholders voted Wednesday to require disclosures of possible climate change risks for the company.Trump tweeted early on Wednesday that his decision would come over the next few days, adding in all-capital letters: ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""Obama committed the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 26% from 2005 levels by 2025, and contribute $3 billion to the United Nations-based Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries adopt green technologies. Only $1 billion has so far been delivered.If the U.S. backtracks on that contribution commitment, analysts have said that might curb sales opportunities for U.S. green technology companies in emerging markets. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) CEO Ben van Beurden has suggested that U.S. companies could pay a price if Trump's action spurs an international public-relations backlash. ""The U.S. has a major crop of companies that deliver technologies that are going to be relevant in the energy transition, and one way or another they will also find themselves probably more disadvantaged than advantaged by the U.S. pulling out,"" Van Beurden told the Financial Times.Shell's Van Beurden also said that a withdrawal by the U.S. could make it a less attractive place for foreign direct investment, though he said that most long-term investments may come to fruition when Trump is no longer in the White House.Yet the nonbinding nature of the agreement and individual country commitments means that there's no negative direct economic consequence in staying involved. Measuring U.S. progress toward its goal will take years and the agreement doesn't have an enforcement mechanism for countries that backslide. There's also nothing prohibiting members from scaling back their greenhouse gas commitments.U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have fallen to their lowest levels in decades thanks to a fracking-fueled shift to natural gas from coal. Germany is struggling to cut its emissions as it eliminates nuclear power.Trump could also decide to stay a party to the agreement but re-examine the U.S. commitment, which the White House has suggested is unfair. Supporters of the framework say the idea is to establish trust and, over time, ramp up what initially appear to be fairly modest goals for major emerging market countries such as China. Critics of the agreement argue that it is unbalanced and that U.S. participation will drive up domestic energy costs and harm job creation. Trump has been a longtime critic of climate science's global warming consensus and has pledged to bring back coal mining jobs.Soon after Trump was elected, more than 350 companies signed a letter urging him not to abandon the Paris climate change agreement. ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,"" the letter said.Among those companies signing it were household names like General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), DuPont (DD), eBay (EBAY), Starbucks (SBUX), Staples (SPLS), Nike (NKE) and Intel (INTC). DuPont, Nike and Intel are all Dow components, like Exxon Mobil.Still, Trump expressed an open mind toward the Paris agreement after entering the White House. Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he had spoken to Trump about the climate pact three weeks earlier and was ""cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.""Some advocates of the Paris agreement have questioned openly whether Trump leaving the agreement would be better than remaining a reluctant participant seeking to undermine the deal from within.RELATED:Trump To Cancel Obama Policies Aimed At Paris Climate PledgeSolar Stocks Plunge On Coal-Champion Trump's Surprise WinHere's Why Bank Stocks Are Breaking Key Support, Sinking Dow

Salesforce paid a high multiple, nearly 16 times MuleSoft's estimated 2018 revenue, setting a high bar for other potential deals involving SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies. MuleSoft's sales jumped 58% last year to $296 million.  The deal is expected to be earnings dilutive through 2019. MuleSoft software automates the integration of new tools with legacy enterprise platforms and speeds application development.  Salesforce.com shares fell on the announcement.AbbVie (ABBV) cratered nearly 13% Thursday after it scuttled plans to seek accelerated approval for a lung cancer drug that performed poorly in a midstage trial.

The Federal Reserve will start paring its balance sheet and stuck to its hawkish plan for raising interest rates, pushing Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks toward buy points. Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced a big defense takeover.The Dow industrials rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 index edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq dipped 0.3%, after all three major averages hit record highs during the week. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed. Apple was a drag on the major indexes but oil stocks rallied with crude futures while bank stocks climbed on a hawkish Fed and rebounding Treasury yields. Some recent breakouts, such as Apple and Tesla (TSLA), faltered during the week. Several other stocks topped buy points, but not by much and in light volume.Crowds were light for the iPhone 8 as it went on sale Friday, confirming reports of light pre-orders, as many customers await the high-end iPhone X due Nov. 3. Apple admitted that its cellular-enabled Apple Watch Series 3, which also went on sale Friday, has connectivity problems. Apple shares fell 5% to 151.89, below a flat-base buy point of 156.75 and its 50-day line.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google announced that it will pay Taiwan-based HTC $1.1 billion to acquire and staff assets to make Pixel smartphones. Google's latest Pixel phones are expected to be revealed in early October.RELATED:Apple iPhone X Production, Supply Likely Delayed: AnalystThe Federal Reserve, as expected announced that it will start to pare its $4.5 trillion balance sheet starting in October. Policymakers also stuck to their plan for four interest-rate hikes by the end of 2018, including one more this year. That raised market odds of an increase by December. Treasury yields continued their rebound, helping Citigroup (C), Bank of America and other big banks hit or near buy points.RELATED: The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltNorthrop Grumman (NOC) announced it would buy Orbital ATK (OA) for $7.8 billion in cash and assume $1.4 billion in debt. That comes out to $134.50 a share for Orbital. The acquisition will give Northrop key missile-defense assets as Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for the Boeing (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The deal could even help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and will be a test case to see if the Trump Administration and Pentagon still have concerns over the size of prime contractors.RELATED:Why The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop GrummanOPEC and noncartel members did not extend or deepen production cuts at Friday's meeting, but a move for increased monitoring and other steps hinted that production would not soar in 2018. Crude futures rose above $50 a barrel earlier in the week on Iraqi hints of extended output curbs, and they closed above that key level. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 4.59 million barrels in the latest week according to the Energy Information Administration, more than expected. U.S. gasoline supplies fell by 2.125 million barrels and distillates fell by 5.69 million barrels. Domestic crude production rose to 9.5 million barrels per day, almost back to pre-Hurricane Harvey levels.RELATED:Oil Ends Above $50 As Iraq Hints At Extension Of OPEC Output CutFedEx (FDX) took an earnings hit from Hurricane Harvey and a June cyberattack on its Dutch TNT Express unit. Adjusted profit fell 13% from a year ago to $2.51, as revenue climbed 4.3% to $15.30 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Wall Street analysts had expected EPS of $3.17 and revenue of $15.37 billion. The delivery giant said it would have posted EPS of $3.32 minus the adverse events. It also lowered full-year guidance. But FedEx shares rose 2.4% for the week to 220, flirting with a 220.09 buy point off a flat base. The shipper is bumping up rates for many services by 5% starting Jan. 1.Shares in T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) jumped 4.7% and 10.8%, resectively, amid reports that their stalled merger talks may be back on and near an agreement. Shares in cell tower operators down. The wireless operators are said to be looking at an all-stock deal that would give Deutsche Telekom control. They have yet to agree upon an exchange ratio based on each company's valuation. But Sprint and T-Mobile shares rose again early Friday on a report that the telecoms were near a deal on terms.Adobe Systems (ADBE) earnings rose 47% in fiscal Q3 as revenue swelled 26% to $1.84 billion, both above views. But investors focused on lower-than-expected bookings for Adobe's Experience Cloud business, which includes online marketing, advertising and analytics services. Adobe blamed longer sales cycles for closing deals worth over $1 million each. Adobe guided higher on earnings, but in line on sales. Adobe shares fell 3.9%, but are up sharply in 2017.RELATED:Adobe Stock Dinged By Marketing Software Bookings MissKohl's (KSS) will start processing Amazon (AMZN) returns for free at 82 locations across Los Angeles and Chicago, starting in October. Department stores, broadly, are throwing everything to the wall to see what sticks in a bid for more foot traffic and sales. Investors seemed to like the news well enough, and Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom called the move ""intelligent,"" but it remains to be seen whether inviting the e-commerce enemy over the threshold will be revenue-boosting, long term. Kohl's shares rose 2%.RELATED:Sign Of The Times: Kohl's Will Start Accepting Amazon ReturnsUnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) fell for much of the week as investors started seeing a serious chance that the GOP's last-ditch ObamaCare repeal plan could actually pass. Medicaid-focused insurers Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), which have made a big push in the ObamaCare exchanges, fell the most. But shares rebounded somewhat Friday after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he'd oppose the bill, making passage far less likely.Big news moved Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS) into the stratosphere last week, as Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI) toppled on FDA reports regarding their drugs while Versartis (VSAR) crashed on a failed drug trial. Alnylam spiked 52% Wednesday after reporting strong late-stage data for a rare-disease drug, prompting rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) to plunge 8.8%. Adamas, on Tuesday, hit a 20-month high after announcing it will charge $28,500 per patient per year for its Parkinson's drug, Gocovri. Aerie, though, dipped to a three-week low after the FDA set a committee review date for its glaucoma drug, Rhopressa. Meanwhile, Intercept neared a four-year low Thursday after the FDA warned of liver damage and death related to its drug, Ocaliva. Versartis cratered Friday after its drug for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency didn't meet a late-stage trial goal.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) got the nod from regulators to purchase 1,932 Rite Aid (RAD) stores, less than what it agreed to in June, along with three distribution centers and other assets for $4.375 billion in cash. The announcement came nearly two years after Walgreens first announced a deal to buy Rite Aid. But its plans repeatedly ran up against concerns that the combined drugstore operator would harm competition. Drugstore stocks came under pressure amid fresh reports that Amazon (AMZN) might enter the pharmacy business.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) disappointed investors with its targets for 2020. Best Buy stock tumbled 8% following its first investor meeting in five years. Best Buy's implied profit margins in its four-year outlook were below Wall Street's estimates. Analysts also expressed doubts that Best Buy could reach its promised annual sales growth of about 2%.Japanese video game firm Nintendo (NTDOY) could be poised to enter China with its Switch console, according to news reports. Nintendo recently revealed that it is bringing Tencent's (TCEHY) ""Honor of Kings,"" one of China's most popular games, to the Switch console this winter. Nintendo stock rose to its best levels in nearly eight 8 years.Amazon (AMZN) reportedly is developing smart glasses and a new camera security system, both of which tap into its Alexa virtual assistant and expand its growing presence in the smart home, to the detriment of Alphabet.Indications are that Facebook (FB) stands a good chance of getting approval to enter China, the world's largest internet market, following the recent success of Airbnb. Facebook has been banned in China since 2009.Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) crumbled 16% on Wednesday after the housewares retailer reported a 32% profit drop on a 1.7% sales dip to $2.94 billion, both missing.As cereal cedes shelf space to fresh food in American supermarkets, General Mills (GIS) and Kellogg (K) are feeling the hurt.

25,GIS,"Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) fell nearly 2% Tuesday afternoon after the food giant ""amicably agreed to withdraw"" its $143 billion, $50-a-share proposal to merge with consumer goods conglomerate Unilever (UN), but deal buzz continued to support the two giants as well as other food and consumer product makers.""Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard,"" said the Sunday release. ""Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever.""The joint statement from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)-backed Kraft Heinz and Unilever spurred a 180-degree shift from Friday's market action, in which Kraft Heinz's stock spiked 10.7% on public confirmation of the bid. Friday's statement from Kraft Heinz had also indicated that it would continue to pursue the parent company of Dove and Vaseline, despite its initial rejection of the offer. Shares ended the day off 1.78 to 94.87.Unilever shares plunged nearly 8% to 45.09 on the stock market today after soaring 15.3% Friday. The company, which trades as both Unilever NV and Unilever PLC (UL) said last week that the proposal ""fundamentally undervalues"" the company and provides no financial or strategic merit for Unilever shareholders.The quick reversal in Kraft Heinz's intentions may stem from Warren Buffett's sentiment toward hostile takeovers. Berkshire Hathaway ""will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions,"" he said in his 2015 annual letter to shareholders. He acknowledged that some hostile bids are ""justified.""""We, though, will leave these 'opportunities' for others,"" he wrote. ""At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.""Berkshire Hathaway and 3G engineered the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz. Berkshire Class B shares were up fractionally.A Kraft Heinz-Unilever merger would have made for the second-largest food-and-drink company in the world, according to Bloomberg data, bringing together brands such as Oscar Mayer and Planters and Lipton and Hellmann's. The combination of Kraft and Heinz two years ago created the fifth largest.While Kraft and Unilever retreated Tuesday, they kept a good share of Monday's gains on speculation that industry consolidation could still happen.Other consumer goods heavyweights were on the move Tuesday as speculation circulated that Kraft Heinz might have another acquisition target in mind. Colgate Palmolive (CL) was up 1.2%. Clorox (CLX) ticked up 0.9%. Procter & Gamble (PG) edged 0.5%. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) inched up 1.2%.Colgate, Clorox and Kimberly-Clark posted big gains Friday on the initial Kraft-Unilever news. Dow component P&G inched up to a 2-year high Friday after surging earlier in the week on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management had taken a $3.5 billion stake.Meanwhile, Mondelez International (MDLZ) was up 4.9% as it announced an overhaul of its snack line, while General Mills (GIS) added 2.8%. Mondelez shares fell Friday after previously rallying on hopes of a Kraft takeover bid.

26,GIS,"Bing Crosby's rendition of Irving Berlin's ""White Christmas"" from the 1942 movie ""Holiday Inn"" sold 50 million copies, making it the best-selling single of all time. Some 500 other versions — by Frank Sinatra, Bob Marley, Shania Twain, Lady Gaga, among others — have added another 50 million.But its popularity started slow: It was first sung by Crosby on a Christmas Day broadcast 75 years ago, just weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack brought the U.S. into World War II. And after its inclusion in ""Holiday Inn"" the next year, Berlin had given up trying to promote the melancholy song that critics had disparaged.""In the closing weeks of the year, it quietly found its way to a special constituency: American soldiers abroad,"" wrote Laurence Bergreen, author of ""As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin."" ""It became the GIs' anthem of longing and homesickness. … Although it owed its initial success to the war, the appeal was essentially timeless … belonging to no particular era, place, or musical fashion.""It was just one of 25 of Berlin's songs that reached No. 1 on the charts, according to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Not bad for someone who never learned to read or write music, taught himself to play piano only in one key, and began his career by singing as he sold newspapers amid New York City's tenements.Berlin (1888-1989) was born Israel Beilin in or near the city of Mohilev, in what was then Russia and is now Belarus. His father, Moses, was the synagogue's cantor, which would inspire his son to sing. The family of nine fled anti-Semitic persecutions and entered the U.S. in 1893, with authorities changing their name to Baline.Settling in the Lower East Side, Moses found a job at a kosher meat market, mom Leah became a midwife, and the kids worked in sweatshops making shirts or cigars. At 8, Izzy became a newsboy, but at 13 when his father died the family couldn't afford to keep him in school. Embarrassed by his meager contribution, he decided to run away to the seedy Bowery district to pursue his dream of becoming a singing waiter.Homeless at first, he hawked papers and popped into saloons to sing for the coins tossed his way. A year later, he was hired by a cafe, showing a talent for witty parodies of popular songs. During slow times in his 12-hour shifts, he taught himself to play the piano, but only in the key of F-sharp major. At 19, he collaborated with the resident pianist to write ""Marie From Sunny Italy,"" selling his publishing rights for 37 cents. A printer's error credited him as ""I. Berlin"" and he embraced the mistake, choosing Irving for his first name.In 1909, Berlin had his first hit, ""Sadie Salome (Go Home)."" It sold 300,000 copies of the sheet music. He was hired by a publisher as a staff lyricist and churned out so many best-sellers that his one-cent royalties earned him $15,000 for the year (equivalent to $403,000 in today's money).He was soon composing tunes as well, but had to hire someone to write out the harmonies for the melodies that he tapped out or sang. He bought a transposing piano, which allowed him to pull a lever that would make his F-sharp major become any other key.Berlin's first international hit was ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" in 1911, which failed when he first wrote it as an instrumental. When he added lyrics, it stimulated a worldwide dance craze. George Gershwin called it ""the first real American musical work.""Berlin composed his first full score for a stage musical, the ragtime revue ""Watch Your Step,"" in 1914. This was followed by a series of patriotic songs during World War I, including one for an all-soldier musical that included the classic, ""Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,"" which he often performed himself. After the war he had a series of hit singles, including ""Always"" in 1925. Al Jolson sang his ""Blue Skies"" in the first feature-length ""talkie"" movie, ""The Jazz Singer,"" in 1927.Berlin's first full film score was for ""The Cocoanuts"" starring the Marx Brothers in 1929, and he wrote 17 others, including ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" in 1930 and ""Top Hat"" in 1935.Part of Berlin's formula for success was his discipline in attending rehearsals all day, then composing from after dinner until four in the morning.""He was the embodiment of dedication to craft and hard work, focusing every night to become a one-man music factory,"" said guitarist and composer Justin Morell, who's also an assistant professor of music at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pa. ""He didn't believe in the romantic image of the inspired artist; he knew that chipping away at a task could produce something extraordinarily beautiful, which is a good model for anyone involved in a creative process. The result was a catalog of 1,500 songs, with an astonishing number that remain popular today because he knew how to connect with everyday people and communicate his message in simple terms to bring them happiness and make them feel something.""As the world rumbled toward war in 1938, Berlin decided to revive a song he had written 20 years earlier but never released. Kate Smith debuted ""God Bless America"" on Armistice Day, Nov. 11. The song is regarded as a second national anthem. He assigned the royalties to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, earning them millions.Berlin also produced ""This Is the Army,"" a revue which he took to troops on the front lines for nearly four years. The stage and the film versions also raised $10 million for the Army Emergency Relief Fund.Berlin wrote about some unusual patriotic causes, like the Lend-Lease Act (which permitted military aid to the Allies in World War II)  and the importance of paying the IRS (Berlin refused to use tax shelters). But nothing came close to the success of ""White Christmas,"" which won the Academy Award for Best Song. ASCAP ranks it No. 3 in its list of most popular songs of all time. The 1942 master of Bing Crosby's original recording was so overused that it became damaged, and a 1947 rerecording by Crosby is the one now in circulation. Crosby also starred in the 1954 movie musical of the same name, which was that year's top earner.Although some of Berlin's postwar projects failed, he had success with the movie versions of such Broadway hits as ""Blue Skies"" (1946), ""Easter Parade"" (1948), ""Annie Get Your Gun"" (1950) and ""Call Me Madam"" (1953).""The score for 'Annie' is remarkable for its variety, one outstanding song after another keeping the silly plot in motion,"" wrote Edward Jablonski in ""Irving Berlin: American Troubadour."" "" 'They Say It's Wonderful' was broadcast on 'Your Hit Parade' only a week after the musical opened and stayed on the roster for no less than six months. 'I Got Lost in His Arms' is the show's loveliest ballad with a melodically hypnotic chorus. It also introduced 'There's No Business Like Show Business' and 'Anything You Can Do,' among others.""""It's beautifully ironic that a Russian-Jewish immigrant wrote our most beloved song for Christmas, our most popular song for Easter (""Easter Parade""), and another national anthem,"" said Harry Parker, chair of the department of theater at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, who wrote a musical revue featuring Berlin's music. ""Berlin had a way to tap into universal feelings in a way that was simple yet profound, in a quintessential American style that made them classics.""Berlin's last composition was ""An Old-Fashioned Wedding"" for the Broadway revival of ""Annie Get Your Gun"" in 1966. He died 23 years later at age 101.""Irving Berlin's innate musical ability cannot be mistaken for what propelled him to become one of America's greatest songwriters, which was his tenacity and lifetime of hard work,"" said Rebecca Dodson-Webster, associate professor of horn and music history at Mansfield University in Pennsylvania. ""He never let obstacles stop him from creating some of the best-known entries in the Great American Songbook.""Wrote lyrics and music for ""White Christmas"" and many other classic songs.Overcame: Lack of training to read, write or play music.Lesson: Don't wait for inspiration — make a ritual of working hard on a challenge until the solution emerges.""Life is 10% what you make it, and 90% how you take it.""MORE ABOUT LEGENDARY ENTERTAINERS:George M.

27,GIS,"The Greeks gave us tragedy -- the idea that life is never fair. Terrible stuff for no reason tragically falls on good people. Life's choices are sometimes only between the bad and the far worse.In the plays of the ancient dramatists Aeschylus and Sophocles, heroism and nobility only arise out of tragedies.The tragic hero refuses to blame the gods for his terrible fate. Instead, a Prometheus, Ajax or Oedipus prefers to fight against the odds. He thereby establishes a code of honor, even as defeat looms.In contrast, modern Americans gave the world therapy.Life must always be fair. If not, something or someone must be blamed. All good people deserve only a good life -- or else.A nation of victims soon becomes collectively paralyzed in fear of offending someone. Pay down the $20 trillion debt? Reform the unsustainable Social Security system? Ask the 47% of the population that pays no income tax to at least pay some?Nope. Victims would allege that such belt-tightening is unfair and impossible -- and hurtful to boot. So we do nothing as the rendezvous with financial collapse gets ever closer.Does anyone think a culture of whiners can really build high-speed rail in California? Even its supporters want the noisy tracks built somewhere away from their homes.Even animals get in on the new victimhood. To build a reservoir in drought-stricken California means oppressing the valley elderberry longhorn beetle or ignoring the feelings of the foothill yellow-legged frog.America's impoverished ancestors at 15 years of age may have rounded Cape Horn on a schooner or ridden bareback over the Rockies.Not today's therapeutic college youth. They have been so victimized by racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia and other -isms and -phobias that colleges often provide them ""safe spaces,"" outlaw ""microaggressions"" and demand ""trigger warnings"" to avoid the un-nice.What would our grandfathers think?As teenagers on D-Day, they found no safe spaces on Omaha Beach. A storm of steel from thousands of SS killers proved more than a ""microaggression"" at the Battle of the Bulge. Generals did not give their freezing GIs mere ""trigger warnings"" about a half-million Chinese Red Army soldiers crossing the Yalu River during the Korean War.American victimhood is the luxury of an affluent, secure and leisured postmodern society that can afford such silly indulgences.Second-string San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick apparently assumes that his wealthy team can afford to pay him nearly $20 million a year to sit on the bench, without much caring that he can't be bothered to stand up for the National Anthem.But victimhood is a good career move. Kaepernick went from being a washed-up quarterback to being a much-publicized social justice warrior -- a veritable Noam Chomsky in cleats opining on over two centuries of American criminal justice.He was once fined for reportedly smearing a fellow NFL player with the N-word, but now as a victim himself, Kaepernick can no longer be a victimizer.During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton blamed Donald Trump for body-shaming 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado two decades ago. Machado had reportedly gained more than 40 pounds and apparently made it hard for Trump's beauty pageant to showcase her figure in promotional events.America may be broke and plagued by riots and terrorism. No matter: It apparently can afford to fret over Machado's 20 years of post-traumatic stress.Once victimhood is established, we lose our identities and, as part of an offended collective, claim blanket exemption for all our imperfections.In Machado's case, what does it matter if such a victim allegedly threatened a Venezuelan judge, or was reportedly involved with a drug cartel leader, or became a campaign shill for the Clinton campaign?All of that is nothing compared with the trauma of being called fat for not being able to fit back into the bikini that won her the Miss Universe crown and fame.Sometimes the art of victimhood gets confusing. If we are all victims of some sort, who are left to be the victimizers?Can victims victimize? Can gays be Islamophobic, Muslims homophobic, blacks racist, women sexist or Latinos xenophobic? If so, who is to sort out their relative rock/paper/scissors zero-sum grievances?Unfortunately, Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Islamic State and the Chinese have no particular sympathy for any American who lays claim to victim status.Nor do foreign buyers of U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the debt defer to America's legions of victims. A nuclear bomb from North Korea or Iran will not sort us all out by race, class or gender, much less by victim and victimizer.To appreciate American heroism, we might read Sophocles' ""Antigone"" or E.B. Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"" -- and watch a lot less Sunday football.

30,GIS,"Shares of Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Amplify Snack Brands (BETR) popped Thursday after France's Danone (DANOY) agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), the owner of Silk soy milk, Horizon Organic and other brands, in a $10 billion deal. The companies valued the deal at $12.5 billion ""including debt and certain other WhiteWave liabilities,"" according to a press statement.Hain, the maker of Earth's Best baby food and shelf stable products, Celestial Seasonings herbal teas and other natural and organic food products, leapt 7.1% to 50.63 on the stock market today.Amplify, which specializes in GMO-free healthier snacks, rose 2% to 15.05. Intraday, the stock rose as high as 15.60, clearing a buy point at 15.14. Amplify came public at 18 last August.WhiteWave Foods stock shot up 18.55 to 56.23, hitting a record high.Like other small natural foods suppliers, Hain was hurt as large grocers such as Kroger (KR) moved into the space in recent years with their own brands of organic and natural foods, such as Kroger's Simple Truth line, making WhiteWave, Hain Celestial and other natural food companies more vulnerable to takeover.In addition, larger food companies like General Mills (GIS) have been buying small natural foods makers. General Mills gobbled up Annie's Homegrown, a maker of natural and organic pastas and other foods, in late 2014 for about $820 million cash. Kroger was down fractionally and General Mills edged up less than 1% early Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Food companies have fared better in recent weeks as investors have clamored for defensive plays. Pepsi (PEP) has hit a buy point after a glowing earnings report. Hain stock plunged 53% from an all-time high 70.65 set on Aug. 5 of last year to a 33.12 low in late January and then it turned up.Among other highly rated food companies, TreeHouse Foods (THS), a maker of healthy snacks, beverages and prepared meals, was up 0.8%. J&J Snack Foods (JJSF), which makes baked goods, frozen snacks and other foods, rose 0.2%.

31,GIS,"Will Keith Kellogg's prospects seemed pretty dim.He began working at his family's struggling broom factory at 7 and was forced to drop out of school at 13 to do it full-time. A year later, he was on the road in all weather to sell their products.""His parents thought Will was stupid, while his older brother John, a famous physician, hired him to manage his sanitarium, but treated him (poorly) and paid him poorly,"" Dr. Howard Markel, author of ""The Kelloggs: The Battling Brothers of Battle Creek,"" to be published in August, told IBD. ""But Will was a serious student of the emerging science of business and methodically analyzed, applied, and adopted efficiency techniques and systems espoused by the best commercial gurus of the day. For nearly a quarter century, the quiet, stolid Will was doing more than merely taking orders. He was preparing to become a renowned captain of industry. Just as Henry Ford was figuring out the economies of scale to sell millions of automobiles rolling off his assembly line, Will Kellogg revolutionized the administration of the modern medical center and, later, the mass production and marketing of manufactured food.""Will Keith Kellogg (1860-1951), usually called just ""W.K.,"" was the seventh of 16 children born to Seventh-Day Adventists in Battle Creek, Mich.On his first trip as a traveling salesman, his one-horse sleigh kept turning over and dumping his stock, but he didn't let that stop him.""He not only sold his cargo, but he also collected from one storekeeper an overdue account which his father regarded as uncollectable,"" wrote Horace Powell in ""The Original Has His Signature: W.K. Kellogg."" ""Thus, Will Kellogg displayed early the tenacity and the courage that were to stand him in good stead during catastrophes to come.""In 1880, he quit to attend Parson's Business College in nearby Kalamazoo for three months. Four years earlier, his brother John had taken over the Adventist Health Reform Institute, which was renamed the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Having little time to manage the day-to-day operation at the popular resort, he hired Will to run it.Will often worked over 100 hours a week, doing everything from keeping the books and buying supplies to janitorial work and filling mail orders, without even an office for the first 10 years. He started at $24 a month (equivalent to $574 in today's money) and over the next quarter century that only rose to $87.""By 1900, in the span of only 14 years,"" Markel writes, ""the Sanitarium's physical plant evolved from a two-story, converted home into a massive, modern, beautiful and luxurious medical and surgical center; it was so grand that it employed over 1,000 people, cared for seven to ten thousand patients each year, operated dozens of laboratories and radiology units, farmed over 400 acres of land to grow the vegetables, fruit and dairy products the guests consumed daily, and operated a canning and food manufacturing facility, laundry, charity hospital, creamery, and a resort comprising 20 cottages."" Over that time, he adds, Will Kellogg ""developed or adopted new business techniques to efficiently and profitably manage the Sanitarium in a manner that would seem familiar and logical to hospital administrators today.""John was always trying to create healthy alternatives to traditional foods, and in 1874 he began to experiment to produce a bread that would be more digestible for patients. He put Will in charge and one day a batch of boiled whole wheat paste was accidentally left out for hours before baking and dried out. When he tried to roll it out into the usual long sheet, each wheat berry became a tasty flake when toasted and this worked just as well with corn, rice and oats. In 1897, the brothers founded the Sanitas Food Co. to promote flaked cereals as a nutritious quick breakfast. At the time, well-off Americans loaded up on eggs and meat to start the day, while the poor made do with grains boiled into a porridge or a gruel.As demand for the flaked cereals rose, Will wanted to move their plant off the sanitarium property to keep their method secret, but John saw keeping it on the grounds as an opportunity for more publicity. One of his patients, C.W. Post, copied the process and founded Postum Cereals, which eventually became General Mills (GIS), with its popular Grape-Nuts, and was soon making millions.Frustrated, Will left in 1906 to form the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Co. — what eventually became the Kellogg Co. (K) There, he became a pioneer in branding. (John finally recognized the opportunity and invested.) Will put his signature on the product to warn customers against inferior imitations, and was the first to provide prizes in each box, while also giving away samples of new products and spending millions on national advertising. Though he was advised to stick with mail order, he instead built a distribution network to grocers. At the end of his first year, 3,000 cases of corn flakes were being shipped daily, reaching 24,000 a day in 1920.Will was an early adopter of the best automated manufacturing systems using conveyor belts. He was also a hands-on manager as his operations spread, writing numerous memos to improve the processes.He was also a generous boss, cutting hours from the standard 10 hours a day to eight. During the Great Depression, he cut the workweek to 30 hours and increased the shifts, to give jobs to as many as possible. He also provided his employees health care and a nursery for their children.In 1934, he set up the W.K. Kellogg Foundation in Battle Creek and endowed it with $66 million (equal to $7 billion today). It has focused on children's health care, education, and leadership training across the globe.""On July 4, 1907, he had just watched his first factory burn furiously to the ground,"" wrote La June Montgomery Tabron, president and CEO of the foundation, in its 2014 annual report. ""To a lesser leader, it could've been devastating. He had no capital to rebuild, but with the ruins still smoking, he told his employees to report for work the next morning. By the day's end, he had arranged for an architect to begin plans for a much larger and safer factory. Then, he somehow drummed up the financing to make it a reality. Today, confronted by the world's challenges, that kind of courage is precisely what we need from our leaders and ourselves.""After serving as president of his company until 1939, as he was going blind from glaucoma, he remained an active chairman until 1948. That year, the company posted sales of $80 million ($774 million today).Kellogg's products currently are manufactured in 18 countries by over 33,000 workers and sold in 180, with net sales for the year ending Jan. 2, 2016, of $13.5 billion and net income of $614 million.He died at 91, one of the most beloved of American industrialists.Founded the Kellogg Co. and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.Overcame: Lack of appreciation of his talents by his family.Lesson: Build your skills quietly to prove your critics wrong in the long run.""I have learned much more by asking questions than by telling people how much I know.""

33,GIS,"As soon as President Trump signed his executive order calling for two regulations to be eliminated for every new one enacted, the usual suspects started to complain.Union of Concerned Scientists President Ken Kimmell called it ""absurd, imposing a Sophie's Choice on federal agencies.""William Gale of the left-of-center Brookings Institution complained that ""there's no logic to this.""Public Citizen head Robert Weissman called Trump's order ""unworkable,"" ""harmful,"" ""unprecedented and untested,"" and ""horrifying.""""Americans will once again have to pay the price for the consequences of corporate recklessness, greed and lawbreaking,"" Weissman added for good measure.Trump's executive order, signed on Monday, doesn't deregulate anything. It simply is an attempt to cap the current costs of regulations this year by requiring agencies to offset the costs of any new rule by eliminating regulations that impose equal costs.""The heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero,"" the order said.It's a tiny first step toward cutting the enormous cost of federal regulations — which by some estimates adds up to almost $1.9 trillion a year.What critics of deregulation fail to mention, however, is that it is greedy corporations that are likely to be one of Trump's biggest opponents when it comes to dismantling, or even taming, the federal government's massively complex and enormously expensive regulatory state.Soon after Trump was elected, for example, more than 350 companies signed a letter urging him not to abandon the Paris climate change agreement that President Obama had signed onto. ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,"" the letter said.Among those companies signing it were household names like General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), DuPont (DD), eBay (EBAY), Starbucks (SBUX), Staples (SPLS), Nike (NKE) and Intel (INTC).Trump's effort to fix Dodd-Frank won't get much support from the banking industry, either.Business Insider reports that ""bankers are concerned the Trump administration, joined by like-minded Congress, will scrape or significantly change the rules.""Dodd-Frank required banks to invest in staff and technology and make other changes to comply with that law's vast web of regulations. But ""now that Dodd-Frank is largely in effect, the industry sees a total elimination as more of a threat than a blessing.""Brokerage firms worry that the Labor Department's ""fiduciary rule"" could be in jeopardy. BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said on a January earnings call that the rule ""has some very great components in it.""Why would companies be pushing to keep costly regulations in place?This is the dirty secret that so-called public-interest groups never share. Big corporations are often the biggest beneficiaries, and at times the strongest advocates, of federal regulations.Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament, put it best during the Brexit debate last year. Big business vigorously supported the Remain campaign, he noted, despite the fact that EU regulations were suffocating the British economy.""Ask yourself why it is that the megabanks and the multinationals are pouring money into the Remain campaign,"" Hannan said. ""I'll tell you why. The biggest surprise for me when I was a newly elected MEP was the extent to which these giant corporations wanted more regulation. They love regulation because they can afford the compliance costs more easily than their smaller rivals.""See? Regulations can give big companies a competitive advantage — not only can they more easily afford the cost of regulatory compliance than their smaller competitors, they can finance an army of lobbyists to make sure the rules are written to their benefit.The most noteworthy effect of Dodd-Frank, for example, hasn't been that it's made the financial sector less vulnerable — as IBD noted recently, it hasn't. It is, instead, the destruction of smaller community banks, which in turn has let large banks further consolidate their grip on the industry.""The number of community banks (those with less than $10 billion in assets) shrank 14% between Dodd-Frank's passage in 2010 and late 2014,"" noted Harvard Business School's Marshall Lux and Robert Greene. ""When regulations — not consumers — drive consolidation, banking system risk increases,"" they wrote.Some other examples, courtesy of the Cato Institute:Airline deregulation is another prime example of how big business fights deregulation more fiercely that it fights regulation.Before 1978, the federal Civil Aeronautics Board controlled airline routes and fares. Airlines routinely complained about CAB rules, but when President Carter and liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy teamed up to deregulate the airline industry, it was the airlines themselves that mounted a determined fight against it, and encouraged their employees to do likewise.The chairman of Delta Airlines (DAL) at the time called deregulation a ""wolf in sheep's clothing,"" saying it would somehow lead to more regulation and ""perhaps eventual nationalization"" of the airline industry.Carter ignored these warnings and disbanded the CAB. The result made life tougher for airline executives, but it was a consumer bonanza of increased competition and far lower rates.Yet despite countless such examples over the decades, this dynamic goes almost entirely unrecognized when the subject of federal regulations comes up. Regulations are always portrayed as helping the little guy at the expense of big business — when the reality is often the opposite.This isn't to say that big business will always fight against deregulation. But when it comes to free-market policies, corporate executives can be fickle friends. And if Donald Trump wants to live up to his promise to deregulate the economy, he's likely going to have to take on not just the liberal left, but some of the biggest businesses in the world.RELATED:Now They Tell Us: Trump's Economic Plan Will Boost GrowthTrump Day One To-Do List: Repeal $1.7 Billion Of Dodd-Frank RulesIs Ford's Move A Cave-In To Trump Protectionist Talk, Or A Savvy Bet On Future?

40,GIS,"Bad things can happen to good stocks, even supposed safe ones that pay a generous dividend.That's the lesson from Campbell Soup (CPB), which disappointed investors Friday with its fiscal third-quarter report.Campbell Soup, which has been a mainstay in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, said it earned 65 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny. But sales of $1.87 billion missed estimates of $1.91 billion. Both were 2% below a year earlier. It was the first earnings decline in five quarters. CEO Denise Morrison said sales were hampered by a weaker U.S. soup season, challenges with the V8 line of beverages, and a weather-related disruption to the company's carrot supply.The stock was hammered Friday, falling more than 6% and undercutting the 59.74 low of a narrow flat base with a 65.58 buy point from which it had meandered May 12 in dull volume. Campbell's sell-off rattled investors in some big members of IBD's packaged food industry group. General Mills (GIS), which sells the competing Progresso brand of soup, was also down, although it was finding support at its 50-day moving average. It is close to completing a cup-with-handle base with a 65.21 buy point.Campbell had a high-volume down day Aug. 24, but the general market was in the midst of a furious correction. Campbell managed to finish down only 3.3% and quickly got back on track. For now, the stock's long-term uptrend remains intact. But further sharp declines and a failure to hold above the 40-week moving average could mean an investor should sell in order to avoid giving back all the solid gains over the past year.Campbell consolidated for two years before beginning an advance in the middle of 2015. Earnings-per-share growth stopped in 2014 but picked up again in 2015 and is seen rising 11% this year.It pays a 31.25-cent quarterly dividend per share, which works out to a 2% annualized yield.

44,GIS,"As a leading operator of work-site child-care centers, Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) is happiest when the labor market is thriving.When employers dangle perks to attract and retain talent, the company benefits. After all, work-site child care is one of those perks.""The competition for professional talent has continued to be a tailwind for us,"" CEOe David Lissy told IBD. ""We do business with companies in every sector of the economy.""Since its founding in 1986, Bright Horizons has operated child-care and early-education centers for large companies, mostly in on-site centers. Many of its early customers were big investment banks and money centers.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) remains one of its biggest clients. Other large customers include Comcast (CMCSA) NBC Universal, General Mills (GIS), Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD).Many of the firm’s newest clients are smaller companies and in technology, higher education, biotech and health care, Lissy says. Recent new customers include visual computing firm Nvidia (NVDA) and Dignity Health, the largest hospital company in California.At year-end, Bright Horizons operated 932 child care and early education centers. Most are in the U.S., with others in the U.K., Ireland, Canada, the Netherlands and a single location in India.JP Morgan analyst Andrew Steinerman notes that demand for high-quality licensed child care such as Bright Horizons' is driven by a ""high proportion"" of dual-income families.""Once employers offer child care, the benefit is difficult to take away,"" he wrote in a research report.The company’s core users are mostly the preschool-age children of professional working parents, who typically have household incomes above $100,000 a year, Lissy says. Employers subsidize a portion of the costs, about 25% on average.A growing number of its centers are off-premise hybrids called lease consortiums, which take in kids from parents working for multiple employers as well as from the community. These centers are typically in urban markets such as New York and San Francisco.Unlike its other centers, Bright Horizons usually builds lease consortiums. Until five years ago, it had been opening only a small number each year, but in the past five years it’s been opening 15 to 20 a year for a total of around 250.""We saw an emerging need in and around major cities,"" Lissy said.Analyst Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets says such new office complexes with onsite child-care centers typically offer tenants in the building first dibs and discounts.""If they can’t fill them up, they open (spaces) to the outside. It’s been a nice growth area for (Bright Horizons),"" he told IBD.Acquisitions – long part of Bright Horizons’ DNA  -- will continue to complement organic growth. Of the 8% to 10% top-line annual growth the company expects this year, 2% to 5% of that will likely come from acquisitions, both in and outside the U.S., Lissy says.Last year, the company acquired Hildebrandt, a 40-center chain operating in the mid-Atlantic. In 2013, it acquired a chain of 64 nurseries in the U.K. and 49 corporate-sponsored centers in the U.S., called Children’s Choice.Management sees the bulk of its growth coming from new child-care centers (an expected 20 to 25 net new centers this year), new enrollments in existing centers and price increases of 3% to 5% a year.In addition, it’s seeing faster growth from two smaller business lines -- in temporary backup care and education advisory services to help employers manage tuition reimbursement programs.""Companies in the U.S. spend about $17 billion a year on tuition reimbursement benefits for their employees,"" Lissy said. ""We do this for about 150 clients. It’s about a $30 million business for us and growing 20% a year.""In the highly fragmented market for temporary backup dependent care for young children and the elderly, Bright Horizons offers the service at its own centers or through a contracted network of home caregivers.Employers buy the backup service on behalf of their employees for a limited number of days. Employees pay a small co-payment ranging from $5 to $20 a day, Lissy says.These other services, added or expanded in the past several years, come with higher margins than the firm’s core business and have helped earnings grow faster than revenue.Per-share earnings in Q4 grew 21% over the earlier year and 28% for the full year. Analysts expect earnings this year to rise 18% to $2.19 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. That’s on the low end of the company’s forecast for 18% to 20% adjusted EPS growth.Since employers typically build out and equip the child-care centers, Bright Horizons’ capital costs are relatively low. Its biggest expense is staffing for teachers and assistants. Labor accounts for about 75% of costs, Lissy says.Revenue growth from Bright Horizon’s core child-care centers started accelerating in the first quarter of 2015 and have picked up steam in every quarter since, Lissy says.Fourth-quarter revenue grew 10% over the earlier year to $372 million. That was a step up from the third quarter’s 9.2% gain. For the full year, revenue rose 8% to $1.46 billion. Shares, meanwhile, have jumped 27% in the past 12 months.Management forecasts revenue growth of 8% to 10% this year.""It is going to be tough to keep that accelerating top-line growth, but it should grow at a faster rate than the overall economy,"" said analyst Silber.He says employer-sponsored child care is a late cycle business.""As unemployment declines and labor markets tighten, more companies use services like this for recruiting and retention,"" Silber said.
"
45,GIS,"Henry Mucci gave his Army Rangers the truth with the bark off.They faced brutal training.And something tougher: Japanese at the camp holding Allied prisoners. Lt. Col. Mucci’s aim was to rescue those POWs in January 1945.“If any of you think you can’t hold up under all that,” he said of the preparation, “I’ll send you to the hospital, and you can spend the rest of the war washing nurses’ panties.”As it turned out, Mucci’s men -- 100-plus from the 6th Ranger Battalion, 100 Philippine guerrillas and 13 soldiers of the Alamo Scout Army commando unit -- rescued all 511 POWs at the Cabanatuan camp 60 miles north of Manila.“This guy was a true leader,” author Patrick O’Donnell, who interviewed Mucci over the phone in 1996, told IBD. “He was cut from the same cloth as Earl Rudder (a key leader of the Boys of Pointe du Hoc during the invasion of Normandy, France, in 1944). Mucci survives Pearl Harbor and suddenly has to take a bunch of mule skinners -- soldiers who hiked mountains with Howitzer-packing mules until mechanization ended that -- and turn them into Rangers. This was totally unique.“It was a daunting task, a true test of leadership. It was amazing how he turned these men into a cohesive unit able to pull off one of the great raids in World War II -- or ever, in terms of people lost and saved.“It was an incredible rescue mission: marching 30 miles behind enemy lines, hostile Japanese units, setting up roadblocks, assaulting the compound. It took great planning and adjusting.”Mucci (1909-97) so indoctrinated his commandos, they were all in at crunchtime. One was Capt. Robert Prince, who would spearhead the assault.As Prince told O’Donnell for the 2002 book “Into the Rising Sun,” the GIs were gung-ho, even knowing the odds were against them living through the ordeal.“I’m going to turn around,” Prince said at formation, “and every man that wants to volunteer take one step forward.”The captain recalled: “I turned around, and they were all in the same row. I thought none of them stepped forward, when actually they all stepped forward.”To rescue the POWs -- mostly American soldiers -- Mucci’s men had to stealthily cover Philippine land swarming with 9,000 Japanese combat troops, then knock out the guards, charge into the compound, corral the prisoners and lead them all the way back to friendly lines.The Mucci operation started on Jan. 28 and climaxed spectacularly on Jan. 30.Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who greeted Mucci and his team a couple of days later, said: “No incident of the campaign in the Pacific has given me such satisfaction as the release of the POWs at Cabanatuan. The mission was brilliantly successful.”Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the Gulf War hero who was an aide-de-camp to a Bataan Death March survivor, called the raid “a model for special operations, as well (as)… one of the most remarkable and tactically studied achievements in our Army’s history.”The raid germinated in the summer of 1943. MacArthur had escaped the Japanese jump on the Philippines the year before, and now as Allied boss in the Southwest Pacific he listened at his headquarters in Australia to three of his officers. They had also fled the enemy and woke him up to this shock: The POWs at Cabanatuan were suffering atrocities and were doomed to death.By April 1944, 33-year-old Mucci was in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, telling his men of the 98th Field Artillery Battalion: “I’m going to turn you men into Rangers. From this point on, we will be known as the 6th Ranger Battalion.”Wrote Hampton Sides in ""Ghost Soldiers"": Henry A. Mucci ""was such a lavish and convincing persuader that the Rangers supplied him with (a) nickname -- Ham, an acronym formed naturally enough from his initials, but also a sobriquet that captured his incorrigible knack for laying on the bulls**t with a very large shovel. His men didn't care -- they adored him, in large part because anything he asked them to do and anywhere he asked them to go, he was right there alongside them.""Sides told IBD: ""What was remarkable about him was that he delegated -- to Prince, to others who were also just kids, to Philippine guerrillas whom he had reasons to doubt. In the end, he trusted them.""MacArthur returned to the Philippines with a massive force in October 1944, and by year’s end Mucci had his target -- the POW camp at Cabanatuan, thick with survivors of 1942’s Corregidor siege and Bataan Death March.“There was no time for a rehearsal,” Prince told O’Donnell. “That’s why they sent us in, because there was no time, and they were afraid they’d murder those men like it happened on (the Philippine island of) Palawan. The Japanese poured gasoline on the men and burned them alive; it was horrible.”On Jan. 27, the eve of the pursuit, Mucci told his troops, “I don’t want any of our boys from Bataan and Corregidor killed. Bring out every prisoner. Bring 'em out even if every Ranger has to carry a man or two on his back. … Men, I want all of you to go to church. Get down on your knees and pray. Swear to God that you’ll die if need be rather than to let harm come to our POWs.”None wavered. “Every Ranger in the battalion wanted to go,” said Prince, “and only 121 could go.”They knew that once they neared the camp, “total surprise, stealth and speed would be crucial,” wrote William Breuer in “The Great Raid.” “When night fell, the Rangers would assault the compound -- with fury and deadly skill. There would be no second chance should they fail.”They were hardly going in naked. “The Rangers were walking arsenals: Browning automatic rifles, Tommy guns, pistols, bazookas and rockets, hand grenades, trench knives,” noted Breuer.With Mucci staying on the perimeter, Prince pushed his men to the gates of enemy hell in the dark of Jan. 30. “Suddenly,” wrote Breuer, “the silent night was split by a murderous crescendo of gunfire that echoed for miles across the flatland, as John Murphy and his platoon poured heavy fusillades of bullets into the barracks where the transient Japanese troops were relaxing in their underwear.”The shock and awe worked. The Rangers, who suffered two killed, rallied and carried the prisoners to safety in less than an hour, with Prince going “into each hut or building with my .45 cocked. It was dark. I called out, ‘Is there anybody in here?’ There were no replies. Only one man was left behind. He was deaf and fell asleep and didn’t know we were there. Fortunately, he was later rescued by the guerrillas.”Breuer wrote that when Mucci’s bunch reached the American command post Jan. 31 at Guimba, northwest of Cabanatuan, six barefoot POWs handed “the regimental flag of the U.S. 26th Cavalry, which had fought to the bitter end on Bataan,” to Lt. Gen. Oscar Griswold, commander of XIV Corps, who responded, “This is the most touching incident of the war.”The next day, MacArthur rode to the Army hospital, clasped hands of feeble former POWs and said, “I’m a little late, but we finally made it.”The general then told a chaplain, “In your next sermon, take your text from Lazarus arisen from the dead.”Outside the hospital, Mucci told the press that Prince, the Rangers, the Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas deserved the credit. Among reporters covering the story was Life magazine’s Carl Mydans, who wrote: “Every American child of coming generations will know of the 6th Rangers, for a prouder story has never been written.”America thanked Mucci with the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest honor for valor.The Connecticut man who vaulted from West Point to national hero to retired colonel to husband of Marion and father of three died at age 88 in Florida.Said Prince: ""He made a Ranger battalion out of a bunch of mule skinners, and he inspired us and trained us -- and any success we had belongs to Colonel Mucci.""Led Army Rangers in a raid for the ages in the Philippines in World War II.Overcame: Heavy Japanese force at the POW camp.Lesson: Plan to the hilt.“We’ll succeed in this mission because of our grueling training and soldierly qualities. And by luck and grace of God.”

86,GIS,"J.M. Smucker (SJM) trimmed its outlook on sales for this year amid predictions that weakness in pet foods will continue through the rest of 2016.The maker of Folgers coffee, Jif peanut butter and Smucker's jams and jellies now sees adjusted 2016 sales to be down 1% or flat, vs. a prior forecast for a 1% increase.Smucker executives told analysts on an earnings call they expects softness in pet food sales to continue through the end of the year.Fiscal Q1 earnings jumped 41% to $1.86 per share, beating estimates for $1.74. Revenue fell 7% to $1.82 billion, below estimates for $1.89 billion.Shares closed down 8.1% at 143.63, diving below their 50-day average, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Shares broke out from a 132.74 buy point in June and even began closing in on profit-taking range.Specialty pet food maker Blue Buffalo (BUFF) ended virtually flat at 26.29, near a 27.47 buy point. Among makers of packaged food for humans, meanwhile, Kellogg (K) fell 0.4%, Campbell Soup (CPB) dipped 1.4%, ConAgra (CAG) lost 1.7%, and General Mills (GIS) eased 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Highly rated J.M. Smucker's sales disappointed Wall Street on weakness in pet food and coffee. The package food sector is consolidating, and shares of some companies have soared recently amid increased M&A activity.Smucker's coffee revenue of $513.3 million in Q1 was down from $565 million a year earlier, in part on weak Dunkin' (DNKN) K-Cup pods sales and lower net prices. Sales of Kibbles 'n Bits, Meow Mix and other pet food  products collectively fell 6% to $519.5 million, in part on difficult comps vs. strong sales of new brands a year before.However, the company expects to achieve $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year as it consolidates after divestments and recent acquisitions, such as Meow Mix maker Big Heart Pet Brands, which it acquired in March 2015.Smucker maintained it outlook for full-year adjusted EPS of $7.60 to $7.75, the midpoint of which is a little below analysts' consensus for $7.70.

88,GIS,"General Mills (GIS) posted quarterly profit and sales that beat Wall Street estimates, while the cereal king also raised its cost savings projection to $600 million, driving its stock up in premarket trading.Adjusted earnings per share fell 12% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, to 66 cents a share. Revenue declined 8.6% to $3.93 billion after the completion of the sale of the company's Green Giant frozen foods line to B&G Foods (BGS) for $765 million last year. However, analyst consensus was for 60 cents diluted EPS and $3.86 billion revenue.It was the fourth time in five quarters that General Mills' earnings per share have topped estimates.The maker of Cheerios and Wheaties cereals and Betty Crocker and Bisquick food brands raised its quarterly dividend 4% to 48 cents and forecast that its operating profit margin will rise to 20% by fiscal 2018 from 16.8% last quarter. It now expects $600 million a year in cost savings by fiscal 2018, up from its prior estimate of $500 million.General Mills shares climbed 3.2% to 67.86 in the stock market today.

92,GIS,"Eighty-year old companies that specialize in meat production aren’t usually looked upon as growth stocks, but Tyson Foods (TSN) aims to position itself as one anyway.The world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork plans to do so by putting more focus on branded products rather than commodities such as fresh poultry.Its ultimate goal? To become the ""leading branded protein company in the world,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report.""Tyson continues to position itself as a growth company with advantaged brands within advantaged categories,"" Palmer said.Those categories include high-margin, ""value-added"" products such as marinated and breaded poultry; prepared foods, including what it calls its “Core 9” packaged brands like Jimmy Dean sausage and Hillshire Farms lunch meat; and antibiotic and gluten-free chicken.During the recent Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Fla., Tyson officials said 85% of the company’s chicken business consists of poultry that is more than just raw meat.""This further differentiates (Tyson) from its more commodity-oriented peers,"" Palmer noted.Tyson Chief Executive Donald Smith echoed that point on a fiscal first-quarter conference call with analysts.""I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio as well as the production flexibility created with our buy vs. grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure,"" Smith said. The ""buy vs. grow"" strategy refers to Tyson’s decision to purchase some of its chickens from other facilities and reduce the number of chickens it grows itself.Tyson officials have made no secret of their desire to change the way investors view the company. As JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman pointed out in a recent note, the first two words of Tyson’s presentation at the consumer group event were ""different company.""""Tyson remains firmly (and understandably) committed to convincing investors that it is a different company than it used to be,"" Goldman noted. ""The primary reason for the difference continues to be Tyson’s emphasis -- both in reality and perception -- on branded food rather than commodity protein.""One difference between branded food and commodity meat items is that the former carries higher prices and margins, Goldman says. Tyson’s Core 9 brands carry ""an 11% average premium over the category average.""Tyson also spent a lot of time talking about revenue growth during the consumer group event. That stood in contrast to other food companies, such as General Mills (GIS) and Nabisco parent Mondelez International (MDLZ), which mainly focused on cost-cutting.""These companies spent much, maybe most, of their time today talking about costs, whereas the opposite was true for Tyson,"" Goldman noted. ""It helps to have a category (meat/protein) growing at a better-than-average pace, as well as a category that responds well to mix- and margin-accretive innovation today.""There appears to be plenty of demand for Tyson’s meat products. Palmer cited Tyson research showing that 54% of U.S. consumers want to increase the amount of protein in their diets.Worldwide, long-term demand for protein is expected to increase more than 60% from current levels due to population growth and the emergence of a global middle class that can afford to buy more meat products.Favorable industry trends, combined with investor optimism over the food sector in general, have helped push Tyson’s stock price up more than 40% since Nov. 20. Its shares set a record high of 64.63 on Feb. 23 — the sixth straight session they reached a new high.Other large-cap food companies that have set new highs this month include Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).One reason for the recent stock gains is the defensive nature of the food business. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food. Companies in this industry aren’t as vulnerable to wide swings in performance and value and also tend to pay regular dividends. Some food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs.Meanwhile, Tyson has gotten a lift from falling food costs. Excessive supplies of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans have lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork. Lower costs were one reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month to a range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share from prior guidance of $3.50 to $3.65.The company also recently reiterated its goal of 10%-or-better annual earnings-per-share growth in coming years, and suggested that its long-term margin goals might be conservative.“We would not be surprised if before the fiscal year ended, Tyson raised its long-term chicken margin to maybe 8% to 10% from 7% to 9% currently,” Goldman noted.Tyson posted earnings of $1.15 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December. That was up 49% from the previous year and well above consensus analyst estimates for 89 cents. It was the biggest quarterly EPS gain in nearly two years.On the downside, revenue declined 15% to $9.15 billion -- the first dip since the September 2012 quarter -- partly because of the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. The top-line result fell short of consensus for $10 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tyson’s full-year earnings to climb 27% this fiscal year and another 7% in fiscal 2017.

94,GIS,"Despite the Brexit volatility, sparked by the U.K.'s June 24 vote to withdraw from the European Union, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds eked out a 1.79% gain on average in the second quarter, even as they lost 0.52% in June alone, according to Lipper Inc.The S&P 500 tacked on 2.46% in Q2, after inching up 0.26% in June.That's it for the good news. Stock fund managers are seeking durable-growth stocks as a hedge against the uncertainty, volatility and slowdown in corporate earnings that several told IBD they see in the months -- or longer -- ahead.Click Here To See A List Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""Before Brexit, the (investment) world was almost back to normal,"" said Matthew Ward, co-manager of Schroder U.S. Large Cap Equity strategy, which is run as a separate account. The Federal Reserve was edging toward an interest rate increase. First-quarter panic over the pace and sustainability of China's growth was subsiding. U.S. economic indicators were OK, with jobs and wages growing, home values inching up and consumers feeling confidence.""Then, Brexit,"" Ward said. ""We're back to uncertainty, and the market hates uncertainty.""As a result, going forward Ward says the stocks he wants are in a narrow group that have shown an ability to grow earnings regardless of the macro environment.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""Our biggest overweight is in consumer discretionary,"" he said. ""It reflects our confidence in consumers. And in some durable secular trends. Amazon (AMZN) is at the top of our list.""Similarly, James Abate, sole manager of $156 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX) and of $53 million Multi-Asset Real Return (DHMUX), sees the best prospects for growth increasingly concentrated within an elite group. ""We're concentrating in names that somehow can buck the trend in terms of economic malaise,"" said Abate, who is also Centre's chief investment officer. ""The names in the new Nifty 50 bucket include Amazon, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Nvidia (NVDA) and General Mills (GIS).""Jim Swanson, lead manager of $3.4 billion MFS Diversified Income (DIFAX) and chief investment strategist of MFS Investment Management, was already bearish on stocks pre-Brexit.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance The outlook was already dim for corporate earnings growth, he said. He added that companies globally had already lost purchasing power. U.S. selling and general administrative costs, as well as labor costs, are rising. Productivity here, in Europe and in China is falling.Post-Brexit, the dollar is up vs. the Chinese yuan, which will hurt U.S. exports and U.S. multinationals' earnings, he said. A global movement toward trade protectionism, if realized, would also hurt earnings.""Brexit or not, we need to see excess capacity come out of the world manufacturing system and the return of some inflation so that companies can pass along price increases,"" Swanson said.Despite the threats to U.S. corporate earnings, Swanson is overweight in U.S. stocks vs. their Japanese and European peers, which have growth outlooks that look even dimmer to him. And he is underweight in stocks vs. bonds and cash.""U.S. corporate bonds are the place to be,"" he said. He's favoring a mix of high-grade and high-yield debt.Small-cap growth funds led market-capitalization and style groups among U.S. diversified stock funds in Q2, gaining 3.85%.World equity mutual funds barely advanced in Q2, edging up 0.27% while losing 0.64% in June. Latin American funds led all foreign regions, advancing 8.72% in Q2 and 10.72% in June.Up 26.16% year to date, Latin American funds have benefited primarily from a rebound from an excessive sell-off last year, as well as a rebound in the Brazilian real vs. the U.S. dollar and a bounce for oil and other commodities, according to Peter Taylor, a manager of $7.4 billion Aberdeen Emerging Markets (ABEAX) and $3.5 million Latin American Equity Fund (ALEAX). Brazilian stocks have also benefited from the ouster, at least temporarily, of President Dilma Rousseff and in market-friendly fiscal reforms, he says.The quarter's volatility enabled precious metals funds to lead sectors by soaring 40.63% in Q2, more than half of that in June.Going forward, Swanson feels best about the technology sector among U.S. stocks. ""Its free cash flow is the highest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors,"" he said. ""Despite talk of bubbles, the sector is trading cheaper than utilities in Ohio. Yet tech companies change the world.""Software is due to benefit from an overdue upgrade cycle, he says.His second-favorite sector is health care. ""Health care spending keeps rising as a portion of U.S. GDP,"" he said. ""It's priced fairly, not cheaply. It has the best profit outlook after tech.""Consumer discretionary is his third-favorite sector. ""Forward price-earnings ratios are high, but we're seeing year-over-year profit growth that's almost as good as tech's,"" he said.Among tech stocks, Facebook (FB) is one that Ward likes. ""They have exceptional top-line growth,"" he said. ""And they're growing their opportunities."" For one, viewers are tolerating a tripling of videos being shown by advertisers, which allows Facebook to triple the number of ads it inserts among videos.In health care, Ward says share prices have been beaten down, largely by investor concerns that drug pricing will draw additional regulatory scrutiny. But he still likes individual stocks in the sector, including Amgen (AMGN).""It is the cheapest with pharmaceuticals,"" he said. And it is creating market opportunities with a number of biosimilars, which are harder than previous generation treatments for rivals to replicate.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Ward likes Amazon because of top-line growth and its use of Prime to draw new site users. He also likes Amazon's use of its warehouse for storing inventory without the expense of purchasing it.Tractor Supply (TSCO) is another consumer discretionary name he likes. It caters to customers whose income is double the national average and who pursue a rural lifestyle, he says. Its sales are triple its next six competitors combined. Its scale enables Tractor Supply to customize inventory for different regions.In staples, he likes Monster Beverage (MNST). Its new carbonated drink, Mutant, and its distribution arrangement with partner Coca-Cola (KO) should keep growth in the high single digits or low double digits, he says. Wall Street expects low single digits, which makes the stock attractively valued, he says.David Harden, president of Summit Global Investments and lead manager of two of its funds -- $125 million U.S. Low Volatility Equity (LVOLX) and $11 million Small Cap Low Volatility (LVSMX) -- says that amid volatility he likes stocks with stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.One trait shared by stocks he likes is stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.Another trait is low two-year beta. Each one's beta is below 1.0, which means each is less volatile than the overall stock market.

Nike (NKE) ran ahead despite a sales stumble, the finance arm of General Electric (GE) is no longer ""too big too fail."" Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces a regulatory probe while Volkswagen (VLKAY) paid a hefty price to settle an investigation.Stocks started the week as they finished the prior week -- falling sharply in reaction to the Brexit vote. But financial markets roared back, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all up more than 3% for the week and above key support levels, helped by Bank of England signals Thursday that it would ease further this summer. Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29. But Morgan, along with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup, all announced bulked-up capital-return plans shortly after results were released.Wednesday's results follow the first round of the stress-test results during the prior week. All 33 banks passed that round.JPMorgan rose 2.8%, but failed to end the week above its 200-day line. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.7%. Deutsche Bank slid 5.5%, setting fresh record lows.The finance arm of General Electric is no longer deemed ""systemically important,"" according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, ending the GE Capital ""too big to fail"" listing.

Williams, which is seeking monetary damages, fell 3.5%, largely on the surprise news that its chairman and five other board members resigned.In what some view as a defensive play against Wal-Mart (WMT), Amazon.com set July 12 for its second annual deal-loaded Prime Day -- expected to be its biggest shopping day of the year. Last year's Prime Day was the biggest single-day shopping sale in Amazon's history and helped drive Prime memberships, even though many shoppers and analysts said the actual deals weren't that great.Wal-Mart, apparently in a pre-emptive strike against Amazon, announced it was offering a 30-day trial membership of its Prime-comparable ShippingPass, which also offers free two-day shipping. The membership fees are half that of Prime membership.Amazon shares rose 3.8%, Wal-Mart 1.2%.Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) reported a 50% per-share earnings bump to $1.55, while revenue rose 15% to $1.87 billion, topping Street views on both the top and bottom lines.

Shares leapt 8.8% for the week to a record high.In contrast, shelf-stable and frozen foods maker ConAgra Foods (CAG) reported lower Q4 EPS that just met views and a worse-than-expected revenue decline. ConAgra affirmed plans to split off its Lamb Weston potato products business this fall, sell parts of its commercial foods business and move its headquarters to Chicago. ConAgra climbed 3.1% for the week, hitting a record high.Acuity Brands (AYI), a highly-rated company that makes smart, connected lighting systems, reported third-quarter results that topped expectations. Acquisitions helped sales, and the company remained optimistic despite any potential impact from the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU. The company has a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Acuity Brands stock rose 1.45% for the week.Paychex: Outsourcing services firm Paychex (PAYX) said Q4 EPS climbed 11% to 49 cents, in line with views. Revenue increased 9% to $753.9 million, beating estimates. The stock popped on the report, trading up 8.8% for the week to 59.44, the best since late 2000.

Earlier this year, the company sold its private label business to TreeHouse Foods (THS) for $2.7 billion. It had previously bought the unit for $5 billion about three years earlier. It has announced plans to cut annual costs by $3 billion, in part by laying off 1,500 employees.General Mills (GIS) saw an 8% drop in revenue during its fiscal Q3. Its profit slumped 7.1%. The company has moved to cut costs, shutting down factories and eliminating jobs. Its divestiture last year of its Green Giant unit cut sales growth by 3 percentage points. Foreign currency issues adversely impacted revenue growth by 4 points.Meanwhile, PepsiCo rival Coca-Cola (KO) will announce Q1 results on Wednesday before markets open. The Atlanta-based company is expected to report earnings of 44 cents a share, down 8.3% from a year earlier. Revenue is expected to fall 4% to $10.3 billion.Image provided by Shutterstock.

110,GIS,"No, it ain’t fish eggs. Instead, ROE means return on equity -- or more accurately, return on shareholders' equity.The gauge divides a company’s full-year net income by its shareholders' equity, then multiplies by 100 to get a percentage figure. IBD takes the average equity over the past two years. The result expresses how much profit it can generate for every dollar of net assets. IBD research into past big market winners shows a ratio of 17% or more as positive. Single-digit ratios could be cause for concern.ROE is a rough gauge for how efficiently management is putting capital to use and how its profitability is keeping pace with its growth as a publicly traded company.  As a company's equity grows, so does the challenge to maintain a high ROE. Earnings per share is another measure that weighs in on this question of ownership vs. profitability. But ROE does not take the number of shares into account.Where do you find it? Get a stock quote by using the search box at the top right corner of Investors.com. Under Stock/Company Data, you will find Annual ROE in the Company Fundamentals column. In addition, the minicharts presented with IBD’s Big Cap 20, Your Weekly Review and IBD 50 include ROE.Some companies often borrow debt to invest in new products and services to drive more profit. As a result, companies with high ROE sometimes also have somewhat elevated levels of debt.So as you perform your stock research, look at peer companies and compare their debt and ROE levels. If a target stock has a higher than group average ROE, and its debt is moderately higher, the two could be related.To be sure, a high ROE doesn’t compensate for unhealthy levels of debt. A long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 100% or more is considered high, even in certain industries known for heavy capital spending.If a stock has a low ROE (single digits and/or well below its group average) and very high debt, it could be a cause for concern.There is also a relationship between profit margins and return on equity. In some cases, you might allow for a below-peer ROE, if the company is churning out top-notch annual pretax margins. In general, annual pretax margin of 17% or higher is a sign of fundamental strength. You also want to see if a company's pretax margin is among the best in its industry.The average return on equity among current IBD 50 stocks is 28.4%. At the high end of the scale among companies that have thus far reported 2015 results, Campbell Soup (CPB) shows an unusually strong return on equity of 52.3%.That is well above peers like J.M. Smucker (SJM), with ROE of 7.2%, and even much larger players such as Kellogg (K), General Mills (GIS) and Kraft Heinz (KHC).Campbell’s pretax margins, 13.1% in fiscal 2015, are in line with these other food giants. Its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 185% is certainly on the high side. It helps boost Campbell's ROE above a company like Smucker, which shows a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 84%.

112,GIS,"Thurgood Marshall seemed unlikely to become a successful civil rights lawyer.A hell-raiser at his Baltimore high school, he was punished by being forced to read the U.S. Constitution. It made him think about becoming an attorney after he graduated in 1925.But he wasn’t yet serious, getting suspended for pranks twice at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania before receiving a bachelor’s degree.The all-white University of Maryland law school rejected him. So he attended all-black Howard University in Washington, D.C., a year before it was accredited. He graduated first in his class in 1933 and opened an office in Baltimore.Soon an African-American was lynched, and Marshall would be thrown into the center of the civil rights storm.“He had to think positive throughout his entire career,” Wil Haygood, author of “Showdown: Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court Nomination That Changed America,” told IBD. “Everywhere he went in the 1930s to (the) 1950s as the civil rights attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the judicial deck was stacked against him at the local level. His only option was to appeal cases to the U.S. Supreme Court after each setback. He argued 32 cases before it, winning an astonishing 29.”In 1967, after a bitter confirmation battle in the Senate, Marshall became the first black justice of the Supreme Court.Marshall (1908-93) was born in Baltimore, where both sets of grandparents owned grocery stores. His father wanted to be independent of them and worked as a waiter, so money was usually tight.He moved the family to Harlem and five years later left New York and returned to Maryland.In elementary school, he did so well that he was skipped a grade.“Marshall was born into a family of articulate and assertive people,” wrote Larry Gibson in “Young Thurgood: The Making of a Supreme Court Justice.” “His father led vigorous dinner table discussions about current events and challenged his sons to support their positions with sound information. His mother spoke with polished diction and was determined that her sons would go to college and professional schools. With several aunts and uncles also providing guidance, the extended family expected him to succeed.”In the ninth grade, Marshall joined the high school debate club, directed by his history teacher, who taught him how to make persuasive arguments.At Lincoln University, he became the first freshman invited onto the debate team, and his skills grew as the group competed with the nation’s best at other colleges.Before going to law school in 1929, Marshall married fellow student Vivien Burey. They had no children by the time she died in 1955. Soon thereafter, he married NAACP secretary Cecilia Suyat. They had two sons who also became high achievers.At Howard, Marshall was mentored by the dean, Charles Houston. The young man finally became interested in civil rights in his last semester, when Houston asked him to research a case for the NAACP.After graduation in June 1933, Marshall and Houston took a road trip to New Orleans to document differences between black and white schools.
"
113,GIS,"Marshall then returned to Baltimore to open his private practice in October. He one of only 34 black attorneys in Maryland out of 2,700.“The range and quality of clients Marshall acquired as a beginning lawyer in the Great Depression suggest that, if he had chosen to build a fee-producing law practice, he could have earned a very comfortable living,” wrote Gibson. Instead, he took the lower-income but more fulfilling civil rights cases. “He had developed work habits, attitudes and personal traits that would characterize his legal career. Colleagues marveled at his almost superhuman capacity to work long days for weeks and months without breaks.”Marshall developed the skills to talk with all types of people and listen to everyone as an equal.He was also able to disarm tense situations with wit and charm.Setbacks in his first civil rights cases involving criminal defense and discrimination by a college didn’t discourage him. He had his first victory (and sweet revenge) in 1935, when he joined Houston to win an NAACP lawsuit to integrate the University of Maryland law school. (Its new library in 1980 was named after Marshall).In 1936 the NAACP hired him as assistant special counsel in New York City, and his crusade began.In 1940 Marshall founded and directed the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund.In 1944 he successfully argued a case before the Supreme Court that outlawed whites-only Democratic primaries.The same year, the highest court agreed that discrimination in housing based on race was illegal.After an initial effort to integrate graduate schools failed, Marshall’s court victory in 1950 led to opening them to black students.The next year, Marshall went to Japan and South Korea to investigate complaints of discrimination in military courts. His report on the problem led to reduced sentences for black GIs.Then came 1954.In his most far-reaching case at the Supreme Court -- Brown v. Board of Education -- Marshall challenged the Topeka, Kan., school board’s policy of having “separate but equal” facilities for whites and blacks.A majority agreed that separate schools were inherently unequal.“His victory in Brown stands as a singular, monumental achievement unmatched in its scope and social impact,” wrote Michael Davis and Hunter Clark in “Thurgood Marshall: Warrior at the Bar, Rebel on the Bench.”In 1961, President John Kennedy appointed Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals covering New York, Vermont and Connecticut.Over the next four years, Marshall wrote 150 opinions, including some protecting individuals from illegal search and seizure, and upholding the importance of not being retried on the same charges after an acquittal.In 1965 he became solicitor general, the nation’s highest-ranking lawyer, the first black to hold the position. Over the next two years, he won 14 of his 19 cases.Marshall was on the rise -- all the way to the Supreme Court, where in 1967 he landed President Lyndon Johnson’s nomination.Segregationists on the Senate Judiciary Committee put Marshall through five days of grueling hearings.“By the start of the third day, he had already been subjected to more questioning than any other nominee in history but kept his composure and didn’t allow himself to be drawn into controversial statements,” said Haygood. “For most African Americans in the first half of the 20th century, it was inconceivable that someone of their race would reach the Supreme Court in their lifetimes, but the Senate finally confirmed Marshall 69 to 11. The oath was administered by Justice Hugo Black, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan.“Marshall would remain unerringly true to his belief in equality and the First Amendment throughout his career.”Over the next 24 years, Marshall sided with the majority in some cases of affirmative action and busing, but few decisions dealt directly with race.Marshall made important contributions in other areas:A majority joined him to affirm that a plaintiff could have a jury trial in a lawsuit against a labor union.He formulated the standard of what evidence is considered relevant in financial securities cases.He argued that savings and loans were permitted to deduct losses from mortgage investments.He persuaded the other justices that mentally ill death row inmates were entitled to have a psychiatrist’s help in their appeals.As the court became more conservative, Marshall wrote more dissenting opinions, with a career total of 1,800, and earned respect for being principled.When Marshall retired in 1991, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Republican from Utah, said, “I don’t know of anyone on the bench who has had a more profound effect on American jurisprudence.”President George H.W. Bush nominated another African-American, Clarence Thomas, to replace Marshall.“No matter what direction the fight for equality now takes, it is clear all Americans have benefited from Marshall’s contribution to the nation’s democracy, not just the country’s black citizens,” wrote Davis and Hunter in 1992. “He used his legal talents to support the rights of the powerless and to make ‘equal protection of the laws’ more than just an idealistic legal phrase.”On July Fourth that year, Marshall accepted the Liberty Medal, given to those who have shown leadership in pursuit of “liberty of conscience or freedom from oppression, ignorance and deprivation.”Poland’s president, Lech Walesa, had been the first honoree.Though Marshall was in a wheelchair, his voice was fiery: “The battle has not been won; we have barely begun. ... America has no choice but to do better to assure justice for all Americans, Afro and white, rich and poor, educated and illiterate. Our futures are bound together.”He died the next January at 84.First black Supreme Court justice.Overcame: Strong opposition to his confirmation.Lesson: Practice keeping cool before getting grilled.“None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. We got here because somebody ... bent down and helped us pick up our boots.”
"
114,GIS,"Ernie Pyle was the pre-eminent war correspondent of his era. He rose to such heights through clarity of prose and an appreciation for the struggles faced by American soldiers during World War II.By writing with jarring detail, Pyle brought the war home to readers through his column, which ran six days a week via the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance.“Ernie Pyle always wrote about what he could see,” Owen Johnson, associate professor emeritus at Indiana University and editor of “At Home With Ernie Pyle,” told IBD. “He called it ‘the worm’s-eye view.’ What he could see from where he was, that’s what he was going to write about. Pyle’s column grasped what one might call the simple but complicated essence of what war is about.”Pyle’s reporting in Europe, in particular, brought him great acclaim. He did it while putting himself at such risk that he died on the battlefield.What he left behind were stories of soldiers who would otherwise have remained anonymous.“There was always that connection with Ernie,” said Ray Boomhower, author of “The Soldier’s Friend: A Life of Ernie Pyle.” “Readers truly felt they could trust him and rely upon him.”Born near Dana, Ind., Ernest Taylor Pyle (1900-45) was the only child of Will and Maria Pyle.According to James Tobin in “Ernie Pyle’s War: America’s Eyewitness to World War II,” Will struggled as a farmer and with Maria “passed on decency and compassion, sensitivity toward others and a capacity for hard work.”Ernie had no desire to be a farmer. What he had was wanderlust and an attraction to more dramatic career pursuits.After a brief stint in the Navy Reserve, Pyle enrolled at Indiana University “with a single suitcase and an aimless ambition,” wrote Tobin.While on the Bloomington campus, Pyle developed his interest in journalism. He became editor in chief of the Indiana Daily Student before withdrawing one semester short of graduation to write for a small-town newspaper in the state.That impatience continued. “When he tired of his routine,” wrote Tobin, “he would just leave,” leaping to trips across the country and jumping from job to job.By 1923, Pyle was in the nation’s capital writing for the Washington Daily News. Things were looking up, especially when he landed a column covering aviation.In Pyle’s aviation writing, as in his later war reporting, he trumpeted the common man’s exploits.“Ernie made a specialty out of telling tales of the mail pilots’ feats of bravery and improvisation,” making them into “miniature narratives,” wrote Tobin.Pyle was gaining widespread recognition as a travel reporter.“His trademark topics were drawn from the concrete stuff of everyday life,” noted Tobin. “He studied unknown people doing extraordinary things.”For example, he wrote of an Alabama man who loved ancient history so much that he built -- and lived in -- a replica Roman temple.Pyle continued writing about his travel exploits until 1942. By then he was also reporting on the war, including the Nazi blitz of London while there in 1940. His wartime writing intensified after America’s entry in December 1941.“Pyle’s experiences profiling ordinary people in his aviation and travel reporting laid the foundation for his writing about ordinary soldiers during World War II,” said Boomhower.Pyle made his momentous mark with newspaper pieces about the war in Europe as a roving reporter for Scripps-Howard from 1942 through 1944.In his most famous column, “The Death of Captain Waskow” in January 1944, Pyle described the discovery of the body of a beloved Army officer, as well as other soldiers’ reactions:“Then the first man squatted down, and he reached down and took the dead hand, and he sat there for a full five minutes, holding the dead hand in his own and looking intently into the dead face, and he never uttered a sound all the time he sat there.”The Waskow column emphasized despair, love, camaraderie and resolve.Also, said Johnson: “The column was about dying, but Pyle’s writing put a personal face on it. It further showed how soldiers both dwelled on death and had to make their peace with it, and yet they went on fighting.“For me, one of the crucial elements is that, at the end of the column, after they had paid their homage to Captain Waskow, Pyle wrote: ‘We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep.’ ”Such prose was a Pyle hallmark. “He wrote the way one would write a letter,” said Johnson.In “Killing Is All That Matters” from December 1942, Pyle wrote: “The last of the comforts are gone. From now on you sleep in bedrolls under little tents. You wash whenever and wherever you can.”In “The God-Damned Infantry” in May 1943, he spelled it out: “Every line and sag of their bodies speaks their inhuman exhaustion.”His artistry especially glowed as Britain took German air assaults: “It was a night when London was ringed and stabbed with fire.”Tobin lauds Pyle for having “a keen ear for harmonies,” wrestling with word choice and cadence.“By 1942,” said Tobin, “he had become a master craftsman of short prose and simultaneously shaped a mythic role for himself: an American Everyman ready for war.”Pyle’s personal struggles made his reporting particularly challenging. He endured depression, exacerbated by the stress of wartime. Also, his wife, Geraldine, suffered from bipolar disorder. They had no children.Even so, Pyle was a voluminous writer, and his wartime columns now make up four volumes.By focusing on soldiers at war, Pyle endeared himself to his readers.“He put the spotlight more on the subjects he wrote about than himself,” said Boomhower. “He was humble. Readers gravitated toward him because he was not someone who liked to boast about himself or put himself above anyone else. His reporting reflected his upbringing here in Indiana.”Pyle’s focus on the day-to-day lives of GIs meant he rarely wrote about the politics of the war itself.His emphasis was connecting readers and the troops.“Pyle had a great respect for his subjects,” said Boomhower. “He never tried to hold anyone up to ridicule. He respected the individual and their story, which I think is lacking with some writers today.”In developing what Tobin describes as “a strange and inextricably intimate” bond with his readers, Pyle became one of the most famous Americans of his time.He was invited to meet with first lady Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House in November 1943, appeared on the cover of Time magazine in July 17, 1944, and was portrayed by Burgess Meredith in the 1945 movie “The Story of G.I. Joe.”Also in the thick of WWII, Pyle received the Pulitzer Prize for correspondence in 1944.“Readers trusted Pyle because he was honest,” said Johnson. “It was almost as if he had a video camera in his head. He told things the way they were.”After a break to recover from the stresses of war and to care for his wife, Pyle resumed his reporting in the Pacific Theater early in 1945.After surviving close calls, Pyle was killed on Iejima Island, part of Okinawa, Japan, on April 18, 1945, when Japanese machine gun fire hit him below the helmet. He was buried on the spot.Upon Pyle’s death, President Truman said: “No man in this war has so well told the story of the American fighting man as American fighting men wanted it told. He deserves the gratitude of all his countrymen.”The building housing the journalism school at Indiana University is named Ernie Pyle Hall.He retains an esteemed place in journalism history because of the quality of his writing and his integrity as a reporter, said Boomhower: “Pyle’s writings have stood up exceptionally well with time. There have been a lot of pretenders over the years, but there is really no one quite like Ernie.”Renowned correspondent of World War II.Overcame: Battlefield danger.Lesson: Act humbly and put the spotlight on others.“The drama and romance are here, of course, but they’re like the famous falling tree in the forest -- they’re no good unless there’s somebody around to hear.”

115,GIS,"As far as most income investors are concerned, the steadier the payout the better. An added bonus: a high dividend growth rate. Here are five Dividend Leaders that offer both, as well as a yield that's well above the S&P 500's average 2.08% payout.All five score a Dividend Stability Factor of 1 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile) on a three- to five-year basis.
"
116,GIS,"Philip Morris International (PM), which pays a 4.6% annual dividend, tops the list based on that measure. Its long-term dividend growth rate is 11%. The Marlboro maker on Dec. 9 boosted its quarterly payout by 20% to $1.02 a share, or $4.08 for the year.Analysts expect the tobacco firm's earnings to decline for a second straight year in 2015, before rising 5% next year. The stock is below a 90.18 flat-base buy point. It's up about 7% year to date, vs. the S&P 500's 2% loss.Pfizer (PFE), which also made the Friday column featuring high-yield drug stocks, is second, with an annualized payout of 3.7%. Like Philip Morris, its dividend growth rate is 11%. The stock is still below its 10-week and 40-week lines as it consolidates.General Mills (GIS) also has a long-term dividend growth rate of 11%. The cereal maker on Thursday announced a 33% increase in its quarterly payout to 44 cents a share. That works out to $1.76 on a full-year basis, for a 3.1% yield.The company also reported quarterly results that day that missed views on both the top and bottom lines. Shares fell 3% Thursday but found support at the 200-day moving average. The stock, up about 8% year to date, has been consolidating since early August.Coca-Cola (KO), which also pays a 3.1% annual dividend, has a long-term dividend growth rate of 9%. The beverage giant is an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat — companies that have increased their dividends each year for the past 25 years — and a top Warren Buffett holding. Shares are slightly positive this year.

117,GIS,"Recent consumer IPOs were a more fitness-focused bunch than those of years past and have largely outperformed new-issue cohorts, offering a clue into who the hot newcomers may be when the current IPO chill starts to gradually thaw.Of the 15 consumer companies that went public in 2015, over half of them were tied -- directly or indirectly -- to the health and wellness trend. The Class of 2015 included fitness tracker maker Fitbit (FIT), gym operator Planet Fitness (PLNT) and SkinnyPop popcorn maker Amplify Snack Brands (BETR).“If you add fast-casual to your list, a lot of these have a focus on health,” said Kathleen Smith, co-founder of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “It resonates. Some of it is that the younger people realize they’re going to live longer and if you’re going to live longer you’ve got to be healthy and eat well and exercise.”Next up could be SoulCycle, an upscale spin-studio operator with a celebrity following. The prospective IPO, a popular choice for hipsters and workout junkies looking for an Instagrammable workout, most recently took its rave-like studio classes to SXSW, hosting ""cardio parties"" in partnership with Spotify.Even Fido’s in on it. July IPO Blue Buffalo (BUFF), which makes natural dog and cat food, is an extension of the consumer demand for more health-conscious, less-processed fare. And on the tech side, Mindbody (MB) went public last June with its class-booking and appointment-scheduling software for gyms and spas.One could even include the outdoorsy Duluth Trading (DLTH), a clothing company that caters to the “modern, self-reliant American” with plaid shirts and waterproof cargo pants for those who live a “hands-on lifestyle.”As more companies sprout from the soil of demand for health-conscious products, many of them tap the IPO market to fund growth, said Smith. That includes Shake Shack (SHAK), the fast-casual purveyor of antibiotic-free and hormone-free Angus burgers that went public at the start of 2015, and David’s Tea (DTEA), the Canadian chain that offers over 150 types of tea -- and not a single espresso drink.While a number of them are trading below their IPO prices, their performance has outpaced that of last year's new issues.Of the 170 companies that went public in 2015, the average return has been a 19.6% decline as of Monday's close, according to Renaissance Capital. But shares of the 15 consumer IPOs from last year, which includes all of the above names except Mindbody, have experienced a collective rise of about 1.1%.Planet Fitness, which went public at 16 last August, is up 18% from the market's low point of Feb. 11 this year to 15.60 by Monday's close. Amplify, which priced at 18 less than a year ago, has rebounded 44% from Feb. 11 to 13.60. Blue Buffalo has leapt 60% to 24.77, above its initial offering of 20 a share.That compares to the S&P 500's 11% rise in the same period. And investors have shown an eagerness to hop on board, though not all stocks have been cooperating with hopes for a fitter future.Within a few months of trading, Shake Shack’s stock more than quadrupled to a high of 96.75, and Fitbit more than doubled from its initial offering price. But they collapsed soon after that. Shake Shack lost two-thirds of its value and Fitbit three-fourths. Both are essentially flat since Feb. 11.“The investor interest is very high in fitness (and) healthy eating, but I think people struggle with exactly how to play the trend, as it is really relatively broad-based,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton, who covers Planet Fitness, Amplify and other consumer stocks.Plus, recent market volatility has put a damper on enthusiasm for privately owned businesses looking to take to the market. Only seven companies have gone public this year, said Renaissance Capital's Smith, vs. 28 during the same time frame in 2015.SoulCycle filed last July to go public but has yet to start trading. The company declined to comment, as it remains in a quiet period.“I think, overall, (SoulCycle has) performed rather well,"" said Smith. ""It’s not like there isn’t competition in this area.""The New York City-based chain raked in $112 million in 2014 revenue from its 38 locations, growing sales by nearly 49% from the prior year.But if the current market rally continues, the window for IPO issuance might be on the verge of reopening, after closing in December.Smith predicts that investors will see a trickle of companies ready to start trading sometime in April. With it might come names like SoulCycle or Honest Company, the baby and home product company founded by actress Jessica Alba.“When the market opens up, it will not be a tsunami wave of IPOs,” said Smith. ""(It will be) slow, steady, below-average.""She expects that health care, technology and consumer companies will likely lead the new-issue market this year, with a similar health-bent possibly flowing throughout.""The SoulCycles and Honest Companies -- we'll see more of it,"" she said.

118,GIS,"Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) has snared iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as a customer for its Google Cloud Platform, a deal that could help Google's service catch up with industry leader Amazon.com (AMZN), says an industry note from Pacific Crest Securities on Thursday.Amazon unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now the biggest provider of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where customers rent computer servers and data storage systems via the Internet. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's Google rank next.Apple signed a contract worth between $400 million and $600 million to use Google's Cloud Platform, according to CRN. Apple now uses cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, but intends to end its reliance on all its rivals in the next few years, as it builds its own data centers, according to Re/Code.While Apple has reportedly used AWS historically for iCloud, ""the more surprising shift is from Apple to Google, which are odd bedfellows given the two companies' mudslinging and competition in other areas,"" wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson. ""Did Google throw in free cloud as a way to renegotiate the search contract? Definitely adds to the perception of Google's momentum,"" Wilson added.The deal has not been confirmed by Google or Apple, but Apple did disclose its reliance on AWS and on Microsoft's Azure in a 2014 white paper.The alleged Apple-Google accord would help ""Google Cloud Platform catch up to Amazon and Microsoft -- at least in terms of perception -- as a real third player in the space instead of a distant third. Google has done similar deals with Snapchat, PricewaterhouseCoopers, General Mills (GIS) Coca-Cola (KO), HTC and Best Buy (BBY),"" said Wilson.In total, the cloud opportunity is big enough for all three Internet powerhouses, said Wilson, who estimated ""a potential $25 billion windfall opportunity in cloud services for Amazon, Microsoft and Google, collectively.""While AWS has been the biggest IaaS price-cutter of the last decade, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has been aggressive since moving into the market. Google slashed prices in March 2014, October 2014 and May-June 2015, Goldman analyst Heather Bellini said in an industry report last month.Goldman Sachs says that the top three service providers are gaining share as Verizon Communications (VZ),  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and others exit the public IaaS market and focus on private clouds.Goldman Sachs estimates that AWS' revenue will hit $12.5 billion in 2016, up from $7.88 billion last year.Apple stock was down a fraction in midday trading in the stock market today, near 106.

"
170,GIS,"Felix ""Doc"" Blanchard was on a training mission over England in 1959 when it happened: The oil line in his F-100 ruptured, engulfing the plane in smoke and flames.Ordered to follow protocol and eject, Blanchard, with a village beneath him, refused.Instead, he took the burning plane in for a safe landing away from the town, then fled the flames.""I've never run so fast,"" he said.That's saying something.Just 13 years earlier, Blanchard (1924-2009) ran to fame on the Army football team, forming with Glenn Davis perhaps the most celebrated backfield in college history on the era's No. 1 powerhouse.Blanchard and Davis were consensus All-Americas in 1944, '45 and '46 — the only three-time All-America backfield teammates.They won the Heisman Trophy in successive years: Blanchard in 1945, Davis in '46.Into The End ZoneIn 1945 alone, they scored 37 touchdowns — 19 by Blanchard, 18 by Davis — in nine games.During their three seasons together, Army went 27-0-1 and won two consensus national titles.While the 208-pound Blanchard was pounding up the middle, Davis was outrunning defenders down the sideline, inspiring a New York sportswriter to call the pair Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside.""Blanchard could run a 10-second 100-yard dash, and he probably weighed the equivalent of most linemen at the time,"" Kent Stephens, curator of the College Football Hall of Fame, told IBD. ""He also played linebacker, punted and kicked off, and was a shot putter. He was an iconic figure.""Laurels and statistics don't fully explain Blanchard and Davis' full impact on America in the war-torn 1940s. In a time when the country was desperate for sports heroes, they fit their roles perfectly as West Point football stars.Their faces appeared on the covers of Time and Life magazines.Their exploits were shown on newsreels.Their games were broadcast to servicemen across the globe.They even played themselves in a 1947 Hollywood biopic, ""The Spirit of West Point.""""Everybody knew Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside,"" said Conrad Crane, a former professor of history at West Point and an author on military matters. ""Everybody followed the team, everyone listened to Army games on the radio. Army was dominating everybody on the football field — it was a metaphor for how the war itself should go. Army was America's team. They boosted everyone.""Soldiers, too. When German troops launched a desperate counterattack during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, American GIs identified themselves in the Nazi-infiltrated woods by whispering ""Blanchard.""If the man headed their way was a fellow American soldier, he replied, ""Davis.""The Wild Blue YonderBlanchard could've written his ticket after football — business, PR, coaching. Instead he became an Air Force fighter pilot and went on to fly a maze of combat missions in the Korean and Vietnam wars.He retired in 1971 as a colonel, then spent several years as the commandant of cadets at the New Mexico Military Institute.""He had the world at his feet,"" Crane said. ""And he decides to serve his country with a full military career.""Blanchard grew up in Bishopville, S.C., the son of a country physician who had played fullback at Tulane. Doc's mother, Mary, was first cousin to Jim Tatum, head coach at North Carolina, Oklahoma and Maryland.By the time Doc — his nickname because of his dad — was 3, he was kicking the ball on the front lawn of the Blanchard home.When he 12, his dad predicted he'd be a better running back than the great Bronko Nagurski, a star at the time for the Chicago Bears.Doc was built like Nagurski.He already weighed 180 pounds in his early teens, when his parents sent him to prep school at St. Stanislaus College on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, 40 miles outside New Orleans.After a sensational high school career, he played a year at North Carolina for Tatum, then tried to enter the Navy's officer training program during World War II.Rejected because of poor vision, Blanchard joined the Army as a private before securing an appointment to West Point in July 1944.Lean Machine""Doc Blanchard was the best-built athlete I ever saw: 6 feet and 208 pounds at his peak, not a suspicion of fat on him, with slim waist, Atlas shoulders, colossal legs,"" Army coach Red Blaik wrote in his memoir, ""You Have to Pay the Price.""Blanchard was hardly a household name prior to Army's 1944 game against Notre Dame.After the Black Knights' 59-0 triumph at Yankee Stadium — the worst loss in Fighting Irish history — he was front-page news. ""I've just seen Superman in the flesh,"" Ed McKeever, the Notre Dame coach, wired back to South Bend, Ind. ""He wears Number 35 and goes by the name of Blanchard.""Blanchard had no time to celebrate. Coming up was a date with dreaded rival Navy to decide the national championship.Spotting a chance to boost a war-weary nation, President Franklin Roosevelt requested that the game be moved from Annapolis, Md., to Baltimore as part of a war bond drive. The deal: Buy a war bond, get a ticket. Seventy thousand fans responded by flooding into Municipal Stadium for what was billed the Game of the Century. Legions of soldiers tuned into short-wave sets in Europe and the South Pacific.""We came into that game, and it seemed like the whole country was either in the Army or Navy or knew and cared about someone who was,"" Blanchard said in Bill Pennington's book ""The Heisman."" ""It was one of the times when a game just felt like more than a game.""At the start of the fourth quarter, Navy trailed 9-7 but was on the move. Davis, playing safety in those two-way days, intercepted a pass, and Blanchard led Army on a nine-play, 52-yard scoring drive.Cresting Against NavyHe carried the ball seven times, accounted for all but four of the team's yards and ran over three Navy defenders for the touchdown. Army headed home with a 23-7 win and the national title.Gen. Douglas MacArthur fired off a cablegram from his Pacific base to Blaik: ""The greatest of all Army teams — STOP — We have stopped the war to celebrate your magnificent success. MacArthur.""Blanchard finished third in the Heisman voting that year, behind Ohio State's Les Horvath, the winner, and Davis.Blanchard's 1945 season was even better.Now a junior, he rushed for 722 yards, averaged a remarkable 7.1 yards per carry, scored 17 touchdowns, caught four passes for 166 yards and capped his season by scoring three touchdowns in a 32-13 victory over Navy.It didn't end there for the junior. He also was the national shot-put champion and a sub-10-second sprinter in the 100-yard dash.""It was amazing a man that big could run that fast,"" Crane said.To almost nobody's surprise, Blanchard became the first junior to win the Heisman Trophy and the first football player to win the Sullivan Award, given to the country's top college athlete.Blanchard's bid to win back-to-back Heismans ended when he tore knee ligaments in the 1946 opener against Villanova.He missed only two games and played the rest of the season at about 60%, according to Blaik.Blanchard still ran for 613 yards and 10 touchdowns, and finished fifth in the Heisman voting, with Davis capturing the trophy.""We tried to complement each other and really weren't competing,"" Blanchard said soon before his death at age 84. ""You've just got to be the right kind of people with the right kind of interests. If you're interested in the welfare of the team, you don't have that problem.""Man In BlueIn 1947 he graduated from West Point and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the brand-new Air Force.

172,GIS,"Jonas Salk stopped polio cold with the first effective vaccine. In 1954, cases numbered 38,968 and the public feared the paralyzing disease more than anything except nuclear war.
"
173,GIS,"Then came the exciting announcement on April 12, 1955.
"
174,GIS,"The Salk vaccine had been used in the largest medical experiment in history and had been proved to prevent polio.
"
175,GIS,"The quiet researcher became a huge figure overnight, and that made colleagues jealous.
"
176,GIS,"They refused to accept that his approach, using a killed virus given by shots, would provide long-term immunity.
"
177,GIS,"After 1962, the Sabin oral vaccine, using a live virus, became the preferred method until it was recalled due to risks in 1999.
"
178,GIS,"""The prevention of poliomyelitis remains Salk's greatest achievement,"" Charlotte Jacobs, author of ""Jonas Salk: A Life,"" told IBD. ""In the long run, many of his ideas about vaccination were adopted, but during his lifetime he had to be very determined and persistent to achieve his goals against so much resistance to innovation.""
"
179,GIS,"New York Rise
"
180,GIS,"Salk (1914-95) was born into a Jewish family in East Harlem, N.Y.
"
181,GIS,"Two years later, 7,000 Americans died of poliomyelitis, which caused paralysis in many survivors. This epidemic was overlooked because of the hundreds of thousands dying in World War I.
"
182,GIS,"On top of that, 20 million died worldwide from influenza in 1918, and the polio threat was forgotten.
"
183,GIS,"Salk skipped grades and entered the City College of New York at 15, graduating with a degree in chemistry in 1934. He then enrolled in medical school at New York University, but with no intention of becoming a doctor.
"
184,GIS,"He wanted to be a medical researcher, inspired to help mankind after reading about French chemist Louis Pasteur, who developed vaccines for rabies and anthrax.
"
185,GIS,"After Salk's freshman year, he took off for a year to do research and teach biochemistry, then returned to classes and clinical rotations.
"
186,GIS,"In 1936, his first paper was published in a medical journal, he graduated and he married Donna Lindsay.
"
187,GIS,"Their three sons would receive medical degrees and help their father in research. However, preoccupation with his work resulted in a divorce in 1968, and two years later he married artist Francoise Gilot.
"
188,GIS,"As his residency at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York was ending in 1941, Salk applied to do research on viruses at the University of Michigan under renowned virologist Thomas Francis. As World War II raged, Francis got Salk an exemption from the draft in 1942 for critical medical research.
"
189,GIS,"The duo developed a killed-virus vaccine against strains of flu. That meant it would stimulate the body's immune reaction without being as dangerous as a live virus.
"
190,GIS,"Few scientists believed it would confer long-term immunity, but then came stronger proof: Some 12,500 soldiers were given a test inoculation in late 1943, and it was so successful that two years later the Army mandated vaccinations for 8 million GIs. This reduced the rate of flu infection by 92% compared with the civilian population.
"
191,GIS,"By 30, Salk had proved that the killed virus provided long-term immunity from the flu.
"
192,GIS,"But he found that scientific arguments were not enough to convince skeptics among leading virologists. They resisted his method of increasing vaccine effectiveness by adding adjuvants — chemical agents that allowed using smaller doses of the virus, which would eventually become accepted.
"
193,GIS,"""Despite the attacks on his reputation by others in the field, which would only increase throughout his career, he never struck back in anger and, at least in public, remained calm, a trait that would win admirers among the small group of scientists who supported his innovations,"" said Jacobs. ""He was politely tenacious and believed that, in the end, he only had to answer to himself.""
"
194,GIS,"In 1947, two years after the war ended, Salk became director of the virus lab at the University of Pittsburgh, with more than a 50% salary increase to $7,500 (the equivalent of $80,000 now). But he soon found that his freedom to research what he wanted was restricted and he lacked adequate funding.
"
195,GIS,"Then Harry Weaver visited. He was the head of research for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, founded in 1938 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the world's most famous polio victim, and later renamed the March of Dimes after its fundraising efforts.
"
196,GIS,"""In 1939, a comparatively modest 7,343 people in the U.S. had contracted polio,"" wrote Jeffrey Kluger in ""Splendid Solution: Jonas Salk and the Conquest of Polio."" ""In 1946, a staggering 25,698 Americans had been sickened by polio, nearly double the 1945 total and the most in 26 years. No part of the country was spared.""
"
197,GIS,"Salk agreed to work for the NFIP on the monotonous task of determining what the different polio viruses were. Funds from Weaver's foundation began to flow to the lab, letting him hire other researchers.
"
198,GIS,"Help On The Way
"
199,GIS,"A key moment came in September 1951, when Salk presented their findings at an international conference. He predicted a vaccine would be available in five years.
"
200,GIS,"""There was nobody like him in those days,"" Weaver recalled. ""He thought big. ... He was out of phase with the tradition of narrowing research down to one or two details, making progress inch by inch. He wanted to leap, not crawl.""
"
201,GIS,"Salk mobilized a veritable army, rolling out a field trial of his vaccine in 1954-55 involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 40,000 nurses, 64,000 school staff, 220,000 volunteers and 1.8 million children.
"
202,GIS,"The result inspired the country.
"
203,GIS,"Salk had many offers for a movie made about his life after the April 1955 unveiling, which showed that the unvaccinated, who had been given a placebo, were 3.3 times likelier to contract polio.
"
204,GIS,"But a few weeks later, some officials blamed the vaccine for causing polio in some areas. It turned out that one of the manufacturers had a flawed process, but it gave critics ammo to discredit Salk.
"
205,GIS,"Regardless, the Salk vaccine worked. By the summer of 1957, 100 million doses had been distributed throughout America, out of a population of 179 million. Polio cases plummeted to 6,000 by the end of the year, and other countries were also getting healthier.
"
206,GIS,"Meanwhile, Dr. Albert Sabin developed an oral vaccine using a live virus. That was adopted by the Soviet Union and a few other countries and did a number on polio with the first 4.5 million patients by 1959.
"
207,GIS,"More Avenues
"
208,GIS,"By 1962, the cheaper cost and easier use of the oral version had made it more popular in the U.S., too.
"
209,GIS,"""Salk brought the polio caseload down to 1,000, and it took Sabin to carry the baton the rest of the way,"" wrote Kluger. ""Or so it seemed. The Salk vaccine had only been in use for seven years before Sabin's was introduced and was on a glide path. ... (But) the biggest misgiving about the live formulation (that it risked causing polio) appeared to be well-founded.""
"
210,GIS,"Salk decided to think bigger. In 1962 he opened the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., rallying top researchers to see what would result from the collaboration. Among them were five who received or would land the Nobel Prize, including the co-discoverer of DNA, Francis Crick, and leading nuclear physicist Leo Szilard.
"
211,GIS,"Salk started projects to find cures for cancer, multiple sclerosis and influenza, but wasn't able to raise sufficient funds to finish them.
"
212,GIS,"He also found that he wasn't a solid manager of day-to-day operations, preferring to cede control while he did research. Financial problems led to his ouster in 1984.
"
213,GIS,"His attention was soon captured by the epidemic of AIDS, which by the end of 1985 had been contracted by 23,000 Americans, 11,000 of whom had died.
"
214,GIS,"One of the world's top AIDS researchers, American Robert Gallo, visited Salk to seek his advice. Salk found himself mediating a dispute between Gallo and Frenchman Luc Montagnier over who had discovered the AIDS virus.
"
215,GIS,"In April 1987, after two years of negotiation, President Reagan and French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac announced that Gallo and Montagnier would be recognized as co-discoverers, with joint ownership of the blood-test patent.

224,GIS,"General Mills (GIS) has increased its dividend six times in the past five years as the packaged-food giant adapts to a growing market for healthier foods.The latest increase took effect early this month, when the Minneapolis, Minn.-based company boosted its quarterly payout by 3 cents, or 7%, to 44 cents per share.The long-term dividend growth rate is 11%, among the highest in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen. The annualized payout of $1.76 a share yields 3% at the current share price, well above the S&P 500 average of 1.9%.The maker of products under brands such as Cheerios, Pillsbury and Betty Crocker boasts that it has paid a dividend for 116 straight years.The stock is getting support at its 50-day line as it works on a flat base with a possible 57.83 buy point.General Mills appears to be having success in trimming costs and broadening its product line to meet rising demand for natural and organic products.But in a setback, earlier this year Target (TGT) reportedly told General Mills and other suppliers that it would reduce the amount of money and effort it devotes to promoting products such as canned soup and packaged cereals.General Mills has responded to changes in tastes with its 2012 purchase of Yoplait yogurt and the purchase last year of organic food maker Annie's Homegrown.

225,GIS,"Campbell Soup (CPB) shares warmed up on Friday after the food company topped fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates and gave slightly optimistic full-year guidance despite currency headwinds.Earnings came in flat at 62 cents a share in Q3, above a Thomson Reuters analyst poll by 10 cents. Campbell, like other food giants, continued cost-cutting efforts and curbed promotions. Gross margin rose to 35.9% from 34.3% a year earlier.Revenue fell 3.6% to $1.9 billion, just below expectations for $1.93 billion, due to currency fluctuations and the impact of retailer inventory movements on its U.S. soup business, the company said. It was the second straight year-over-year sales decline and the worst drop in nearly three years.For the full year, Campbell expects revenue to fall closer to the lower end of its prior guidance for -1% to 1%. Analysts have calculated sales to drop 1.7%.Campbell sees full-year earnings closer to the favorable end of its range of $2.32-$2.38 a share, while Wall St. has estimated $2.35 vs. last year's $2.53.Shares climbed 1.8% to 47.78 in the stock market today intraday. Shares are nearing a 48.40 buy point from a flat base.Campbell has an IBD Composite Rating of 55 out of 99, meaning its shares outperform 55% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors. Some of those factors are earnings and sales growth, return on equity, profit margins and relative price performance.WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), which was spun off from Dean Foods (DF) in 2012, leads the Food-Packaged industry group with a 93 Composite Rating. Earlier this month, WhiteWave, the maker of Silk nondairy milk and Earthbound Farms salads, reported Q1 earnings that topped views and sales that met views.WhiteWave's results were also affected by the strong dollar.

226,GIS,"At 93, Ed Shames is the last living officer of Easy Company, the ""Band of Brothers"" immortalized by the 2001 HBO TV series about World War II.
"
227,GIS,"Serving initially in the Army's Item Company, 3rd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, he was dropped behind enemy lines on D-Day, June 6, 1944.
"
228,GIS,"Over the next week, they fought fierce Nazi resistance around Carentan, a rail center between the Americans coming in from Utah Beach and those who landed at Omaha Beach.
"
229,GIS,"Victory came on June 13, his 22nd birthday, and he was given the battalion's first battlefield promotion, to second lieutenant.
"
230,GIS,"""If we'd lost, the Germans would have probably pushed us back into the sea,"" Shames told IBD from Virginia Beach, Va., his home with Ida, his wife of 69 years.
"
231,GIS,"Ian Gardner, author of ""Airborne: The Combat Story of Ed Shames of Easy Company,"" wrote: ""Carentan was where Ed's fighting reputation was established, and from the 101st Airborne perspective it was one of the most important and decisive engagements of its entire Normandy campaign.""
"
232,GIS,"Aiming Straight
"
233,GIS,"Shames was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Virginia Beach in 1922. His father and mother owned a grocery store, but Dad died when Ed was 5. Left with a Smith & Wesson pistol, Ed became a crack shot in the woods.
"
234,GIS,"At 19, he was attending the Steam Engineering School in Norfolk, hoping to become a naval engineer, when the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
"
235,GIS,"Reading in the paper about a new volunteer force in the Army's experiment with parachuting infantry, he joined and began training at Camp Toccoa, Ga.
"
236,GIS,"The 506th PIR arrived in England in September 1943 for further preparation, and Shames became the operations sergeant for the 3rd Battalion's commander, Col. Lee Wolverton.
"
237,GIS,"On June 5, 1944, at 11:30 p.m., the air armada took off for Normandy ahead of the invasion.
"
238,GIS,"The cloud cover required the Allied planes to stay low and slow, resulting in many being shot down.
"
239,GIS,"In the chaos of landing, Shames learned from other paratroops that Wolverton and much of I Company had died in two crashes, so he was attached to H Company.
"
240,GIS,"""German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel had ordered Carentan defended 'to the last man,'"" wrote Stephen Ambrose in ""Band of Brothers."" ""The country around it was full of very dense hedges at least 6 feet tall on either side of narrow lanes. This was about as bad a place to launch an infantry assault as could be imagined, as bad as clearing out a town house by house, as bad as attacking a World War I trench system.
"
241,GIS,"""Little progress could be made toward Cherbourg, the largest port in Normandy and a major strategic objective, until the bottleneck at Carentan had been broken.""
"
242,GIS,"After initial fighting and heavy Allied bombing of the town, Shames' 3rd Battalion moved in from the north on June 13 through hedged fields. His H Company came under heavy fire when he realized F Company was not on the right to protect the flank, having been driven back. After close calls, he made it to regimental headquarters to alert the brass. ""Without a doubt, his quick thinking helped to change the outcome of the battle,"" wrote Gardner.
"
243,GIS,"Fighting for H Company occurred on a sunken road — Bloody Gully — then 502nd PIR tanks rolled to the rescue. A bullet had taken out a piece of Shames' nose, but he taped it up and fought on.
"
244,GIS,"Carentan was the last battle in Normandy. The 506th PIR had taken 983 casualties, 50% of the total of all regiments in the campaign, with the 3rd Battalion the hardest hit. The GIs were sent to England for recuperation and training, with Shames reassigned to the 2nd Battalion as an intelligence officer.
"
245,GIS,"On Sept. 17, Shames and the 506th PIR landed near Eindhoven, Holland, as part of Operation Market Garden, involving 40,000 other U.S. and British paratroopers. Allied commanders thought the enemy would collapse, opening the way into northern Germany.
"
246,GIS,"Instead, the Nazis regrouped and counterattacked, making it daunting for the Allies to hold the bridges and roads essential to moving men through a marshy country covered by rivers and dikes.
"
247,GIS,"Shames spent much of his time working with the Dutch underground on reconnaissance missions. The Allies began withdrawing eight days after the drop, having suffered 17,000 casualties.
"
248,GIS,"On Oct. 2, the 506th PIR trekked toward ""the Island,"" an area below sea level with 7-foot dikes near Arnhem. After artillery duels and assaults, the front line settled into a stalemate while Shames, shot in the left leg, went to the hospital.
"
249,GIS,"In a few days he took over the 40-man 3rd Platoon of Easy Company. ""We all had nicknames and mine was SOB — Son of the Battalion — because I was tough,"" said Shames. ""I was a perfectionist and never satisfied.""

"
273,GIS,"Shames says he can't elaborate, but said, ""I've had an amazing life.""At 93, Ed Shames is the last living officer of Easy Company, the ""Band of Brothers"" immortalized by the 2001 HBO TV series about World War II.Serving initially in the Army's Item Company, 3rd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, he was dropped behind enemy lines on D-Day, June 6, 1944.Over the next week, they fought fierce Nazi resistance around Carentan, a rail center between the Americans coming in from Utah Beach and those who landed at Omaha Beach.Victory came on June 13, his 22nd birthday, and he was given the battalion's first battlefield promotion, to second lieutenant.""If we'd lost, the Germans would have probably pushed us back into the sea,"" Shames told IBD from Virginia Beach, Va., his home with Ida, his wife of 69 years.Ian Gardner, author of ""Airborne: The Combat Story of Ed Shames of Easy Company,"" wrote: ""Carentan was where Ed's fighting reputation was established, and from the 101st Airborne perspective it was one of the most important and decisive engagements of its entire Normandy campaign.""Aiming StraightShames was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Virginia Beach in 1922. His father and mother owned a grocery store, but Dad died when Ed was 5. Left with a Smith & Wesson pistol, Ed became a crack shot in the woods.At 19, he was attending the Steam Engineering School in Norfolk, hoping to become a naval engineer, when the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.Reading in the paper about a new volunteer force in the Army's experiment with parachuting infantry, he joined and began training at Camp Toccoa, Ga.The 506th PIR arrived in England in September 1943 for further preparation, and Shames became the operations sergeant for the 3rd Battalion's commander, Col. Lee Wolverton.On June 5, 1944, at 11:30 p.m., the air armada took off for Normandy ahead of the invasion.The cloud cover required the Allied planes to stay low and slow, resulting in many being shot down.In the chaos of landing, Shames learned from other paratroops that Wolverton and much of I Company had died in two crashes, so he was attached to H Company.""German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel had ordered Carentan defended 'to the last man,'"" wrote Stephen Ambrose in ""Band of Brothers."" ""The country around it was full of very dense hedges at least 6 feet tall on either side of narrow lanes. This was about as bad a place to launch an infantry assault as could be imagined, as bad as clearing out a town house by house, as bad as attacking a World War I trench system.""Little progress could be made toward Cherbourg, the largest port in Normandy and a major strategic objective, until the bottleneck at Carentan had been broken.""After initial fighting and heavy Allied bombing of the town, Shames' 3rd Battalion moved in from the north on June 13 through hedged fields. His H Company came under heavy fire when he realized F Company was not on the right to protect the flank, having been driven back. After close calls, he made it to regimental headquarters to alert the brass. ""Without a doubt, his quick thinking helped to change the outcome of the battle,"" wrote Gardner.Fighting for H Company occurred on a sunken road — Bloody Gully — then 502nd PIR tanks rolled to the rescue. A bullet had taken out a piece of Shames' nose, but he taped it up and fought on.Carentan was the last battle in Normandy. The 506th PIR had taken 983 casualties, 50% of the total of all regiments in the campaign, with the 3rd Battalion the hardest hit. The GIs were sent to England for recuperation and training, with Shames reassigned to the 2nd Battalion as an intelligence officer.On Sept. 17, Shames and the 506th PIR landed near Eindhoven, Holland, as part of Operation Market Garden, involving 40,000 other U.S. and British paratroopers. Allied commanders thought the enemy would collapse, opening the way into northern Germany.Instead, the Nazis regrouped and counterattacked, making it daunting for the Allies to hold the bridges and roads essential to moving men through a marshy country covered by rivers and dikes.Shames spent much of his time working with the Dutch underground on reconnaissance missions. The Allies began withdrawing eight days after the drop, having suffered 17,000 casualties.On Oct. 2, the 506th PIR trekked toward ""the Island,"" an area below sea level with 7-foot dikes near Arnhem. After artillery duels and assaults, the front line settled into a stalemate while Shames, shot in the left leg, went to the hospital.In a few days he took over the 40-man 3rd Platoon of Easy Company. ""We all had nicknames and mine was SOB — Son of the Battalion — because I was tough,"" said Shames. ""I was a perfectionist and never satisfied.""Easy Does ItHe and Easy Company now had new orders: Help rescue a stranded group of 149 British troops, Dutch fighters and Americans.On the night of Oct. 22-23, Operation Pegasus managed to evacuate all of them to the Allied side of a river without casualties.Hitler launched his last great offensive on the Western Front on Dec. 16, through the heavily forested Ardennes region of Belgium, Luxembourg and France.

"
274,GIS,"Dave Thomas had a simple goal as he grew up: own a restaurant. He exceeded that by a multiple of 6,000, building that many Wendy's eateries in 30 years of operation.""When Wendy's began in 1969, I saw the chance to have perhaps three or four restaurants in the Columbus, Ohio, area,"" he wrote. ""When we built those and they worked, the company grew, and more opportunities opened up. Opportunity never knocked, but it was all around us. You just had to see it.""The empire that Thomas built led to a Wendy's (WEN) stock that's still hot, rising 300% since 2008.Rex David Thomas (1932-2002) formed his vision of Wendy's early.""In 1940, at the age of 8, I dreamed I would one day own the best restaurant in the world,"" he wrote in his 1992 book, ""Dave's Way."" ""All of the customers would love my food, and all of my employees would do everything they were supposed to do. But, most important, everyone would think I was a good boss, and every day when I walked into the restaurant, people would be glad to see me.""Cooking Up A CourseWhen he was in 10th grade, he wrote an essay on ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" noting:""After I finish school, I want to join the Army for a while and be a cook. In this way, I will get more experience. I will have my education and my Army experience. I will be all set to start the pursuit of happiness with a restaurant of my own.""Dave didn't finish high school in Fort Wayne, Ind. Aside from that, he said, ""I achieved it all. My plan wasn't fancy, but it was all I needed.""His rise wasn't easy. He never knew his birth mother. His adoptive mother died when he was 5.""Her name was Auleva, and she died of rheumatic fever,"" Dave wrote. ""I really don't remember her, what she looked like or how she treated me. But I do remember she was very sick, and when she died it scared me to be around so many people because I wasn't used to strangers. We never had any visitors at our house, and I wasn't sure how I was supposed to act.""His adoptive dad, Rex, ""was a hard worker, and honest,"" he wrote. ""But as far as being a father, he didn't have the time or the inclination.""Despite moving often, Dave didn't lack for guardian angels. His adoptive mother's mom was his earliest champion. ""When my (adoptive) mother's casket was lowered into the ground, it bothered me a lot,"" he wrote. ""My adoptive grandmother, Minnie Sinclair, explained my mother had gone to heaven where she would watch over me.""While in grade school, Dave spent summers on Minnie's Michigan farm. ""She was born and raised in the hills of Kentucky,"" Dave wrote. ""She had so little, but she made so much out of it. She believed that if you worked hard, you made things happen.""Minnie raised four children by herself after her husband was killed in a railroad work accident. ""I took whatever work I could find after Grandpa died,"" she told Dave. ""I knew the Lord would provide. All of my children grew up to be fine people.""Minnie had a strong sense of fun, making shopping and eating out an adventure. She was also tough. ""She taught me you could be strict but show you cared at the same time,"" noted Thomas. ""Minnie was a motivator. If you did the right thing, she could make you feel 10 feet tall and very, very special.""Minnie taught Dave not to cut corners — a hallmark of Wendy's, with its top-of-the-line square burgers.""Quality's everything,"" she told him. ""Remember that. If people keep cutting corners, this country's going to be in big trouble.""With this firm foundation, Dave took solid principles to his professional life. At 12, he dived into the food arena, delivering groceries.He gained early experience in his chosen restaurant field, always building on what he learned. By 15, he was ready for business, staying behind in Fort Wayne to work at the Hobby House restaurant while his family moved away.""What I did is not something I'd recommend to any kid today,"" he wrote. ""I was ... working 50 hours a week, minimum, still in Fort Wayne Central High School and living at the Y. It wasn't much longer until I quit school. My real vocation was the restaurant business.""Phil Clauss, the Hobby House owner, was the next crucial Dave mentor. ""He was a hard worker and an innovator who believed in progress and change,"" Thomas wrote. ""His personal instinct for taking care of the customer was so strong. Whatever he did got attention. If he was doing pancakes, he was the best pancake maker you ever met. Phil was also the kind of guy who said, 'If I can do it, anyone can do it.' I used to try to match hour to hour with him.""Army And KFCWhile working at Hobby House, Thomas enlisted as a cook in the Army. The work at his base in Germany from 1950 to 1953 bored him, and he yearned to be an entrepreneur. His roommate managed the enlisted men's club, and the two brainstormed ways to improve the establishment's food. When Dave's suggestions were hits with the GIs, his roommate tagged him for an assistant manager spot.In the early 1960s, Thomas and Clauss shifted into higher gear by investing in Harlan Sanders' Kentucky Fried Chicken.Thomas also worked as a regional manager for KFC. Then, after leaving the chicken chain in the late 1960s, he invested in a firm called National Diversified, a restaurant holding company that asked him to turn around a losing unit, Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips, which he did. Such experience sparked his interest in starting his own outfit.Thomas ""was never satisfied with the status quo,"" Michael Seid, a franchising consultant who was Dave's co-author in ""Franchising for Dummies,"" told IBD. ""Innovations that were introduced at Wendy's have changed the way the quick-service restaurant industry functions today. For example, the single line at Wendy's is called a snake. Dave invented it, and other restaurant chains copied it.""While with KFC, Thomas and Clauss boosted marketing operations, developing the meal in a bucket and unique signage: lighting up the bucket on a pole. ""Dave created his initial nest egg as a franchisee of Kentucky Fried Chicken,"" said Seid. ""He even wore the white suit like Colonel Sanders.""Upbeat OutlookThomas knew that eateries were a people business. ""You can tell if a restaurant is excited about having customers come in,"" he wrote. ""You can also read the enthusiasm on the customers' faces. A restaurant team that is upbeat and disciplined has a real effect on customers.""When Thomas got out of the Army, he went back to work for Clauss — as a manager and the go-to problem solver.Thomas ""was a serial entrepreneur before he began Wendy's,"" said Seid. ""He had a lifetime of achievements before he was 35.""By the mid-1960s, Thomas was in charge of an underperforming group of Clauss' KFC units. He turned them around, then sold his stake to Sanders for $1.5 million.Thomas' heart, soul and stomach were in Wendy's — named for his daughter. His ardor partly explains why he was its public face and voice for years. Dave starred in the company's TV commercials in the 1980s and 1990s.""The genius of Wendy's inserting Dave Thomas, its founder, into its advertising was that Dave was a man of virtue and integrity,"" said Geoffrey Precourt, an editor at Warc, an advertising, marketing and media news service. ""He's a guy who could be your next door neighbor or the stranger who offers to help you carry your groceries to your car. He's so likable — and even before there were online Likes, favorability was critical to building brand loyalty.... When television became the focal point of households, personality became an integral part of branding. Just as Clara Peller humorously reminded us that Wendy's had a meatier product (with her 'Where's the beef?' line), so did Dave Thomas give us the notion that fast food could be comfort food. ... (Dave was) one of those CEOs like (Chrysler's) Lee Iacocca or (chicken man) Frank Perdue who could carry a brand.""Dave never forgot his roots. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush urge him to put his marketing skills behind a national adoption effort.From that came the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption to help children find a permanent family.And that high school diploma? Thomas landed it in 1993, then founded the Dave Thomas Education Center in Coconut Creek, Fla., to hike GED skills.

275,GIS,"In 1968, Mark Spitz promised his fans that he would bring home no fewer than six gold medals from the Mexico City Olympics. Instead, the swashbuckling swimmer took silver in the 100-meter butterfly, bronze in the 100-meter freestyle and two gold medals in his team relay events.Meanwhile, he came in last in the 200-meter butterfly and didn't win any solo race.His take? He could do better.""I considered myself a failure,"" Spitz, now 65, told IBD from his home in Los Angeles.Still, he knew that worrying about drowned dreams was a waste of time. So he focused his goggles on 1972 and the Munich Games.Making a serious splash in Germany, Mark the Shark sliced through the water with unstoppable force.The 22-year-old's first contest: The 200-meter butterfly, the same race that choked him in '68.""He didn't just win,"" wrote biographer Richard Foster. ""He demolished the field and the record.""The Shiny SevenOver the next few days, Spitz latched onto more golds: in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly and 100-meter freestyle.He also swam in relay events for three more golds.With those seven medals, he was the most victorious Olympian at a single venue, passing the record of five held by previous athletes.Spitz held his distinction for 36 years, until fellow American Michael Phelps swam to eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games.The poster of 6-foot-tall Spitz wearing all seven of those medals, beaming with his moustache, sinewy torso, and stars and stripes swimsuit, sold a million copies — and he got a decent cut of the sales.He was on course as a founding father of athletic endorsement. He's pitched Bausch & Lomb, General Motors (GM), General Mills (GIS) and other brands, most recently the tour company Windstar Cruises.He's worth about $20 million, according to ForbesNetWorth.com.""As it's happening, you have no clue you are pioneering anything,"" he said. ""You are out there, relentlessly taking risks and trying to expand, capturing success either from the training that you have had or the tenacity that you are gaining.""Sports Illustrated named Spitz Athlete of the 20th Century in water sports, reflecting what dominated the Munich scene — until the slaughter. Just hours after he won his seventh gold, Palestinian terrorists kidnapped and murdered 11 Israeli Olympic team members.The Munich Massacre still haunts him. ""It was a terrible tragedy,"" he said.Terrifying, too. As a Jew, he was smuggled out of the Olympic village in a blanket for his safety. Though the Games continued, he wasn't around for the closing ceremonies.Spitz traveled to Israel a couple of years later to meet with the families of the fallen athletes and coaches. They talked about the spirit of the Olympics.With its emphasis on hard work, self-discipline and the champion's mindset, they agreed, the Games trump the evils of terrorism.Spitz was born in 1950 in Modesto, Calif., the oldest of three children to Arnold Spitz, a World War II gunner and scrap metal expert, and his wife, Lenore, a homemaker. Arnold was intense. Lenore was practical and charming. Both put family at the center of their midcentury lives.Mark was 2 when Arnold moved the family to Honolulu.Lenore later recalled that little Mark ran headlong toward the ocean the first time he saw it, as if he sensed his Aquaman destiny.The Spitzes had two more kids, Heidi and Nancy, in Hawaii before they moved back to California when Mark was 6.That summer, Lenore took the kids to the Sacramento YMCA to keep them occupied. Soon enough, Mark was on the Y swim team.Fatherly AdviceSpitz had what it took: long arms, scooping hands and well-balanced legs. He also had a powerful cheering squad. From the time he was a tadpole, Dad made it clear:Victory, or go home.""Swimming isn't everything,"" he told young Mark. ""Winning is.""That chutzpah propelled Mark to wake at dawn six days a week, 11 months a year, churning mile upon mile in chilly water.Out of the pool, he scarfed food to replace the calories he burned.Those who saw the Kid Wonder knew he was something spectacular. ""He almost lifted himself out of the pool to pass his opponents,"" coach Sherm Chavoor later wrote in ""The 50-Meter Jungle."" ""He has had the ability to do that all his life. It's a natural, inborn talent to extend himself beyond all physical endurance when the time comes. When I saw him do it in that obscure little meet for little kids back in 1960, there was no longer any doubt in my mind. I knew even then that I had a great one.""Chavoor became Spitz's longtime mentor when the boy was 9.When Spitz was 14, he went up the coast to train with coach George Haines in Santa Clara, but Chavoor stayed close.Today, Spitz believes that practice and a stellar mental attitude are more important than talent when it comes to reaching the top.Work hard early in your career, he advises, and you'll stand out.""People who are successful have a real wide base,"" he said. ""Most people build a base like an inverted pyramid. They've got a tiny starting point the size of a dollar bill. And they are expecting, when they get to the top, an acre of knowledge. There is no stability to this concept.""Springboarding From MexicoLeading up to the 1968 Olympics, 18-year-old Spitz looked good in the pool. Yet in Mexico, Chavoor later reported, the teen's mental game was off — and Spitz fretted about a chronic sore throat.To win consistently on the world stage, Chavoor knew, Spitz had to banish bad thoughts. ""Swimming is such an individual effort that once a competitor has doubts, he can't win,"" the coach stressed.Spitz did win, but not as much as he and many thought he should.After those Mexico City Games, Spitz headed to the University of Indiana. Hoosier swim coach Doc Counsilman rallied his team to support one another and build unity.That made a big difference for Spitz, who blossomed. ""He became more interested in working out with the group. He was no longer a loner,"" Chavoor recalled.Spitz schooled himself in the dreaded butterfly, lurching through laps to the point of exhaustion. ""It doesn't matter if you swim it slow or fast,"" he said. ""It beats you up.""Spitz knew he also needed a whale-sized goal to stay inspired.So he vowed to capture those record seven golds.Going into the Munich Games, he believed, he had to win his first event convincingly.He nailed it. ""The relief of that first gold medal was so great that if I had quit then and there, I would have considered my years of hard work worth it,"" Spitz said.Back home after the Olympics, he was eating a bologna sandwich and planning his departure for dental school when the phone rang.It was Bob Hope.""Back in the day, Bob Hope was as big as there was,"" said Evan Morgenstein, Spitz's agent.So Spitz got a sense of his star potential — and did something about it. Instead of dental school, he'd develop his brand, marry Suzy Weiner in 1973 and raise two sons.It's still panning out.""He has a shelf life that goes beyond the Olympics,"" Morgenstein said. ""He is still considered one of the greatest Olympians of all time.""

300,GIS,"Packaged-foods company ConAgra Foods (CAG) lowered its fourth-quarter earnings estimate due to weak appetites for private-label brands and a slide in its consumer-foods segment.Guidance is now set at 55 cents per share vs. its earlier view of ""slightly in excess"" of 60 cents a share. Analysts expect 62 cents.The Omaha-based company attributed the outlook cut to a 7% quarterly volume decline in the consumer-foods segment and weak profits in the private-label unit.But lowering guidance has become common practice for ConAgra, said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash in a research note. The company previously lowered its near-term earnings outlook back in February, again reflecting weaknesses in its consumer-foods and private-label segments.""I can't recall any other major packaged food firms repeatedly lowering guidance quarter-after-quarter of late,"" said Lash in an email to IBD.Shares of ConAgra sank 8% on the stock market today. Rivals Kraft (KRFT) and General Mills (GIS) both dipped 0.2%.ConAgra acquired Ralcorp Holdings at the end of 2012, making it the biggest private-brand packaged-food business in North America by sales. But it will take time to fully integrate the new takeover.Lash said she sees the Ralcorp acquisition favorably since it will strengthen ConAgra's relationship with retailers, ""but incremental product innovation and marketing support investments for its brands and private-label will be needed to put it on more stable ground.""ConAgra has a slew of household names in its pantry. Its consumer-foods segment includes brands such as Bertolli, Orville Redenbacher's, Hebrew National, Slim Jim and Hunt's. Chef Boyardee was singled out by the company as one of the retail brands that is primarily proving to have profit challenges.And Q4 operating profit for private-label brands is expected to decrease by about $60 million, said the company. The segment's issues were noted in March, when it blamed below-expected profitability on ""sales force and supply chain transition issues, as well as pricing actions implemented in response to competitive pressure.""The company will report Q4 earnings on June 26.""We've long held a more conservative stance on ConAgra's prospects, given it operates with a portfolio of second- and third-tier brands and its profitability pales in comparison to peers (10% versus high-teens operating margins),"" said Lash in the research note. ""However, this revision is even more dire than we expected, and we plan to lower our near-term profit outlook.""

309,GIS,"Omar Bradley knew who scaled history's heights on D-Day. ""No soldier in my command,"" wrote the general after overseeing the Army at the Normandy invasion of June 6, 1944, ""has ever been wished a more difficult task than that which befell the 34-year-old commander of the Provisional Ranger Force.""That commander? Earl Rudder.When Bradley sought a man of steel to lead men up the cliff of Pointe du Hoc and nail the Nazis, he turned to the tenacious Texan.Lt. Col. Rudder came through. His triumph high above the Normandy coast helped D-Day deck the Germans from the west as the Russians rushed from the east — and in 11 months World War II in Europe was over.""Pure leadership,"" Patrick O'Donnell, author of ""Dog Company,"" told IBD. ""He was a leader of men. He had mental toughness. He was determined. It was in his DNA. And to think the whole operation might not have succeeded if he had not been there.""Douglas Brinkley, author of ""The Boys of Pointe Du Hoc,"" put it this way: ""James Rudder was the best of the U.S. military tradition. As an officer, he was one with his men. He was the perfect leader.""This was a man who went on a suicide mission, and it's one of the most remarkable stories of World War II. He told his men they had a 50% chance of making it alive. And when his superiors told him not to go himself, he insisted. No way would he send them on that mission and not put his own life on the line.""GroundedThomas Hatfield, author of ""Rudder: From Leader to Legend,"" also raves: ""He was simply an authentic person who had a calling in his life. He was very purposeful, with values that were as firm as was his character. He was one of the greatest citizen soldiers. The greatest, of course, was George Washington, who left the Army after the Revolution and returned to farming. Rudder was a reservist. He didn't make the Army a career. He wanted to return to civilian life for two reasons: an attachment to his mother and an attachment to Texas, to ranching. He was a man of the soil.""When Rudder retired from the Army Reserve in 1967, while president of Texas A&M; University, he was a major general whose top decoration was the Distinguished Service Cross, a military award second only to the Medal of Honor.His men never forgot.Rudder was ""one of the greatest men that ever lived,"" said Pvt. Jack Keating, one of the 2nd Ranger Battalion GIs who hit Pointe du Hoc.Heroic 1st Lt. Dutch Vermeer said that seeing Rudder ""control the operation saved our day on Pointe du Hoc. In spite of his wounds, he was in command all the time.""Star Ranger Leonard Lomell said: ""He inspired you to do your best. You just wanted to die for him.""Rudder almost died on that day 71 years ago. He was wounded twice at the Pointe, once by a bullet in his calf, and minutes later when an explosion fired cement fragments into his chest and arm.Meanwhile, as Rudder's Rangers ran into a Nazi gantlet above the coast of France, ""he had to cope with the unknown,"" said Hatfield. ""He and his men were cut off, isolated. They had no communication with commanders at sea. They didn't know the outcome of the invasion. Yet Rudder was steadfast without knowing when relief was coming. He remained calm, a dedicated leader. Some of his men told me they were better soldiers with him than at other times. That's because he was consistent, whatever the circumstances. He was always the same, authentic leader — and with him, his men knew the mission came first.""James Earl Rudder (1910-70) developed his traits growing up poor in tiny Eden in central Texas.""The family was stoic, and he became a man who was not easily ruffled,"" said Hatfield, who witnessed that character while with the Army Reserve in the 1960s. ""He was also extraordinarily competitive.""Rudder played football well enough in high school to get a ticket out of isolated Eden to play at John Tarleton Agricultural College, a few hours north in Stephenville. And play he did. Other than football, he had little use for the junior college (now four-year Tarleton State University) and quit.Yet he returned, completed two years and vaulted to Texas A&M;, where he landed a bachelor's degree in industrial education.The Depression kept him from pursuing his career for a year, but in the fall of 1933 he hooked up as a football coach and teacher of history and math in Brady, just east of Eden. ""He was a very conscientious teacher. And he made no compromises with his football players,"" said Hatfield. ""In fact, he was more demanding of them. The main thing was preparation. He lived in the future. He did not think about the past. That all carried over to Pointe du Hoc.""Rudder had been commissioned an officer in the Army Reserve out of A&M;, and by 1937 he was married to Margaret Williamson and on the way to having five children.With America gearing up for WWII, he entered active duty in June 1941 and rose to major in July 1943 upon taking over the 2nd Ranger Battalion, then was promoted to lieutenant colonel that November. He put his men through the wringer of assault training at various U.S. bases.At the start, his men ""were a disaster,"" said O'Donnell. ""They couldn't do parade formation or much else. But Rudder the football coach turned them into a unit obsessed with winning. It all emanates from Rudder. He turned raw recruits into soldiers who could act on their own initiative and change the course of a battle.""By early 1944, Rudder was in England and received details of the mission. In May, wrote Brinkley, he ""laid out the plan for his men. . . . The Rangers' task: climb the cliffs and destroy the Nazi concrete bunkers 4 miles west of Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast. The Nazis had a battery of six 155 mm guns, with a range of 14 miles, on top of the Pointe between Utah and Omaha beaches aimed at the boats and men storming in. From their jutting crow's nest, the Germans could inflict great damage to the Allies' armada of over 5,000 ships.""Added Brinkley: ""To neutralize these enemy guns, this elite group of about 225 2nd Ranger Battalion volunteers — Rudder's Rangers — had to surprise the enemy by scaling the 100-foot-tall promontory, even while under a barrage of Nazi fire coming from a concrete observation post. It was a daunting assignment.""To say the least. One naval officer said flatly, ""It can't be done. Three old women with brooms could keep the Rangers from climbing those cliffs.""Said O'Donnell: ""It was definitely one of the most dangerous missions of World War II and American history. The Rangers had to fight through a 'Guns of Navarone'-like fortress atop the cliff filled with bunkers, tunnels and artillery, and machine gun nests.""After crossing the English Channel, Rudder wasted little time, noted Brinkley: ""Setting a fearless example for his men, (he) was on the first (assault craft) to land. . . . He raced to the cliff and established a small headquarters in a cave.""The charge was made deadlier by the Nazis' MG 42, a savage machine gun called the Bonesaw. Rudder and his men still ascended with rope hung from hooks shot up the Pointe.Stratospheric ResultsAfter reaching the top — bombed by Allied planes that ""turned it into something resembling the surface of the moon,"" said O'Donnell — the GIs followed tire tracks to the Nazi guns and used thermite grenades to disable them.""The cliff climbing was tough enough,"" said O'Donnell. ""The German counterattack the night of June 6 and the next day made it all the more difficult. First, the Americans ran out of ammo, so they had to use German guns. Then some of Rudder's men were taken prisoner.""Rudder forged on with his next order: cutting the road between Utah and Omaha beaches.""By June 8,"" wrote Brinkley, ""the Americans were victorious at the Battle of Pointe du Hoc, raising the Stars and Stripes on the promontory. They had suffered 70% casualties. Yet their mission had been a military success.""

311,GIS,"Army Col. James Van Fleet led his men on D-Day, but they landed at the wrong place on Utah Beach. ""As commander of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Division, he had learned to seize opportunities where he could, so he made the decision to move forward, leading from the front,"" Michael Haskew, author of ""West Point 1915: Eisenhower, Bradley and the Class the Stars Fell On,"" told IBD. ""He had overcome obstacles by sheer perseverance throughout his career that would have thwarted individuals of lesser constitution, taking the action he could wherever he was.""Belatedly recognized for his leadership, he ended World War II as a major general.The next year, 1946, President Truman sent him to Greece to help the government defeat communist insurgents.Then in 1951, as a lieutenant general, he commanded Allied troops that routed North Korean and Chinese communists and was awarded the rank of full general.""General Van Fleet is the greatest general we have ever had,"" said Truman. ""I sent him to Greece and he won the war. I sent him to Korea and he won the war.""Van Fleet (1892-1992) was born in Fort Lee, N.J., soon before his family moved to Bartow, Fla., when he was still an infant.To The PointHe entered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1911, but was a slow reader who didn't have good study habits. He wrote to his father, saying he should probably drop out, but was encouraged to persevere. He told himself, ""I can take it,"" a lesson he never forgot.He graduated in 1915 as a second lieutenant, among 36% of his class of 164 who were destined to become generals. Included were Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, who would receive five stars, and three would get four, one of them the late-bloomer Van Fleet.During leave on Christmas Day, Van Fleet married Helen Moore in Carnegie, Pa., and they would have two daughters and a son.After moving around the country as an instructor in the run-up to WWI, he joined the 16th Machine Gun Battalion of the 6th Division as it set sail for France in July 1918.First Lt. Van Fleet was soon in the trenches, and in November — the month the war ended — was wounded by a bomb.He returned home in June 1919.Van Fleet rose to major the next year and taught military leadership at Kansas State. Then he did the same at the University of Florida while coaching the football team to winning seasons in 1923 and 1924.By 1927 he was at Fort Benning, Ga., where Lt. Col. George Marshall was innovating infantry tactics.Van Fleet rose to lieutenant colonel in 1936 while training reserves in San Diego. Three years later the Nazis invaded Poland, so he was called back to Fort Benning to command 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, which would demonstrate tactics to other units.In June 1941, Van Fleet assumed the rank of colonel and took over the 8th Infantry Regiment.""Many of his classmates had been rapidly promoted, and it was alleged that the reason for his career stagnation was that Marshall, who was named Army chief of staff in 1939, had confused him with an alcoholic officer with a similar name,"" said Steve Taaffe, author of ""Marshall and His Generals."" ""Instead of becoming bitter and despondent, though, Van Fleet focused on the task at hand, even if it was beneath his talents. Generals Eisenhower, Bradley and Joe Lawton Collins were said to have eventually cleared up the matter with Marshall.""On June 6, 1944, at 4 a.m., the 8th Regiment was headed for the wrong landing point in the chaos of the invasion of Normandy, France, with Van Fleet initially behind in a command ship.""After more than three years of training and planning, it was the first to make an amphibious landing on Utah Beach,"" wrote Paul Braim in ""The Will to Win: The Life of General James A. Van Fleet."" ""The lessons learned would save lives, and then-Capt. George Mabry, remembering his moment of trial after retirement as a major general with a Medal of Honor, said Van Fleet was 'the best leader I have ever encountered, and I've encountered a lot of them.'""Van Fleet joined his men on the beach and led them deeper into Normandy. His jeep roamed the front line over the next four days, and he was slightly wounded.Bradley was astounded at what he saw and gave Van Fleet his first of three Distinguished Service Crosses, the military's second highest award, on the spot.The regiment continued to lead the division in fierce fighting over the next two weeks that ended with the capture of Cherbourg.""He worked hard to gain intimate knowledge of his unit's personnel and operation, studying and analyzing not only the manpower, firepower and terrain under his control, but the same features for the enemy,"" said Keith Huxen, senior research director at the National WW2 Museum in New Orleans. ""He knew that he would be successful if he mastered these details.""A StarIn August, Van Fleet became a brigadier general, and in October took over the 90th Division, which had lagged at Normandy.He promptly made the outfit live up to its nickname, the Tough Ombres. Recalled one of its GIs, ""He acted as if he expected success, and he got it.""In November, the same month Van Fleet was made major general, the retrained 90th had its first big test in an assault across the Moselle River toward Germany.His men took heavy casualties the first three days, then pushed the enemy back. ""Swiftness, mobility, unrelenting attack — these were Van Fleet's principles, in football as in war,"" wrote Braim. ""He would regard the Moselle campaign as his finest hour.""The 90th pursued the retreating Germans to the Siegfried Line near the Saar River, where the defensive barrier of the border of Germany was most highly developed.The Americans made a surprise attack in December and, despite strong resistance, pushed inland, capturing many prisoners.Just then, the 90th rushed north to counter the German offensive that was the Battle of the Bulge.In March 1945, Bradley urgently ordered Van Fleet to take over III Corps, which had just crossed the Rhine River at Remagen, Germany, the first major unit to do so.By mid-April, Van Fleet had directed III Corps' encirclement of the industrial heartland of the Ruhr Valley and captured over 100,000 prisoners. The Nazi high command surrendered on May 7.All Over The MapVan Fleet arrived home in June and took over the 2nd Service Command in New York City. The unit involved the Army Reserve.In February 1948, Truman promoted him to lieutenant general and put him in charge of helping the Greek government defeat the insurgency backed by the Soviet Union. Starting with a poorly armed and badly led force, Van Fleet oversaw $300 million in aid, equipment and training, and by 1950 his Greeks had triumphed.Van Fleet returned to Washington and helped the Army prepare a response to the North Korean invasion of the South in June 1950.In September, Gen. Douglas MacArthur's U.S. and U.N. troops pushed back the communists and captured the North's capital.But in November, the Chinese army poured over the border, and the Allies were forced back into South Korea. Then came a political thunderstorm, with MacArthur criticizing the American strategy in public in March 1951 and Truman replacing him with Gen. Matthew Ridgway, commander of the 8th Army, the main U.S. force.Van Fleet was rushed to take over the 8th in April, and a week later a communist force of 700,000 struck. He directed a tactical withdrawal and blunted the offensive, inflicting 70,000 casualties.The 8th then pushed the communists north of the border, inflicting an additional 200,000 casualties.In July 1951, Van Fleet received his fourth star. Peace talks started the same month, but fighting continued.The next April, his son, a B-26 bomber pilot, was shot down over North Korea and died.The general left for home in early 1953 and retired. The armistice was signed that July.Van Fleet lived to 100 and died at his ranch near Polk City, Fla.

""He attended Youngstown State for a couple of semesters, but his grades weren't great, so he took a break. Four months later, in April 1969, he was drafted into the Army, and while we were concerned about his safety, we were very proud that he felt he was doing his duty. Because our family had barely escaped when the Russians came into Hungary, we thought it was important that communism be kept from spreading.

""He never complained and was a good soldier. But the hero came out in battle when he protected his brothers.""George talked with others in his platoon: ""They said he wasn't one of those rah-rah guys, but he'd volunteer for the most hazardous missions and led on point for two months, so it's a miracle he survived as long as he did. When he was getting ready for battle, he went through a ritual of tying a bandana on his head and focusing, and everyone could see the transformation into a true warrior and knew he had their backs.""For years, the North Vietnamese army had staged attacks on South Vietnam from Cambodia, knowing that it was U.S. policy to respect that country's official neutrality.Finally, President Nixon ordered a counteroffensive. U.S. and South Vietnam forces hit the North Vietnam Army (NVA) in Cambodia during the spring of 1970.The northern thrust was in the Se San Valley to disrupt the use of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to bring down supplies from North Vietnam.In The Thick Of ItOperation Binh Tay — meaning ""tame the west"" — borrowed Sabo's 506th Regiment (from the 101st Airborne Division), based near the border between North and South Vietnam, and put it under control of the 4th Infantry Division to spearhead its wing of the mission.The 506th was nicknamed the Currahees, Cherokee for ""we stand alone,"" and was one of the Army's most storied units, having been among the first parachuting infantry, landing behind the lines during the D-Day invasion in June 1944.""The 'Currahees' of Bravo Company, 3-506th, had been involved in skirmishes with NVA soldiers practically from the time they set foot on Cambodian soil,"" wrote Jerald Berry in ""Twelve Days in May."" ""The first line of defense for the line company was the firepower of the individual weapons of the infantrymen — M-16 rifles, M-60 machine guns and M-79 grenadiers (grenade launchers). If more firepower was required to subdue the enemy, the commanding officer could call for artillery support from the battalion fire support base.""After destroying North Vietnamese army field hospitals and hamlets where the enemy was based, Sabo's 2nd Platoon, along with the 3rd, headed for another hamlet on May 10. At 3:15 p.m., they came to a clearing amid thick brush and trees. The Americans advanced into it warily until a big NVA force opened up, some members shooting down from the treetops.The Mother's Day Ambush was on. With some protection from bushes and small trees, the GIs fired back. Sabo neared enemy trenches to kill several NVA soldiers and prevent a flanking move.While he gave first aid to a wounded comrade, grenades landed at their position. Sabo covered the GI and took fragment wounds in his back. Even so, he killed two of the communist attackers and moved the wounded man to safety.With his platoon low on ammo, Sabo retrieved belts from the dead and redistributed them, but he was hit by small arms fire. Now bleeding profusely, he fired back, giving others time to crawl to safety.By nightfall, 1st Platoon, which had been held in reserve, came to their relief, while helicopters tried to medevac the wounded. Sabo shook off his wounds and stepped into the open to shoot any NVA soldier who fired at the chopper. Giving up himself for his comrades, he moved toward the enemy. He took more bullets and then, as he was reloading, was shot dead. He was 22.""We had to call in artillery on top of us to keep from being overrun,"" said Rios. ""The 105 mm howitzer rounds were detonating at treetop level, and shrapnel flew all over us as well as the enemy. I had been in firefights before, but not this big, as long or intense.""Seven other members of 2nd Platoon were killed and 28 wounded — the most casualties of the three platoons; virtually everyone had been hit — before the communists slumped away with heavy losses. The ambush was the worst battle during the 12 days that the 506th was in Cambodia.The Cambodian Campaign ended by July. The Paris peace treaty was signed in 1973. The North Vietnamese shredded that agreement by overrunning the South in 1975 — and the recommendation for Sabo's Medal of Honor got lost.Then in 1999, Alton Mabb, a columnist for the 101st Airborne Division Association's Screaming Eagle magazine, came across the paperwork at the National Archives.None of Sabo's family or friends knew how he had been killed. The Medal of Honor recognizes those whose valor saved lives. The standards to qualify are extraordinarily high, with two-thirds of recipients since 1941 having been awarded it posthumously.Unlike any other award, it has to be approved by the entire command, including the secretary of the military branch, the secretary of defense and the president.During the long lobbying to recognize Sabo's heroism, he was promoted posthumously to sergeant.Then came a call that Rose will never forget. ""On Feb. 1, 2012, the telephone on Rose Sabo-Brown's computer desk jangled to life,"" wrote Poole in the newly published ""Company of Heroes: A Forgotten Medal of Honor and Bravo Company's War in Vietnam."" ""A few minutes later, President Barack Obama came on the line and told her that the husband whose death had left her a widow more than four decades earlier would receive the U.S. military's highest honor for combat valor. With the president's call, the United States completed one of its last remaining items of business from the Vietnam War.""

"
314,GIS,"If you've purchased these kinds of health-oriented products, there's a good chance at least some of them come from one company: Hain Celestial Group (HAIN).
"
315,GIS,"Hain sells hundreds of natural and organic products under brands such as Celestial Seasonings, Terra, Garden of Eatin', Health Valley, WestSoy and Earth's Best.
"
316,GIS,"And that's just a starter list.
"
317,GIS,"""They probably have the best and broadest exposure to the natural foods industry in all channels of distribution,"" said analyst Scott Van Winkle of Canaccord Genuity.
"
318,GIS,"It's a good place to be these days. Organic and natural foods are growing at a blended rate of at least 11% a year, Van Winkle says. Conventional food is growing in the low single digits at best.
"
319,GIS,"Hain has logged double-digit sales and profit gains every quarter for more than three years. During its fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31, revenue grew 22% from the prior year to a record $557.4 million. Earnings also rose 22%, to 88 cents per share.
"
320,GIS,"A Natural Choice
"
321,GIS,"""(Hain) is a very good play on the core growth of natural and organic foods,"" Van Winkle said.
"
322,GIS,"Major customers include Wal-Mart (WMT) as well as United Natural Foods (UNFI), a distributor that sells to Whole Foods Market (WFM) and other outlets.
"
323,GIS,"Hain also sells to traditional grocery chains such as Kroger (KR), Safeway (SWY), Wegmans and Publix.
"
324,GIS,"Thanks to health and dietary concerns, the kind of natural and organic foods and personal-care products Hain sells have been gaining shelf space in traditional grocery channels.
"
325,GIS,"""That is where the growth is coming from,"" Irwin Simon, Hain's chief executive, said in an interview. ""We've seen the shift in the last couple of years.""
"
326,GIS,"He says about 60% of Hain's U.S. sales come from traditional grocery stores.
"
327,GIS,"Rivals run the gamut from large packaged foods companies such as Kraft (KRFT) and General Mills (GIS) to small organic-food players such as Annie's (BNNY).
"
328,GIS,"""Given that Hain has such broad exposure, it has hundreds of competitors,"" Van Winkle said.
"
329,GIS,"Meanwhile, the company's sales outside the U.S. have been increasing. They represented 42.7% of the total during the fiscal third quarter, up from 17.9% in 2011.
"
330,GIS,"The U.K. is still Hain's biggest overseas market, with 32% of Q3 revenue. Hain's product mix in Britain includes a larger mix of mainstream grocery items than in the U.S., such as jams, peanut butter and desserts.
"
331,GIS,"To feed consumers' hankering for organic and natural foods in the U.S. and elsewhere, Hain keeps rolling out new products and adding new brands through acquisitions.
"
332,GIS,"Last year it launched 125 new products, Simon says, though it discontinued some others. New products rolled out this year ranged from snacks, soups and shakes to gluten-free pasta and personal-care items.
"
333,GIS,"It's also been a big year for acquisitions, continuing a strategy Simon began in 1993 after he acquired struggling Hain Pure Food from Pet Inc.
"
334,GIS,"Simon says his strategy has always been to ""buy brands started by someone else,"" and then ""figure out how to grow them from there.""
"
335,GIS,"In January, Hain spent $357 million to buy Tilda Ltd., a premium Basmati and specialty-rice company based in the UK, with sales in more than 40 countries.
"
336,GIS,"Also this year, Hain acquired Rudi's Organic Bakery, which makes a popular organic bread. And last week Hain bought the remaining 51.3% interest it didn't already own in antibiotic-free and organic poultry brands FreeBird chicken and Plainville Farms turkey.
"
337,GIS,"Organic baby foods company Ella's Kitchen Group was added last year, expanding Hain's large reach into the baby market, where Earth's Best sells everything from infant formula to diapers.
"
338,GIS,"In December 2012, Hain bought cold-pressed juice business BluePrint Cleanse, putting Hain in a market that is ""very on trend,"" Van Winkle said.
"
339,GIS,"Even old trends still have juice. For example, the Celestial Seasonings tea brand contributes only 6% to 7% of overall sales but produces margins that are ""quite good,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton noted in a report earlier this month.
"
340,GIS,"In addition, he says, tea comes with ""steady profitability"" and cash flow that can be invested in other areas of the business.
"
341,GIS,"As calming as tea is for Hain, Wal-Mart's expanded rollout of organic products through the Wild Oats brand may cause some stress among organic-food players.
"
342,GIS,"""With Wal-Mart launching Wild Oats at lower prices, our concern is that it could put downward price pressure on the organic category,"" said John Baumgartner, analyst with Wells Fargo Securities.
"
343,GIS,"Immaterial Threat?
"
344,GIS,"Since Hain has such a diversified product mix in organic products, it might feel the price pinch more than other companies with a narrower focus, he says.
"
345,GIS,"Even so, Naughton views the Wild Oats threat as ""largely immaterial"" to Hain, based not on pricing pressures but on the fact that Hain and Wild Oats directly compete on only a small percentage of products.
"
346,GIS,"Assuming 20% to 30% cannibalization in affected categories, he figured ""a modest"" headwind to Hain's revenue growth over the next 12 months.
"
347,GIS,"Another potential risk comes from United Natural Foods, which looks to improve inventory turns by buying fewer units from suppliers. Hain is ""navigating the headwind by better product sales in other channels,"" Naughton said. However, United Natural's inventory-reduction program took away ""some upside"" to his revenue estimates for Hain.
"
348,GIS,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate Hain will post earnings of $3.16 a share for all of fiscal 2014, up 25% from last year.

461,GIS,"Through it all, Hain Celestial (HAIN) has generally seen its stock climb the past few years — barring periodic gyrations, such as Feb. 9's 3% dip as the overall market fell on concerns over Greece and China.
"
462,GIS,"Hain stock is up 41% from an August low, including a 5.4% jump on Feb. 4 after second-quarter earnings were reported, bringing the stock back from a January lull.
"
463,GIS,"While slower than expected, net sales in Hain's December-ending second quarter of fiscal 2015 were still up 31% to an adjusted $701.7 million. Adjusted earnings rose 26% to 54 cents per share, beating views.

"
465,GIS,"A big part of Hain's appeal is its focus on the healthy side of the packaged-goods business.

466,GIS,"It's behind some of the biggest brands in herbal tea (Celestial Seasonings), soy milk (WestSoy), organic baby food (Earth's Best), natural soups and cereals (Health Valley), healthy snacks (Terra) and cold-pressed juices (BluePrint), to name some of the many niches the company plays in.

"
469,GIS,"Van Winkle credits management for working efficiently through good and tough times. In Hain's September-ending first quarter — which included its voluntary nut-butter recall in August — Hain grew earnings and revenue more than 30% vs. the year-earlier period.

481,GIS,"Hain competes with numerous companies. They range from small organic and natural-foods players to the big packaged-goods giants that have increasingly been adding healthier products to their mix.

"
487,GIS,"The U.K. is Hain's second largest market after the U.S. Second-quarter net sales in the U.K. jumped 38% vs. the year prior to $200.8 million. Tilda contributed around $50 million of the total, even with the ongoing production disruption from the fire.

Fans of the maple syrup-flavored cereal have spoken up, and General Mills (GIS) is responding to their request.The Minneapolis-based company announced Friday in a blog post plans to reintroduce the cereal later this month. It was discontinued in 2006, but fans created a ""Bring French Toast Crunch Back"" Facebook page, collected signatures for a petition, and flooded General Mills with emails and phone calls.""All of the conversations, requests and passion from the fans really got our attention,"" Waylon Good, General Mills marketing manager, said in a press release. ""It's amazing to see how nostalgia for brands from generations past can really take on a life of its own.""Cereal makers have been struggling as consumers wake up to a wide range of alternative morning food options, including Greek yogurt and breakfast sandwiches. That's been hurting cereal makers' top line.General Mills, whose brands include Cheerios, Wheaties, Betty Crocker and Yoplait, saw sales slip by 1% to 3% the past three quarters. Analysts expect revenue to dip 2% in fiscal Q3, before picking up by the low-single digits in Q4. Rival Kellogg (K) has also struggled on the sales front: Revenue fell 1% to 3% the past four quarters.General Mills earns a 2 for its three-year and five-year Earnings Stability Factor on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable).

535,GIS,"Text of President Obama's 2015 State of the Union Address Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are fifteen years into this new century.  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.  But tonight, we turn the page.Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.  We are humbled and grateful for your service.America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.At this moment — with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production — we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.  It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come.Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another — or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.  And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.It begins with our economy.Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.  She waited tables.  He worked construction.  Their first child, Jack, was on the way.They were young and in love in America, and it doesn’t get much better than that.“If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.”As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.  Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed for each other.  And slowly, it paid off.  They bought their first home.  They had a second son, Henry.  Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise.  Ben is back in construction — and home for dinner every night.“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story.  They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled.  You are the reason I ran for this office.  You’re the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.  And it’s been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.<[>We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores.  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump.We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  And more Americans finish college than ever before.We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.  And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.  Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.So the verdict is clear.  Middle-class economics works.  Expanding opportunity works.  And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way.  We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.  We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got a system to fix.  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007.  But here’s the thing — those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making.  We need to do more than just do no harm.  Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help.  She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.  Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.  Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.  We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.  We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet — tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them.That’s what middle-class economics is — the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.  We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success — we want everyone to contribute to our success.So what does middle-class economics require in our time?First — middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.  That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement — and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.Here’s one example.  During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority — so this country provided universal childcare.  In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.It’s not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have.  It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.  And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America — by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.Here’s another example.  Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.  Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave.  Forty-three million.  Think about that.  And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.  So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington.  Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  It’s the right thing to do.Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  Really.  It’s 2015.  It’s time.  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned.  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.These ideas won’t make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship.  That’s not the job of government.  To give working families a fair shot, we’ll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest.We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage — these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.  That is a fact.  And that’s what all of us — Republicans and Democrats alike — were sent here to do.Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world.  But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more.By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education.  Two in three.  And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.  It’s not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future.That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero.  Forty percent of our college students choose community college.  Some are young and starting out.  Some are older and looking for a better job.  Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.  Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt.  Understand, you’ve got to earn it — you’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.  I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.  And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.  Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.  Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.  We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a veteran.Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.  Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.  Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.  But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist ten or twenty years ago — jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.  But we do know we want them here in America.  That’s why the third part of middle-class economics is about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure — modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.  So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.  Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.  Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region.  That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage.  Why would we let that happen?  We should write those rules.  We should level the playing field.  That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but fair.Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.  But ninety-five percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders, and we can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China.  Let’s give them one more reason to get it done.21st century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development.  I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine — one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.  In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.  Tonight, I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes — and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs — converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay.  Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.  In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.  Good luck, Captain — and make sure to Instagram it.Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there’s bipartisan support in this chamber.  Members of both parties have told me so.  Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.  As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.  They’ve riddled it with giveaways the superrich don’t need, denying a break to middle class families who do.This year, we have an opportunity to change that.  Let’s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.  Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.Let’s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.  We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.  We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy.  Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness.  This is where America needs to go.  I believe it’s where the American people want to go.  It will make our economy stronger a year from now, fifteen years from now, and deep into the century ahead.Of course, if there’s one thing this new century has taught us, it’s that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America.  In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.  When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military — then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.  That’s what our enemies want us to do.I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.  We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don’t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.  That’s exactly what we’re doing right now — and around the globe, it is making a difference.First, we stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists — from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.  We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we’ve done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we’ve learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years.Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we’ve trained their security forces, who’ve now taken the lead, and we’ve honored our troops’ sacrifice by supporting that country’s first democratic transition.  Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we’re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL’s advance.  Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.  We’re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.  This effort will take time.  It will require focus.  But we will succeed.  And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.  We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine’s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.  Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin’s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength.  Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.That’s how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.  When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new.  Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.  And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.  As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of “small steps.”  These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.  And after years in prison, we’re overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs.  Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we’ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.  Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies — including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran.  But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails — alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again.  It doesn’t make sense.  That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.  The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.Third, we’re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.  We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism.  And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children’s information.  If we don’t act, we’ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.  If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola — saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.  I couldn’t be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.  But the job is not yet done — and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules — in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.  And no challenge — no challenge — poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.  Now, one year doesn’t make a trend, but this does — 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.I’ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they’re not scientists; that we don’t have enough information to act.  Well, I’m not a scientist, either.  But you know what — I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities.  The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe.  The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  We should act like it.That’s why, over the past six years, we’ve done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it.  That’s why we’ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.  And that’s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.  I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action.  In Beijing, we made an historic announcement — the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.  And because the world’s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we’ve got.There’s one last pillar to our leadership — and that’s the example of our values.As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I’ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.  It’s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.  It’s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims — the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace.  That’s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.  We do these things not only because they’re right, but because they make us safer.As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice — so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.  Since I’ve been President, we’ve worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half.  Now it’s time to finish the job.  And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.  It’s not who we are.As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties — and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.  So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven’t.  As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.  And next month, we’ll issue a report on how we’re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.Looking to the future instead of the past.  Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely.  Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities.  Leading — always — with the example of our values.  That’s what makes us exceptional.  That’s what keeps us strong.  And that’s why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards — our own.You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn’t a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America — but a United States of America.  I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home — a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world’s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision.  How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.  It’s held up as proof not just of my own flaws — of which there are many — but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naïve, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.I know how tempting such cynicism may be.  But I still think the cynics are wrong.I still believe that we are one people.  I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.  I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best.  I’ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London.  I’ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia.  I’ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.  I’ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home.  So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother’s keeper, and our sister’s keeper.  And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.  So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America’s hopes.  I’ve served in Congress with many of you.  I know many of you well.  There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.  And many of you have told me that this isn’t what you signed up for — arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.  Imagine if we did something different.Understand — a better politics isn’t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.  A better politics is one where we appeal to each other’s basic decency instead of our basest fears.  A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than “gotcha” moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives.  A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America.If we’re going to have arguments, let’s have arguments — but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.  We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it’s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs.Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it’s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it’s being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.  But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed.  Surely we can understand the wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.  Surely we can agree it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all.That’s a better politics.  That’s how we start rebuilding trust.  That’s how we move this country forward.  That’s what the American people want.  That’s what they deserve.I have no more campaigns to run.  My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I’ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol — to do what I believe is best for America.  If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand.  If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you’ll at least work with me where you do agree.  And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth — that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood:  your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids.I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen — man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.  I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:  that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past six years:  “It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family.  We, too, have made it through some hard times.  Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.  We’ve laid a new foundation.  A brighter future is ours to write.  Let’s begin this new chapter — together — and let’s start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love. ####

536,GIS,"Islamofascism: America, land of the free, home of the brave, looks more like land of the meek, home of the enslaved — to Shariah law. It's not just the self-censoring media capitulating to the Islamic State. Now it's our military.It's bad enough major news media won't show the hot-selling defiant new cover of ""Charlie Hebdo"" magazine for ""fear of offending Muslims.""But now the Pentagon has advised military families to scrub their Facebook accounts of ""anything opposing terrorist groups or organizations,"" lest they be targeted by homegrown jihadists sympathetic to IS.Imagine, during World War II, military brass warning GIs not to say anything bad about the Nazis or ""Japs""? Back then, the government plastered posters across the country caricaturizing the Nazis and ""Japs."" Back then it was our government that was publishing cartoons demeaning the enemy. And we licked them in four years.Just to be safe, though, today's soldiers are also advised to: take off their uniforms in public; scrape ""military pride decals"" off their cars; conceal military IDs when in public; and even ""wear civilian clothes when traveling to and from work.""Yes, don't wear your American uniform or any patriotic symbols. You don't want to set off any Muslim fanatics around the base.CNN confirms that soldiers and their spouses are complying, some by deactivating their Facebook and Twitter accounts. Others are removing American flags from their front porches and stowing them in the garage.These are people who are trained to combat the jihadists. If they are frightened and intimidated by threats from Muslim bullies, God help the rest of us.Social media sites are forms of free speech. Displaying bumper stickers and flags are fundamental forms of free expression in America. Yet we are letting the Islamofascists restrict both these rights now.Fox News was the only major news network to show the full cover of the French cartoon magazine showing the Muslim prophet Muhammad sobbing underneath the headline ""All is forgiven."" The big three networks, as well as CNN and MSNBC, instead cravenly described the cover to viewers while even blurring out background images of the magazine in video feeds from Paris. CBS would only show viewers the front cover above the fold, as if it were a porno magazine.The new cover, which sold 5 million copies in Europe, was an integral part of one of the biggest stories of our time — the two-day terrorist siege of Paris, the French 9/11. Yet ""NBC News will not allow us to show it to you,"" MSNBC said, even though both networks had no qualms about showing and discussing ad nauseam the image of the ""Piss Christ"" photo by artist Andres Serrano, which depicted a crucifix submerged in urine.The New York Times, for its part, refused to run even the relatively mild new ""Charlie Hebdo"" cover.In a story, ""Charlie Hebdo's Defiant Muhammad Cover Fuels Debate on Free Speech,"" it took pains to crop out the entire magazine from a photo of the magazine editors holding the new cover up at a press conference.In another story about the new cover triggering record sales, the Times ran an interactive piece asking readers: ""Share your experience as a Muslim in Europe"" while whining about free speech being denied to jihadists.How does this look to our enemies? In the eyes of the jihadists, the intrepid American media are no more than paper tigers, intimidated into censoring anything critical of Islam. The free press should be reinforcing free speech, not fleeing from it in a state of fear and submission.

538,GIS,"Bob Hope delivered the punch line.And the bottom line.Thanks to a 100-year life of jokes in every venue — from stage to screen — along with vast real estate, Hope built a treasure chest of $115 million, according to Forbes.Simply, Hope (1903-2003) reflects a rich history: appearing in almost 100 movie and TV productions.He had ""an unparalleled reign as NBC's most popular comedy star that lasted for nearly four decades,"" Richard Zoglin wrote in his new ""Hope"" biography. ""Other comedians who made the move into television — (Milton) Berle, Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Jackie Gleason, Danny Thomas, even Lucille Ball — had their heyday on TV and then faded. Hope alone remained a major star headlining top-rated TV shows well into his 80s.""King Of ComedyZoglin underscores Hope's heft, telling IBD: ""I consider him the most important entertainer of the 20th century. First, because he achieved top-rated success in virtually every major field of popular entertainment — vaudeville, Broadway, radio, movies, television and live concerts — something no other entertainer can claim. But his importance also comes from his offstage activities, the way he defined what we think of as an entertainment celebrity today: a smart businessman, an innovative self-promoter and builder of his own brand, and (thanks to his tireless work for the troops and for charities of all kinds) a role model for public service in Hollywood.""Gene Perret, who wrote for Hope for three decades, said: ""I'm prejudiced, but I've loved Bob Hope since I was in grade school. But think about it: He was No. 1 at the box office, then hit TV with specials that had huge ratings for years. He was wise enough to know what his audience wanted and give it to them. So I'd go along with Zoglin.""Perret joined Hope for the 1969 Oscars, one of a record 19 times the comedian hosted the gala.Meanwhile, Hope was on a patriotic run that saw one of his Christmas specials from Vietnam reach, as Zoglin notes, ""a now-unthinkable 46.6% of all TV homes in the country.""Hope's patriotism was a ""tremendous boost,"" said Perret. ""Not just for his career, but it (found him) a great audience.""Hope discovered how great as he visited March Air Force Base in California in 1941 just before America entered World War II.""I told my first joke,"" recalled the comedian, ""and they exploded. I looked at them and said, 'Where have you been all my life?'""Hope thereafter vaulted to the front — North Africa, Sicily, the South Pacific, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf — along with starlets and his writers. Sometimes he was joined by his wife, Dolores, a former singer who was the mother of their four adopted children.""On military trips,"" said Perret, ""he would go right to dinner with the generals and told us to mingle with the soldiers. So when he got on stage, he had material to connect with the GIs. They had to wonder, 'How did he know about what red light district we hit?'""Hope felt that troop tug often, cracking: ""21,000 men, all dedicated to one purpose — to get to Bangkok.""At one stop in Vietnam, Hope riffed on the end of the U.S. ambassador's tenure: ""We're on our way to Saigon, and I hope we do as well as Henry Cabot Lodge. He got out.""Military MarathonHope was still at it a quarter-century later, regaling troops at sea near Beirut during the Gulf War.""They were packed on the ship and laughed at everything,"" said Perret. ""It didn't matter that the troops were so young. Bob had that mystique to the end.""He'd go to hospitals to see the wounded, enter the room, and the first thing he'd say was, 'Don't get up.' Of course, 90% of them couldn't move. But it was funny. And he was so devoted to them, a true service to his country.""Hope received plaudits for that service with the Congressional Gold Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the naming of airport USOs in his honor.""Hope's patriotic work was of course a key part of his entertainment persona,"" said Zoglin. ""It's what set him apart from nearly every other star in Hollywood.""All for a guy born Leslie Hope in England and at age 4 moved with his mom and five brothers to join their financially shaky dad in Cleveland. Leslie became Bob in time for his stage start in the 1920s and Broadway landing in 1932.Six years later came his first feature film, ""The Big Broadcast,"" with what became Hope's signature song, ""Thanks for the Memory.""""Hope spent a long time in the trenches of vaudeville before he made it on Broadway and in radio,"" said Zoglin. ""Those years of struggle made him especially driven and resourceful. He was shrewder about money than almost anyone else in Hollywood. In 1944 he went on strike against his studio, Paramount Pictures, refusing to do anymore movies until the studio allowed him to set up his own production company so he could have a share of the profits from his films. Paramount finally relented, and the production arrangement that Hope set up really became the model for the production deals that virtually every star in Hollywood now has.""In The Fast LaneHope's trademark movies came alongside Bing Crosby, starting with ""Road to Singapore"" in 1940 and speeding to No. 7 in the series, ""The Road to Hong Kong,"" in 1962.""His comic character in films,"" said Zoglin, ""was immensely engaging, and his stand-up monologues — as corny as the jokes often seem today — struck a real chord with audiences back in the 1940s and '50s in a way that few comedians, current or past, have matched.""Perret studied Hope's style while growing up in Philadelphia, then finally hooked up with the master.Said Hope upon working with Perret's material: ""You seemed to be writing for me all your life.""Perret: ""Mr. Hope, I have, but you didn't know about it.""Perret rose to become Hope's main writer the last dozen years of the comic's career until the late 1990s — while writing close to 50 books, including the upcoming ""Comedy Writing Self-Taught.""""Really, Bob Hope was the main writer,"" said Perret. ""That's a skill too. He knew what was right for him. He would get 50 jokes from a staff of 10 or 12 for a monologue and whittle them down to 30. He won all the arguments with the writers. Then on stage, his delivery was magnificent.""Said Zoglin: ""Hope basically invented stand-up comedy in the form we know it today. ... He asked his writers to read the papers and come up with jokes about what was happening in the world — as well as about Hope's own activities, friends and Hollywood career. These topical monologues were really the model, not just for Johnny Carson and virtually every late-night TV host today, but for all stand-up comedians.""Perret, 77, is still applauding: ""Success is an indication of talent. You have people saying, 'Well, he was Bob Hope.' But he had to do something right to become Bob Hope.""

539,GIS,"One big push.That's what Radio Flyer CEO Antonio Pasin pondered for his fledgling wagon business.By 1930, his wheeled toys had made inroads with American consumers, and his factory turned out 1,500 a day. But amid the Great Depression, company cohorts urged a conservative approach.That's not how Pasin (1897-1990) rolled.With bravado and savvy business maneuvers, the Italian carpenter cornered the market with his iconic red wagon. Many decades thereafter, the company boasted that 75% of U.S. families had owned a Radio Flyer.Starting out, Pasin knew he had to make a bold move.The 1933 World's Fair, ""A Century of Progress,"" was coming to Chicago — Radio Flyer's home — and he envisioned a wild ride.To gain momentum, Pasin took a huge risk with the firm's finances as well as his own.""He took out a big loan, and he'd never done that before,"" Robert Pasin, Antonio's grandson and Radio Flyer's current CEO, told IBD.With $30,000 — nearly a half-million dollars in today's money — Antonio Pasin hired an art-deco designer and commissioned a 45-foot structure. His towering ""Coaster Boy"" depicted a giant youth kneeling in a Radio Flyer — one hand steering the wagon, the other bracing for adventure.Price Was RightAt street level, the edifice opened into a gift shop where fairgoers could purchase souvenir-sized Radio Flyers for 25 cents (worth $4.50 today).Kids clamored for the keepsakes, and the company sold more than 120,000 — enough to repay the loan in full. ""We feel like that was the watershed event,"" Robert Pasin said. ""All the eyes of the world were on Chicago.""The white-knuckled journey paid off for the Italian immigrant.""That was the only time my grandmother saw him stressed out in any way. That was the big one,"" Robert Pasin said.Antonio described his bold approach this way:""I enter so many ventures in business with more nerve than capital.""Eight decades later, the little red wagon remains a childhood rite of passage.""It's a quintessential American toy. It's become synonymous with America,"" said Christopher Byrne, content director of Time to Play Magazine and author of ""Toy Time! From Hula Hoops to He-Man to Hungry Hungry Hippos: A Look Back at the Most-Beloved Toys of Decades Past.""Pasin made the wagon affordable — less than $3 dollars in 1930, or $40 in today's currency — so every boy and girl could have one.The return on investment for parents? A toy with uses as boundless as a kid's daydreams.""It became a catalyst for the imagination,"" Byrne said. ""It became synonymous with childhood freedom.""Pasin knew a thing or two about daydreaming. ""Since I was 10 years old, I wanted to be in business for myself,"" he said.Born in Rosa, an Italian town near Venice, he learned cabinet-making from his father and grandfather. The elder Pasins did carpentry work at a palatial Italian estate.As a youth, Antonio helped them craft an indoor carousel, complete with hand-carved horses. ""He was exposed early to quality and beauty,"" Robert Pasin said. ""Design was so central to everything he did.""In 1914, the Pasin family sold a mule to pay for 16-year-old Antonio's voyage to America — the land of promise, they felt. But arriving in New York City was more like a nightmare.Pasin's wife, Anna, described it in a corporate video: ""He got off the boat with no money, no friends, nobody. He came to this country and nobody gave him a job because he was too young.""Pasin made his way to Chicago, where he found work hauling water for sewer-digging crews.""It was a few years of successively getting better jobs,"" grandson Robert said.By 1917, Pasin had saved enough money to buy tools and rent a one-room shop where he built phonograph cabinets.Sales trickled in, but what really caught the fancy of customers was the wooden wagon that Pasin built to haul tools around his workshop.""People kept ordering the wagon,"" Robert said. ""Eventually, he just went with his best-seller.""The Italian immigrant who was born on the Fourth of July dubbed it the Liberty Coaster — a nod to the statue that had greeted him in New York — and sales rolled in.By 1923, he had several employees at his bustling company.But Pasin didn't coast. His mind always sped toward the horizon.""He was into what was modern, what was new,"" Robert said.What was especially new was Henry Ford's assembly line. Fired up by the carmaker's manufacturing innovations, Pasin toyed with metal stamping as a way to mass-produce his wagon.Plugged-In Pasin""He was a very technical guy. He was very into how the product was made,"" Robert said. ""When he saw the metal-stamping technology, he thought: Oh my gosh, I could use this. He went after it full-bore.""Using scrap pieces, Pasin made a metal version of his wagon and dubbed it the Radio Flyer. The catchy phrase captured the two hottest innovations of the time — radio and commercial flight.Pasin opened a metal-stamping factory in Chicago and changed his company's name from Liberty Coaster to Radio Steel & Manufacturing in 1930. An order for 7,000 wagons put the business in motion.With a toehold on the market, Pasin put everything into his product — ""the only wagon that outsells Ford station wagons,"" according to a company advertisement.""His approach was: Let's keep the price low and the margin low, and let's not invite a lot of competition,"" Robert said.Pasin wanted rivals scratching their heads, wondering how he made a profit on such a reasonably priced product.One secret was business relationships. ""He knew all the steel dealers,"" Robert said. ""If someone had metal scrap to unload, he'd get there first and buy it at some crazy low price.""Sellers were happy to oblige the personable, nattily dressed gentleman with an Italian accent.""His word was his bond,"" Robert said. ""People loved him and trusted him.""Especially enamored were new immigrants who found a fresh start and a first American job with the gregarious Pasin.Happy With New Americans""It always gave him a lot of pride,"" said Robert. ""He was incredibly generous with his time, his money and his advice.""Pasin put it this way: ""To give work to others. That had something to do with my desire to be in business.""When World War II put the brakes on the wagon biz, Radio Flyer shifted production to the 5-gallon steel Blitz cans that GIs used to tote fuel and water.""He made that product because it was well suited to the equipment we had,"" Robert said.In 1945, the company received an Army-Navy E Award for excellence in producing essential wartime materials.The military further tapped Pasin for hands-on help during the war. ""He became somebody that they would use to go in and certify the factories,"" Robert said. ""He and his team knew what they were doing.""The patriarch steered the company until 1967, when he turned the CEO chair over to his son, Mario, giving him permission to make, in the younger man's words, ""a ton of mistakes.""When Mario passed the company on to sons Robert and Paul in 1997, he repeated the same advice.What would Antonio, who died in 1990 at age 93, have thought of the company's move that decade into plastic wagons — a shift forced by competition?""My grandfather was not nostalgic whatsoever. He would believe in changing with the times,"" Robert said. ""He would say: Of course it needs a cup holder.""Radio Flyer's sales pegged $100 million going into 2013, according to the management journal Smart Business Chicago, after dipping as low as $20 million in the early '90s.Robert Pasin calls himself the company's chief wagon officer and continues to follow his grandfather's advice:""Stay close to the consumer and know what they want.""

541,GIS,"When Philip Pillsbury answered the call to run the family business in 1940, the aristocratic Yale graduate knew the milling industry from the ground up.
"
542,GIS,"If anyone doubted that, he would hold up his hands, which were mangled from years of working in Pillsbury Co.'s mills.
"
543,GIS,"""I've lost the tips of three fingers,"" the company's president and chairman said on many occasions. ""You know, that is the mark of flour millers around the world. We've all had our hands caught in the roller of the grinding machines and lost parts of our fingers.""
"
544,GIS,"Groomed since childhood to run the company, Philip (1903-84) modernized Pillsbury Co. in ways that his parents and grandparents could never imagine.
"
545,GIS,"Dig Deep
"
546,GIS,"A big man with big ideas, he plunged deeply into research and development, shifted the direction of the company to the growing consumer market, ramped up marketing, bought new businesses and expanded into international markets.
"
547,GIS,"In the process, Philip Pillsbury became a leader in introducing easy-to-prepare food to the American household while changing the country's eating habits.
"
548,GIS,"By the time he stepped down as chairman of the board in 1965, the company had grown from a struggling milling business to a diversified food giant.
"
549,GIS,"""The whole consumer revolution was upon the country, and Pillsbury was still selling its flour in 25-pound barrels or humongous sacks,"" Lori Sturdevant, author of ""The Pillsburys of Minnesota,"" told IBD. ""They wanted to be a supplier to bakers and to people willing to buy flour in large lots. That wasn't where the market was going. It took the arrival of Phil Pillsbury to shake things up and move the company into the consumer market. He began moving into cake mixes. He began moving into refrigerated dough.""
"
550,GIS,"""He was a great man in many ways,"" former Pillsbury CEO Paul Gerot said in a 1988 interview. ""He had good ideas, big ideas.""
"
551,GIS,"Pillsbury was the only son of Charles S. and Helen Pillsbury and the grandson of Charles A. Pillsbury, who co-founded the original flour milling company in Minneapolis in 1871.
"
552,GIS,"After Pillsbury left Minnesota to attend a Connecticut prep school, he went to Yale, where he starred as a guard on the school's undefeated 1923 football team, was a top water polo player, and sang tenor in the glee club.
"
553,GIS,"""He was quite a football hero,"" Sturdevant said.
"
554,GIS,"""He had three great loves: his family, Yale and the Pillsbury Company,"" William Spoor, chairman of the company in the 1980s, said upon Pillsbury's death.
"
555,GIS,"Although he had family advantages, Pillsbury learned the business on the mill floor. He even spent vacation from school working his way up to a master miller.
"
556,GIS,"One of the few top executives of the milling industry who had a craftsman's knowledge of the trade, Pillsbury was a lifetime member of the Association of Operative Millers, a select guild.
"
557,GIS,"Years later, he could reach into a grinding machine, pull out a handful of half-done flour and tell from its feel whether the machine rollers were properly adjusted.
"
558,GIS,"""He was always proud to say he was one of the longest holding members of his union. He kept (his card) current all the time,"" said Sturdevant. ""The stories were always being told of Philip going to fancy parties and then coming (to the mill) late at night and putting on his dungarees to work the night shift. He was proud of the fact he did this, and way into his later years he kept in touch with colleagues.""
"
559,GIS,"In his book ""Swim With the Sharks,"" Harvey Mackay wrote:
"
560,GIS,"""Philip Pillsbury had a reputation as a connoisseur of fine foods and wines, but to (his employees) his reputation as a man willing to do a hard dirty job was the one that mattered, and you can be sure everybody was aware of it.""
"
561,GIS,"Pillsbury's initial effort as an executive — shifting the company from a commodities-based flour business to a consumer product firm — met with resistance in his own boardroom.
"
562,GIS,"""Top management, outside of Philip Pillsbury, was pretty much convinced that the way to success was to stay in the commodity business,"" Gerot said. ""It was his idea that the company could stand for much more than that.""
"
563,GIS,"New Products
"
564,GIS,"After winning that boardroom battle, Pillsbury rolled out his first batch of cake mixes in 1948.
"
565,GIS,"Three years later he steered the company into the refrigerated roll, biscuit and cookie business with the acquisition of Ballard & Ballard Co., a grain and flour firm in Louisville, Ky.
"
566,GIS,"In the 1960s he spread Pillsbury's products through the global market via acquisitions in Europe, South America, Australia and Africa. ""Phil was very keen on expanding into a worldwide platform,"" Sturdevant said.
"
567,GIS,"Meanwhile, Philip pushed aggressively into marketing. In 1949 he created the Grand National Recipe & Baking Contest — later known as the Pillsbury Bake-Off.
"
568,GIS,"The company estimated the inaugural contest attracted 700,000 new customers, so Philip latched on to it as a permanent marketing vehicle.

569,GIS,"Following former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt as a celebrity judge was a member of the British royal family, with TV star Art Linkletter broadcasting the show live. ""What a big coup it was,"" Sturdevant said.
"
570,GIS,"In the early contests, the single ingredient required was Pillsbury flour. That changed in the 1960s, with packaged mix and refrigerated dough categories added to the competition.
"
571,GIS,"In 1966, after Tunnel of Fudge Cake won second prize, Pillsbury received 200,000 requests from cooks trying to find the unusual ring-shaped Bundt cake pan the contestant had used. The sole manufacturer of the pans went on a 24-hour production schedule to keep up with the demand, according to Pillsbury archives.

"
575,GIS,"After stepping down as chairman in 1965, Pillsbury continued as a director the next nine years.
"
576,GIS,"By then, 1974, the company's net sales were $315 million, more than seven times the level of sales in 1940, when he took over the reins.
"
577,GIS,"In 1989, the British company Grand Metropolitan bought Pillsbury, which went on to merge with General Mills (GIS), its longtime rival, in 2001.
"
578,GIS,"In Minnesota, home to General Mills' Minneapolis headquarters, the Pillsbury name lives on. In the 18th century, John S. Pillsbury's flour mill helped build the Land of 1,000 Lakes. He served as governor of the young state and founded the University of Minnesota.
"
579,GIS,"Generations of Pillsburys served as governors, mayors, congressmen and leading philanthropists in addition to running the business.
"
580,GIS,"Continuing that tradition, Philip and his wife, Eleanor, along with their two sons, got involved in charity and civic endeavors.
"
581,GIS,"""The Pillsburys were exceedingly friendly people and well-known by lots of folks in town on a personal level,'' Sturdevant said.
"
582,GIS,"In the 1960s, a Pillsbury financial analyst wrote a long report to the board of directors claiming that it was in the company's best interest to move to another state. The analyst waited for weeks for a response to his report, but none ever came, the Star Tribune reported.

586,GIS,"Pillsbury: ""Because I like living here.""When Philip Pillsbury answered the call to run the family business in 1940, the aristocratic Yale graduate knew the milling industry from the ground up.If anyone doubted that, he would hold up his hands, which were mangled from years of working in Pillsbury Co.'s mills.""I've lost the tips of three fingers,"" the company's president and chairman said on many occasions. ""You know, that is the mark of flour millers around the world. We've all had our hands caught in the roller of the grinding machines and lost parts of our fingers.""Groomed since childhood to run the company, Philip (1903-84) modernized Pillsbury Co. in ways that his parents and grandparents could never imagine.Dig DeepA big man with big ideas, he plunged deeply into research and development, shifted the direction of the company to the growing consumer market, ramped up marketing, bought new businesses and expanded into international markets.In the process, Philip Pillsbury became a leader in introducing easy-to-prepare food to the American household while changing the country's eating habits.By the time he stepped down as chairman of the board in 1965, the company had grown from a struggling milling business to a diversified food giant.""The whole consumer revolution was upon the country, and Pillsbury was still selling its flour in 25-pound barrels or humongous sacks,"" Lori Sturdevant, author of ""The Pillsburys of Minnesota,"" told IBD. ""They wanted to be a supplier to bakers and to people willing to buy flour in large lots. That wasn't where the market was going. It took the arrival of Phil Pillsbury to shake things up and move the company into the consumer market. He began moving into cake mixes. He began moving into refrigerated dough.""""He was a great man in many ways,"" former Pillsbury CEO Paul Gerot said in a 1988 interview. ""He had good ideas, big ideas.""Pillsbury was the only son of Charles S. and Helen Pillsbury and the grandson of Charles A. Pillsbury, who co-founded the original flour milling company in Minneapolis in 1871.After Pillsbury left Minnesota to attend a Connecticut prep school, he went to Yale, where he starred as a guard on the school's undefeated 1923 football team, was a top water polo player, and sang tenor in the glee club.""He was quite a football hero,"" Sturdevant said.""He had three great loves: his family, Yale and the Pillsbury Company,"" William Spoor, chairman of the company in the 1980s, said upon Pillsbury's death.Although he had family advantages, Pillsbury learned the business on the mill floor. He even spent vacation from school working his way up to a master miller.One of the few top executives of the milling industry who had a craftsman's knowledge of the trade, Pillsbury was a lifetime member of the Association of Operative Millers, a select guild.Years later, he could reach into a grinding machine, pull out a handful of half-done flour and tell from its feel whether the machine rollers were properly adjusted.""He was always proud to say he was one of the longest holding members of his union. He kept (his card) current all the time,"" said Sturdevant. ""The stories were always being told of Philip going to fancy parties and then coming (to the mill) late at night and putting on his dungarees to work the night shift. He was proud of the fact he did this, and way into his later years he kept in touch with colleagues.""In his book ""Swim With the Sharks,"" Harvey Mackay wrote:""Philip Pillsbury had a reputation as a connoisseur of fine foods and wines, but to (his employees) his reputation as a man willing to do a hard dirty job was the one that mattered, and you can be sure everybody was aware of it.""Pillsbury's initial effort as an executive — shifting the company from a commodities-based flour business to a consumer product firm — met with resistance in his own boardroom.""Top management, outside of Philip Pillsbury, was pretty much convinced that the way to success was to stay in the commodity business,"" Gerot said. ""It was his idea that the company could stand for much more than that.""New ProductsAfter winning that boardroom battle, Pillsbury rolled out his first batch of cake mixes in 1948.Three years later he steered the company into the refrigerated roll, biscuit and cookie business with the acquisition of Ballard & Ballard Co., a grain and flour firm in Louisville, Ky.In the 1960s he spread Pillsbury's products through the global market via acquisitions in Europe, South America, Australia and Africa. ""Phil was very keen on expanding into a worldwide platform,"" Sturdevant said.Meanwhile, Philip pushed aggressively into marketing. In 1949 he created the Grand National Recipe & Baking Contest — later known as the Pillsbury Bake-Off.The company estimated the inaugural contest attracted 700,000 new customers, so Philip latched on to it as a permanent marketing vehicle.Following former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt as a celebrity judge was a member of the British royal family, with TV star Art Linkletter broadcasting the show live. ""What a big coup it was,"" Sturdevant said.In the early contests, the single ingredient required was Pillsbury flour. That changed in the 1960s, with packaged mix and refrigerated dough categories added to the competition.In 1966, after Tunnel of Fudge Cake won second prize, Pillsbury received 200,000 requests from cooks trying to find the unusual ring-shaped Bundt cake pan the contestant had used. The sole manufacturer of the pans went on a 24-hour production schedule to keep up with the demand, according to Pillsbury archives.Rising EventThe Bake-Off was a national institution, later popping up every two years in Orlando, San Francisco, San Diego and other cities.""For as long as he lived, Phil would go to this every year,"" said Sturdevant. ""It was a command performance.""After stepping down as chairman in 1965, Pillsbury continued as a director the next nine years.By then, 1974, the company's net sales were $315 million, more than seven times the level of sales in 1940, when he took over the reins.In 1989, the British company Grand Metropolitan bought Pillsbury, which went on to merge with General Mills (GIS), its longtime rival, in 2001.In Minnesota, home to General Mills' Minneapolis headquarters, the Pillsbury name lives on. In the 18th century, John S. Pillsbury's flour mill helped build the Land of 1,000 Lakes. He served as governor of the young state and founded the University of Minnesota.Generations of Pillsburys served as governors, mayors, congressmen and leading philanthropists in addition to running the business.Continuing that tradition, Philip and his wife, Eleanor, along with their two sons, got involved in charity and civic endeavors.""The Pillsburys were exceedingly friendly people and well-known by lots of folks in town on a personal level,'' Sturdevant said.In the 1960s, a Pillsbury financial analyst wrote a long report to the board of directors claiming that it was in the company's best interest to move to another state. The analyst waited for weeks for a response to his report, but none ever came, the Star Tribune reported.Then one night the analyst ran into Philip Pillsbury at a party and asked if the report was OK.Pillsbury: ""It was ... fine.""Analyst: ""Then why didn't the board act on it?""Pillsbury: ""Because I like living here.""

677,GIS,"The food industry has underperformed the broader market in a year’s time as the industry has been struggling in the face of numerous issues. Again, the industry currently ranks among the bottom 20% of all Zacks industries, signifying that industry-level factors will continue to be unfavorable.With obesity ballooning into a major heath issue in America, consumers are desperately looking for food with health benefits. They are cutting back on food items that contain artificial flavor, color, sodium and saturated fat. Also, food items proven to contain traces of pesticides, genetically modified organisms and antibiotics are consciously avoided. Hence, with an increasing number of Americans choosing healthier lifestyle practices, packaged food companies are finding it hard to survive.Meanwhile, this rising health awareness is not going down well with companies selling snacks and packaged food products. Companies like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) have been facing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. Along with a shift in preference, increased price consciousness among consumers is acting against the industry.All is Not LostPer the Organic Trade Association, organic food now accounts for more than 5% of total food sales in the United States. Organic food sales increased 6.4% from last year in 2017. Sales are expected to rise further this year, largely banking on innovation and product launches. The organic food and beverages market is expected to grow at a rate of 14% from 2017 to 2021, per the latest market research report by Technavio.Needless to say, it makes it pertinent for food companies to comply with changing preferences to regain footing. Food companies are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Again, some companies are opting for co-branding to boost sales. Cereal Partners Worldwide deserves a special mention here. General Mills formed a joint venture with Nestle called Cereal Partners Worldwide, which serves customers in more than 130 global markets. Mondelez International teamed up yet again with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.Moreover, the overall economy appears to be in good shape, driven by an improved labor market, higher consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and increased business investments.Making the Right ChoiceSeveral food companies defy all odds on varied endeavors like product innovation and co-branding to keep up with evolving trends. Using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on three food stocks that have been performing well. We have ensured that the selected stocks possess a  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with other relevant metrics. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Medifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report) sports a Zacks Rank #1. Shares of the company have gained more than 200% against the industry’s loss of 18.5% in the past year. Moreover, the company is witnessing upward estimate revisions — 12.3% for 2018 and 18.6% for 2019 — in the last 60 days. This reflects that analysts are optimistic about the stock’s prospects. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, EPS growth is at 59.4% and sales growth at 30.9% for 2018. Again, EPS is projected to grow nearly 15% in the next three to five years.The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2. The stock has gained around 82% in the past year. Though estimates have been stable over the last 60 days, earnings are expected to grow a solid 65.9% in 2018. Again, EPS is projected to rise nearly 22% in the next three to five years. Meanwhile, the company’s Value Score of B reflects that there is upside potential for the stock.Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2. Earnings are expected to grow a solid 17.8% in 2018. Again, EPS is likely to grow nearly 8% in the next three to five years. Meanwhile, the company’s Value Score of B reflects that there is more room to run for the stock.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

678,GIS,"Consumer staple companies came under pressure on Jun 5, after Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from the United States. The heat was primarily felt by packaged foods companies, as fears of a trade war fail to subside. Consumer staples have been suffering for a long time now with changing tastes and preferences of consumers and increased competition from online retail giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In fact, the consumer staples sector fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, registering its worst performance since 1990. Trade war fears have added to the sector’s woes, as consumer staples continue to take a beating with retaliatory tariffs being imposed by the United States’ trade allies. That said, it needs to be seen how consumer staple companies fight back in the days to come.Mexico Tariffs Hit Consumer Staple Stocks The United States’ decision to impose 25% and 10% tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum followed by tariffs of another $60 billion saw China come up with retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products that primarily hit the consumer staples sector.Moreover, the United States last week imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union (EU), Mexico and Canada. On Jun 5, Mexico announced that it will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products including pork, bourbon and some types of cheeses.This saw consumer staples stocks, in particular packaged food companies, taking a hit. Shares of Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) slid 2% and 1.8%, respectively. Also, shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  declined 0.1% each.Understandably, packaged food companies have reasons to worry with Mexico, one of United States’ biggest trade allies, now imposing retaliatory tariffs.Consumer Staples Suffer Longest DeclineConsumer staples stocks have been suffering for quite some time now, with the sector entering the longest monthly losing streak since November 2016. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples index declined 1.7% in May, registering its straight monthly fall. On a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 Consumer Staples index has declined 13.3%.Moreover, of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was the second-worst performer in first-quarter 2018. The consumer staples sector didn’t have a good start to 2018, after having registered gains of more than 130% over a period of nine years. The sector has been under pressure owing to rising competition from online retailers and at the same time has been affected by rising commodity prices and transportation costs, and declining brand value.Packaged Food, Beverage, Tobacco Companies SufferChanging customer preference and inclination toward healthier options have seen a number of beverage, packaged foods and tobacco companies suffer. Year to date, shares of PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) have declined 15.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Similarly, shares of B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) have declined 20.3% and 18.4%, respectively, over the same time period.Tobacco companies too have been suffering with slower-than-expected adoption of alternate tobacco products in some markets and at the same time health-conscious people looking for healthier options. Shares of tobacco giants like Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB  -  Free Report) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) have declined 0.6% and 25.8%, respectively. Turning Point Brands carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineConsumer staples stocks have been considered a defensive bet, mainly because of its predictable growth rate and high dividends. However, a number of factors including changing consumer preference, declining brand value and stiff competition from online retailers are acting as tailwinds. Moreover, trade war fears have added to the woes, with countries like Mexico and China imposing tariffs on imported goods from the United States.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

679,GIS,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its effective brand strengthening and cost management efforts. Additionally, the company has been focusing on innovations and undertaking strategic acquisitions to bolster market share. However, persistent rise in freight expenses has been hurting the company’s margins, raising concerns for management. That said, let’s take a closer look at the aspects impacting Smucker’s performance.Strategies to Strengthen Brand PortfolioThe food industry is rife with competition and shifting consumer preferences. Amid this scenario, companies like Smucker and United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report) often resort to strategic tie-ups to augment their offerings and stay afloat. Smucker actively pursues strategic acquisitions in the United States as well as overseas. Its agreement with Keurig Green Mountain and Dunkin’ Brands Group to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. Additionally, the company has formed key partnerships with coffee companies like Rowland Coffee along with other food brands such as Sahale Snacks and Enray Inc. amongst others.Speaking of acquisitions, Smucker has been expanding in the pet foods category. Consumers’ rising consciousness regarding the health and wellness of pets has been giving much impetus to companies to grow in this category. Recently, the company concluded the acquisition of Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, LLC., a renowned name in the premium pet foods segment with popular brands like Rachael Ray Nutrish, Well, this is not the first time that Smucker has undertaken strategic efforts to strengthen its footing in pet foods. In 2015, it acquired Big Heart Pet Brand that added iconic brands such as Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. Apart from Smucker, General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has also been striving to expand in this category and recently concluded the acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. In fact, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is also planning to foray in this category, evident from its recent launch of the Wag brand.Apart from these, the company focuses on brand building through product innovation. The company’s recent launches include Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee and Meow Mix Servings cat food. These introductions contributed significantly toward sales growth during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In fact, management stated that products launched over the past three years delivered net sales growth of nearly 7% during the third quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Well, Smucker’s dedicated efforts to augment brand strength are reflected in third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. In the said period, Smucker witnessed growth across most core brands and categories. Going ahead, we expect that the company’s continued focus on brand building will add more colors to its performance. Hurdles yet to be CrossedSmucker continues to bear the brunt of higher freight expenses, which hurt its margins in the third quarter. In fact, management stated that the freight costs were greater than anticipated, thanks to a difficult transportation landscape in the United States. The company expects these headwinds to linger in the fourth quarter, which along with charges related to inventory obsolescence compelled it to lower gross margin view.  Additionally, lower net price realization dampened Smucker’s performance in several segments during the third quarter. Such persistent hurdles are a threat to Smucker’s performance. Well, such deterrents have dragged the company’s shares by almost 13.2% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s decline of 9.2%.Nevertheless, the company has put into place stringent cost saving measures, which is expected to aid savings worth $100 million in fiscal 2018, which forms part of its targeted savings of $250 million for 2020. Also, we are encouraged by Smucker’s efforts to boost the top line through brand development. We hope that such endeavors will uplift investors’ optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in the forthcoming periods.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

680,GIS,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) closed its operations in Venezuela, thanks to tumultuous economic condition. Poor access to raw materials due to economic barriers, supply chain disruptions and the limited access to dollars to import goods due to currency controls have disrupted operations of the company’s Venezuelan subsidiary.The Venezuelan division produced 75% of the breakfast cereals for the country, per the company's website and employed around 400 workers. Post the news of discontinuation of operations in Venezuela, Kellogg’s manufacturing plant has been captured by the leftist government, under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro. Importantly, Kellogg deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for the Venezuelan subsidiary in December 2016.What’s Exactly Happening in Venezuela?The oil-rich country of Venezuela is now reeling under hyperinflation and strict price controls. The country is divided between the followers of the United Socialist Party (PSUV), earlier led by Hugo Chávez and currently fronted by Nicolas Maduro, and those who want an end to the more than 15-years of rule of the party.Venezuela, having one of the largest oil reserves in the world, heavily depended on revenues from oil imports for sustenance. During the presidency of Hugo Chavez in early 2000s, oil prices were booming. The leader used this money to fund various social programs and was successful in addressing illiteracy, healthcare and poverty issues. Also, the price of key items, food and medicines were fixed at a rate below the cost of production to make it affordable. Chavez also restricted the conversion of national currency into dollars and fixed the rate.When oil prices began to fall the economy went haywire. The government failed to support the projects, paralyzing the country with poverty and inflation. Moreover, the government also stopped companies from raising prices to keep up with hyperinflation.Venezuelan President ReactsThe enraged president Maduro decided to hand the company over to the workers so that they can continue production. He believes that Kellogg’s exit is unconstitutional and has begun judicial proceedings against management.In retaliation, Kellogg said that the company is not responsible for the unauthorized use of the commercial names as well as brands and will exercise legal actions if needed.Importantly, Kellogg is not the first company to exit the country. Other companies include Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report), Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report). Though Kellogg stated that it looks forward to resume operations once conditions improve, we believe that chances are dim considering the dismal economic situation.Zacks RankKellogg currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

681,GIS,"The J. M. Smucker Company’s (SJM  -  Free Report) previously-announced strategic move to acquire Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, LLC, was concluded on May 14. Smucker acquired Ainsworth in a transaction worth $1.7 billion, after considering tax gains of about $200 million. The transaction was funded through a combination of term loan and commercial paper borrowings.Significance of the TakeoverConsumers’ rising consciousness regarding the health and wellness of pets has strengthened the traction of the pet foods category. Driven by such a market scenario, building strength in this category is an appropriate strategy by Smucker. Moreover, Ainsworth is a renowned name in the premium pet foods segment with popular brands like Rachael Ray Nutrish that will fortify the company’s portfolio. Incidentally, the Rachael Ray brand accounts for about two-thirds of Ainsworth's sales.Well, this is not the first time that Smucker has undertaken strategic efforts to strengthen its footing in pet foods. In 2015, it acquired Big Heart Pet Brand that added iconic brands such as Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. The buyout has been bolstering the company’s pet food business. Incidentally, net sales in the company’s U.S. Retail Pet Foods category inched up 2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, owing to improved volume/mix. These were primarily related to the Nature's Recipe brand and the company’s pet snacks portfolio. With the inclusion of Ainsworth, we expect Smucker to expand further in this category.Apart from Smucker, General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has also been striving to expand in this category and recently concluded the acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. Further, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is also looking toward invading this category, evident from its recent launch of the Wag brand.Focus on Buyouts & Brand Expansion Bodes WellThe food industry is rife with stiff competition and shifting consumer preferences. Amid this scenario, companies like Smucker and United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report) often resort to strategic tie-ups to augment their offerings and stay afloat. Smucker actively pursues strategic acquisitions in the United States as well as overseas. Its agreement with Keurig Green Mountain and Dunkin’ Brands Group to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. Further, the growing popularity of certain brands has encouraged the company to undertake innovations. Moreover, Smucker’s cost-saving initiatives have also contributed effectively toward undertaking brand augmenting efforts.Wrapping it UpDespite the aforementioned upsides, Smucker’s performance has long been eclipsed by higher freight expenses, which has been weighing upon its gross margin performance. Additionally, lower net price realization has dampened Smucker’s performance in several segments. Well, such deterrents have dragged the company’s shares by almost 10.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 16.1%.Nevertheless, we are confident about the company’s ability to offset such headwinds with well-chalked cost-reduction measures and efforts to boost top line.

684,GIS,"B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, after the market closes.The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.39% in the last reported quarter. However, B&G Foods surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, with the average being a positive 0.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayTrends that have gathered steam in the United States in the recent years include a shift toward healthier options in the food sector (predominantly fresh foods) and high level of price consciousness. Additionally, factors such as growing awareness of ""clean label"" and genetically modified organism or GMOs, increasing concerns related to sugar consumption and rising demand for free-from products are also sketching the food landscape afresh.Given this backdrop, B&G Foods has been on an acquisition spree in the recent times to bolster its healthy offerings. B&G Foods acquired snack foods manufacturer, Back to Nature Foods Company, in October 2017. The deal is likely to contribute to earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow. The earlier buyouts, Victoria Fine Foods Holding Company and Victoria Fine Foods in December 2016, as well as spices and seasonings business of ACH Food Companies in November 2016, are likely to contribute to first-quarter results.Green Giant frozen products are expected to drive revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Net sales of Green Giant frozen products increased more than 11% in 2017. While its spices & seasonings acquisition generated more than $260 million in net sales, Victoria generated nearly $43 million of the same in 2017.The company’s base business net sales in 2017 decreased 1.1%. The decrease was mostly concentrated in the first half of the year. Net sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 increased 1.2% compared with the same quarters of 2016.Again, the company’s Pirate Brands had a strong rebound, delivering a 6.1% increase in net sales in 2017.Given the weak sales trajectory, B&G Foods’ major cost-cutting initiatives are likely to support the bottom line to some extent.Conversely, challenging conditions of the North American food industry are expected to hurt its results to some extent. These have been hurting results of major food companies like General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $434.7 million, reflecting an increase of 4% year over year. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 51 cents, showing a decrease of 12.1% from the prior-year quarter. B&G Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  B&G Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | B&G Foods, Inc. Quote Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not show that B&G Foods is likely to beat estimates in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  B&G Foods has Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

685,GIS,"General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), which remains focused on the Consumer First strategy, provided details on its global growth priorities at its annual Investor Day. Talking of Consumer First strategy, management believes that meeting consumers’ evolving needs is one of the vital strategies for its business. This also helped the company to return to top-line growth in fiscal 2018.That said, let’s delve deeper into the company’s global growth priorities, which should most likely help it sustain top-line growth and uplift investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Well, the company has lost more than 22% so far this year, wider than the industry’s decline of 4.8%. This can be accountable to input cost inflation that remains a threat to General Mills’ margins. Nevertheless, focus on global growth strategies should help the company sustain top-line growth and provide cushion from these hurdles.Global Growth Priorities in DetailManagement’s key priorities include competing efficiently, driving differential growth platforms and restructuring its portfolio.With regard to competing efficiently everywhere, the company aims to bring a balance between top and bottom-line growth. While management remains committed toward driving sales, improving margins also remains a major priority. To this end, General Mills remains on track with its Holistic Margin Management (HMM) plan, which is expected to generate greater savings this year. This along with the company’s Strategic Revenue Management is likely to generate price/mix gains for all company segments.Further, General Mills concentrates on innovation and adding products like YQ yogurt, Betty Crocker mug treats and Haagen-Dazs stick bars, among others, to its portfolio. The company remains focused on making further brand investments through media advertisements, sponsorships, packaging and enhanced points of sale. Solid focus on these efforts in fiscal 2019 is also likely to continue driving e-commerce sales that surged 50% in fiscal 2018.Finally, the company aims to reshape its portfolio through strategic acquisitions and divestitures. In this regard, General Mills acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products in April 2018, and management remains focused on expanding this business under General Mills’ umbrella. Also, offloading underperforming businesses remains an important part of the company’s portfolio reshaping endeavors.All said, we expect General Mills’ focus on its global growth priorities to fuel top and bottom lines, aiding the stock’s recovery. Nevertheless, investors can also count on better-ranked stocks in the same industry.Check Out These Solid Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.

686,GIS,"On Aug 23, we issued an updated research report on General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) — a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer food.Sales have been soft due to lower demand amid changing consumer food preferences. Sales at the North America Retail segment, accounting for 65.3% of sales in fiscal 2017, decreased 6.8% affected by declines in the U.S. Meals & Baking, U.S. Yogurt, U.S. Cereal, and Canada operating units. Volumes at the North America Retail segment dropped 11% owing to deterioration in the developed markets of North America, Europe and Australia. Like other U.S. food producers — Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) — General Mills has been facing the brunt of the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.Notably, shares of the company have lost 19.2% in the last one year, compared with the industry’s ’s decline of 9.6%. In the last 60 days, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.5% and 1.8% for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively.Efforts to Counter Tepid SalesTo combat the weak sales, General Mills has outlined four key global strategies for fiscal 2018. The company plans to focus more on growing its cereal business which has been sluggish for quite some time now. Cereal sales nonetheless declined around 1% in fiscal 2016 and 3% in fiscal 2017.Also, restructuring its U.S. yogurt portfolio through fundamental innovation is a key objective as the unit has been experiencing sluggish sales over the last few quarters, declining 18% in fiscal 2017. The company’s third main strategy focuses on driving differential growth across several global platforms where it has already witnessed solid revenue momentum. Investing in its Foundation businesses (includes refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes etc.) is also a priority for fiscal 2018.Apart from these strategies, consumer-focused innovation, marketing initiatives and robust restructuring savings are making up for the sluggish revenue growth at General Mills. The company is investing in consumer-focused innovation, marketing and accelerating its organic product portfolio to boost sales.Also, by fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion. The company plans on delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which is expected to rake in approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.The Road AheadDespite the several initiatives undertaken to boost sales, General Mills expects organic sales decline of 1%-2% year over year. The company expects earnings in the first half of fiscal 2018 to decline on lower sales, phasing of its cost savings initiatives and brand investments. However, management anticipates earnings for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to improve in the second half as sales pick up pace.

687,GIS,"On Aug 18, we issued an updated research report on The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the leading chocolate manufacturer of North America.Hershey’s second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings also increased 28.2% from the year-ago level on higher sales, solid gross margin expansion and operating income improvement in the International segment. Net sales also improved 1.5% year over year owing to strong performance by the North America segment and the acquisition of barkTHINS brand. This marks the fifth straight quarter of sales improvement after a few quarters of no growth.Hershey’s shares have gained 4.3% so far this year compared to its industry’s 21.8% decline. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s earnings estimates for 2017 remained stable over the last 30 days. Notably, Hershey has been able to beat earnings estimates in all of the past four quarters. The company’s productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should drive the stock’s performance as well.Key PositivesHershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer needs. Its initiatives have been able to drive net sales by 2.2% so far this year.The company’s new cost savings program, Margin for Growth, bodes well. As part of the multi-year program, it will reduce its global workforce outside the U.S. by 15%. It will also improve the overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses, with savings likely to be recorded in 2018 and 2019.These moves are anticipated to boost efficiency, leverage global shared services and common processes and increase capacity utilization. For 2017, Hershey expects $25 million in savings from the Margin for Growth program, more than $15 million anticipated earlier.ConcernsThe North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption over the last few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference toward organic food items. As a result, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers like Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been grappling with declining demand.Moreover, weak consumer shopping trends and the softening chocolate category trends have been hurting Hershey’s sales in China since 2015. China’s foreign exchange-neutral sales declined 29% in the second quarter of 2017 due to continued softness in the chocolate category throughout modern trade and select SKU rationalization.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

689,GIS,"U.S. food producers are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat food items are losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales.In order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet the rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with a focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Therefore, though the companies’ sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins. Again, savings are being re-invested in the business for innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate top-line growth.Among the food companies, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) has already reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the consensus mark. The company posted solid results on the back of strong performance from Asia, Middle East & Africa and Europe. Adjusted earnings grew 9.6% and revenues increased 5.5% from the year-ago level.In March, McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) posted solid first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. The quarterly performance gained from positive acquisitions synergies, which led to growth in the consumer business and flavor solutions segments. General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) delivered in-line earnings and revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, the food giant has lowered its fiscal 2018 profit outlook to reflect higher supply chain costs.Q1 ExpectationsAccording to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 267 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 27, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25.1% year over year on more than 10% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 73.8% beat revenue expectations.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to increase 22.6% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues. For the Consumer Staples sector (which includes food stocks), the expected earnings and revenue growth is 6.8% and 3.1%, respectively, for the first quarter.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following food stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report results before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 5.82%.The company’s top line remained subdued since 2014, primarily due to lower demand in North America. Particularly, sluggish performance of its cereal products in the developed markets as well as a soft U.S. snacks business have been affecting the company.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities, along with product and packaging innovation. Also, revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe, the Parati acquisition in Brazil, better shipments, and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia.Meanwhile, cost-saving initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are somewhat compensating for the sales decline.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.32 billion indicates a 2% uptick on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a 1.9% year-over-year increase.Our proven model does not show that Kellogg is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Though net sales in the quarter is expected to gain from early Easter, overall top line looks somewhat under pressure from hurdles like the exit of certain low-margin Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) products, the shutdown of Boulder UK operations and soft underlying sales. Nevertheless, the company’s solid productivity initiatives aimed at generating savings and improving gross margin are commendable.The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 56 cents, which marks an improvement of 12% from 50 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales currently stands at $763.2 million, reflecting a decline from $766.1 million reported in the year-ago period.Our proven model does not show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

690,GIS,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, it surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.82%.The company’s top line remained subdued since 2014, primarily due to lower demand in North America. Particularly, sluggish performance of its cereal products in the developed markets as well as a soft U.S. snacks business have been affecting the company. Kellogg missed analysts’ expectations on sales in five of the past 11 quarters.The food industry in the region is experiencing changes in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. In fact, the food industry, including legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), has been displaying a dismal performance for quite some time.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Business in North America WeakThe North America business accounts for about more than 65% of Kellogg’s total revenues. Hence, it is evident that revenues generated from this segment largely impact overall sales of the company. The segment is further categorized into U.S. Morning Foods, U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty and North America Other.In the last reported quarter, Kellogg’s total North America sales declined 1.7% year over year to $2.1 billion (down 3.3% organically), owing to the exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system and continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal business (particularly in the health and wellness segment). Moreover, in 2017, sales declined 2.6% from the prior-year period (down 3% organically). The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America segment revenues is pegged at $2.3 billion, implying a 1.7% decline year over year. Conversely, these are likely to improve 7.5% sequentially.North America Business by SegmentU.S. Morning Foods:  Kellogg’s mainstay U.S. cereal business, accounting for 40-45% of sales, has been performing poorly for quite some time now. Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressure from other breakfast alternatives, including yogurt, eggs, bread and peanut butter, has been hurting category growth. In the last reported quarter, revenues slipped 4.9% and declined 5.2% in 2017. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter, with revenues likely to decline 4.6% year over year but improve 2.4% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.U.S. Snacks: This business has been struggling since 2013 due to weak volumes. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 5.8% from the year-ago level due to discontinued shipping through its DSD distribution system, reducing workforce, and exiting leases for its distribution centers, trucks, and other equipment and SKU rationalization. In 2017, the segment’s net sales dropped 4.1% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, with revenues likely to decline 5.9% year over year but improve 1.7% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.U.S. Specialty: This segment’s sales rose 2.1% in the last reported quarter, marking the 10th straight quarter of sales growth, given strength in the convenience and foodservice channels, such as K-12 schools. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Specialty segment revenues is pegged at $396 million, implying a 0.3% year-over-year and 37.5% sequential increase.North America Other: Segmental revenues grew 9.6% in the fourth quarter on contribution from frozen foods. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with revenues likely to increase 10.9% from the prior-year quarter and 5.8% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.Europe revenues in the first quarter are likely to witness 12.1% growth from the year-ago level but a decline of 6.5% from the prior quarter. However, revenues for Latin America are likely to witness a 0.9% decline from the year-ago level and 15.1% from the prior quarter. For Asia Pacific, revenues are expected to register 4.7% year-over-year rise in the quarter. Sequentially, revenues are expected to be in line.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.32 billion indicates a 2% uptick on a year-over-year basis. In 2017, net sales declined 0.7% (down 2.6% organically), with volumes down 3.1% as a result of soft consumption trends across most categories during the period.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities, along with product and packaging innovation. Also, revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe, the Parati acquisition in Brazil, better shipments, and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia.Meanwhile, cost-saving initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are somewhat compensating for the sales decline. Although the top line has been discouraging, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to lend support to the company’s bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also likely to subside, further supporting EPS growth.List price adjustments owing to its DSD transition and weak cereal volumes in the United States are gross margin headwinds in the first quarter. Higher logistic expenses also remain a drag. Expenses related to brand building initiatives are likely to hit operating margin to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings increased 5.5% year over year in the last reported quarter. Notably, the consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a 1.9% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Kellogg does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — that are required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kellogg is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

691,GIS,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from continued strength in its snacks and frozen products, higher net price realizations, and improved mix. However, inflation in commodity prices, and higher freight and logistics costs continue to hurt margins.Recently, the food giant reported third quarter of fiscal 2018 results, wherein the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same. Meanwhile, the company’s shares have plunged 26.5% in the last three months, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 12.6% decline.Earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have moved south by 4.7% and 1.3%, respectively, in the last seven days. The company’s weak sales growth trajectory and margin woes may impact the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters. A Look at the Company’s Sales Performance and OutlookGeneral Mills, like many other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic food. Management is trying to turn around the U.S. Retail business through consumer-focused innovation and marketing.After sales declined 3.5% in the fiscal first quarter, General Mills’ sales showed marked improvement in the fiscal second quarter. Total revenues of $4.2 billion grew 2.1% year over year, owing to higher sales across the board.General Mills also continued its sales growth momentum in fiscal third quarter. The company’s sales of $3.9 billion improved 2.3% from the prior-year quarter owing to higher sales across the board. Higher net price realizations and improved mix helped General Mills report improved sales performance. Favorable currency translation rates also supported its top line.The company’s legacy North America Retail segment’s revenues grew 1% to $2.52 billion due to 6% growth in the Canada operating unit, 3% in U.S. Snacks, and 2% in U.S. Meals & Baking business units. Continued strength in its snacks and frozen products has helped the company post better numbers. Moreover, the Soup and Baking segments also positively impacted the company’s sales.The company’s focus on consumer-focused innovation seems to be bearing fruits. New products like Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios, Oui by Yoplait, and Yoplait Mix-Ins have been generating solid demand. Nature Valley snack bars have also witnessed higher demand.That said, yogurt and cereals continue to remain a drag on its top line. Net sales were down 8% in the U.S. Yogurt and 1% in U.S. Cereal in the recently reported quarter. In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, U.S. Cereal net sales were down 1% and sales in the U.S. Cereal unit were down 14% from the year-ago level. While management is taking initiatives to reinvigorate this priority business through innovation and increased promotional support for new products, we are yet to see significant growth.For fiscal 2018, General Mills reiterated its sales guidance and expects its organic sales to remain flat. The company’s sales are expected to benefit from its new products as well as from its acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products. However, sales weakness in cereals and yogurt remain a headwind.Higher Costs to Compress MarginsGeneral Mills continues to disappoint on the margins front. Gross margin and operating margin contracted 250 basis points (bps) and 120 bps, respectively, in the fiscal third quarter. The downside was due to higher input, freight and manufacturing costs.A tepid sales environment, higher spending to support top-line growth and price competition among retailers are expected to hurt margins of the packaged food manufacturers like General Mills, Kellogg (K  -  Free Report), Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and others.General Mills expects inflation in commodity, transportation and other operational costs to adversely impact its fiscal 2018 margins. Hence, the company cut its operating profit and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. General Mills expects its operating profit to register a decline of 5-6% in fiscal 2018. Earlier, it had expected its operating profit to either decline 1% or remain flat.Also, the company, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has slashed its expectation for adjusted earnings per share (constant currency) growth from flat to up 1% versus prior expectation of 1-2% growth.

On a constant currency basis, earnings increased 8% benefiting from lower taxes and average shares outstanding.Adjusted earnings exclude certain items, influencing comparability of results. Including these items, reported earnings came in at $1.62 per share, reflecting a substantial increase from 61 cents a year ago.In-Line SalesTotal revenues of $3.882 billion were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.886 billion but improved 2.3% year over year, owing to higher sales across the board.Organically, excluding currency and acquisitions/divestures, sales increased 1%, same as the preceding quarter.Price/mix had a 1% positive impact on its quarterly revenues but volumes had a 1% unfavorable impact on sales. Currency had a 2% positive impact on quarterly revenues.General Mills, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  General Mills, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | General Mills, Inc. QuoteMargins DeclineAdjusted gross margin declined 250 basis points (bps) to 32.5% due to higher input costs. Increased freight and logistics expenses, commodity inflation, and other operational costs, as well as higher merchandising expenses also adversely impacted the gross margin.Adjusted operating margin also plunged 120 bps to 15.7%, owing to lower adjusted gross margins. However, lower selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses, and 22% decline in advertising and media expenses had partially offset the negatives.Segmental PerformanceNorth America Retail: Revenues from this segment grew 1% year over year to $2.52 billion due to 6% growth in the Canada operating unit, 3% in U.S. Snacks, and 2% in U.S. Meals & Baking business units. However, net sales were down 8% in the U.S. Yogurt and 1% in U.S. Cereal.Organic sales grew 1% versus flat growth in the prior quarter. Volumes increased 1%, but price/mix had a neutral impact on revenues.Segment operating profit remained unchanged from the prior-year quarter owing to higher input costs. This was offset by higher sales and lower SG&A expenses.Convenience Stores & Food Service: Revenues were up 3% year over year at $460 million. Growth in the Focus 6 platforms, including frozen meals, cereals and snacks, as well as benefits from market index pricing on bakery flour had a positive effect on the segment’s results. Organically, sales were up 3%, too. Volumes increased 1%, and price/mix had a 2% positive impact on revenues.However, segment operating profit decreased 10% from the year-ago level owing to higher input costs.Europe & Australia: On a year-over-year basis, the segment’s revenues improved 11% to $470 million, thanks to benefits from favorable foreign currency exchange and price/mix. However, organically, sales were down 1%.Foreign exchange and price/mix had a 12% and 2% favorable impact on revenues, respectively, in the quarter. However, volumes decreased 3%.However, the segment’s operating profit dropped 35.7% year over year. This was due to major input cost inflation.Asia & Latin America: Revenues were up 3% from the year-ago quarter to $435 million. The upside was mainly driven by a favorable currency impact (+3%). Organically, sales were at par with the year-ago level.While volumes were down 9%, price/mix had a favorable impact of 9% on the quarter’s results. Segment operating profit was down 80% year over year due to higher input costs, including currency-driven inflation and higher SG&A expenses.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceThe company expects organic sales growth between flat and down 1%. This reflects an improvement of 300-400 bps from fiscal 2017 results. Currency-related translation is likely to benefit net sales by 1%.The company has slashed its expectation for adjusted earnings per share (constant currency) growth from flat to up 1% versus prior expectation of 1-2% growth. In fiscal 2017, the company earned $3.08 per share. The company expects currency-related translation to have a 3-cents benefit (earlier it was one cent) on fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share.Total segment operating profit is now expected to decline 5-6%, compared to the previous expected range of down 1% to flat, on a constant-currency basis. This slashed view reflects higher-than-expected supply chain costs including freight and logistics, commodities, and other operational costs. The company expects to generate constant-currency total segment operating profit growth in the fourth quarter, driven by favorable net price realization mix and increased cost savings. Currency translation is expected to add 1 point to full-year total segment’s operating profit growth. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksGeneral Mills carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can consider a few other top-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples sector that include Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report), Medifast, Inc.

694,GIS,"As prevention is better than cure, it is prudent to dump losing stocks at the right time than regret later. Incidentally, The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has seen its shares slump more than 30% in the past year, significantly wider than the industry’s 2.4% dip. This leading consumer packaged food company has been bearing the brunt of shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food, which has been denting its sales for long.What’s Affecting Kraft Heinz?The company has been seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. The food industry has been struggling in the face of numerous issues. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share with packaged food items losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making sales growth difficult to come by.Consumption trends in a number of its key categories like ready-to-drink beverages, frozen meals and salad dressings are on the decline.In 2017, net sales of $26.2 billion declined 1.1% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. Two of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the biggest decline in Canada (down 5.2%). The United States registered a decline of 1.5% in sales. Organically, sales declined 1.5% in the United States and 7% in Canada.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of net sales, needs sustained improvement for the company to return to healthy growth.These factors have made analysts hesitant about Kraft Heinz, as evident from the downtrend in estimates. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and 2018 went down from 94 cents to 84 cents and from $3.94 to $3.85, respectively, over the past 60 days. Though the company is undertaking cost savings and productivity improvements and innovating in line with consumer preference, the efforts are yet to reap significant benefits. This makes the road ahead bumpy for Kraft Heinz.Not All is Lost for the Food IndustryIn order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channelling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Again, some companies are also going for co-branding to boost sales. Cereal Partners Worldwide deserves special mention. General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) formed a joint venture with Nestle called Cereal Partners Worldwide, which serves customers in more than 130 global markets. Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) teamed up yet again with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.Moreover, the overall economy appears to be in good shape, driven by an improved labor market, higher consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and increased business investments.4 Food Stocks That Are Better PlacedRanked among the top 40% of all Zacks industries, the Zacks Food-miscellaneous Industry space has some bright spots for investors to put their funds in. Despite the headwinds looming over the industry, several firms have managed to stay afloat, gaining from strategic endeavors to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and the improved economic scenario. Using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four food stocks that have been performing well. These stocks have outpaced the industry in the past year and are well poised for the long term. Additionally, these stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank.US Foods Holding Corp. (USFD  -  Free Report) has rallied 29.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 climbed 15.2% over the past 60 days. Earnings for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock are expected to grow 48.6% in 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investors can also count on Medifast, Inc.

Encouragingly, the stock has gained 112.1%, cruising ahead of the industry.We also suggest investing in Darling Ingredients Inc. (DAR  -  Free Report). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 rose 58.7% over the past 60 days. Shares have jumped 26.2% in the past year. Also, Darling Ingredients has impressive earnings per share growth rate of over 100% in 2018. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Finally, we suggest investing in United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1. The company has delivered positive earnings surprise in all the past four quarters. Estimates for fiscal 2018 trended upward from $2.82 to $3.06 over the past 60 days.  Earnings for fiscal 2018 are expected to grow 19.1%. Notably, the company has seen its shares rise almost 1% in the past year, faring way better than the industry.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

696,GIS,"The consumer environment looks rosy owing to favorable jobs scenario, increased consumer spending, rise in Consumer Confidence Index and an improving economy. However, shifting demographics, changing consumer preference and technology advancements continue to pose threats for the sectors where consumers’ are the main driving force.Which are the sectors that are impacted the most by this trend? Let’s find out.Well, one most prominent sector in the lot is Consumer Staples, which deals in essential and non-durable goods that form a part of our daily lives. Products ranging from everyday grocery, food items, beverages, tobacco, and other household essentials generally make up this sector’s business. Notably, highly competitive environment, shift in preference towards organic food products, new store formats and evolving business models are major challenges plaguing the sector.Consequences of These HeadwindsWhen discussing the consequences, we can rightly quote the example of the grocery industry, which is a key segment of this sector. The industry has been grappling with intense competition, highly promotional landscape and change in customers’ taste resulting in the increased demand for organic products.As we all know, competition in the traditional grocery space mainly relates to strengthening franchises and shift to low-priced private label brands. Further, the recent intrusion of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. on Aug 28 has intensified the competition. Following this, Amazon has started slashing the prices of Whole Foods’, giving its brick-and-mortar rivals goose bumps.Moreover, as quoted earlier, change in consumer tastes to healthy products has significantly altered the fate of the food industry, where the canned products and packaged goods are falling out of customers’ favor. The impact of this trend can be clearly seen in the performance of Campbell Soup Company, which is struggling to find a place in customers’ carts for its canned soup products. This is also true for other categories, including Cereal, which is also witnessing a decline.Additionally, packaged-food manufacturers are struggling to get the right promotional pacts in place with grocery retailers and other vendors. This has left them scrambling to occupy the center grocery aisle in a store. Some retailers battling for protecting shelf space are Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report), General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), and Campbell Soup.These challenges have left industry players scrambling for options to improve businesses. Apart from protecting shelf space, the food industry is feeling the pressures of some serious price wars, lower market share, diversifying products, and exploring acquisitions and mergers.Other headwinds like strained margins, high operating expenses, declining volumes, slowing emerging markets growth, uncertain international markets and foreign currency impacts may also hinder growth.How the Consumer Staples Sector is Placed?We note that the Consumer Staples sector has been underperforming the S&P 500 market lately. In the last six months, the sector recorded 3.2% growth, a notch below the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 5.2%. However, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #7 (out of 16), placing it at the top 44% of the Zacks Classified sectors.While the sector Rank is encouraging, its dismal performance relative to the S&P 500 Index makes us cautious about placing bets in the sector.Earnings Trend for Sector PlayersThe second-quarter earnings season, which marked the second straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500, is well behind us.Shedding light on the Consumer Staples sector, the aforementioned challenges surely call for a tough quarterly performance for industry players. We note that many major sector participants came up with dismal earnings for the quarter and slashed their forward outlooks. Further, estimates for these companies declined considerably following the earnings.Also, as is the general case, share prices of these companies have plunged following the dismal results. These factors considerably reduce the visibility for these stocks to beat estimates in the quarter ahead.Surely, investing in companies that deliver positive surprises can fetch handsome returns for investors. On the flip side, investors prefer to sideline stocks that have a dismal surprise trend to avoid portfolio mishaps.Here is the key to any investment portfolio, picking the most lucrative stocks and doing away with stocks that have little visibility.Consumer Staples Stocks to Avoid After Earnings SlumpHence, we bring you five stocks from the Consumer Staples sector that have disappointed in the most recent quarter and witnessed decline in share price following the results. We suggest avoiding these stocks, which also carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell), possess a negative surprise trend and have witnessed downward estimate revisions.First on the list is Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), a global direct-selling beauty company offering cosmetics, fragrances, toiletries, jewelry, and accessories. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #5 and reported negative earnings surprise of 150% in second-quarter 2017. Results for the most recent quarter were primarily impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter. Another major setback for the company has been weak Active Representatives growth, which is hurting results for the past few quarters. The company has lagged earnings estimates for four consecutive quarters, with an average miss of 90.7%. Additionally, estimate for the current fiscal has declined 55% to 9 cents per share in the last 60 days. Moreover, the stock declined a solid 25.9% since reporting dismal earnings on Aug 3, underperforming the industry’s 1.7% gain.Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and earnings miss of 5.5% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, is also in the red. This worldwide manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters, reporting an average negative surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters. Much of this debacle could be attributed to a difficult packaged food industry landscape, where sales have been soft due to consumers changing food preferences, evolving shopping trends and tough retail environment. Also, the company expects a tough operating scenario in fiscal 2018, which led to a cautious view. Estimate for the current fiscal has declined 3.7% to $3.10 per share in the last 30 days. Further, the stock has fallen 5% since reporting results on Aug 31, against the industry’s 1.1% upside.Another stock to avoid is Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report), a leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States as well as a leading manufacturer of various specialty food products. The stock has declined 26.1% since posting dismal second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, wider than the industry’s fall of 23.9%. Moreover, the company has reported negative earnings surprise in four of the last five quarters, with an average four-quarter miss of 15.2%. The company has been facing a tough retailing on account of fast-evolving consumer trends. Moreover, Dean Foods’ volumes have been under pressure due to stiff competition and macro factors. These factors, along with high raw milk costs led the company to post a negative surprise of 30% in the second quarter. Estimate of 85 cents per share for full-year 2017 has declined 37% in the last 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Next is B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report), the manufacturer, seller and distributor a portfolio of shelf-stable, and frozen food and household products in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 16.3% in second-quarter 2017, mainly hurt by industry-wide challenges. Further, it lowered adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017. The company has an average negative surprise of 8.1% in the trailing four quarters. Further, estimates for 2017 dipped 1.9% to $2.12 per share in the last 30 days. This Zacks Rank #4 company has declined 3.4% since reporting second-quarter results on Aug 4, underperforming the industry’s 2.6% downside.Lastly, we would suggest avoiding Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (SPB  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and a negative earnings surprise of 10.9% in third-quarter fiscal 2017. The lower-than-expected results were due to lower volumes, foreign currency headwinds and soft sales at personal care and small appliances segments. This consumer products company has reported earnings miss in the last two quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.7% in the trailing four quarters. Moreover, estimate for the current fiscal has fallen 0.4% to $5.57 per share in the last 30 days. Further, the stock has fallen 14.5% since reporting earnings on Jul 27, compared with the industry’s 5.7% declineLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

697,GIS,"Shares of Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) got canned on Thursday after the company reported both fourth quarter and full-year sales declines. Campbell’s poor performance also helped send the rest of the packaged food industry lower, nearly across the board.Campbell’s fourth-quarter revenues fell by 1% from the year-ago period to $1.664 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.689 billion. The company also failed to meet our earnings estimates, posting earnings of $0.52 a share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55.The canned soup giant’s full-year sales dipped by 1% to $7.890 billion, based mostly on an overall drop in organic sales due to lower volume and greater promotional spending. Campbell’s now projects that full-year revenues could fall by as much as 2% next year.“The operating environment for the packaged foods industry remains challenging due to shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food, the adoption of new shopping behaviors and the dynamic retailer landscape,” Campbell’s President and CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement. “In these times, sales growth remains a challenge.”The CEO noted that drastically changing consumer shopping trends have greatly impacted the company’s non-refrigerated canned and bottled goods sales, which are now seemingly outdated. Morrison also pointed to the rise of self-cooking delivery companies, such as Blue Apron (APRN), as well as an increase of private label brands, as major reasons for Campbell’s poor sales.Campbell’s biggest business sector, its soup and juice division, saw its sales sink 3% in its fourth-quarter. Sales of its packaged snack segment, including Pepperidge Farm and Goldfish, were flat. On the bright side, Campbell’s Bolthouse Farms fresh food sector experienced a 1% gain.Still, Thursday’s report marked Campbell’s 11th straight quarterof falling sales. Campbell’s stock tanked by over 7% and touched a new two-year intraday trading low of $46.43 a share.Packaged Food Industry  Campbell’s rough day helped send the rest of the packaged food industry down overall, as the soup maker’s predicament is hardly unique. With companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) growing larger, brands hold less and less leverage in price negotiations.“Right now, the retailers, they’re doing better in this round of the fight,” Warren Buffett said in a recent interview with CNBC.Buffett, an investor and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) board member, saw shares of the packaged food powerhouse fall 1.72% on Thursday. Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) stock dropped by 2.03%, while shares of Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) dipped 0.82%.Shares of General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) both sunk to new 52-week intraday   lows. B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) also hit a new 52-week low, while Hormel Foods (HRL  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices dip marginally.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

698,GIS,"The first-quarter earnings season is past the halfway mark, with more than 900 companies including 142 S&P 500 members due to report results this week.According to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 267 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 27, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25.1% year over year on more than 10% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 73.8% beat revenue expectations.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to increase 22.6% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues. Total earnings for consumer staples companies are expected to grow 6.8% while revenues are likely to increase 3.1% in the first quarter of 2018.Some of the key players in the sector — Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) — have already released their quarterly numbers. Procter & Gamble, popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.PepsiCo reported first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise for the company. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.Coca-Cola started 2018 on a strong note, beating the consensus mark on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The Oreo-maker surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The food industry within the consumer staples sector has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the past few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, a shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat) and consumer dynamics (such as increased need for portable and on-the-go products), demographic shifts and also a shift in demand for low-priced products.Mondelez, like other legacy brands including General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014.Nonetheless, in order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Mondelez’s to-be-reported quarter’s results are likely to gain from its Power Brands, favorable trends in emerging markets, higher pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, indicating a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Aid Mondelez's Q1 Earnings?) Mondelez International, Inc.

QuoteArcher-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is a leading food processing company. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.14%. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. Archer Daniels sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Archer Daniels has a dismal surprise history. In fact, the company has been lagging sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14.52 billion, down 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprise in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.However, Archer Daniels’ focus on cost savings to strengthen its business has been offsetting the sales headwind to some extent. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 50 cents for the quarter under review reflects a decline of 16.7% year over year.

699,GIS,"General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) shares have lost 26.2% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 7.7%. This can be blamed on input cost inflation, which remains a threat to the company’s margins and is a major hurdle for the overall food space. Markedly, the Zacks Food-Miscellaneous industry is placed among the bottom 16% out of more than 250 Zacks industries.Coming back to General Mills, the company has also been suffering lackluster sales at its U.S. Retail Segment, particularly due to softness in Yogurt category. Recently, the U.S. Yogurt category witnessed a 5% and 12% drop in sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018, respectively. Nonetheless, the company is on track to restructure this category through fundamental innovation. This is also one of General Mills’ four key global strategies to drive sales.Moving to the other core initiatives, the company plans to focus more on growing its cereal business. For that, General Mills plans to introduce new product varieties to its global product portfolio. Further, the company’s strategy focuses on driving differential growth across several global platforms where it has already witnessed solid revenue (roughly $4 billion) momentum. The platforms include Häagen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars (primarily under Nature Valley), Fiber 1 and Larabar brands, Old El Paso Mexican foods, and its natural and organic brands in North America.Investing in its Foundation businesses (includes refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes etc.) is also a priority for fiscal 2018. Apart from these four key priorities, the company is focused on improving its e-commerce channel, given its rapid acceleration. E-commerce already represents about 1.5% of the company's total sales in the United States as of fiscal 2017 and it is expected to grow 5% by fiscal 2020. The company’s U.S. e-commerce business grew nearly 70% in fiscal 2018, while its global e-commerce sales surged 50%.These endeavors, along with General Mills’ robust cost-saving initiatives should provide some cushion to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company and help it uplift investors’ sentiment.Notably, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, further supply-chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business. All of this together will result in accelerated margin expansion for the company. Further, General Mills remains on track with its Holistic Margin Management (HMM), which is expected to generate greater savings this year. Management expects cost of goods sold and HMM savings of roughly $450 million in fiscal 2019. These initiatives will help the company battle input cost inflation and costs related to additional growth investments in fiscal 2019.Check Out These Solid Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.

"
701,GIS,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, after market close.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, including legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been displaying a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales.Let’s Have a Look at Mondelez’s Past PerformanceMondelez witnessed a decline in revenues in nine out of the last 11 quarters, primarily due to lower demand. Mondelez’s sales were down 0.1% and its volumes decreased 0.6 percentage points (pp) in 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has declined more than 9% in the past year, compared with its industry decline of 15.3%.In the last reported quarter, Mondelez’s net revenues increased 2.9%, courtesy of the Power Brands and favorable trends in emerging markets. Emerging markets’ net revenues rose 6.3% and the Power Brands witnessed a 3.7% increase in revenues.Regionally, Latin America, Asia, Middle East & Africa (AMEA) and Europe registered an increase of 4.2%, 2.6% and 5% in revenues, respectively. However, North America’s revenues declined 0.6%.Organic revenues increased 2.4%, softer than 2.8% in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement was primarily driven by the Power Brands as well as strong performance in Latin America and Asia, Middle East & Africa.Pricing increased 2.1 pp, more than 1.5 pp in the preceding quarter. Volume/Mix had a positive impact of 0.3 pp on the revenues. In the third quarter, it was 1.3 pp.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q1In order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital.Mondelez’s advertisement spend is biased toward the high-margin Power Brands. Mondelez is increasing investments in in-store execution and advertising to support the Power Brands and innovation, funded by cost savings from its restructuring plans. The company is thereby reaping benefits from the Power Brands that include Oreo, Cadbury Diary Milk, Halls and Tang. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, with improved volumes in its Power Brands. Higher sales from its wellness product portfolio are also anticipated to support its revenue growth. Further, improvements in China, Europe, Russia and India, along with strong pricing in the emerging markets are added positives. Notably, the company has been experiencing improvements in the emerging markets.However, softness in North America due to a tough retail environment will mar the growth rate to some extent.Segment Wise: Mondelez’s Europe revenues, comprising about 37.8% of the total revenues, are likely to witness 8.5% decrease sequentially but 6% year-over-year improvement to $2.6 billion, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. North America segment, comprising about 26.2% of the total revenues, is expected to witness $1.64 billion of revenues in the first quarter, compared with $1.8 billion in the last reported quarter and $1.65 billion in the year-ago period.Latin America revenues of $921 million indicate an increase from $900 million in the preceding quarter and $910 million in the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in nine of the past 11 quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has managed to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.However, higher commodity prices, primarily on dairy products, and increased trade spending are likely to adversely impact its gross margins. Then again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, productivity savings and lower overhead costs are expected to boost its operating margin.Overall, first-quarter bottom line is expected to witness solid growth from higher pricing, higher volumes, as well as lower overhead and increased productivity savings, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.Mondelez International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mondelez International, Inc.

On a constant currency basis, earnings jumped 7%, benefiting from improved adjusted operating profit.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | General Mills, Inc. QuoteIncluding one-time items, earnings came in at 59 cents per share, reflecting a 14.5% decrease from 61 cents in the year ago.

Organic sales increased 1%, same as the preceding quarter. Organic sales growth was fueled by organic net price realization and mix in all segments, somewhat countered by reduced organic volumes across all segments, barring Convenience Stores & Food Service.Price/mix had a 3-point positive impact on its quarterly revenues, but volumes had a 2-point unfavorable impact on sales. Currency had a 1-point positive impact on quarterly revenues.Margins Adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points (bps) to 35.8% on the back of improved net price realization and mix, along with gains from productivity initiatives such as the company’s recently executed global sourcing program.Adjusted operating margin also grew 170 bps to 18.5%, courtesy of improved adjusted gross margins and reduced SG&A costs.Segmental PerformanceNorth America Retail: Revenues from this segment remained almost flat year over year at $2,388 million. The segment noted 2% growth in U.S. Snacks and U.S. Cereal business units, while U.S. Meals & Baking and U.S. Yogurt business units dipped 2% and 5%, respectively. At the Canada unit, sales remained flat with the year-ago period. Organic sales slipped 1%.Segment operating profit rose 7% on the back of coast-saving efforts and reduced SG&A costs, partly countered by input cost inflation.Convenience Stores & Food Service: Revenues were up 4.7% year over year at $510.6 million. Growth in the Focus 6 platforms, including frozen meals and snacks, together with gains from market index pricing on bakery flour, had a positive effect on the segment’s results. Organically, sales were up 5%.Segment operating profit jumped 11% from the year-ago level, backed by improved net price realization and mix, and gains from cost-saving efforts. However, input cost inflation was a hurdle.Europe & Australia: On a year-over-year basis, the segment’s revenues improved 14% to $556 million, thanks to benefits from favorable currency movements, and better net price realization and mix. Further, sales rose 4% on an organic basis. Increased sales of snack bars, ice creams and Mexican food was partly countered by soft yogurt sales.However, the segment’s operating profit jumped 37% on a constant-currency basis. This was due to improved net price realization and mix, along with solid cost-saving efforts.Asia & Latin America: Revenues dipped 1% to $435 million, due to difficult year-over-year comparisons. This was somewhat cushioned by underlying volume growth and gains from net price realization and mix. Organic sales remained flat year over year.Segment operating profit was down 54.5% year over year, due to greater input costs, elevated SG&A costs and impacts from differences in the reporting period.Other Financial AspectsThe company ended fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $399 million, long-term debt of $12,668.7 million and total shareholders’ equity of $6,141.1 million.General Mills generated $2,841.0 million as net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2018, which reflected an 18% growth from the year-ago period. The company made capital investments worth $623 million.Further, General Mills paid dividends of roughly $1.14 billion, while it repurchased nearly 11 million shares for $602 million.Other DevelopmentsThe company concluded the buyout of Blue Buffalo on Apr 24, 2018. Results of this business will be included in General Mills’ operations, under a new “Pet” segment in the forthcoming periods.Constant-currency sales from joint ventures of Cereal Partners Worldwide and Häagen-Dazs Japan went down 2% each, in the fourth quarter.Fiscal 2019 GuidanceManagement remains pleased with its fiscal 2018 performance, wherein the company returned to top-line growth. General Mills witnessed organic sales growth, in each of the last three quarters, on the back of solid innovation, effective marketing and in-store execution. Also, the company remains on track to reshape its portfolio, evident from its buyout of the fast-growing and profitable Blue Buffalo business. In fiscal 2019, management remains focused on its Consumer First strategy as well as working toward its global growth plans to enhance its sales momentum.All said, the company expects organic sales growth in a range of flat to increase 1%. Including Blue Buffalo’s buyout, net sales are anticipated to rise 9-10%.Adjusted operating profit (on a constant-currency basis) is expected to jump 6-9% year over year. Finally, the company envisions adjusted earnings per share (constant currency) growth in a range of 3% decline to flat, compared with the fiscal 2018 figure of $3.11. This takes into account a 4 cents negative impact from the buyout of Blue Buffalo.Check These Solid Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.

704,GIS,"Castle Brands Inc. (ROX  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company reported in-line results.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to ConsiderIn March, Castle Brands made a strategic investment for an additional 20.1% stake in its affiliate Gosling-Castle Partners Inc. or GCP. Castle Brands has now beefed up its ownership in GCP to 80.1% and extended the terms of the agreement through Mar 2030, with 10-year renewal terms from then on. Sales of Goslings Rum and Beer have increased in the U.S. and internationally since the formation of GCP in 2005. Now, with the increase in ownership, Castle Brands’ strong sales and marketing initiatives are expected to boost Goslings Rum and Beer sales. This will help expand Castle Brands consumer base, thus driving profits.Castle Brands is also poised to benefit from the National Supply Agreement with Walmart to supply Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer and Goslings Stormy Diet Ginger Beer to all Walmart stores in the U.S.  This fortifies Castle Brands’ position in the U.S. market.For fiscal 2017, Castle Brands net sales increased 7% year over year, driven by solid improvement in Jefferson's bourbons and Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer. This solid momentum is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2018. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $18.18 million, implying an 8.5% increase.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show that Castle Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

706,GIS,"Shares of Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), a U.S. food and beverage company, tumbled as much as 3.6% to $40.39 in the intraday trading on Aug 30 after billionaire investor Warren Buffett crushed rumors of The Kraft Heinz Company’s (KHC  -  Free Report) interest in acquiring Mondelez.While speaking to CNBC, when asked if Kraft Heinz, in which Buffett holds a 26.7% stake, would be interested to take over the Oreos and Triscuits maker, Buffett told CNBC, “I think the answer is no on that.”Analysts have been long speculating that Kraft Heinz would pursue another acquisition after the company’s failed $143 billion bid to take over Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) earlier this year. The obvious choice was Mondelez, as it was once part of Kraft until it was spun off into a separate snack food company in 2012 to focus more on international markets.Investors should note that Unilever rejected Kraft Heinz’s $143 billion merger proposal in February stating that that there is no financial or strategical merit in it. As a result, Kraft Heinz withdrew its offer. Initially, Kraft Heinz made clear its intentions of working out a deal for the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever.Meanwhile, Mondelez has been witnessing weak volumes since 2014 because of lower demand. In fact, Mondelez has been witnessing sluggish sales results ever since it split from Kraft Foods due to global snacking category slowdown.Mondelez’s volumes were down 0.3% in 2016 and 2.1% in the first half of 2017. The company’s net revenues declined 2.8% in the first six months of 2017. Even, Kraft Heinz has been witnessing top-line weakness for the past several quarters. Its reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year in the first six months of 2017 due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada.Mondelez and Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, have been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. Another company, General Mills, Inc.’s (GIS  -  Free Report) sales too have declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and the company’s slowing organic volumes are overshadowing minor improvements in profit margins.Mondelez’s shares have lost 5.5% so far this year, compared with the 9% dip of its industry. Earnings estimates moved down 1.8% for the current quarter over the last 30 days. Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz shares have lost 6.7% year to date.Zacks RankWhile Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Kraft Heinz hold a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

707,GIS,"Shares of major packaged food companies have been trading lower since June as investors fear that Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) $13.7 billion buyout of the organic grocer Whole Foods Market, Inc.  would make a seismic shift for retailers.Shares of a number of grocery store chains, including The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report), dipped on Aug 28, after the deal officially came into effect. The deal was announced in mid-June. Losses spread across the food sector and shares of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Post Holdings Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and Treehouse Foods Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) tumbled as well.Traditional packaged food brands such as General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg and Conagra are already struggling, as consumers look for fresh foods and more natural brands over packaged and processed food.Kraft Heinz has been witnessing top-line weakness for the past several quarters. Its reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year in the first six months of 2017 due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. For Kellogg, net sales declined 3.3% year over year due to foreign currency headwind and weak volume (down 5.3%) as a result of unexpectedly soft consumption trends across most categories during the period. General Mills' sales too have declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and the company’s slowing organic volumes are overshadowing minor improvements in profit margins.That said, these major packaged food companies have been fighting the sales slump with consumer-focused innovation, marketing initiatives and robust restructuring savings.For General Mills, adjusted gross margin advanced 50 basis points or bps and adjusted operating margin increased 130 bps in fiscal 2017. Again, cost savings from its Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) have been supporting renovation, innovation, brand support and margins for Kellogg. Kraft Heinz realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.45 billion from its Integration Program as of second-quarter 2017.Amazon's foray into brick-and-mortar stores is now likely to step up fresh price wars for these companies’ products, both in stores and online. Amazon’s as much as 43% price cut on Whole Foods’ products on its first day as the owner of this organic grocer could be distressing for the entire food industry. Prices of a number of products, ranging from avocados to organic chicken, were cut.Bottom LineDespite traditional packaged food companies taking a number of initiatives to boost sales, the weakness in this area continues. Amid this uproar, how these food biggies deal with the latest Amazon-Whole Foods merger is a wait-and-see story.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

708,GIS,"The time is ripe for picking chocolate stocks as cocoa prices continue to melt down. This is primarily due to copious supply and fading demand, as growing health consciousness continues to grip consumers. As per a recent Bernstein research, the price of cocoa has plunged 37% since last summer and is expected to trickle down for the next few years.This makes The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, a special treat for chocolate investors.Analyst Alexia Howard of Bernstein stated, “Easing cocoa prices could be a major tailwind as we move out into 2018, more than offsetting the relatively mild inflation in dairy prices.” This is assuming that cocoa comprises an estimated 10% to 15% of Hershey’s cost of goods sold or COGS. Also, considering that cocoa will account for 10% of Hershey COGS, Howard's estimates a 30% decline in input prices, which in turn is likely to boost gross margin to 47.8% from 46.2% in a year, thereby lifting earnings per share by 8.6% or 42 cents.Moreover, Howard’s thesis is backed by the U.S. chocolate industry’s growth prospects driven by the snacking trends among millennials and more product innovation, as Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) increased its competition.What Hershey’s Q2 Numbers Have to SayHershey’s second-quarter 2017 earnings per share improved from the year-ago profit level by 28.2%, driven by higher sales, solid gross margin expansion and operating income improvement in the International segment.More precisely, the company’s adjusted gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 47.1%. The company stressed that this upside was driven by supply chain productivity, cost-saving initiatives and lower input costs. For the full year, the chocolate maker also expects adjusted gross margin to rise about 50 bps, buoyed by lower input costs (higher than earlier anticipated) and by productivity and cost-savings initiatives. These positives is likely to offset fixed costs volume absorption due to lower sales, unfavorable product mix and the rollout of new packaging formats.It is to be borne in mind, Hershey has been reporting weak top-line growth for the last few years due to persistent macroeconomic challenges in China as well as a shift in consumer preference toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat. As a result, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers such as Mondelez, B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been grappling with declining demand.That said, the company’s net sales improved 1.5% year over year in the second quarter owing to strong performance by the North America segment and the acquisition of barkTHINS brand. This marks the fifth straight quarter of sales rise after a few quarters of no growth.Again, adjusted operating profit increased about 16.9% from the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 20.8%, an increase of 270 basis points. The increase was driven by higher gross profit and lower SG&A due to productivity and cost savings.Other Relevant MetricsHershey’s shares have gained 1.7% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 22.5%. Estimates for 2017 and 2018 have remained stable over the last 30 days. Hershey has been able to beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 10.35%. The company’s productivity improvements and cost-saving initiatives should drive the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, sales and earnings for the current year is expected to increase nearly 1.1% and 8.9%, respectively. This top-line as well as bottom-line performance is reflected in the growth style score ranked B. Overall, Hershey has a VGM Score of B.Hershey’s ROE of 119.7% compared with the industry average of 9.7% manifests the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. Again, based on last day's closing price of $105.16 per share, the company's current dividend yield is 2.49%, a lot higher than the industry’s 0.00%.Hence, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has good prospects and is expected to make value addition to your portfolio.

709,GIS,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 results wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but missed the same on revenues. Notably, the company’s shares increased 1.14% in after-hours trading on Aug 3, in response to better-than-expected earnings results.EarningsAdjusted earnings per share of 98 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents by 2.1%. Earnings grew 15.3% year over year on significant gains because of cost-savings initiatives.SalesReported sales of $6.68 billion fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.69 billion marginally by 0.2% and also declined 1.7% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. Notably, Kraft Heinz’s sales have now declined in five of the last six quarters and the company expects sales growth to ramp up in the second half of 2017. The reported figure includes an unfavorable 0.8% impact from currency.Organically (excluding currency), sales declined 0.9%.Volume/mix decreased 0.5% in the quarter against a 3.7% decrease in the previous quarter. The slump was due to weak demand of cheese, meats, and food services in its biggest market, the U.S. However, these were partly offset by positive contributions from condiments and sauces in all business segments. Pricing declined 0.4% in the quarter compared with 1% increase in the preceding quarter.The company has been witnessing weakness in top line for the last several quarters. Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid changes in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) among others, have been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food.Operating HighlightsGross profit of $2.68 billion was up 5.9% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA was up 0.7% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter owing to cost initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.2%.Quarterly Segment DiscussionU.S.: Net sales of $4.6 billion declined 1.2% year over year. Organic sales dropped 1.2% on lower volumes. Volume/mix decreased 0.8% in the quarter comparison with 4.2% decrease in the last quarter. Pricing was down 0.4%.The downside was primarily due to select distribution losses in cheese and meats as well as lower shipments in foodservice that overshadowed the benefits from a shift in Easter-related sales as well as gains in frozen, macaroni and cheese, and condiments and sauces.Canada: Net sales of $597 million declined 6.4% year over year despite a 3.3% favorable impact from currency. Organically, its sales declined 3.1%. Volume/mix grew 0.6% attributable to growth in condiments and sauces that more than offset the discontinuation of select cheese products. Pricing decreased 3.7%.Europe: Net sales of $595 million declined 4.9% year over year due to 4.1% currency headwinds. Organically, sales fell 0.8% amid a challenging consumer and retail environment.

710,GIS,"B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, after market close.Last quarter, this NJ-based shelf-stable and frozen food company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.45%. However, the company surpassed estimates in three of the past four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.95%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderA look at estimate revisions lends us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share remained stable over the past 30 days at 49 cents. This reflects a year-over-year decrease of 41.9%. The stock also saw dismal trading over the past three months, with the share price slipping 11.7%.B&G Foods’ weak base business growth raises concern. The company's base sales declined 2% in 2016 and 2.4% in the first quarter of 2017, thanks to declining unit volumes. Also, the North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption over the last few quarters due to a shift in consumer preference toward healthier options.Meanwhile, we are encouraged by the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy, cost-saving initiatives and productivity improvements. In 2016, the company's sales increased 44%, while in the first quarter it had risen 18.4%. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $382.70 million, implying a 24.9% increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that B&G Foods will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.79, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.General Mills, which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $3.89 billion for the quarter ended May 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.51%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.81 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.It remains to be seen how the recently released numbers will impact the stock price, and the immediate price movement will reflect how these results and management's commentary on the earnings call help shape expectations for the coming quarter(s).General Mills shares have lost about 22.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.9%.What's Next for General Mills?While General Mills has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for General Mills was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.75 on $4.15 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.10 on $17.26 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Food - Miscellaneous is currently in the bottom 17% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

712,GIS,"Shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) rallied 9.4% yesterday on hearsay of a possible takeover by The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report). While both companies remained silent, sources revealed that Kraft Heinz looks keenly interested in buying Campbell Soup, which has been struggling with its soups and C-Fresh businesses for quite some time.These headwinds have been hurting Campbell’s top line for more than a year now, as a result of which this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has tumbled 17.7% in a year, wider than the industry’s decline of 7.3%. Also, Campbell is struggling with strained gross margins, due to input cost inflation, escalated supply-chain expenses (particularly in C-Fresh) and promotional spending (especially in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages).These factors, along with a soft C-Fresh performance, led to a disappointing third-quarter fiscal 2018. Unfortunately, management expects its ongoing challenges to persist, which along with its increased investment spending is likely to hurt fiscal 2019 performance. These factors led to a lowered earnings outlook for fiscal 2019.However, during the third-quarter conference call, Campbell’s interim CEO, Keith McLoughlin, revealed plans to bring the company back on track by carrying out a complete review of the company’s strategic plans, portfolio alignment, resource allocation and cost of capital, among others. Per sources, this strategic business review could also include a conceivable divestiture or division of the company’s operations. In fact, there have been speculations that apart from Kraft Heinz, Campbell could also get buyout proposals from General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), if it puts itself up for sale.As for the alleged buyout by Kraft Heinz, reports suggest that Campbell may not be a strategic fit for the company. This is because Kraft Heinz itself has been struggling with its top line, owing to shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. Thus, adding Campbell may not solve Kraft Heinz’ top-line issue, though it may augment the latter’s bottom line. Notably, Kraft Heinz has been making constant attempts to enhance its performance, through cost and productivity improvement efforts along with innovation and marketing strategies.All said, let’s see what’s in store for these food companies and if the aforementioned speculations actually surface. Talking of speculations, we had another one on similar lines, last week. Incidentally, there were rounds that Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) is trying to strike a deal to buy Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report). If the consolidation materializes, it is likely to create a robust frozen foods entity, at a time when demand for this category is booming. However, both Conagra and Pinnacle Foods remained silent on the matter.While Conagra has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), both Pinnacle Foods and Kraft Heinz carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

713,GIS,"We still have a few more weeks to go before the big banks start reporting June-quarter results. But the Q2 reporting cycle has (officially) gotten underway, with results from 9 S&P 500 members already out. All of these early earnings releases are from companies that have fiscal quarters ending in May, but these get counted as part of the June-quarter tally.We have another 11 index members with fiscal quarters ending in May on deck to report results this week. All in all, we will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members by the time JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) (unofficially) kick-off this earnings season on July 13th.The notable earnings reports coming out this week include:Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reports on Tuesday (6/26) before the market’s open, with the homebuilder expected to earn $0.45 per share in earnings on $5.23 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.91 per share on $3.26 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock was up big following the last earnings release, but overall it has been a tough period for Lennar shares as well as the broader homebuilder space.Lennar shares are currently trading close to 52-week lows and are now down -18.8% since the start of the year, underperforming the Zacks Construction sector’s -8.1% year-to-date decline vs. the S&P 500 index’s +4% gain. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to report results Thursday morning (06/28) is down even more than Lennar (down -19.9% YTD).    General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) reports on Wednesday (6/27) morning, with the company expected to earn $0.75 per share on $3.91 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.73 per share on $3.81 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have come down a bit in recent days and the stock has lost ground following each of the last two earnings reports. The stock was down big in the run up to and the day of the last earning release on March 21st and has essentially remained flat since then. General Mills shares are currently down -22.3% since the start of the year, underperforming the struggling Consumer Staples sector’s -10.3% year-to-date decline.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) reports after the market’s close on Thursday (6/28), with the company expected to earn $0.64 in EPS on $9.39 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.60 EPS on $8.68 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock was down following each of the last three earning releases, but has been an impressive performer this year, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector as well as the broader market. Nike shares are currently trading close to their 52-high and are up +18.6% vs. the Consumer Discretionary sector’s +4.7% year-to-date period.Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will report before the market’s open on Thursday (6/28), with the company expected to earn $1.71 per share in earnings on $10.02 billion in revenues, up +12.5% and +13% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Accenture has been spotlighting its opportunity in the digital, cloud and security areas in recent quarters and revenues from those areas should show strong momentum in this release as well. Management’s commentary about technology spending trends typically has read through for IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The stock was down big following the last quarterly release on March 22nd, but has recovered since then and is currently up +4.9% in the year-to-date period.The chart below of weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another three weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.5% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.6% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +8.6%, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations. As you can see, the growth rate has ticked up a bit, partly reflecting results from the 9 S&P 500 members that have reported results already. But even after accounting for the results that have come out, Q2 estimates revisions are nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.But as the chart above shows, we didn’t see much in positive revisions. In other words, while the overall growth picture remains very strong – there is no other way to describe +18.5% quarterly earnings growth - there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond. The recent strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend.This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding, June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors. The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology, Energy, Medical, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Business Services, and Retail. Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector, reflecting momentum in oil prices. Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector, the aggregate revisions picture for the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1.The Earnings Growth PeakThe chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter’s impressive level, the overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.The two charts above provide different answers to the ‘peak earnings’ question. The first chart shows that the growth rate likely peaked in 2018 Q1, while dollar earnings aren’t expected to ‘peak’ till the last quarter of 2018. Even with respect to the growth rate, it is very much possible that final growth rates for Q2 and Q3 may surpass what we saw in Q1.We should keep in mind that this earnings cycle got underway back in 2009 when the U.S. economy got out of its last recession. By this time, earnings growth should have come down to the historical ‘normalized’ pace in the mid-single digits level. The reason we have these impressive growth numbers and positive revisions trend is thanks mostly to the effect of the tax cuts, which will start wearing off towards the end of 2019.In other words, earnings likely haven’t peaked yet. But with this cycle so long in tooth, we are steadily moving towards that stage.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

714,GIS,"After witnessing a negative earnings surprise of 7.79% in first-quarter fiscal 2018, General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) delivered in-line earnings in the second-quarter of fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, the top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate after missing the same in three of the last four quarters. Again, the company raised its fiscal 2018 organic sales outlook mirroring the positive impact of its strong second-half plans.Shares surged 1.5% in premarket trading after the earnings release.In-Line EarningsThe food giant reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings, however, decreased 4% year over year. On a constant currency basis, earnings decreased 5%.Adjusted earnings exclude certain items, influencing comparability of results. Including these items, reported earnings came in at 74 cents per share, reflecting a decrease of 7.5% year over year.Sales BeatTotal revenues of $4.2 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06 billion and improved 2.1% year over year, owing to higher sales across the board.Organically, excluding currency and acquisitions/divestures, sales increased 1% against the 4% drop in the prior quarter.Price/mix had a 1% positive impact on its quarterly revenues but volumes remained unchanged in the quarter. Currency had a 1% positive impact on quarterly revenues.Margins DeclineAdjusted gross margin declined 240 basis points (bps) to 34.4% due to higher input costs.Adjusted operating margin also plunged 220 bps to 17.4%, owing to lower adjusted gross margins and an increase in advertising and media expense.Segment PerformanceNorth America Retail: Revenues from this segment grew 1% year over year to $2.77 billion due to a 7% increase in the U.S. Cereal operating unit and a 5% increase in U.S. Snacks.Organic sales were flat versus down 5% in the prior quarter. Volumes increased 1%, but price/mix had a 1% negative impact on revenues.Segment operating profit declined 4% year over year, owing to higher input costs and advertising and media expense.Convenience Stores & Food Service: Revenues were up 5% year over year at $512 million. Growth in the Focus 6 platforms, including frozen meals, cereal, and snacks, as well as benefits from market index pricing on bakery flour had a positive effect on the segment’s results. Organically, sales were up 5%, too. Volumes increased 3%, and price/mix had a 2% positive impact on revenues.However, segment operating profit decreased 2% from the year-ago level owing to higher input costs.Europe & Australia: On a year-over-year basis, the segment’s revenues improved 7% to $467 million, thanks to benefits from favorable foreign currency exchange and higher volumes. Organically, sales were up 1%.Foreign exchange and volume had a 6% and 1% favorable impact on revenues, respectively, in the quarter.However, the segment’s operating profit dropped 34.1% year over year. This was due to major input cost inflation.Asia & Latin America: Revenues were up 2% year over year to $448 million. The upside was mainly driven by a favorable currency impact and benefits of net price realization. Organically, sales were on a par with the year-ago level.While volumes were down 7%, price/mix had a favorable impact of 7% on the quarter’s results. Segment operating profit was down 41.4% year over year.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceThe company now expects organic sales growth between flat and down 1%, higher than its prior forecast of a decline of 1% to 2%. This reflects an improvement of 300-400 bps (previously up 200 to 300 bps) over fiscal 2017 results.The company maintained its expectation for adjusted earnings per share (constant currency) growth of 1-2% from the fiscal 2017 level of $3.08 per share. The company expects currency-related translation to have a one cent benefit on fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share.Adjusted operating profit margin is now anticipated to be less than the year-ago level of 18.1%, compared with the prior expectation of year-over-year improvement.Total segment operating profit was reaffirmed in the range of flat to up 1%, on a constant-currency basis. The company expects to generate double-digit growth in the second half, driven by favorable net price realization and mix and higher cost savings, including savings from its new global sourcing initiative.General Mills, Inc.

716,GIS,"In a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc.  — the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips.Consequently, Amplify's shares were up 71.6% on Dec 18 while Hershey gained a mere 0.1%.Terms of the DealHershey agreed to buy all outstanding shares of Amplify Snack Brands for $12 a share, which is a 71% premium to Friday’s closing price. Valued at approximately $1.6 billion, the deal includes net debt and a make-whole payment of $76 million related to the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA).Per the company, the transaction is slated to close in the first quarter of 2018 and will be funded with cash on hand and new debt.  In fact, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to Hershey's earnings in the first year following the deal closure..The accord is also anticipated to generate approximately $20 million in annual run-rate synergies over the next two years.However, the takeover is not expected to affect Hershey’s full-year 2017 guidance, projected earlier.Hershey and Other Food Biggies Diversify to Combat Fading DemandThe packaged food industry is suffering from waning consumer demand due to the shift in consumer preferences to healthier options. In this context, Austin, TX-based Amplify seems to be gaining ground as it offers the better-for-you food products. Apart from owing Skinny Pop popcorn and Tyrrells potato chips, Amplify also owns Oatmega bars made with whey protein from grass-fed cows in New Zealand.Over the past two years, Hershey acquired brands like Krave meat jerky and Ripple Brand Collective's barkTHINS as well. Notably, the company’s top-line performance was weak since 2014.  However, sales increased a meager 0.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in the first nine months of 2017. Persistent macroeconomic challenges in China continued to hurt the company’s result. Notably, soft international sales due to macro headwinds, changing consumer shopping habits and intense competition from the broader snacking environment in the United States were mainly responsible for the sales results.Apart from Hershey, other big food giants are gradually re-shuffling their shelves and are making niche acquisitions, given tepid demand.In a separate press release, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) unveiled deal to buy Cape Cod chips-maker Snyder's-Lance, Inc.  for $4.87 billion in cash to fight declining soup sales. The No. 5 U.S. healthy savory snacks maker — Snyder's-Lance — also owns brands like Eatsmart veggie snacks.Although Campbell and Hershey operate in different section of food industry, their core products have been suffering from lower demand. Much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products.Other biggies like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Co (K  -  Free Report) are also acquiring or investing in healthier options to boost sales and thereby profits. In line with the strategy to diversify its organic offerings, Kellogg entered into an agreement in October 2017 to acquire protein bar maker — Chicago Bar Company. Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered to be the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States. The addition of “clean-label, high-protein” RXBAR can be expected to revive Kellogg’s wholesome snacks business, which has been weak over the past few quarters.Meanwhile, Conagra Brands Inc (CAG  -  Free Report) took over Boomchickapop popcorn maker — Angie's Artisan Treats — in September 2017.Currently, Hershey and these food companies are regularly bringing innovations to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. Hershey expects innovation to help it achieve its long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 10.5% year to date, as against the industry’s loss of 20.6%. Although the Hershey’s earnings estimates for the current quarter and current year remained unchanged, successful innovation and progress in multi-year productivity, and cost-saving initiatives are likely to drive growth for this largest producer of quality chocolate products.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

717,GIS,"General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 27. This global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods has a mixed earnings surprise record in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for General Mills this time around.General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFactors Driving General MillsGeneral Mills is likely to benefit from its four key global strategies for fiscal 2018, which are aimed at enhancing the company’s top line. Well, General Mills’ North American Retail segment has been facing sales declines at its U.S. Cereal and U.S. Yogurt businesses, which lingered in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. General Mills, like many other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food. Nonetheless, as part of its key strategies, General Mills is increasing focus on its cereal business and is also restructuring its U.S. Yogurt portfolio through innovations.Analysts polled by Zacks expect sales at the North American Retail segment to increase 1.6% to $2,430 million in the third quarter. Apart from these, the company should also gain from its solid focus on strengthening e-commerce network. Notably, the company expects global e-commerce business to grow in double-digits in near future, the United States. These factors along with General Mills’ consumer-focused innovations and marketing strategies should fuel sales in the quarter to be reported.Cost Savings Versus Cost InflationGeneral Mills’ margins remained soft in the third quarter, as the company is encountering escalated supply-chain expenses, owing to a rise in freight, commodities and operational costs. These headwinds are expected to linger, which is clear from management’s raised input cost inflation outlook for fiscal 2018. The company now expects input cost inflation of 4%, a point greater than the prior guidance. This also led to a lowered operating profit outlook for fiscal 2018, which gives out unfavorable signals for the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, the company remains on track with its cost-savings initiatives like increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply-chain optimization and expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business. General Mills earlier announced plans to deliver approximately $390 million in supply-chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018, through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. These along with incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives should help offset the aforementioned hurdles in the quarter under review.Q4 Estimates in NumbersAnalysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $3,918 million, up 2.9% from the year-ago period. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 75 cents, which shows a 2.7% jump from the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that General Mills is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, the stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.General Mills fails to meet both, as it has an Earnings ESP of -3.23% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Hence, we caution against sell-rated stocks going into earnings announcement.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

718,GIS,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 21, before market open.A Look at General Mills’ Margins Performance in Q2It isn’t unknown that a seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales and thereby profit level.General Mills and other food majors have been focusing on various strategies to combat weak sales trajectory. However, higher promotions and advertising spending to support innovation and new product launches have been putting pressure on these companies’ margins. Again, inflation in commodity prices as well as price competition among retailers also remained headwinds.General Mills has been experiencing weak margins for the past several quarters. Adjusted gross margin declined 240 basis points (bps) to 34.4% due to higher input costs in the last reported quarter. Adjusted operating margin also plunged 220 bps to 17.4%, owing to lower adjusted gross margins, and an increase in advertising and media expenses. Adjusted gross margin declined 230 bps and adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps in the fiscal first quarter as well.General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM)  General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM) | General Mills, Inc. QuoteThird-Quarter ExpectationsThe company is currently taking a number of initiatives, focused on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings and support its key growth strategies. General Mills is on track to reduce its COGS (cost of goods sold) through its Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program that has helped it boost margins despite lower volume.General Mills has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing HMM efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation of 3%. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.By fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion.Also, General Mills had earlier stated that it expects margin headwinds to subside in the second half of fiscal 2018 and generate higher cost savings during the period, driving its margins and thereby profit. Additionally, the company’s higher net price realization and benefits from its global sourcing initiative are expected to support margins in the to-be-reported quarter.However, weak sales, and higher expenses associated with promotional activities and commodities could weigh on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s margins. Despite having profound strategic plans, the company expects its adjusted operating margin to remain below the prior-year’s level in fiscal 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall Earnings & Revenues ExpectationsOverall, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $3.89 billion, implying 2.5% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 79 cents, reflecting an increase of 9.7% year over year.

719,GIS,"On a day in which we see fewer companies reporting quarterly earnings and no important economic data to speak of, we look forward to what might potentially affect the market this Friday. And we found it: at 11am ET today, new Fed Chair Jerome “Jay” Powell will report to Congress on the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy.This is significant because we are seeing something of a sea-change in the U.S. economy currently: long-standing accommodative measures to spur growth and full employment have finally taken hold over the past year, and show no signs of slowing down. On top of this is a $1.5 trillion tax cut for corporations and many individuals that promises to bring huge new influxes of cash that would have normally gone to paying taxes.Also, proposals for new infrastructure funding in Congress are being considered. Powell’s testimony ought to be informative to congresspeople deciding on economic policy going forward.The testimony will not be televised live; instead, we’ll see segments of it on Monday. But today is the day the Fed Chair lays plain what he thinks is in store in the current market environment, which has already seen raised levels of volatility amid concerns of excess deficits and rising inflation. Powell’s words may soothe or aggravate these concerns, especially including his opinions regarding interest rate hikes this year.General Mills Goes BluePet food specialty retailer Blue Buffalo  has agreed to be acquired by food product giant General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) for $40 per share, or $8 billion in cash. General Mills expects the company to immediately add to the company’s top-line, with bottom-line growth expected in 2019. The U.S. pet food market is a $30 billion industry, growing routinely in the 3-4% range each year. BUFF shares cranked up 17% upon the news release.Market futures are up today following a mixed Thursday in regular trading. This February remains on track to be the worst trading month in more than two years. Both the Dow and S&P 500 are roughly 6% off all-time highs we saw last month, where the Nasdaq is down 4% from those highs. Without much pushing or pulling the market in either direction, we do not foresee a particularly volatile trading day. Happy Friday!

"
725,GIS,"6 sectors expected to decline more than 25%

"
731,GIS,"Top down estimates $56.54 and $67.79, respectively
"
732,GIS,"Total Net Income GrowthEarly results bad absolutely, but better than expected based on 70 early reports
"
733,GIS,"Total net income reported $29.5 billion versus $34.6 billion last year; down 14.7%
"
734,GIS,"Financials only sector up from year ago (easy comps and questionable quality)
"
735,GIS,"Remaining firms expected to post 36.2% decline
"
736,GIS,"Staples expected to lead with small increase, followed by small declines in Health Care and Utilities
"
737,GIS,"Materials and Energy expected to see massive year over year declines
"
738,GIS,"Earnings are coming in much better than expected in the early going. While in this report we have not tracked revenues, there seems to be a general pattern where the source of the positive surprises is coming from much better than expected margins (both operating and net) rather than from better than expected revenue growth.
"
739,GIS,"In other words companies are succeeding in cost cutting their way, if not to prosperity, then at least much better than feared results. While at the individual company level, this is almost always a positive, it is not necessarily so at the macro level. Cutting costs by reducing head count means that there are fewer jobs and less overall demand in the economy.
"
740,GIS,"Still given the weak state of the economy, I suspect most investors will not be too picky about the source of the earnings improvements. The one exception to this might be in the financials where the earnings quality is weak due to FASB caving to political pressure and doing away with mark-to-market accounting. On the other hand, I have not seen any situations of massive mark-to-market of the liabilities but not the assets, like we saw in the first quarter.
"
741,GIS,"The total earnings reported so far of the 70 firms that had reported by the Jul 20 close were $29.5 billion, a decline of 14.7% from the $34.6 billion those same 70 firms reported a year ago. There are only 2 sectors where the actual results that are in are worse than the remaining firms are expected to show, Staples and Industrials.
"
742,GIS,"There are 2 ways of looking at this. The pessimist would say that the good news is getting out of the way early and that results will start to deteriorate. The optimist would say that there is a trend towards better than expected earnings. I lean towards the second explanation. Still, actual earnings growth has been a pretty rare commodity with only 23 of the 70 reporting firms actually posting higher net income than a year ago. I would note that it is still a pretty thin sample and that some sectors have many more reports in than others.

833,GIS,"General Mills Sees Good Demand
"
834,GIS,"Last week, General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) reported adjusted fiscal fourth-quarter profits of 86 cents per share. The results topped expectations by 5 cents and represented year-over-year growth of 18%.
"
835,GIS,"Revenues increased 5%, though the actual growth would have been higher were it not for currency fluctuations. Domestically, the company saw strong demand for many of its brands, including Cheerios, Bisquick, Yoplait and Totino's. Internationally, sales rose, but GIS could not convert those gains into higher profits because of the dollar.
"
836,GIS,"Nonetheless, General Mills thinks it can continue to grow in fiscal 2010, especially if commodity costs don't rise sharply. The company guided for full-year profits of $4.20 to $4.25 per share. All 14 covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus estimate 7 cents higher to $4.25 per share.
"
837,GIS,"General Mills is a Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stock.
"
838,GIS,"Smuckers Gets A Big Boost From Folgers Acquisition
"
839,GIS,"General Mills' bullish report was preceded by good numbers from J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report). SJM topped fiscal fourth-quarter expectations by 41 cents with adjusted profits of $1.02 per share. EPS jumped 40% year-over-year.
"
840,GIS,"The results were inflated by the acquisition of Folgers, which accounted for 42% of sales. However, even when Folgers is excluded, SJM performed well. Pillsbury and Hungry Jack both saw volume gains. Higher prices also had an impact on revenue growth.
"
841,GIS,"Peanut butter sales were down, though the segment is recovering. (The FDA's recall of another manufacturer's peanut products damaged sales across the entire industry.) As was the case with GIS, the stronger dollar was a drag on overall revenue and profit growth.
"
842,GIS,"SJM raised its fiscal 2010 adjusted profit guidance to between $3.65 and $3.80 per share. Previously, the company had guided for profits of $3.62 to $3.72 per share. All of the covering analysts raised their forecasts in response, sending the consensus earnings estimate 38 cents higher to $3.75 per share.

843,GIS,"SJM is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock.
"
844,GIS,"Other Food Companies That Could Also BeatKellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report) and Corn Products International (CPO) could surprise to the upside. Both are Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
845,GIS,"K has topped expectations during 8 out of the last 9 quarters. Two analysts recently raised their second-quarter forecasts and 3 raised their full-year forecasts. The consensus estimate calls for K to have earned 81 cents per share last quarter. Kellogg is scheduled to report on Jul 30.
"
846,GIS,"Though CPO disappointed investors with its first-quarter earnings, the company had previously topped expectations for 5 consecutive quarters. One analyst recently raised his second-quarter profit projection and 2 raised their full-year forecasts. The consensus second-quarter estimate calls for profits of 32 cents per share, though the most accurate estimate is far more bullish at 39 cents per share. CPO is scheduled to report on Jul 28.
"
847,GIS,"If K and CPO release good results, Nestle S.A. (NSRGY  -  Free Report) could rise in response. Though the company is not scheduled to release first-half results until Aug 12, the full-year consensus estimate has been revised upward by 11 cents higher over the past 30 days.

850,GIS,"B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, after the market closes.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.6% in the last quarter. B&G Foods surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, the average being a negative 6.4%.Let’s see how things shape up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company’s aggressive acquisition strategy looks encouraging. B&G Foods acquired snack foods manufacturer, Back to Nature Foods Company, in October 2017. The deal is likely to contribute to earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow. The earlier buyouts, Victoria Fine Foods Holding Company and Victoria Fine Foods in December 2016 as well as spices and seasonings business of ACH Food Companies in November 2016, are likely to contribute to fourth-quarter 2017 results.Green Giant frozen products is expected to drive revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Net sales of Green Giant frozen products increased double digits in the third quarter of 2017. The company’s base business experienced a turnaround in the third quarter driven by Green Giant frozen products, after declining 2.4% in the first quarter and 4.9% in the second quarter of 2017.Moreover, the company’s Pirate Brands also had a strong rebound, delivering a 21% increase in net sales in the third quarter. Some of the smaller brands like Polaner, Underwood, New York Style and Cream of Wheat, also performed well in the third quarter. These positive trends are expected in the upcoming results.B&G Foods projects cost savings from Mama Mary's plant consolidation, procurement savings and packaging changes of few Green Giant products to drive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017.However, the challenging conditions of the foods industry can hurt results to some extent. The North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption over the last few quarters due to a shift in consumer preference toward healthier options. This has been hurting results of major food companies like General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $490.4 million, reflecting an increase of 18.6% year over year. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 59 cents, showing an increase of 103.5% year over year.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not show that B&G Foods is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  B&G Foods has Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

879,GIS,"The revisions ratio reversed course, falling after a long string of steady increases. The reversal brought it from the abysmal lows of 0.20 last winter (i.e. 5 cuts for every increase) to a high of 1.29 two weeks ago. Last winter, in individual sectors, the cuts were often in excess of 10:1.
"
880,GIS,"The current reading is on a very low number of total revisions, which is quite normal for this time of the quarter. However, it is sort of like a stock that moves on low volume. Its good if the stock moves up, but you have less conviction about its significance than if it is on high volume.
"
881,GIS,"Tech has moved up substantially in the revisions ratio rankings in large part due to the strength in the Chip industry. Some of the real standouts in terms of large numbers of estimate increases leading to very large increases in mean estimates are National Semiconductor (NSM) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report).
"
882,GIS,"The strength in Staples was lead by General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report). However it is a sector where the estimate changes do not tend to be dramatic. Two other notables that had many more increases than cuts, but small changes in the mean estimate, were Colgate-Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report). The one firm in the sector that was noteworthy in heading south was Walgreens (WAG).
"
883,GIS,"The weakness in the Industrial sector was most apparent in some of the transportation related companies, like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airline (LUV  -  Free Report). Paccar (PCAR  -  Free Report) was also very weak.

902,GIS,"The Q2 earnings season has so far seen releases from 41.9% of the consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 cohort. According to the latest Earnings Preview, 53.8% of the companies in the Consumer Staples sector have surpassed earnings and 61.5% have beat revenue expectations. Total earnings for these consumer staples companies increased 2.9%, while revenues declined 2.6%.Some of the key players in the sector – General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) – have already released their quarterly numbers. Hershey beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in second-quarter 2017 by 19.8% and 0.7%, respectively. General Mills’ cost-saving initiatives have helped it come up with better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results along with solid adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Total revenue however declined 3% year over year owing to lower organic sales.The Food industry, within the Consumer Staples sector, has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales. Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the food industry at large.Given this backdrop, let’s try to determine how these players – Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report). The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Treehouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) – are placed ahead of their second-quarter earnings releases on Aug 3.Kellogg Company, the world's leading producer of cereal and convenience foods, posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.9% in the last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in all of the past four quarters at an average of 6.16%.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of +2.17% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 94 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 92 cents. Also, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our proven model shows that Kellogg is likely to beat earnings this quarter. According to our model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteFor the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 92 cents, up 1.6% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is at $3.15 billion, reflecting a 3.5% decrease. (read more: Kellogg Company Q2 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards?)Kraft Heinz, the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world, posted a negative earnings surprise of 1.2% in the last quarter. The company has a positive average surprise of 8.09% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice.For the second quarter, the company has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.04% (Most Accurate estimate is 97 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 96 cents). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise  The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Kraft Heinz Company QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 96 cents, up 13.1% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is $6.70 billion, reflecting a 1.3% decrease. (read more: Will Cost Cut Help Kraft Heinz Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Treehouse Foods, a food manufacturer, primarily serving the retail grocery and foodservice channels, posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.2% in the last quarter. Also, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.42% in the trailing four quarters.Treehouse Foods has an Earnings ESP of +2.04% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 50 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. However, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Treehouse Foods, Inc. QuoteWe caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In an effort to achieve growth, the company continues with its Private Brands’ integration and revised organizational structure to focus more on organic foods. However, these initiatives are yet to yield positive results. The company incurred higher spending with regard to its business structure realignment. Unfavorable pricing, inflationary pressure, higher operating expenses also added to the concerns. Such challenges have led the company to issue a soft guidance for the second quarter, which in terms of earnings, is anticipated to be the lowest in 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at 49 cents, depicting a year-over-year decline of 9.9%. Further, the analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.54 million for the said quarter, almost in line with the year-ago sales figure.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017  From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

903,GIS,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2 before the market opens.Last quarter, the Oreo-maker delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.00%. Overall, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMondelez had earlier stated that a global cyber attack, which wreaked havoc across Europe and the U.S. at the end of June, would impact its revenues in the second quarter. Additionally, the company has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it difficult for legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) to boost sales.Again, foreign exchange is a major headwind for Mondelez with around 75% of its revenues coming from outside the U.S. We expect these headwinds to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, Mondelez reaffirmed its full-year organic revenue outlook of ""at least 1% growth.""The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.95 billion for the second quarter, pointing at a 5.6% decline year over year.Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the company at large. These initiatives could offset the aforesaid adverse impact to some extent on the company’s sales growth in the second quarter. The company stated that its underlying margin progress continues to be in line with its outlook of mid-16% for the full year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is currently pegged at 46 cents, reflecting an increase of 3.4% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

904,GIS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 8.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.General Mills Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Margins GrowGeneral Mills reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents by 2.8%. Earnings also improved 11% year over year. On a constant currency basis, earnings grew 14%.Adjusted earnings exclude restructuring, project-related expenses and mark-to-market valuation effects. Including these items, reported earnings came at 69 cents per share, up 11% year over year. Sales SurpassTotal revenues of $3.81 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.75 billion by 1.6% but declined 3% year over year owing to lower organic sales. Also, sales were weak in the core U.S. Retail and other segments barring Convenience Stores & Foodservice division.Organically, excluding currency and acquisitions/divestures, sales were down 3%.Price/mix improved 4%, whereas volumes declined 7%. Foreign exchange headwinds did not impact quarterly revenues.Margins ImproveAdjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points (bps) to 35.1%, as input cost inflation and lower volumes were offset by savings from cost-reduction activities.Adjusted operating margin increased 220 bps to 16.8%, owing to higher adjusted gross margins, benefits from cost-savings initiatives and a 17% decline in advertising and media expense.Segment PerformanceBeginning third quarter of fiscal 2017, the company has been reporting results under four new business groups: North America Retail, which combines U.S. retail segment and Canada region in international segment; Convenience Stores & Food Service; Europe & Australia, which is currently another international region; and Asia & Latin America, which combines the remaining two current international regions.This structural change aims at maximizing global scale, unlocking global growth opportunities and driving efficiency.North America Retail: Revenues from this segment declined 3% year over year to $2.39 billion due to double-digit declines in the U.S. yogurt operating units. This was partly offset by growth in the U.S. Snacks unit. Organic sales were down 4%. Volumes dipped 8%, while price/mix added 4% to revenues.Segment operating profit was up 9% year over year, attributable to lower advertising and media expense and higher pricing.Convenience Stores & Food Service: Revenues were flat year over year at $488 million. Growth at the Focus 6 platforms, comprising cereal, yogurt, and biscuits, offset the decline in other frozen dough products.Organically, sales were flat, too. While volumes increased 2%, price/mix impacted revenues by 2% in the quarter.Segment operating profit also remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Europe & Australia: On a year-over-year basis, the segment’s revenues declined 14% to $487 million because of the reporting period difference in the year-ago period and unfavorable currency impact. Organically, sales were down 9%.Foreign exchange headwinds dragged revenues by 5% in the quarter. Volumes were down 16% and price/mix had a 7% favorable impact on the quarter’s results.Segment operating profit dropped 34% year over year. This was due to the reporting period difference and input cost inflation, including currency-driven inflation on products imported into the U.K. These were partially offset by benefits from cost-savings initiatives.Asia & Latin America: Revenues were up 10% year over year to $440 million. Organically, sales grew 8%.While volumes were up 2%, price/mix had a favorable impact of 6% on the quarter’s results.Segment operating profit was down 17% year over year.Fiscal 2017 SummaryThe company’s earnings in fiscal 2017 came at $3.08, up 5% year over year and 6% on a constant-currency basis.Total revenue declined 5.7% year over year to $15.6 billion in fiscal 2017. Adjusted gross margin advanced 50 bps to 36.1% and adjusted operating margin increased 130 bps to 18.1%.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceOrganically, year-over-year sales growth is expected to decline 1–2%.Adjusted earnings per share (constant currency) are anticipated to grow 1–2% from the fiscal 2017 level of $3.08 per share. The company expects currency-related headwind of 1 cent on full-year fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share.Total segment operating profit growth is estimated in the range of flat to 1%, on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted operating margin is expected to remain above the fiscal 2017 level of 18.1%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 9.2% due to these changes.General Mills, Inc.

905,GIS,"The Q2 earnings season has picked up pace, with 97 companies in the S&P 500 cohort having released their quarterly numbers. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing revenue estimates.Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +8.6% from the same period last year on a 4.7% revenue improvement. Coming to the Consumer Staples sector, earnings are expected to increase 3.1% in Q2 compared with 4.7% in the previous quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 1.2%, lower than 3% recorded in the last quarter.The Food industry, within the Consumer Staples sector, has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness is hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) to boost sales. Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the food industry at large.Coming to the Beverage (soft drinks) industry within the Consumer Staples sector, persistent decline in carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are raising concerns for established players like PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report).  Cola companies are gradually reshuffling their portfolio toward healthier options to counter the tepid sales and volumes environment.Given this backdrop, let’s try to determine how these players – The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) – are placed ahead of their second-quarter earnings releases before the opening bell on Jul 26.Hershey, the largest North American manufacturer of quality chocolate and confectionery products, reported a positive 3.97% earnings surprise in the last quarter. Also, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.65%.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of -3.30% as the Most Accurate estimate is 88 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 91 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteAlso, Hershey carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Notably, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. In fact, China chocolate category sales in the first quarter was flat and also below the market level. The company had earlier expressed that considering the timing of Easter and the projected decline in China sales, second-quarter net sales growth is expected to lag the full-year growth rate (read more: Hershey Q2 Earnings: Disappointment in the Cards?)For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents, reflecting an increase of 6.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $1.65 billion, implying 0.9% year-over-year growth.Soft drink giant, Coca-Cola posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.27% in the last quarter. However, the company managed to surpass earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.51%. Per our model, the company is likely to disappoint this earnings season as it has an Earnings ESP of -1.72% and a Zacks #3.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteThe company’s net revenue is also expected to face a 17–18% negative impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items.

906,GIS,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter 2017 results before market opens on Friday, Feb 16, 2018.Last quarter, this packaged food manufacturer’s earrings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Overall, the company surpassed/met the consensus mark in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 1.38%.A Look at Kraft Heinz’s Revenues Performance & ExpectationsThe company is seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid changes in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting its categories. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) have been giving dismal performance for quite some time.In the first nine months of 2017, reported net sales of $19.36 billion declined 1.4% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States, Canada and Europe. Three of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the biggest decline in Canada (down 5.5%). United States and Europe registered a decline of 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively. Organically, sales declined 1.7% in the United States and 6.4% in Canada.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of its total net sales, needs sustained improvement in sales for the company’s return to an overall healthy stature. Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz expects organic sales growth in the United States to see a 30-basis point headwind from hurricane-related consumer pantry loading in Q3; delayed production line start-ups impacting cold cuts; as well as difficult year-over-year comparison owing to strong fourth-quarter 2016 results that included some degree of retail inventory build. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $4.8 billion reflects 1% decline from the year-ago quarter.Rest of World (Asia Pacific, Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa) segment revenues of $850 million are likely to witness 6.1% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe segment revenues of $644 million indicates an increase from $600 million a year ago. Canada revenues are likely to increase to $631 million from $617 million a year ago, per the consensus estimate.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kraft Heinz’s total revenues stands at $6.9 billion, implying a 0.6% year-over-year increase.Bottom-Line ExpectationTo combat weak sales environment, Kraft Heinz has implemented several cost-saving initiatives. The company had earlier aimed to cut annual costs by $1.7 billion by 2017-end, primarily through work-force reduction along with factory closures and consolidations. Cost savings have driven margins for the company, mainly in the developed markets of the United States and Europe. Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero-based budgeting, modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint. As of third-quarter 2017, the company realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.58 billion from its Integration Program.The company anticipates solid EBITDA growth to offset the above-mentioned challenges in the fourth quarter, reflecting its ongoing focus on profitable sales, as well as cost savings.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 96 cents, reflecting a 5.5% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kraft Heinz is -1.57%.Zacks Rank: Kraft Heinz carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

907,GIS,"On Jul 14, 2017, we issued an updated research report on The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the leading chocolate manufacturer in North America.Hershey’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Food-Confectionary industry year to date. The company’s shares have gained around 1.3%, while the broader industry declined 10.2%.The company’s strong brand portfolio, focus on innovation and productivity improvements and cost savings programs are encouraging. However, the changing North American food industry raises concern.Cost Saving Plans Combatting Weak SalesThe North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the last few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat), changes in consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products.Given these changes, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers namely Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and food giant General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been facing the brunt of shifting consumer preference.Hershey has been experiencing top-line pressure since 2014. In 2016, the company’s sales experienced a meager 0.7% growth. Meanwhile, the U.S. chocolate category is gradually slowing. In fact, the company is witnessing chocolate category softness in key international markets such as China. The chocolate category sales in China were flat and below the market level in first-quarter 2017.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late with net sales increasing 2.8% year over year in the first quarter. This marks the fourth straight rise in quarterly sales after few quarters of no growth.Again, under its continuous improvement and productivity (CIP) program, management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint, added manufacturing capabilities in international markets, increased supply chain productivity, invested in cost saving projects and improved the sales mix significantly.The productivity and cost savings from these efforts are being invested in brand building and supporting growth and gaining marketplace insights, which in turn are boosting the company’s margins.In the last reported quarter, Hershey’s adjusted gross margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) to 47.5% buoyed by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-savings initiatives and lower input costs, which offset other higher supply chain costs. Operating margin also expanded 170 bps to 23.2%.Additionally, the company unveiled a new cost-savings program, Margin for Growth, to boost profitability. The international division is expected to significantly narrow its operating loss in 2018 on the back of the new cost-reduction program.As part of its Margin for Growth multi-year program, it will reduce its global workforce outside the U.S. by 15%. This multi-year program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses, with savings primarily being achieved in 2018 and 2019. These moves are anticipated to boost efficiency, leverage global shared services and common processes and increase capacity utilization.These initiatives will enable Hershey to achieve its adjusted operating profit margin target of around 22–23% by 2019. The company will incur pre-tax charges of $375 million to $425 million, and provide benefits between $80 million and $100 million from the layoffs.Hershey holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

908,GIS,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.79%.This branded consumer foods’ company delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.74%.Factors to ConsiderGeneral Mills has been reporting dismal revenues for the last few quarters. Much like other U.S. food giants, General Mills too is having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.Although General Mills is making significant efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to witness muted sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Although the company expects organic sales to improve in the second quarter sequentially, we believe that the company needs time to register growth. The company expects product innovations, promotions during key seasons for soup and refrigerated dough, and investments in compelling media campaigns to strengthen its brands, will bring in improvements.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, accounting for about 65% of the company’s total sales, have been soft due to lower demand amid weak food industry trends and changing consumer preferences.Again, lower volumes and higher input costs are creating pressure on margins despite having profound cost-cutting initiatives to boost margin amid soft sales. General Mills’ adjusted gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps), while its adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps year over year in its last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to continued decline in volumes, higher input costs on imported products, increase in advertising media expenses, and unfavorable mix that offset the benefits of its cost-saving plan.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects the factors to turn favorable. Primarily, General Mills anticipates its volume to improve, banking on innovation in brand building. Hence, the rate decline of the company’s adjusted operating margin is expected to lessen in the second quarter (Read more: Will General Mills Witness Improved Margins in Q2?).Overall, an expected decline in volumes, primarily in North America, higher promotional expenses, as planned for the second half of fiscal 2018, and rising input costs are likely to remain a drag on its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Then again, General Mills’ focus on reducing its cost of goods sold through its margin-improvement plan along with lower share count is anticipated to give support for its EPS growth to some extent.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a decline of 3.2% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.06 billion, implying a 1.2% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.General Mills does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for General Mills is -1.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   Zacks Rank: General Mills carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.General Mills, Inc.

909,GIS,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. It isn’t unknown that seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales. Although General Mills expects fiscal second quarter to register improvement in sales, we believe that the company needs time to be back in the positive territory (Read more: Will Soft Volume Weigh on General Mills’ Q2 Sales?).Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.The company is currently taking a number of initiatives focused on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings and support its key growth strategies. General Mills is on track to reduce its COGS (cost of goods sold) through its Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program that has helped it boost margins despite lower volume.By fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion.Buoyed on the above-mentioned initiatives, General Mills was successful in reporting higher margins until the first quarter of its fiscal 2018. Despite having profound strategic plans, General Mills’ adjusted gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps), while its adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps year over year in its last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to continued decline in volumes, higher input costs on imported products, increase in advertising media expenses, and unfavorable mix that offset the benefits of its cost-saving plan.General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM)  General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM) | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFor the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects the factors to turn more favorable. Primarily, General Mills anticipates its volume to improve, banking on innovation in brand building. Hence, the rate decline of the company’s adjusted operating margin is expected to lessen in the second quarter.The company expects its margin headwinds to subside gradually during the second half of fiscal 2018. Also, it expects to generate higher cost savings during the period, driving its margins and thereby profit.Overall, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing HMM efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation of 3%. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

910,GIS,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8 before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.9%. It also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 7.88%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Kellogg has missed analysts’ expectations on sales in five of the past 10 quarters. The company has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last couple of years, primarily due to lower demand. Particularly, sluggish performance of its cereal products in the developed markets as well as a soft U.S. snacks business has been affecting the company.Segment Discussion: Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kellogg’s Total North America segment’s revenues (comprising 68% of the Kellogg’s total revenues) are expected to witness a 3.2% decline in the fourth quarter. Kellogg’s mainstay U.S. cereal business has been performing poorly since 2012 due to disappointing category growth. Precisely, its adult category has been a drag, adversely impacting its overall sales growth.Revenues at the U.S. Morning Foods segment including cereals dipped 5.3% in the first nine months of 2017. The metric at the U.S. Morning Foods segment is also anticipated to decline 3.4% in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, the U.S. snacks business has been struggling since 2013 on low volumes. Kellogg’s transition from a Direct Store Delivery system to warehouse distribution in its U.S. Snacking business is on track with shipping fully transitioned to warehouses in July 2017. This shift remains a headwind to sales of late as the company rationalizes SKUs and resets pricing to customers. The U.S. snacks business revenues are estimated to decline 8.1% year over year to $705 million in the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. It is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities plus product and packaging innovation. Again, the company’s sales in Brazil are likely to benefit from the Parati acquisition. The metric is also predicted to gain from the improved performance of Pringles in Europe.Europe revenues are likely to witness a 2.7% decline. However, Latin America as well as Asia Pacific revenues are expected to register a respective 20.9% and 3.6% rise in the quarter.Kellogg, much like a number of other U.S. food producers namely General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), has been struggling due to shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the soon-to-be-reported quarter and Kellogg expects its top line to remain subdued in 2017, declining 3% from the level in 2016 on a currency-neutral comparable basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.1 billion, implying 0.4% growth.Let as delve deeper into other factors likely to impact Kellogg’s fourth-quarter performance:Cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are somewhat compensating for the sales decline. Although the top line has been discouraging, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to lend support to the company’s bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also likely to subside, further supporting EPS growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 96 cents, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year increase.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company Quote Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Kellogg does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP:  Kellogg has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

911,GIS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, General Mills has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 22.9x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, General Mills’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that General Mills has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 19.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for General Mills stock in the near term too .P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, General Mills has a P/S ratio of about 2.2. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, General Mills currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes General Mills a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though General Mills might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D. This gives GIS a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower, while the full year estimate has seen five up and two down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 1.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:General Mills, Inc. Price and Consensus   General Mills, Inc. Price and Consensus | General Mills, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineGeneral Mills is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, with a strong industry rank (among Top 42% of more than 250 industries) instilss our confidence on the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

912,GIS,"The food industry has been dealing with a slew of issues of late. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat food items are losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales.In order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet the rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Therefore, though the companies’ sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins. Again, savings are being re-invested in the business for innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate top-line growth.Among the food companies that have already reported their numbers, McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report) posted solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. Last month, General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) delivered in-line earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2018, after a negative earnings surprise of 7.79% in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Q4 ExpectationsAs we take a closer look at the Q4 earnings season, we see a steady improvement over the past few quarters. According to the latest Earnings Preview, of the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported Q4 results as of Jan 26, 81.2% have surpassed EPS estimates and 78.9% have come up with top-line beats. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 65.4%.Total Q4 earnings are expected to be up 11.6% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues compared with 6.7% earnings growth in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.9% rise in revenues.For Q4, total earnings for the companies in the Consumers Staples sector (which includes food stocks) are projected to grow 6% year over year, more than 3.9% in the previous quarter. Revenues are expected to increase 2.5% compared with 1.9% in the third quarter. Let’s see what awaits the following food stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Feb 1.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell.We expect the top line to remain subdued in the to-be-reported quarter, as has been the case for quite some time now owing to changes in consumer preference in North America and soft international sales.In the fourth quarter, the company had plans of introducing retail-ready packaging at select outlets. Also, Hershey is transitioning the packaging of its core chocolate products. Though these initiatives will improve shelf presence and visibility over the long haul, it is expected to affect fourth-quarter gross margin. Moreover, higher advertising expenses in China and the United States related to product innovation are expected to impact results in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.06, reflecting a 9.4% year-over-year decline. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.98 billion, implying a 0.3% increase.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%. The company beat the consensus mark in all of the last four quarters, resulting in an average earnings beat of 9%. Our proven model conclusively hints at an earnings beat for the company this quarter, as Hershey has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and Zacks Rank #3.

The company surpassed estimates in all of the past four quarters and has an average positive surprise of 4.0%.The company’s business model and strategic blueprint are encouraging. Continuous improvement initiatives and lower input costs continue to drive operational efficiencies throughout North America. However, moderate margin compression is expected as the company has been getting rid of its high fructose corn syrup business to make room for new specialty sweetener blends. With growth in specialty sweetener blends, the company anticipates higher operational efficiency and price/mix.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ingredion is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% (Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.74) and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.74, up 4.2% year over year.

913,GIS,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, after market close.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.56% last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 2.96%.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been giving a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales. Mondelez, in particular, witnessed a decline in revenues in nine out of the last 10 quarters, primarily due to lower demand. Mondelez’s sales and volumes were down 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, and in the first nine months of 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has advanced only 0.9% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s 2.6% growth.  Let’s See How Things Are Shaping Up for Q4In the last reported quarter, Mondelez’s net revenues increased 2.1% year over year on organic revenue growth and currency tailwinds. Revenues from emerging and developed markets increased 4.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Power Brands also witnessed a 5.6% increase in revenues.The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with improved volumes in its Power Brands, which includes Oreo, Cadbury Diary Milk, Halls and Tang. Higher sales from its wellness product portfolio is also anticipated to support its revenue growth. Further, improvements in China, Europe, Russia and India along with strong pricing in emerging markets are added positives.However, softness in North America due to a tough retail environment will mar the growth rate to some extent. Again, weakness in the Middle East is also expected to hurt the company’s sales.Segment Wise: Mondelez’s Europe revenues, comprising about 36.9% of the total revenues, are likely to witness 15% growth sequentially and 4.7% year over year to $2.8 billion. North America segment, comprising about 27.7% of the total revenues, is expected to witness growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 billion for the segment’s revenues reflect growth from $1.77 billion in the prior quarter and $1.81 billion in the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues of $910 million indicates an increase from $908 million in the prior quarter and $864 million in the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in eight of the past 10 quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has managed to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.However, higher commodity prices, primarily on dairy products, and increased trade spending are likely to adversely impact its gross margins. Then again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, productivity savings and lower overhead costs are expected to boost its operating margin.Hence, fourth-quarter bottom line is expected to witness solid growth from higher pricing, higher volumes as well as lower overhead and increased productivity savings, partly offset by higher input costs.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 56 cents, reflecting a 19.2% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.98 billion, implying 3.1% growth.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Mondelez does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.Zacks Rank: Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

"
934,GIS,"The third quarter earnings season is over, and we will actually start to see a handful of fourth quarter reports next week, those with November fiscal ends. Only 63 firms will report, but 6 of those will be S&P 500 firms.
"
935,GIS,"We define any fiscal period ending in November, December and January to be the fourth quarter. While there are a not a lot of reports, the reports we get will provide some early clues on the fourth quarter. The firms reporting this week include: Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Discover (DFS  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL). That is an interesting cross section of the market that may provide clues to the overall direction of the economy.
"
936,GIS,"While things will be quite on the earnings side, the same is not true of the economic data front. Inflation will be in focus to start the week as the PPI comes out on Tuesday followed by the CPI on Wednesday. We will also get data on Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization, housing Starts and the leading economic indicators. In addition, we have a Fed meeting.  MondayNothing of significance.TuesdayWe get the Producer Price Index (PPI). It has been running higher than the Consumer Price Index for several months now, particularly on the headline level. Headline PPI is expected to come in at an increase of 0.5% up from 0.4% in October. Excluding food and energy, the rise is not expected to be as big, but to also show more acceleration, with a rise of 0.3% only partially reversing the 0.6% drop in October. Those numbers are for finished goods. The report will also show data further up the production pipeline, which could warn of higher inflation down the road.Retail Sales are expected to rise by 0.8%, which is a healthy showing, but down from the very strong 1.2% increase posted in October. The October increase was, however, driven by a sharp rise in Auto sales (relative to September). Stripping them out, overall sales rose just 0.4% in October. Sales ex-autos are expected to accelerate to 0.6% growth.The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee is almost universally expected to keep the Fed Funds rate in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been in for over two years now. There should not be any major announcements out of the meeting like there was with the announcement of QE2 last meeting. The market will, however, probably look very closely at the Fed policy statement for any changes from the last meeting.WednesdayThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been extremely well behaved of late, rising just 0.2% in October. Stripping out food and energy prices, inflation has been even more subdued, unchanged not only in October, but for the last three months in a row. In November the consensus is looking for the headline number to again rise 0.2% while the core barely breaks into positive territory with a 0.1% rise. That would actually be good news as it would diminish the threat of actual deflation.The Empire State Manufacturing Index, one of the “mini ISMs is expected to bounce back to a reading of 2.9% from an extremely and surprisingly weak showing of -11.14 in October. Any reading over 0 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity in New York State. The expected reading would mean positive but very slow growth, but that is better than the fairly sharp contraction last month. On the other hand, it has been a long time since New York State was a manufacturing powerhouse. This is an index that is best tracked in conjunction with the other regional mini ISMs.Industrial Production is expected to have increased by 0.3% after being unchanged in October. The overall Industrial production number can sometimes be a bit misleading. It includes utility output, which is highly weather dependent. Thus it is important to look not only at the overall number, but the change in manufacturing output. The October number was actually much better than the unchanged reading would indicate as it included a 3.4% drop in Utility output. Manufacturing output increased by a healthy 0.5% on the month.Capacity Utilization is reported along with Industrial Production. This is a highly underrated economic indicator and deserves a lot more attention than it gets in the press. Effectively it is measuring the employment rate of our physical capital, the way the employment report measures the utilization of our human capital. Overall capacity utilization is expected to rise to 75.0% up from 74.8% in October. That is much better than the 70.7% reading we saw a year ago, but is still historically low and indicating recessionary conditions. A healthy economy has capacity utilization around 80%, so we are about half way back to normal on this measure. As with the Industrial production number it is important to look at the Manufacturing only utilization as well as the overall, since there can be weather related changes in utility utilization. The October unchanged overall reading masked a rise to 72.7% from 72.3% in manufacturing. That was offset by a drop to76.6% from 79.8% in Utility Utilization. I suspect a return to more normal utility utilization will lead to a bigger than expected increase in overall capacity utilization.ThursdayNew Claims for Unemployment Insurance have been trending down recently, but erratically. Last week the four-week moving average (which takes out some of the week to week volatility fell to its lowest level since August 2008. The actual reading for the week was 421,000, down from over 500,000 in mid-August. It looks like we have finally moved out of the “trading range that initial claims have been stuck in for most of the year. That is very good news if it continues. We probably have to get down to under 400,000 and stay there to start to make a serious dent in the army of the unemployed, but at least we are making a serious move in the right direction. A small rebound for the week would not surprise me, but the four week moving average will probably continue to decline.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 191,000 to 4.086 million. That is down 1.219 million from a year ago. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks, but even extended claims have started to decline as well. Federally paid extended claims fell by 393,000 to 4.507 million, and down 120,000 from a year ago (the first year over year decline in this economic cycle). Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.298 million, which is down 612,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.249 million below year-ago levels. The big unknown is if those people are actually finding new jobs, or simply slipping into abject poverty with no income at all. Extended benefits are made up of four tiers, and the ability to move on to the next tier ended on 11/30. Reinstatement of that ability is dependent on the overall tax deal being ratified, which is likely, but not a certainty. Look for a big drop in extended claims next week simply from benefits expiring. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.Housing Starts are expected to rebound to an annual rate of 545,000, up from 519,000 in October. That is still a simply awful level of housing starts. Then again with the last six months being the lowest six months in history (back to 1963), there is simply not a big need to increase housing starts. There is still a huge inventory overhang of both new and existing homes, particularly relative to recent sales rates. Still, normally residential investment, of which new home construction is the biggest part, has historically been the locomotive that pulls the economy out of recessions and that locomotive has been derailed this time around. A rebound in housing starts could indicate that housing is getting back on track, and that could indicate much more robust economic growth as we move into 2011. It would not take very heroic absolute levels of housing starts to generate very robust percentage increases from current levels.The Philly Fed index, another regional “mini-ISM is expected to drop to 14.1 from a surprisingly robust 22.5 in October. That would still indicate a healthy rise in manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic area, but not quite as fast as last month.The index of leading economic indicators is expected to show an increase of 1.2% up from a 0.5% increase last month.FridayNo numbers of any particular significance.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceENZO BIOCHEM    ENZ        201010 ($0.08) ($0.05) 0 20101213 BTO $4.92 FUELCELL ENERGY FCEL       201010 ($0.13) ($0.21) -7.14 20101213 AMC $1.32 GOLUB CAPITAL   GBDC       201009 $0.29  N/A 3.57 20101213 BTO $17.02 LAKELAND INDS   LAKE       201010 $0.12  ($0.03) 400 20101213 AMC $9.05 SPARTECH CORP   SEH        201010 $0.06  $0.15  -118.52 20101213 AMC $9.86 ADDVANTAGE TECH AEY        201009 N/A $0.07  N/A 20101214 BTO $3.78 APPLD SIGNAL    APSG       201010 $0.22  $0.27  18.18 20101214 AMC $34.46 BEST BUY        BBY        201011 $0.60  $0.53  36.36 20101214 BTO $42.00 COMPOSITE TECH  CPTC       201009 N/A N/A N/A 20101214   $0.26 CSP INC         CSPI       201009 N/A ($0.04) N/A 20101214 BTO $5.12 FACTSET RESH    FDS        201011 $0.84  $0.74  2.5 20101214   $94.49 HOVNANIAN ENTRP HOV        201010 ($0.69) ($2.99) 32.08 20101214 AMC $4.36 IMPERIAL SUGAR  IPSU       201009 ($0.02) ($1.35) -1500 20101214 BTO $13.87 INTEGRATED ELEC IESC       201009 ($0.44) ($0.20) -1533.33 20101214 AMC $3.24 INTL ASSET HLDG IAAC       201009 N/A $0.08  52.63 20101214 AMC $23.76 NATL TECH SYS   NTSC       201010 $0.11  $0.11  -37.5 20101214 BTO $7.57 NEVADA GOLD&CAS UWN        201010 N/A ($0.03) N/A 20101214 AMC $1.08 PANTRY INC      PTRY       201009 $0.71  $0.60  38.24 20101214 BTO $20.13 PNI DIGITAL MED PNDMF      201009 $0.05  $0.05  N/A 20101214 DMT $1.74 SANDERSON FARMS SAFM       201010 $1.71  $0.96  -17.11 20101214 BTO $42.20 SYNERGETICS USA SURG       201010 $0.03  $0.02  N/A 20101214 AMC $4.50 THE9 LTD-ADR    NCTY       201009 ($0.37) ($0.35) 15.38 20101214 AMC $6.41 AAR CORP        AIR        201011 $0.36  $0.34  16.67 20101215 AMC $27.07 ABM INDUSTRIES  ABM        201010 $0.43  $0.39  0 20101215 AMC $24.77 APOGEE ENTRPRS  APOG       201011 ($0.10) $0.39  -80 20101215 AMC $12.71 CROSSROADS SYS  CRDS       201010 N/A $0.03  N/A 20101215   $0.97 HERMAN MILLER   MLHR       201011 $0.28  $0.20  -11.54 20101215 AMC $23.43 JOY GLOBAL INC  JOYG       201010 $1.15  $1.16  10.78 20101215 BTO $78.36 NORDSON CORP    NDSN       201010 $1.37  $0.85  16.07 20101215 AMC $85.77 PURE BIOSCIENCE PURE       201010 N/A ($0.05) N/A 20101215 AMC $2.53 RENTECH INC     RTK        201009 ($0.02) ($0.03) -200 20101215 DMT $1.38 WILLIAMS CTRLS  WMCO       201009 $0.09  $0.05  100 20101215 BTO $11.11 WPCS INTL INC   WPCS       201010 N/A $0.05  -83.33 20101215 AMC $2.88 ACCENTURE PLC   ACN        201011 $0.75  $0.67  4.76 20101216   $44.61 ACTUANT CORP    ATU        201011 $0.34  $0.20  10.71 20101216 BTO $27.26 BIO REFERNC LAB BRLI       201010 $0.30  $0.25  3.57 20101216   $20.68 DISCOVER FIN SV DFS        201011 $0.41  $0.12  34.29 20101216 BTO $18.77 FEDEX CORP      FDX        201011 $1.31  $1.10  -0.83 20101216 BTO $94.09 GENL MILLS      GIS        201011 $0.78  $0.77  1.59 20101216 BTO $35.67 GIGAMEDIA LTD   GIGM       201009 $0.03  ($0.04) -1800 20101216 BTO $1.55 HEICO CORP      HEI        201010 $0.40  $0.34  18.92 20101216 AMC $55.82 LUBY'S INC      LUB        201011 N/A ($0.10) -80 20101216 AMC $6.10 MARCUS CORP     MCS        201011 $0.07  $0.04  0 20101216 BTO $14.30 NEOGEN CORP     NEOG       201011 $0.26  $0.20  8.7 20101216 BTO $38.99 NORDION INC     NDZ        201010 $0.01  ($0.10) -1100 20101216   $10.97 ORACLE CORP     ORCL       201011 $0.43  $0.37  11.43 20101216 AMC $29.26 PIER 1 IMPORTS  PIR        201011 $0.14  $0.02  0 20101216 BTO $10.46 QUIKSILVER INC  ZQK        201010 $0.07  $0.02  166.67 20101216 AMC $5.68 RESEARCH IN MOT RIMM       201011 $1.64  $1.10  8.15 20101216 AMC $61.29 RICKS CABARET   RICK       201009 $0.14  $0.19  -55 20101216 AMC $7.22 RITE AID CORP   RAD        201011 ($0.13) ($0.10) -12.5 20101216 BTO $0.92 SCHIFF NUTRITN  WNI        201011 $0.12  $0.20  8.33 20101216 BTO $8.75 SCHOLASTIC CORP SCHL       201011 $2.19  $2.29  -66.67 20101216 BTO $30.56 SMART MODULAR   SMOD       201011 $0.11  $0.06  30 20101216 AMC $6.45 STEELCASE INC   SCS        201011 $0.14  $0.04  60 20101216 AMC $10.19 STEWART ENTRP A STEI       201010 $0.07  $0.05  -14.29 20101216   $6.23 TAKE-TWO INTER  TTWO       201010 $0.27  ($0.04) 200 20101216 AMC $12.05 TORTOISE ENERGY TYY        201011 ($0.12) N/A N/A 20101216   $26.95 WINNEBAGO       WGO        201011 $0.02  ($0.05) 466.67 20101216 BTO $12.10 XENONICS HLDGS  XNNH       201009 N/A $0.00  N/A 20101216 BTO $0.45 BEACON ENTERPRS BEAC       201009 N/A ($0.12) N/A 20101217   $0.42 CARNIVAL CORP   CCL        201011 $0.33  $0.24  12.24 20101217 BTO $43.74 WOLFORD AG ADR  WLFDY      201010 N/A $0.24  N/A 20101217   $3.04 My apologies for missing the last two weeks.

937,GIS,"The Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) is likely to acquire Nestle's U.S. confectionery business, which includes brands such as Butterfinger, Baby Ruth, Sno-Caps and Laffy Taffy, per media reports. The chocolate giant may have submitted its final bids on Jan 5, 2018.However, Ferrero, best known for its Nutella chocolate spread and Ferrero Rocher bonbons, is also believed to be among the potential bidders. Ferrero, Hershey and Nestle all declined to comment on the news.In June 2017, Nestle revealed that it was exploring strategic options that include a possible sale of its U.S. chocolate and candy business. In July, Nestle said that the business attracted considerable interest from bidders.Nestle's U.S. confectionery business unit is expected to be worth as much as $2.5 million.Hershey, in a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks, inked a deal last month to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc. (BETR), the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips for $1.6 billion. In the last two years, Hershey acquired brands like Krave meat jerky and Ripple Brand Collective's barkTHINS as well.Hershey’s president and CEO, Michele Buck, had earlier expressed that the company is optimistic about its chocolate portfolio and is expected to leverage its snack business through potential mergers and acquisitions.Notably, the company’s top-line performance was weak since 2014.  Sales increased a meager 0.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in the first nine months of 2017. Much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Hence, Hershey is looking for ways to boost its top line.Currently, Hershey and other food companies, like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report), Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and others, are regularly adding new products and innovating its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. Hershey expects innovation to help it achieve its long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 7.6% in the last six months against the industry’s loss of 6.5%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

938,GIS,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) has teamed up yet again with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.The new Post NUTTER BUTTER and CHIPS AHOY! cereals are inspired by classic, NUTTER BUTTER and CHIPS AHOY! cookies. In July 2017, the companies had teamed up to bring back Post OREO O's, which have been off store shelves since 2007. Also, they created a cereal — Honey Maid S’mores. It is to be noted that Post Consumer Brands is a business unit of Post Holdings, Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), formed from the combination of Post Foods and MOM Brands in May 2015.The North American food industry is seeing growing demand for healthier products, changes in consumer dynamics and a shift in spending toward lower-priced products. As a result of this, food companies like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) have been witnessing weak sales over the past few quarters.Given the sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption in the food industry, co-branding is expected to bring success to companies. In line with this, Cereal Partners Worldwide deserves special mention. General Mills formed a joint venture with Nestle called Cereal Partners Worldwide, which serves customers in more than 130 global markets.Mondelez has been refreshing its brand portfolio through product innovation and extending brands to newer geographies and platforms. The company is increasing investments in in-store execution and advertising to support the Power Brands.Also, Mondelez plans to offer more good-for-you snacks and expects 50% of its product portfolio to comprise “well-being” items by 2020 instead of the current one-third. Apart from simplifying the ingredients and improving nutritional benefits of the existing products, the company will develop products to meet the growing demand for healthier and natural items.Stock Price MovementMondelez’s shares have lost 5.5% so far this year, compared with the 4.2% decline of its industry.

939,GIS,"Inflation-Proof Your Portfolio
"
940,GIS,"On Mar 21, the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates steady at 5.25% for a sixth straight time. After 17 consecutive rate hikes, the decision was largely anticipated, leaving the federal funds rate at the same level since last June. However, a warning was issued on the risk of inflation.     
"
941,GIS,"The Fed made it very clear that inflation remains an issue and concerns persist. It was noted in its latest statement that, The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. However, recent readings on core inflation have been somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. The Federal Open Market Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.
"
942,GIS,"The consumer price index jumped 0.4% last month, while the core level, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2%. The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which serves as the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is at 2.3%. The Fed prefers 1% to 2% annual growth.
"
943,GIS,"It goes without saying that inflation is not good for the overall stock market. Nevertheless, some stocks tend to hold their own during inflationary times. It is precisely companies of this nature that should appear on your radar. Remember, no matter how tough times may get, or how high prices may elevate, there are certain items or services that people just cannot live without.

Revenues ballooned to $1.2 billion from $511.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005.

Based on its impressive results, WCG raised its full-year and first-quarter 2007 profit and revenue guidance. While the stock may not return 69% as it did in 2006, this Zacks #1 Rank stock (strong buy) should fair well in 2007.

957,GIS,"Next week will be one with very few market-impacting scheduled events. 
"
958,GIS,"The Federal Open Market Committee will hold a two day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. Rates are expected to remain unchanged, though the statement will be analyzed for any mention of the problems in the subprime market.
"
959,GIS,"Just slightly more than 70 companies are expected to report earnings next week, 11 which are members of the S&P 500. Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Fedex (FDX  -  Free Report) might have influence on market direction. The remainder, such as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), will grab some headline attention, but probably wont have much impact outside of their respective sectors.
"
960,GIS,"February housing starts will be released on Tuesday, the Conference Boards leading indicators index will be published on Thursday, and February existing home sales data will be issued on Friday. Winter weather in February may have impacted both starts and existing home sales. Outside of the weekly reports and, obviously, the Fed meeting, there is really not much else on the economic calendar.
"
961,GIS,"So what will move the markets next week? Sentiment. Daily fluctuations should continue, dependant on the news of the day and how the overseas markets fare. Traders still need to be willing to jump between going long and short. Investors will need to use prudence, but buying opportunities do exist.
"
962,GIS,"Its worth noting that despite Tuesdays drop, one-fourth of the companies within the S&P 500 index are trading within 5% of their 52-week highs. (14 closed Thursday at 52-week highs.) In other words, underlying bullish sentiment still remains. Part of the reason is that analysts continue to forecast the average company to grow earnings at a double-digit pace this year. M&A activity and stock buyback programs are also playing a role. Finally, the economy is still expected to grow. Yes, the problems in the subprime market are a concern, but so far, risk-aversion has yet to become the norm.

"
972,GIS,"With over 29% of the S&P 500 reported, the third-quarter earnings season is well underway.  The results thus far have been undeniably positive.  Median reported EPS growth sits at nearly 11% and positive surprises outnumber negatives by over 5:1.  As the Dow continually reaches for new highs, its clear that the market has taken a sharp turn from the worry days of mid-summer.  As reports ramp up, the lagging corporate performance indicator will come into much clearer focus.  These results will help dictate whether or not the markets newfound enthusiasm has a leg to stand on.  
"
973,GIS,"So far, the sectors seeing the largest number of companies reporting have been Financials and Consumer Discretionary.  Both sectors have performed well, with positive to negative surprise ratios of 5:1 and 9:1, respectively.  Another top performer, the Materials sector is leading the pack in terms of median growth.  Of the 20% of Materials companies reported, the median firm has grown EPS at nearly 46%, quarter over quarter.  This number is expected to fall off sharply however as new reports come in.  Median Q3 growth for all Materials firms listed in the S&P 500 is expected to come in at a still solid 21%.
"
974,GIS,"For the full S&P 500, analysts are expecting 10% median third-quarter growth.  Just two weeks ago, the expected growth was 8.6%.  If this growth rate proves accurate, it will be slightly lower than the 12.9% seen last quarter.  If on the other hand, positive surprises continue at the rate seen so far, the growth rate would be very similar.  Going into each of the last two quarters, growth was expected to be much lower than it later proved to be.  That pattern seems to be repeating itself.  
"
975,GIS,"The largest comparable growth drop this quarter is expected to come from the Energy sector.  Last quarter, the sector boasted 65.6% growth.  This quarter however, it is only expected to deliver 21.2% growth, although that should still put it at the top of the chart. On the plus side, lower energy prices bring operating costs down across the board and give consumers more discretionary cash flow.  Consequently, both Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples have logged favorable third-quarter results thus far, and further positive results could more than pick up the slack caused by lagging energy comps.

978,GIS,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month was 1,714.  This is down from the 3,243 seen at the peak of the second quarter reporting season, but up significantly from just a few weeks ago.  In the coming month, we should once again test this peak as more quarterly reports are released.  
"
979,GIS,"Over the last four weeks, there were 904 upward revisions and 810 downward.  This makes for a total revisions ratio of 1.12, up from last weeks 1.04.   The uptrend has continued now for several weeks and the 2006 revisions ratio has held solid above 1.  Continued positive EPS surprises could boost the ratio back to levels we saw during the peak of Q2 earnings reports.  Two months ago, for example, the ratio was 1.57. 
"
980,GIS,"Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Energys ratio is at the bottom of the barrel, at 0.33.  Three weeks ago, energys ratio was 1.15.  Negative revisions were across the board here, from the super majors  Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)  to the independents (Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report) to the drillers and refiners (Rowan (RDC  -  Free Report) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report)).  The weakness in oil and gas prices is the clear catalyst causing the slide.  On the upside of the revisions story, Consumer Discretionary has made its way to the front of the pack with an admirable ratio of 1.62.  Revisions were across the board, with middle income catering retailers like JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and TJX (TJX  -  Free Report) benefiting the most.  Two companies being downwardly revised however, were Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Lowes (LOW  -  Free Report).  Analysts are expecting both to be negatively impacted by the cooling housing market and have revised full-year 2006 and 2007 estimates downward.

"
982,GIS,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio is slightly lower, at 0.96.  This ratio has been trending upward over the last few weeks and sits slightly above our last reported number, 0.89.  If full-year 2007 revisions stay positive as the total number of revisions pick up, we could see this metric revisiting its second quarter highs.  Two months ago for example, the ratio was 1.33.  If the ratio continues its ascent, I will become much more positive about the outlook for both the economy and the market.  
"
983,GIS,"The bright point this week regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Consumer Staples.  The sectors ratio has reached 1.39.  Food product distributors McCormick (MKC  -  Free Report) and Conagra (CAG) both showed strong upward revisions, as did the more consumer focused General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report).  Other sectors seeing higher revisions ratios from the previous week were Utilities and Industrials.  Energys ratio was slightly higher than last week, though still a dismal 0.38.

"
985,GIS,"On a full-year1  basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid.  Double digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis.  On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.5% and 12.9%, respectively.  This growth rate has stayed relatively stable over the last several weeks.  On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.3% versus 10.2% next year.  While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 10.2% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near term recession.   Further, with the revisions ratios of both 2006 and 2007 near 1.0, a significant deterioration of the expected growth rate does not look likely at this point. 
"
986,GIS,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates.  The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings.  Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase.  In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock.  These repurchases shrink the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies.  As mentioned above, stock options expensing counteracts this effect, and depresses the 2005 versus 2006 EPS comparisons.  
"
987,GIS,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms.  Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing over 34% this year and nearly 20% next year.  However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis.  The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors (XOM, CVX, COP) account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings.  Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip.  The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007.  
"
988,GIS,"Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector.  This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms.  The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Health Care sectors combined.

"
990,GIS,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization.  This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
991,GIS,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
992,GIS,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.5%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
993,GIS,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.3% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 14.0% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.3%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase.  Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd.  Even though the NASDAQ is at only 50% of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
994,GIS,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.2% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 44.0% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index.  In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.1x 2006, and 9.5x 2007 earnings.  Tech on the other hand is trading for 22.2x 2006 and 18.9x 2007 earnings.  The S&P is trading for 15.7x and 14.3x, respectively.  The P/E for 2007 equates to an earnings yield of 7.0% which is very attractive relative to a 10 year t-note yield of 4.78%.  The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

"
998,GIS,"Earnings Preview 3/19/10Earnings Season is winding down, but that does not mean it is over. Actually, it is about to start up again. Next week will bring 70 earnings reports, including 14 members of the S&P 500.We define the first quarter as any fiscal period ending in February, March or April, and 30 of the firms reporting will actually be reporting first quarter earnings (all February fiscal ends). Some of the higher profile firms to report will be Best Buy (BBY), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Walgreen Co. (WAG).The economic data calendar will also be on the light side. The focus will be on housing data and then at the end of the week we get the final numbers on fourth quarter GDP. With a light earnings calendar, and a relatively light data calendar, there should be plenty of time to focus on the really important stuff, like college basketball.Political developments may also help set the tone of the market, as the vote on the Health Care reform bill is likely to happen this weekend. I think the vast majority of market commentators have it wrong, and that the market will react positively to its passage, and negatively if it fails.Monday• No significant data is due to be released.  We should know by the opening bell if Health Care reform has passed or not.Tuesday• Existing home sales are expected to slide to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.00 million from the January pace of 5.05 million. So far the second iteration of the “1st time buyer tax credit does not seem to be generating the response that it had the first time around in the fall. Existing home sales generate relatively little overall economic activity, and are thus much less important than are new home sales which are released the next day, even though there are far more existing home sales than new home sales. Existing home sales have been tumbling since November when they hit an interim peak of 6.49 million. The level of inventories will be very important, as will the months of supply.Wednesday• New home sales are expected to rebound slightly to an annual rate of 315,000 from 309,000 in January. The January figure was an all-time record low (the data goes back to 1963) and a far cry from the peak of 1.389 million set in July of 2005.  Normally, residential investment, which is largely the construction and sale of new houses, is the key locomotive in pulling the economy out of a recession. However, housing inventories, both new and used are still extremely high, especially if one considers the millions in “shadow inventory of people who are far behind on their mortgage payments or are already in the process of foreclosure. Unless new home sales pick up meaningfully -- and a rise of 1.0% from record-low levels is hardly meaningful -- it is hard to see how we will have a robust and sustained economic recovery. I consider this to be the most important data release of the week by a very wide margin.

999,GIS,"• New orders for Durable goods are expected to have risen by 0.5% on top of a 2.6% rise in January. However, the January numbers were all about autos. Excluding autos, they actually fell 1.0%, and are expected to rise by 0.3% in February.Thursday 
"
1000,GIS,"• Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 5,000 in the last week, to 457,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims started to rise again, up in 7 of the 8 weeks before falling in the last three weeks. Last week was some good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to near 400,000 to signal that the economy is, on balance, adding jobs. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go.
"
1001,GIS,"• Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. However, that is in part due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. If one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus program, claims soared last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week, regular continuing claims were 4.579 million, down 12,000 from the previous week. Extended claims (paid from Federal ARRA funds) were 6.044 million, a increase of 353,000. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.Friday
"
1002,GIS,"• In the ""old news"" department, we get the final read on fourth quarter GDP. The second read showed growth of 5.9%, up from the first read of 5.7%, although 2/3 of the growth came from a slowdown in the rate of inventory liquidation (not actual restocking, just clearing out the shelves more slowly). The 5.9% figure is not likely to change significantly.Potential Positive SurprisesHistorically, the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are both a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better-than-expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter. While pickings are getting slim, some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Phillips Van Heusen (PVH  -  Free Report) is expected to report EPS of 0.59, up from $0.31 per share a year ago. Last time out, PVH posted a positive surprise of 21.4%, and over the last month the mean estimate for its fourth quarter earnings is up 9.3%. PVH has a Zacks #1 Rank.Tiffany’s (TIF  -  Free Report) is expected to post ESP of $1.13, up from $0.85 a year ago. Last time, TIF beat expectations by 43.4%, and over the last month analysts have rised their estimates for the about to be reported quarter by 1.21%. TIF is a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Potential Negative SurprisesConn’s (CONN) is expected to post EPS of $0.01 a share, versus $0.69 a year ago. Last time, they reported 480% below expectations (reported a loss when a profit was expected). For this Zacks #4 Ranked stock, analysts have cut the estimates for this quarter slightly over the last month by 81.3%.Texas Industries (TXI) is expected to lose $0.81 a share this quarter, versus earnings of $0.25 a share a year ago. They were 50% below expectations last time out. Analysts have cut the estimate for this quarter by 13.2% over the last month.  The stock holds a Zacks #5 Rank.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceBpz Resources BPZ 200912 -0.02 ($0.08) -166.67% 20100322 BTO 7.33China Transinfo CTFO 200912 0.22 $0.19  0.00% 20100322 BTO 7.9Copel-Adr Pr B ELP 200912 0.52 $0.29  11.54% 20100322 AMC 21.39Cti Industries CTIB 200912 0.09 $0.04  133.33% 20100322   2.65Cypress Biosci CYPB 200912 -0.13 ($0.19) 30.00% 20100322 BTO 5.04Gigamedia Ltd GIGM 200912 -0.04 $0.14  -140.00% 20100322 BTO 3.18Hasting Entmt HAST 201001 0.57 $0.41  -24.14% 20100322 BTO 4.21Maguire Pptys MPG 200912 -0.03 $0.04  -14.29% 20100322 AMC 2.63Rubio'S Restrnt RUBO 200912 -0.01 ($0.01) 20.00% 20100322 AMC 7.92Tiffany & Co TIF 201001 1.13 $0.85  43.48% 20100322 BTO 47.58Williams-Sonoma WSM 201001 0.73 $0.31  220.00% 20100322 BTO 24Adobe Systems ADBE 201002 0.3 $0.38  0.00% 20100323 AMC 35.75Antares Pharma AIS 200912 -0.03 ($0.04) -33.33% 20100323 AMC 1.48Carnival Corp CCL 201002 0.12 $0.33  20.00% 20100323 BTO 37.66Carnival Plc CUK 201002 0.1 $0.32  10.83% 20100323   39.83Cemig Sa -Adr CIG 200912 0.37 N/A N/A 20100323 AMC 16.62Darden Restrnt DRI 201002 0.92 $0.80  2.38% 20100323 AMC 43.49Digital Ally In DGLY 200912 0.06 ($0.06) -83.33% 20100323   2.08Inhibitex Inc INHX 200912 -0.09 ($0.08) 9.09% 20100323 BTO 1.36Jabil Circuit JBL 201002 0.22 $0.11  4.17% 20100323   17.73Kb Home KBH 201002 -0.45 ($0.75) -168.18% 20100323 BTO 17.64Lime Energy Co LIME 200912 -0.08 ($0.16) -84.62% 20100323 AMC 5.15Pharmathene Inc PIP 200912 -0.18 ($0.23) -105.26% 20100323   1.73Phillips Van He PVH 201001 0.59 $0.31  21.35% 20100323 AMC 54.08Progress Softwa PRGS 201002 0.38 $0.29  13.64% 20100323 AMC 32.44Sonic Corp SONC 201002 0.02 $0.08  -28.57% 20100323 AMC 11.15Steelcase Inc SCS 201002 0 ($0.04) 0.00% 20100323 BTO 7.27Sypris Solution SYPR 200912 -0.12 ($0.58) 85.71% 20100323   3.24Transcept Pharm TSPT 200912 -0.23 ($1.31) -2800.00% 20100323 AMC 7.46Unisource Enrgy UNS 201003 0.22 $0.64  3.70% 20100323 AMC 31.76Vertro Inc VTRO 200912 0.01 ($0.13) 0.00% 20100323 AMC 0.43Walgreen Co WAG 201002 0.71 $0.65  8.33% 20100323 DMT 34.82Amer Caresource ANCI 200912 0.01 $0.08  0.00% 20100324 AMC 1.84Cke Restaurants CKR 201001 0.07 $0.05  -6.25% 20100324 AMC 11.4Commercial Metl CMC 201002 -0.94 ($0.11) -340.00% 20100324 BTO 16.67Danaos Corp DAC 200912 0.26 $0.47  15.38% 20100324 AMC 4.56Delias Inc DLIA 201001 -0.06 ($0.01) 0.00% 20100324 BTO 2Genl Mills GIS 201002 0.93 $0.79  6.21% 20100324 BTO 73.64Lennar Corp -A LEN 201002 -0.32 ($0.27) 53.57% 20100324 BTO 16.54Omnova Solution OMN 201002 0.1 $0.02  73.33% 20100324 AMC 7.23Paychex Inc PAYX 201002 0.33 $0.36  6.06% 20100324 AMC 32.47Red Hat Inc RHT 201002 0.12 $0.14  8.33% 20100324 AMC 30.2Robbins & Myers RBN 201002 0.14 $0.46  0.00% 20100324 BTO 26.98Accenture Plc ACN 201002 0.61 $0.63  3.08% 20100325 AMC 42.28Ada-Es Inc ADES 200912 -0.35 ($0.10) -230.43% 20100325 BTO 7Amer Apparel APP 200912 0.04 $0.05  25.00% 20100325 AMC 3.37Best Buy BBY 201002 1.79 $1.61  23.26% 20100325 BTO 40.45Conagra Foods CAG 201002 0.43 $0.40  10.64% 20100325 BTO 25.86Conns Inc CONN 201001 0.01 $0.69  -480.00% 20100325 BTO 6.15Cost Plus Inc CPWM 201001 0.34 ($0.60) 8.18% 20100325 AMC 2.09Freds Inc FRED 201001 0.15 $0.20  -18.75% 20100325 BTO 10.41Full House Reso FLL 200912 0.07 $0.02  50.00% 20100325 BTO 3.18Inx Inc INXI 200912 -0.01 ($0.23) -500.00% 20100325 AMC 4.83Lululemon Athlt LULU 201001 0.29 $0.20  5.26% 20100325 BTO 34.83Mccormick & Co MKC 201002 0.47 $0.44  1.11% 20100325 BTO 38.85Ngp Cap Rsrcs NGPC 200912 0.17 $0.53  0.00% 20100325 BTO 8.88Oracle Corp ORCL 201002 0.36 $0.34  5.71% 20100325 AMC 25.38Saba Software SABA 201002 0.04 $0.06  25.00% 20100325 AMC 5.28Sabesp -Adr SBS 200912 1.39 $0.43  -42.20% 20100325   35.84Scholastic Corp SCHL 201002 -0.13 ($0.12) 21.16% 20100325 BTO 29.61Signet Grp Plc SIG 201001 1.2 $1.09  52.94% 20100325 DMT 29.33Smart Modular SMOD 201002 0.15 $0.04  20.00% 20100325 AMC 6.67Spectrum Contrl SPEC 201002 0.19 $0.17  0.00% 20100325 AMC 11.96Synnex Corp SNX 201002 0.62 $0.59  11.84% 20100325 AMC 31.38Texas Inds TXI 201002 -0.81 $0.25  -50.00% 20100325 BTO 38.15Tibco Software TIBX 201002 0.07 $0.07  16.67% 20100325 AMC 10.58Uti Worldwide UTIW 201001 0.15 $0.15  -5.26% 20100325 BTO 17.11Wet Seal Inc -A WTSLA 201001 0.08 $0.09  0.00% 20100325 AMC 4.47Finish Line-Cla FINL 201002 0.46 $0.36  100.00% 20100326 BTO 13.99Hearusa Inc EAR 200912 0.01 ($0.08) 0.00% 20100326   1.61Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

1007,GIS,"Earnings Preview 12/14 - 12/18
"
1008,GIS,"Next week will be a light one on the earnings front, with a total of only 40 companies reporting, including 9 S&P 500 firms. Among the more noteworthy names that are going to report are: Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report). There will also be several potentially market-moving economic reports.Monday
"
1009,GIS,"•    Nothing of significance.Tuesday
"
1010,GIS,"•    The Producer Price Index (PPI) is released for November. The headline PPI is expected to show an increase of 0.9%, on top of last month’s 0.3% increase. However, most of that is expected to come from food and energy price increases. The core PPI is expected to post an increase of just 0.2% after falling 0.6% in October.
"
1011,GIS,"•    The Empire State Manufacturing Survey is expected to show that manufacturing activity in the New York area increased at a slightly faster pace in its December survey than it did in its November survey, with a reading or 25.0, up from 23.5.
"
1012,GIS,"•    Capacity Utilization is expected to have risen to 71.1% overall in November, up from 70.7% in October. This is still an extremely low reading, but has been showing signs of rebounding in recent months. If the consensus expectations are met it will be the 5th straight monthly increase since it bottomed in June at 68.3%, an all-time record low. Total Capacity Utilization normally runs at around 80% in a healthy economy. Manufacturing Capacity utilization was 67.6% in October, up from a low of 65.1% in June. This report is far more important than the amount of attention it usually receives.
"
1013,GIS,"•    Industrial production is expected to have expanded by 0.6% in November after a 0.1% increase in October.Wednesday
"
1014,GIS,"•    Housing Starts are expected to rebound to an annualized rate of 575,000 after a very disappointing level of just 529,000 in October. Recent strength in new home sales have given builders a bit more leeway in starting additional homes.
"
1015,GIS,"•    Building Permits, the best indicator of future housing starts, are expected to rise to a 570,000 annual rate, up from 552,000 in October.
"
1016,GIS,"•    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will probably rise by 0.3% in November on a headline basis after rising 0.2% in October. Core (ex-food and energy) CPI is expected to be up a more tame 0.1% after a 0.3% increase in October. Within the report, pay special attention to how Rent and Owner's Equivalent Rent are doing. Together they make up almost 30% of the total CPI and almost 40% of the core CPI, and should be keeping overall inflation in check.
"
1017,GIS,"•    The Federal Reserve finishes up their two-day policy meeting. There is almost no chance that they will raise the Fed Funds rate from its current 0 to 0.25% range. Economists will be reading the tea leaves in the Fed statement closely for any change in tone that might indicate when the Fed will start tightening again.Thursday
"
1018,GIS,"•    Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. These have been in a steep downward trend of late, although still at historically high levels. Last week there were 474,000 initial claims -- the first increase in five weeks. Look for the decline to resume. Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late, even if one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus Program. Look for a further decline in regular continuing claims from the current level of 5.157 million, offset by a smaller rise in the extended claims which now total 4.586 million.
"
1019,GIS,"•    The Index of Leading Economic Indicators is expected to post a gain of 0.7% following a 0.3% gain last month.Friday
"
1020,GIS,"•    No reports of any significance.Potential Positive Surprises
"
1021,GIS,"Historically, the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report) is expected to post EPS of  $1.06, down from $1.58 last year. That low expectation sets it up for a positive surprise.  Last time out they just met expectations, but the stock holds a coveted Zacks Rank #1 and over the last month the expectations for the about-to-be-reported quarter have jumped by 25.7%.  General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) is expected to report EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.36 a year ago. The mean estimate for the quarter has edged up by 0.8% over the last month and last time out the company posted a positive surprise of 24.3%. The stock holds a Zacks Rank of 2.Joy Global (JOYG), the maker of mining machines, is expected to see EPS drop to $1.01 from $1.23 last year. However, last time out it posted a 26% positive surprise and the estimates for this quarter have edged up by 0.8% over the last month. The stock holds a Zacks Rank of 2.Potential Negative Surprises
"

"
1031,GIS,"Revenue revisions ratio at 1.63 for 2009
"
1032,GIS,"Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. Our analysis of the S&P 500 will now use Zacks own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the change will result in better granularity of the data. (The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together.)  In addition, we will now present top line as well as bottom line expectations and surprise information. This is very much or a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
1033,GIS,"Since we are in the heart of earnings season, we will first focus on the quarterly data for those firms that have already reported. We will add more annual information in the weeks to come.
"
1034,GIS,"The overall picture is very similar to the second quarter with most firms beating both earnings and revenues expectation, but both the top and bottom lines are lower than a year ago. As far as the surprises are concerned, firms are doing better on the bottom line than on the top line. Of the 66 firms that have reported so far, 50 have come in with EPS that are higher than expected, while only 9 have disappointed, a ratio of 5.56:1. While firms have long tried to under-promise and over-deliver, the normal ratio has been about 3:1 positive to negative (over the last five years or so), so this definitely counts as a better than normal bottom line earnings season so far.
"
1035,GIS,"The median earnings surprise is a very strong 7.9%. (Normally the median surprise runs at about 3%.) However, this is in large part a triumph of low expectations. There are 38 companies with earnings that are lower than a year ago while only 28 have seen positive year-over-year growth.
"
1036,GIS,"The disparity between firms beating estimates, but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is a huge 10, but the growth ratio is just 0.36. A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Retailers. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
1037,GIS,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations. In terms of actual year-over-year growth, however, it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 66 firms that have already reported are 4.6% below year ago levels. A total of 44 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus only 22 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 2.0. On the other hand, only 17 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 49 with lower revenues.
"
1038,GIS,"For the market as a whole, but especially for Tech, the better than expected, but worse than a year ago story also applies to revenues. While only 13.3% of the Tech firms have actually grown revenues from a year ago, 86.7% have seen revenues drop. Still, the expectations were set very low on the revenue side. As a result, 86.7% of them have exceeded expectations and only 13.3% have fallen short.
"
1039,GIS,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, 23.3% of reported companies have generated positive year-over-year revenue growth, while 76.7% have seen revenue declines. However, 66.0% have exceeded revenue expectations, while 34.0% have fallen short.
"
1040,GIS,"In other words, cost cutting has been the major force driving earnings. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someones paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. Still, the strategy seems to be working as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with 6 sectors seeing more than 4 increases for each cut, while only 2 sectors, Utilities and Aerospace, seeing more cuts than increases.
"
1041,GIS,"For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.31, its highest level in over a year. The current ratio is also in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point.

"
1050,GIS,"Staples and Finance only sectors with more positive growth firms than negative growth
"
1051,GIS,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the % reported in mind, especially since the sample size for some sectors is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For sectors with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new companies are added to the sample. Thus, the 76.7% median surprise in Basic Materials is probably less significant than the 15.15% surprise in Consumer Staples, especially when you consider that the consensus is usually much tighter for Staples firms than for materials firms.
"
1052,GIS,"Some of the more impressive earnings surprises in staples include General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report). Tech has also had a number of impressive earnings surprises including Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and National Semiconductor (NSM).

1097,GIS,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
1098,GIS,"As I write this, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report) are trading higher in response to raised fiscal second-quarter estimates from one brokerage analyst. The change has yet to be factored into the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which currently stands at 47 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly higher at 48 cents per share. The home goods retailer has topped expectations for 2 consecutive quarters and could be a beneficiary of the rebound in housing. Bed, Bath & Beyond is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Sep 23, after the close of trading.
"
1099,GIS,"Though used cars did not qualify for the Cash for Clunkers rebates, optimism about CarMax's (KMX  -  Free Report) second-quarter results has been growing. During the past few weeks, 4 brokerage analysts have raised their profit projections. The revisions have pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 2 cents higher to 18 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at 19 cents per share. KMX beat expectations over the past 2 quarters after previously missing twice. CarMax is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 22, before the start of trading.
"
1100,GIS,"Though KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) is projected to have lost 68 cents per share, the actual fiscal third-quarter loss could be less than most analysts forecast. The most accurate estimate is far more bullish, calling for a loss of 61 cents per share, and the homebuilder has topped expectations for 2 consecutive quarters. KB Home is scheduled to report on Friday, Sep 25, before the start of trading.
"
1101,GIS,"Research in Motion (RIMM) has topped expectations for 3 consecutive quarters. Ahead of the company's fiscal second-quarter report, 3 analysts have raised their projections. The changes were not significant enough to move the Zacks Consensus Estimate from its current level of $1 per share, though the most accurate estimate is a penny higher, at $1.01 per share. Research in Motion is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 24, after the close of trading.
"
1102,GIS,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesTexas Industries (TXI) has missed expectations during 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Shareholders should brace themselves for another disappointment with 3 of the 8 covering analysts cutting their fiscal first-quarter estimates within the past few weeks. The revisions have caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate to drop 7 cents to a projected loss of 5 cents per share. Texas Industries is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 24, before the start of trading.

"
1130,GIS,"Staples and Health Care expected to lead with small increases
"
1131,GIS,"Materials and Energy expected to see massive year-over-year declines
"
1132,GIS,"Earnings are coming in much better than expected, with almost 40% of the reports in. While in this report we have not tracked revenues, there seems to be a general pattern where the source of the positive surprises is coming from much better-than-expected margins (both operating and net) rather than from better-than-expected revenue growth. In other words companies are succeeding in cost cutting their way, if not to prosperity, then at least much better than feared results.
"
1133,GIS,"While, at the individual company level, this is almost always a positive, it is not necessarily so at the macro level. Cutting costs by reducing head count means that there are fewer jobs and less overall demand in the economy. Still, given the weak state of the economy, I suspect most investors will not be too picky about the source of the earnings improvements.
"
1134,GIS,"The one exception to this might be in the financials, where the earnings quality is weak due to FASB caving to political pressure and doing away with mark to market accounting. On the other hand, I have not seen any situations of massive mark-to-market of the liabilities but not the assets like we saw in the first quarter.
"
1135,GIS,"The total earnings reported so far is $78.9 billion, a decline of 16.1% from the $94.0 billion the same 198 firms reported a year ago. However, on a sequential basis earnings are up 7.1% from the first quarter pace. Actual earnings growth has been a pretty rare commodity with only 63 firms actually posting higher net income than a year ago.
"
1136,GIS,"The median EPS growth rate is a negative 17.3%. (Those still left to report have a median expected EPS growth rate of -13.7%.) While the median EPS growth reported is largely in line with the total net income decline, there is a big difference when it comes to those yet to report.
"
1137,GIS,"The total net income of the remaining firms is expected to plunge 40.3%, which is far worse than what we have seen so far, as well as very different from the median. The big decline in total net income for the remaining firms may be in part due to the mix of firms that have reported, with a very small percentage of the total energy earnings in yet (20% of Energy firms have reported, but none of the big guys that represent the bulk of the earnings in the sector). On the other hand it means that the bar is set very low for the remaining firms and we may well see more positive earnings surprises.
"
1138,GIS,"Keep in mind that medians are inherently equally weighted with the growth rate of a relatively small firm counting as much as that of an Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) or a Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report). Also changes in share count can affect EPS growth, but not total net income growth.

"
1153,GIS,"So far, this is looking like the story of the dog that didn't bark. Yes, the revisions ratio has edged up, but given the magnitude and number of positive surprises in second quarter earnings, one would expect a flood of positive estimate revisions.
"
1154,GIS,"After all the second quarter is part of the full year 2009, so if a company beats the estimates for the quarter, and the analysts do not raise their estimates for the full year by the amount of the beat, then they are implicitly cutting their forecasts for the third and fourth quarters. There is a very good possibility that this is simply a lag effect in the data, as the pace of reports has really picked up in the last few days. If so we should see the revisions ratios rise dramatically over the next few weeks. If not, it will be a subtle, but very disturbing sign.
"
1155,GIS,"The defensive Staples and Health Care sectors are doing the best on the revision front. However, Materials is about as cyclical a sector as you can think of and it has shown a great improvement in its revisions ratio, apparently in response to the much better-than-expected earnings in the sector. Utilities are the weakest sector, followed by the very small Telecom sector. No Utilities have reported yet and only one Telecom company (AT&T (T  -  Free Report)) has reported.
"
1156,GIS,"In the Staples and Health Care sectors, analysts generally tend to be in tight agreement about the expected earnings (small standard deviation around the mean estimate). They, therefore, will not show up on screens of the biggest estimate revisions. On the other hand it means that even small changes in the mean estimate can be significant, and it is best to look for large numbers of analysts changing their estimates in one direction, rather than for big changes in the mean estimate.
"
1157,GIS,"In Health Care, the big drug companies stand out in this regard. Among the notables are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Schering-Plough (SGP). The same is true for the staples, where some of the stocks with large numbers of estimate increases include Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Colgate Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report).
"

1176,GIS,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. The food giant has been reporting dismal revenues for the last few quarters. Much like other U.S. food giants like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, General Mills too is having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.The company’s total sales declined 3.5% in the first quarter. Organic sales declined 4%, wider than the 3% drop in the prior quarter. Price/mix did not impact quarterly revenues but volumes declined 4% in the quarter.Resultantly, General Mills’ shares have declined 9.3% year to date, compared with the industry’s decline of 6%.Let’s see how the company's top line is shaping up for this earnings season.Although General Mills is making efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to follow the trend in the second quarter as well. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, accounting for about 65% of the company’s total sales, have been soft owing to lower volumes in yogurts and cereals. At the same time, retailers are also reducing inventory, given the ongoing price war. The company’s North America Retail’s sales declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and 4.6% in the last reported quarter.Although the company expects organic sales to be better in the second quarter sequentially, we believe that the company needs time to be back in the positive territory. The company expects product innovations, promotions during key seasons for soup and refrigerated dough, and investments in compelling media campaigns to strengthen its brands will bring in improvements. As for fiscal 2018, General Mills expects its total organic sales to decline 1-2%.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s North America segment revenues, of $2.7 billion are likely to surge 9.2% sequentially but is expected to decline 0.03% year over year.Convenience Stores & Food Service segment is likely to witness 8.9% sequential growth but is expected to remain unchanged year over year. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe & Australia segment revenues of $454 million indicates a decrease of 7.7% from the prior quarter but 0.04% growth on a year-over-year basis. Again, the consensus estimate for Asia & Latin America segment revenues of $457 million are likely to increase 16.6% sequentially and 0.04% year over year.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.1 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 7.8%. However, revenues of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company are likely to decline 1.2% year-over-year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.General Mills, Inc.

1177,GIS,"With a significant portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, Mondelez International, Inc.’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) international markets have contributed significantly to growth. The company generated about 73.2% of revenues from outside the United States in 2016 and 73.6% in the first nine months of 2017.The emerging markets of Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia offer solid long-term prospects. The company’s organic revenues from emerging markets increased 2.7% in 2016 as well as in the first nine months of 2017. Mondelez is building new plants and expanding existing ones in China — one of the key emerging markets.Another key market for Mondelez is India where its business is run by Cadbury India Ltd. The company has seen strong growth in the country in the past few quarters. India revenues grew double digits in the third quarter of 2017 owing to the ongoing momentum in products like Fuse and Silk Oreo.In Brazil, improving dynamics in chocolate resulted in a fourth straight quarter of growth. Overall, Brazil revenues were up low single digits in the third quarter. Mexico continued to deliver solid growth, driven by strength in candy while growth in Argentina was led by pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.We believe emerging markets with continue to enhance Mondelez’s prospects at a time when the North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption due to a shift in consumer preference toward organic food items. Food companies like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, have also been struggling to boost sales over the last few years. Revenues from North America were down 1.2% in the first nine months of 2017 and overall sales declined 1.2% over the same time frame.Though overall sales have been sluggish, Mondelez's margins have been consistently strong buoyed by cost savings and productivity gains.  Operating margin expanded 330 basis points year over year, in the first nine months of 2017.The company’s $3.5-billion restructuring plan (2014-2018 Restructuring Program) is expected to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018. Operating margin is expected to scale to 17-18% by next year. Savings from the program are being used to fund marketing investments and expand capacity to boost the top line and market share. The company is also working to drive advertising cost efficiencies by consolidating media providers, reducing non-working media costs and spending in lower-cost digital media outlets.Stock Price MovementThough Mondelez’s shares have lost 4.5% so far this year, it compares favorably with the 8.2% decline of its industry. Earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 increased 0.9% each, over the last 30 days. This signifies that analysts are optimistic about this stock’s near-term performance. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 2.96%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1178,GIS,"With thanksgiving around the corner, Kellogg Company’s (K  -  Free Report) acquired brand Pringles introduced a snack named Pringles Thanksgiving Dinner in eight new flavors.This new thanksgiving-themed snack is not available for retail sale. To ensure that the latest flavors meet consumer expectations, the snack has been launched as a pilot taste test in limited quantity.Notably, the buyout of Pringles, the biggest brand of Kellogg, has helped the company offer a more balanced cereal and snacks basket and gain traction in international markets. Pringles ended 2016 with solid mid-single digit growth and the company continues to see strong growth in emerging markets across all categories — cereal, wholesome snacks and Pringles. In fact, Kellogg concluded 2016 with double-digit internal growth in its Mediterranean Middle East business and Russian business.The latest addition is in line with Kellogg’s efforts to diversify its product line. The company has been channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulation of existing products to meet the rapidly changing taste of consumers pertaining to health and wellness. The new flavors are expected to drive demand for wholesome snacks, helping the company gain further traction.However, despite Pringles’ robust Asia-Pacific performance in third-quarter 2017, the overall snacks business in the United States has been weak since 2013 owing to low volumes. Shift in consumer preference toward healthier food options has been particularly hurting the company’s sales along with that of food giants like General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report).In fact, the wholesome snacks business has been weak in the past few quarters due to lack of effective innovation. Though management is working to revive the business through investments in innovation and better in-store execution, the efforts are yet to show results. In the first nine months of 2017, the U.S. Snacks segment’s net sales dropped 3.6% year over year (also organically).Meanwhile, shares of Kellogg have underperformed its industry so far this year. The company’s shares have lost 11.4% when compared with the industry’s decline of 8.2%. Nevertheless, continuous expansion of product line and restructuring initiatives are expected to drive growth and profits for Kellogg.In fact, earnings estimates for the current year have inched up 1.3% over a month, reflecting analysts’s optimism over the stock’s prospects.Kellogg currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1179,GIS,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results, after market close on Nov 1. Last quarter, this packaged food manufacturer delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.08%. Also, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 3.68%. The chart below depicts the surprise history. The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise   The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Kraft Heinz Company Quote The company has been seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters due to soft global retail and consumer demand. In the first half of 2017, reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) have been performing dismally for quite some time. Consumption trends in a number of the company’s key categories remain challenged. Three of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the steepest decline in Canada (down 8.9%) and Europe (down 5.8%). Its flagship U.S. segment saw a 2.3% year-over-year decline in net sales. The company’s overall organic sales also declined 1.8% during the period. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter. Nevertheless, the company expects organic sales growth to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. This will likely be driven by strong marketing, go-to-market and product quality initiatives.  Kraft Heinz has implemented several cost-saving initiatives, including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz. The company plans to cut annual costs by $1.7 billion by 2017-end, primarily through work-force reduction along with factory closures and consolidations. Cost savings have driven margins for the company, mainly in the developed markets of the United States and Europe. Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero-based budgeting, modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint. However, adverse impact of lower volumes, higher commodity costs and foreign exchange headwind could hurt profits in the to-be-reported quarter. Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 83 cents, reflecting a 0.3% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $6.3 billion, implying a 0.9% increase. Here is what our quantitative model predicts: Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kraft Heinz is +0.56%.

1180,GIS,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31 before the opening bell.Kellogg has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last two years, primarily due to lower demand. Particularly, weak performance of its cereal products in developed markets as well as soft U.S. snacks business has been negatively impacting the company.Kellogg, much like a number of other U.S. food producers such as General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter and Kellogg expects its top line to remain subdued in 2017.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation. The company’s sales in the second half of 2017 are expected to somewhat benefit from innovation and Pringles’ improved performance in Europe. Again, the company’s sales in Brazil are likely to benefit from the Parati acquisition. Mexico and Australia’s sales are likely to be higher owing to better shipments and improvement in pricing and mix.As per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kellogg’s total North America segment’s revenues are expected to witness a 0.04% decline in the third quarter. Europe revenues are likely to witness a decline of 0.01%. However, Latin America as well as Asia Pacific revenues are likely to register 0.2% and 0.03% growth in the quarter, respectively.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, implying a 1.2% decline.However, cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program are somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales. Although the top line has been weak, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to give support to its bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also expected to diminish, thereby further supporting EPS growth.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 93 cents, reflecting a 2.8% year-over-year decrease.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Kellogg has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is +0.50%.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

The products will be free from artificial colors, flavors and preservatives.Innovation Efforts to Counter Sales SlumpWith growing awareness of the nutritional value of food products and a subsequent shift in consumer preference toward organic product over packaged items, Kraft Heinz, like many other companies in the industry, is emphasizing on natural and organic ingredients, reshaping its existing products and entering new categories.The company has been seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. Kraft Heinz’s categories have seen a slowdown due to soft global retail and consumer demand. Consumption trends in a number of the company’s key categories like ready-to-drink beverages, frozen meals and salad dressings remain challenged. In the first half of 2017, reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada.In fact, shares of Kraft Heinz have lost 6.8% year to date. Earnings estimates have also moved down 1.6% for the current year and 2% for the next over the last 60 days.A few of the company’s successful innovative endeavors to boost demand include Lunchables, P3, Heinz Yellow Mustard sauces in Europe and Mayo in Brazil. It also renovated Kool-Aid Jammers and added a new line of Classico Riserva branded premium pasta sauces. Further, a range of frozen meals with enhanced nutrition is slated for launch this year.Notably, the company expects organic sales growth to ramp up in the second half of 2017 on stronger sales performance and cost savings.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples  sector are Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report), The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.

1182,GIS,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30 after market close.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been giving a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales. Mondelez, in particular, witnessed a decline in revenues for the last nine quarters, primarily due to lower demand.Mondelez’s sales were down 2.8% on a 2.1% decline in volumes in the first half of 2017. Organically, sales decreased 1% in the period. However, the company expects its sales to rebound in the second half delivering companywide organic sales growth of 1% for 2017. The company’s third-quarter volumes are expected to get a boost owing to delayed shipments after the cyberattack in the preceding quarter. The company’s shipping process was affected due to the global malware attack. That said, the company expects to recognize and recover delayed shipments during the third quarter that would result in higher volumes.Mondelez’s North America segment, comprising about 26% of the total revenues, is expected to witness growth in the third quarter after registering a 5% year-over-year decline in revenues in the first half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 billion for the segment’s revenues reflect growth of 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.The company has a strong innovation agenda in North America for the second half of 2017. Mondelez has several new products in the pipeline to boost North American sales. These include new Vea brand snacks, non-GMO Triscuits, Belvita Protein, Ritz Crisp & Thins, and Good Thins.Europe revenues are likely to witness 12.4% growth. The consensus estimate for Latin America revenues of $911 million indicates an increase of 5% from the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in seven of the past nine quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has also been able to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.Mondelez’s third-quarter margins are expected to gain from higher volumes as well as lower overhead and advertising costs. Again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, higher pricing and restructuring are expected to boost its margin. Mondelez anticipates adjusted earnings to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant-currency basis for 2017 and remains on track to reach its 17-18% profit-margin goal by 2018.For the third quarter, Mondelez’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 54 cents, reflecting a 3.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.5 billion, implying 1.2% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Mondelez has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is +0.84%.Zacks Rank: Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1183,GIS,"B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, after market close. The company posted a negative earnings surprise in the last quarter and has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by average of 8.12% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things shape up prior to this announcement.In the third quarter of 2017, the company had plans to extend the line of Green Giant frozen innovation products launched in 2016 with five new entries. This is expected to boost demand, thereby driving revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.10 billion, implying 8.7% growth. Notably, net sales of Green Giant frozen products grew $9.4 million or 14% in the second quarter, driven by the brand's innovative products.We are also encouraged by the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy. B&G Foods acquired snack foods manufacturer, Back to Nature Foods Company. The deal is expected to contribute to cash earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow.Meanwhile, the company’s earlier buyouts, Victoria Fine Foods Holding Company and Victoria Fine Foods, LLC in December 2016 and spices and seasonings business of ACH Food Companies, Inc in November 2016, are also likely to contribute to third-quarter results.B&G Foods expects cost savings from Mama Mary's plant consolidation, procurement savings and packaging changes of few Green Giant products to drive incremental adjusted EBITDA of approximately $7 million in the third and fourth quarter of 2017.However, the company expects incremental frozen, warehouse and distribution costs of approximately $4 million to impact third-quarter results.Also, the company’s weak base business raises concerns. The company's base sales declined 2.4% in the first quarter and 4.9% in the second quarter of 2017 owing to declining unit volumes.Again, the North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption over the last few quarters due to a shift in consumer preference toward healthier options. This has been hurting results of major food companies like General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report). For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 48 cents, reflecting a 14.3% year-over-year decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:B&G Foods has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for B&G Foods is +4.17%.

1184,GIS,"In line with the strategy to diversify its organic offerings, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) entered into an agreement to acquire protein bar maker, Chicago Bar Company.Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States.Transaction DetailsThe acquisition, valued at $600 million or $400 million net of tax benefits, is anticipated to close by 2017-end. Chicago Bar Company will operate as an independent business within Kellogg.RXBAR expects to generate net sales of $120 million in fiscal 2017. Kellogg expects the multiple on projected 2018 EBITDA to be in the 12x-14x range, inclusive of the tax benefits to the purchase price. The acquisition however will not be accretive to earnings in 2017 and 2018, excluding one-time costs.Buyout BenefitsThe addition of “clean-label, high-protein” RXBAR can be expected to revive Kellogg’s wholesome snacks business, which has been weak over the past few quarters. The U.S. snacks business has been struggling since 2013 owing to weak volumes. Though Pringles has been performing well, the deterioration in U.S. snacks is stemming from weakness in weight-management products like Special K bars, Special K cracker chips and Right Bites' 100-calorie cookie packs. In the first six months of 2017, the snacks segment’s net sales dropped 3% year over year.Kellogg is poised to benefit from RXBAR’s immense brand appeal and strong online presence. RXBAR, on the other hand, will be able to capitalize on Kellogg's scale and resources to accelerate growth.Kellogg is innovating and diversifying its line of offerings to keep up with changing consumer needs and counter the weak sales trajectory, similar to food giants like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report).Persistently soft sales have led to a 18.4% decline in the company’s shares in the past year. The stock has also been trading below its industry. Current-year estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock went down 0.3% in the last 30 days but remained stable for next year. Though Kellogg is facing tepid sales, such organic products can be expected to boost demand.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1185,GIS,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has been implementing cost saving initiatives, investing in consumer-focused innovation and accelerating the natural and organic product portfolio to boost its sales keeping the changing food preferences in mind.Earlier this month, the company posted weak first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5% and 7.8%, respectively.ChallengesMajor U.S. food companies are fighting a tough battle as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience foods are gradually losing sheen. Consumers would earlier take decisions based on taste, price and convenience.This seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), and others, thus making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales.In the recently reported quarter, General Mills’ adjusted earnings and revenues declined 9% and 3.5%, respectively, year over year due to weak sales across the board, barring Convenience Stores & Foodservice, and Europe & Australia segments. Its core U.S. Retail business’ sales declined 5% primarily due to double-digit declines in the domestic yogurt operating unit and a 7% decline in cereals. The company’s organic sales also declined 4%, with volumes decreasing 4%.The company also revealed a weak margin picture with adjusted gross margin declining 230 basis points (bps) due to higher input costs. Adjusted operating margin also plunged 210 bps thanks to lower adjusted gross margins and an increase in advertising and media expense.Again, fiscal 2018 guidance seems to be a shade depressing, depicting organic sales decline of 1% to 2%, segment operating profit growth of 0% to 1% (restructuring savings partly offsetting higher investments), and earnings per share growth of 1% to 2%.Management is trying to turn around the U.S. Retail business through consumer-focused innovation and marketing. However, a material improvement in the segment will take some time.Turnaround EffortsTo regain lost ground, General Mills laid out four global growth priorities for improving its top line. Growing Cereal globally, improving U.S. yogurt through innovation, investing in differential growth opportunities and managing the company’s foundation brands with appropriate investment are the key agendas. Precisely, expanding the Cereal business includes Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), which is the joint venture with Nestlé based in Switzerland that markets cereal in 130 countries.The company is investing in consumer-focused innovation, marketing and accelerating its organic product portfolio to boost sales in a challenging and dynamic environment.Furthermore, General Mills is on track to achieve its cost-savings target for fiscal 2018 as it forges ahead with its margin-expansion efforts. The company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equate to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.The company remains optimistic about the rest of fiscal 2018 and expects retail sales to contribute positively, beginning second quarter. Although, we do not expect significant sales growth in the near term, the declines are expected to narrow down as the company focuses more on sales growth, banking on product innovations. Hence, sales are likely to strengthen and margin headwinds to diminish as we move forward through the fiscal year, driving profit growth in the second half of fiscal 2018.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1186,GIS,"A small handful of multinational conglomerates seemingly own almost every major consumer packaged goods brand, food company, or restaurant chain—yet some big-name brands and firms have managed to survive, sometimes for decades, all on their own.Nestle (NSRGY  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Unilever (UN  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), and an array other firms dominate consumer-facing industries, snatching up brands left and right. The reach of these multibillion-dollar companies is greater than ever, especially as some of the largest companies begin to join forces in order to compete long-term on a grand scale.But there will always be companies that avoid being swallowed up by brands for various reasons, especially if their stocks are performing well and their bottom lines continue to grow.Now let’s look at four companies that are almost certainly household names throughout the U.S. that many people might find hard to believe are still their own publicly traded firms.Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. Little tiny Tootsie Rolls have been staples in Halloween baskets for decades. But the candy company’s success might make investors think it got scooped up by a candy giant, such as Mars, years ago. On the contrary, Tootsie Roll has turned into a bit of a powerhouse itself.The company now boasts an array of different candy brands—from Blow Pop and Caramel Apple Pops to Dots and even Junior Mints. With a market cap of $2.38 billion, shares of Tootsie Roll have climbed steadily in recent years. The candy power’s stock now sits just a few dollars below its all-time high of $40.44 per share and has popped from under $20 a share just over five years ago.The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report)Like Tootsie Roll, Clorox has turned itself into a bit of a conglomerate. The cleaning company’s brands include Green Works, Pine-Sol, Glad, 409, and others. With a market cap of nearly $17 billion, the company is certainly not small and wouldn’t be easily acquired, but with giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) out there lurking, it is a testament to the company’s strength that it still stands on its own.The company, which has been around for more than 100 years, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but earned an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system. Shares of Clorox have soared over the last decade and have gained 9.40% since the start of the year.Nathan's Famous, Inc. The host of the famous 4th of July hot dog eating contest has been churning out cased-meats since 1916. Nathan’s Famous is a small cap company with a market cap of around $310 million, and it has seen its stock price do a 360-degree turn in just the last two years. Nathan’s stock sat at an all-time high of over $81 per share in 2015 before it sank to $30 a share. Shares then climbed back slowly and now rest at around $74.The company owns a line of grocery store dogs, burgers, fries, and pickles, as well as a chain of restaurants, yet it has not been scarfed up by big chains such as Yum! Brands.Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK  -  Free Report)This iconic maker of Twinkies, Ho Hos, and others screams Americana. It is hard to believe that Hostess Brands has not been bought by a big CPG company, but, it in fact, just recently went public.Hostess Brands was almost bankrupt less than a decade ago, then two investment firms bought the company out of liquidation in 2013. The company then went public in 2016. With a market cap of $1.78 billion, the newly public snack maker’s stock price has fared well. Shares of the company that has been around since before the Great Depression gained a modest 6.15% since the start of the year, but Hostess Brands is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1189,GIS,"General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is a leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. The company’s core brands like Big G cereals, Betty Crocker and Hamburger Helper dinner mixes, Pillsbury refrigerated dough products, Progresso soups and Yoplait yogurt enjoy leading positions in attractive food categories.However, much like the rest of the food industry, GIS has been under pressure lately as its U.S. sales and profits have been hurt by changing consumer food preferences. To cater to the evolving consumer tastes, General Mills is investing in consumer-focused innovation and marketing and accelerating its natural and organic product portfolio to improve sales.Investors should note that the consensus estimate for the current quarter for GIS has remained stable over the last 60 days.

1190,GIS,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 20, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.82%.This branded consumer foods’ company delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.86%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderAlthough General Mills is making efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to witness muted sales growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, which accounted for about 65.3% of the company’s total sales in fiscal 2017, have been soft due to lower demand amid weak food industry trends and changing consumer preferences. Further, organically, year-over-year sales growth is anticipated to decline 1-2% in fiscal 2018.However, much like the other food companies, General Mills, too is focusing on cost-cutting initiatives to boost margin amid soft sales. During the last-reported quarter, despite soft sales, the company’s adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points (bps) year over year to 35.1%, helped by cost-saving measures. Even its adjusted operating margin grew 220 bps to 16.8%, owing to higher adjusted gross margins, benefits from cost-savings initiatives, and a 17% decline in advertising and media expense.The company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.That said, an expected decline in volumes, primarily in North America, higher promotional expenses, as planned for the second half of fiscal 2018, and rising input costs are likely to remain a drag in the to-be-reported quarter.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 77 cents, reflecting a decline of 1.7% year over year. Meanwhile, our estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.79 billion, implying a 3% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that General Mills is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: General Mills’ Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 77 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Mills’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the consumer staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.08% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report its quarterly results on Oct 19.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.36% and a Zacks Rank #3.
