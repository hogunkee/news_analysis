8,COG,"The Chicago Democrat, who still sneaks smokes when no one's looking, is president again in large part thanks to Republican errors. 
"
9,COG,"He has no business occasionally occupying the Oval Office, corroding trust in American institutions, violating all laws of fiscal sanity, talking through his hat, monitoring Americans. He had to spend nearly a billion dollars of other peoples' money last year to get millions fewer votes than he did the first time.
"
10,COG,"Here's a news flash for Republicans: As Obama whispered to Russia's president last year, 2012 was his last election. He ain't running again. In 2016, Democrats will nominate the tired old face of Hillary Clinton. Start creating an achievement record for that struggle.
"
11,COG,"Yes, she was a nominee lock in 2008 too. But back in those days she was just a former first lady and ineffective senator. She's added to her resume since then as the most global-galavanting secretary of State in history, largely free of the acrid political rancor Obama was stoking in D.C.. 
"
12,COG,"And, more importantly, this time Clinton's opposition will be the even more tired face of Joe Biden, the gaffey guy who publicly admitted in 2008 that she would be a better VP. Barring some major development, nomination lock Hillary.
"
13,COG,"And Washington Republicans are doing just about everything they possibly can right now to ensure that Bill Clinton, the impeached Philanderer-in-Chief, will become the nation's first First Man. That takes some kind of political skill. And stupidity.
"
14,COG,"Witness Tuesday's big-news House vote on abortion. A 228-196 'victory' to ban abortions nationally after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Woo-Hoo. High-fives in the cloakroom. We be pure.
"
15,COG,"Of course, that bill is going nowhere. Everyone knows that. It's like hitting it over the fence in batting practice. The Democrat Senate won't even consider it. Obama promised a veto.

16,COG,"Simply put, that House vote could not possibly mean less. To go on the record? Seriously? Is there one sentient American on either side unaware of decades of Republican opposition to abortion? 
"
17,COG,"No one here doubts the sincerity or morality of its supporters or sponsor, Arizona's five-term Rep. Trent Franks. Family man. Two kids. Epic abortion opponent. In the state legislature, his tie-tack even depicted baby feet.
"
18,COG,"They say the measure was aimed at preventing another Kermit Gosnell case. But the awful deeds of the Philadelphia late-term abortionist were already illegal. Hence, the prison terms. Another law would somehow fail to not stop it better?

20,COG,"George W. Bush has a higher approval now than Obama, for pete's sake. Voters had to pick a legislator in 2008. So, they opted for the young, historic one who talked good.

22,COG,"There's an important place for the slippery legislative mind-set in America's political system. It's called the legislature.

24,COG,"But it gives a better shot at election than legislative experience; ask John Kerry, Bob Dole, Gerald Ford, Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Al Gore, Walter Mondale, Barry Goldwater.
"
25,COG,"That's why Hillary agreed to bolster her resume as chief executive of the State Department for her nemesis. That's why Mike Pence and Bobby Jindal quit the House to go govern Indiana and Louisiana, respectively.
"
26,COG,"Here's what Republicans should do: Stop falling for the Democrats' bait to argue about their issues. Who agrees to play every game on the road? And for Lincoln's sakes stop telling us what you would stop--abortion, gun control, ObamaCare, tax hikes, death tax, immigrant DREAMS, yada-yada.
"
27,COG,"Instead, start telling us what you would do--to make government more efficient, leaner, smaller, to educate children better, to ensure more efficient healthcare, to protect Social Security and Medicare/aid, to create a safe climate for small business to create jobs, to give taxpayers their money's-worth.

29,COG,"Ideological purity itself should not be the conservative goal. Better government is, through the freer-enterprise system, not government dictat.

30,COG,"Clinton will spend the next year seeking distance from Obama. She may even criticize him. Her husband has already started in ""private"" sessions leaked to media.
"
31,COG,"For four years Clinton was senior member of Obama's cabinet, a crucial cog in his liberal big government administration. She's from Chicago too. She sat at his right hand, not Biden. Make those links, over and over.
"
32,COG,"She leaves a treasure trove for opp research gnomes to mine--the undeclared war in Libya and resulting chaos, the policy failures in Egypt and Tunisia, the deadly inaction on Syria, the widening gap with Israel, ineffective sanctions on Iran, the unexplained and deadly security and preparedness failures in Benghazi, those trumped-up talking points, her crony aides' interference in State Department investigations. All will be useful someday.
"
33,COG,"Meanwhile, Republicans ought to focus on doing a good job where they are, on spiffing up their own house and backyard. So, next year and in 2016 voters are invited to make a proper comparison on actual achievements, not left to fall for the smears and false issues of attack ads.

93,COG,"Creighton Abrams wanted to see the whole battlefield.
"
94,COG,"So he directed his tank regiment while sticking out of his turret.
"
95,COG,"""Get down!"" he was warned.
"
96,COG,"The Army colonel refused and was never even wounded.
"
97,COG,"What he did was win — especially on D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge during World War II.
"
98,COG,"A quarter-century later he was a crucial cog in the buildup and drawdown of American forces in Vietnam and to overseeing the creation of the all-volunteer Army.
"
99,COG,"Abrams (1914-74) grew up in rural Agawam, Mass., the son of a railroad mechanic and a mother who cared for three children in the close-knit family.
"
100,COG,"Everyone in the area was poor, but this didn't mean much until Abrams received a scholarship to Brown University in his senior year of high school, based on his athletic and academic record. The family had to turn it down because it couldn't afford the books.
"
101,COG,"A Turn To The Army
"
102,COG,"He took the West Point test, passing with soaring marks and then borrowed $300 for his uniform and expenses before entering in 1932.
"
103,COG,"The Army that Abrams joined as a horse cavalry platoon commander in 1936 was ""small, scattered, ill-equipped, antiquated and uncertain about the future,"" Lewis Sorley, author of ""Thunderbolt: General Creighton Abrams and the Army of His Times,"" told IBD. ""Its 155,000 men made it 17th in size among the armies of the world, behind those of nations such as Romania and Yugoslavia.""
"
104,COG,"Still, Abrams saw the future: tanks. He transferred to them even while the Army's chief of cavalry ridiculed the idea that ""an untried machine can displace the proved and tried horse.""
"
105,COG,"By July 1942, with America in the thick of World War II, Abrams was on a roll. He took command of the 3rd Battalion, 37th Armored Regiment, and soon earned a reputation as a tactical experimenter.
"
106,COG,"""Two keys to his later success were that he was innovative and a lifelong learner,"" said Gregory Padgett, professor of history at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Fla. ""But while he was aggressive, he also carefully prepared, which is sometimes an unusual balance in the military. That combination allowed him to overcome extraordinary challenges on the European battlefield.""
"
107,COG,"After landing in Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944, Abrams spearheaded the attack, showing he had great battlefield intuition. He sensed when to take risks and where to go to surprise the enemy, his men recalled.
"
108,COG,"Abrams' outfit got so far ahead of the rest of the 4th Armored Division in September 1944 that it spent four days behind enemy lines, knocking out dozens of tanks and killing 2,000 German soldiers.
"
109,COG,"On Sept. 19, the American tanks ran into a massive concentration of German armor at Arracourt, France. Abrams gave the order — charge — and in four days the 37th destroyed 55 of the enemy machines while losing just 14.
"
110,COG,"It was one of the greatest tank-vs.-tank battles of the war, for which Abrams was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.
"
111,COG,"This was despite U.S. tanks having inadequate numbers, armor and guns. The Americans offset the disadvantages with a turret that could turn faster and with training that emphasized lightning mobility bull's-eye shots.
"
112,COG,"Cheers
"
113,COG,"The Stars & Stripes newspaper praised Abrams for being ""cherished by his people because he respected them for what they did. He never seemed to use the force of his rank as a weapon of command. That was the style of his greatness beyond his immense ability as a military man.""
"
114,COG,"Abrams' style offers a lesson for anyone in business: People will follow someone who leads from the front and walks the talk.
"
115,COG,"In early December 1944, the Germans launched the Battle of the Bulge. Suddenly, the 101st Airborne Division was surrounded by superior German forces at Bastogne, Belgium. The call went out to the 4th Armored to rush 120 miles to break through.
"
116,COG,"The 37th Tank and 53rd Armored Infantry battalions fought their way there. Then the day after Christmas, Abrams directed the assault that relieved the 101st. For this he received his second DSC.
"
117,COG,"""It was a daring thing and well done, the most brilliant operation we have thus far performed,"" Gen. George Patton wrote in his diary.
"
118,COG,"He later said, ""I'm supposed to be the best tank commander in the Army, but I have one peer—Abrams is the world champion.""
"
119,COG,"On Target
"
120,COG,"One officer estimated that by war's end Abrams' tank, named Thunderbolt, had destroyed more German tanks than any other.
"
121,COG,"Another lesson from Abrams' WWII experience: Aggressiveness and innovation can make up for being the smaller player.
"
122,COG,"After the war ended in 1945, Abrams taught tactics at the Armor School at Fort Knox, Ky. He then oversaw tank units in Europe and was a corps chief of staff in Korea following the 1953 armistice.
"
123,COG,"By 1967, Abrams was a four-star general and deputy to William Westmoreland, head of U.S. forces in Vietnam. The American search-and-destroy tactics weren't producing progress in the war, so a year later President Lyndon Johnson gave Abrams the top spot.
"
124,COG,"""The tactics changed within 15 minutes of Abrams taking command,"" said Fred Weyand, the general who became Abrams' second in command in 1970.
"
125,COG,"Sorley said Abrams' new approach was based on his grasp of the war, that South Vietnam's army needed a huge upgrade to break the Viet Cong's hold over the rural population.
"
126,COG,"By early 1969, American troops peaked at 543,000 in Vietnam, and the new president, Richard Nixon, ordered the drawdown. Abrams had the task of shifting war responsibility to local forces.
"
127,COG,"All the while, students at American college campus began protesting against the fighting. When one commander complained that Armed Forces Radio was providing too much coverage of anti-war activities at home, Abrams responded: ""We should never protect our men from the truth, because the very system of government for which they fight and sacrifice has its basic strength in its citizenry knowing the facts. It is our job to persevere in the atmosphere of the facts.""
"
128,COG,"A lesson from Abrams' Vietnam experience: Sometimes we need to make the best of a situation, regardless of how it was created.
"
129,COG,"The strengthening of the South Vietnamese army worked well enough that it repelled a full-scale North Vietnamese invasion in the spring of 1972. Vietnamization, as the shift was called, proceeded fast, with only 25,000 American soldiers left when the Paris Peace Accords were signed in January 1973.
"
130,COG,"By then, Abrams had left Saigon to become the Army's chief of staff. Now he was running another transition: to an all-volunteer force.
"
131,COG,"""Abrams returned from five long years in Vietnam to head an Army that was widely viewed as dispirited and in need of reform,"" Sorley said. ""His reputation for integrity and competence, and the universal respect and affection for him that ran through the Army's ranks, were in themselves important parts of dealing with the manifold problems of the day.""
"
132,COG,"New Military
"
133,COG,"The process of shedding the draft resulted in the all-volunteer Army in 1973. The professional soldiers would turn America's military into the sharpest in history.

158,COG,"""It's a natural fit in one sense,"" said analyst Ben Pang of Caris & Co., noting that Novellus would give Tokyo Electron access to its chemical vapor deposition, or CVD, technology, something it doesn't have a lot of now.
"
159,COG,"""CVD is still the core of (Novellus); it's the biggest growth lever for them,"" he said.
"
160,COG,"Novellus' CEO says the company never comments on rumors.
"
161,COG,"""We work with Lam and Tokyo Electron to solve customer needs,"" he said. ""They have etch technology. We have deposition technology. The combination of those two technologies is critical.""
"
162,COG,"Hill added that ""just because I'm out to dinner"" with execs from either firm doesn't mean they are talking mergers.
"
163,COG,"""We're not out hawking the company. We're a public company. Anybody who wants to buy the shares is free to buy the shares,"" he said. ""Nobody in the company is trying to thwart it or make it happen. If it makes sense from a business sense and shareholder value, management always acts in the interests of the shareholders.""
"
164,COG,"Novellus' shareholder-friendly stock buyback program ""indicates the company's openness to a reasonable acquisition proposal,"" wrote Credit Suisse analysts in a note to clients.
"
165,COG,"They listed a number of reasons Novellus would be a good buyout pick: its low-cost debt, low earnings multiple, cash-rich balance sheet, technology to help deal with upcoming changes in chip manufacturing and senior management approaching retirement age.
"
166,COG,"Hill, 59, has been CEO for 18 years. He's seen chip cycles come and go. He likens today's growth cycle to the long one from the mid-90s to early 2000s. That cycle was marked by multiple drivers, not least of which was the worldwide rollout of the Internet.
"
167,COG,"Hill thinks the current cycle could also last about seven years, with five more to go.
"
168,COG,"As the cyclical chip industry goes, so goes Novellus and other companies that provide the building blocks for chips.
"
169,COG,"The Internet is ""gentrifying,"" Hill says, with the advent of 3G and 4G, streaming video, social media and the storage cloud. All the new technologies need a very broad bandwidth pipe and more demand for high-performing chips, he says.
"
170,COG,"Reports of a slowdown in PC shipments are overblown, he says, particularly if you consider China, whose consumers are buying not only PCs but also smartphones, TVs and other products needing chips.
"
171,COG,"""People underestimate the significance of China in worldwide growth of PC technology,"" Hill said. ""And I don't expect (that significant growth) to change anytime soon.""
"
172,COG,"Greater China was the source of 40% of Novellus' first-quarter revenue vs. 34% from the U.S. Total revenue in the quarter jumped 49.6% vs. the prior year to $413.2 million.
"
173,COG,"Management noted that PC-related sales are being helped by a corporate ""refresh cycle.""
"
174,COG,"Profit in the quarter rose 121% over last year to $1.04 a share. Analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters expect per-share profit to grow 18% for the full year, to $3.57 a share, and go up 3% in 2012.
"
175,COG,"Only a few analysts have made forecasts for 2013, and their outlook is for a double-dip drop. But Pang says a lot of it will depend on how the economy shapes up and the ""capital intensity"" of the chip industry then.
"
176,COG,"Industry Consolidation
"
177,COG,"The chip industry is consolidating and, as the number of companies shrinks, growth in demand becomes more ""real,"" closely tied to capacity, Pang says.
"
178,COG,"""You don't have much overcapacity being built in the industry right now,"" he said.
"
179,COG,"Meanwhile, the industry is benefiting from growth in smartphones and tablets.
"
180,COG,"Last year, capital spending in the sector grew over 100%, and he says it'll be up 10% to 20% this year.
"
181,COG,"Novellus is a leader in a key area of chipmaking known as copper processing. That's important because most new chip factories are transitioning from aluminum wiring to copper as the primary conductive material in chip devices. Copper has lower electrical resistance and performance and cost advantages.
"
182,COG,"In terms of copper processing, ""Novellus is a market-share-gain story,"" Pang said. In copper applications, Novellus beats Applied Material, he says.
"
183,COG,"It's also gaining share in the CVD market, though Applied Material still leads Novellus. Pang puts Novellus' share of the CVD market at 45% to Applied's 55%.""We're a small cog in the overall semiconductor industry. But we're an essential cog,"" said Richard Hill, chief executive of Novellus Systems (NVLS), in a recent interview.The San Jose, Calif.-based company makes thin film deposition systems and other technology used in making chips that go into PCs and other computing devices.Its customers are leading chipmakers, such as Intel (INTC), Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).""You heard the slogan, 'Intel Inside.' We're inside Intel,"" Hill said.In the outside world, Novellus, which posted $1.3 billion in revenue in 2010, is being talked about as a potential takeover target in the wake of Applied Material's (AMAT) $5 billion bid to buy Varian Semiconductor Equipment (VSEA), which amounts to a huge premium.Applied Material, with $9.5 billion in revenue last year, is the No. 1 semiconductor equipment firm in its field.Tokyo Electron, the second largest, may be looking to make an acquisition to keep up with its bigger rival, analysts say. Novellus is viewed as a leading contender. Lam Research (LRCX) also is seen as a potential buyer in the consolidating space.Access To Technology""It's a natural fit in one sense,"" said analyst Ben Pang of Caris & Co., noting that Novellus would give Tokyo Electron access to its chemical vapor deposition, or CVD, technology, something it doesn't have a lot of now.""CVD is still the core of (Novellus); it's the biggest growth lever for them,"" he said.Novellus' CEO says the company never comments on rumors.""We work with Lam and Tokyo Electron to solve customer needs,"" he said.

"
187,COG,"Emmitt Smith ran to the peak of the National Football League.He amassed rushing records for yards (18,355), touchdowns (164) and 100-yard games (78).He was a cog on three NFL title teams with the Dallas Cowboys.He won league and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player trophies.He was first-team All-Pro four times. And after a 15-year career, he entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Not bad for a running back who stood just 5 feet 9 inches and had to put up with naysayers early on the football field.Even in college, people contended he wasn't big enough or strong enough or fast enough.He Ignored Them""You will always have critics, no matter who you are,"" Smith, 42, told IBD. ""If you're successful, people are either patting you on the back or tearing you down.""If you start worrying about what people are saying — especially if it's not true — you'll lose your focus. You need to concentrate on what you hope to accomplish, not on what people are saying. They don't determine your outcome; they're not in control of what you do.""From childhood, Smith was determined to make it into the NFL. In his new memoir, ""Game On,"" he writes about how he had visions of an NFL career, imagining himself as Tony Dorsett or Walter Payton scoring touchdowns.To be successful, he told IBD, ""you have to have a dream or a vision.""And you must grasp how to progress, he added: ""It's one thing to sit on the sofa or on the sideline and say 'I like this' or 'I want to have that,' but without understanding what it takes to achieve it, it won't happen. A lot of time in our society, people do a lot of coveting without taking the necessary steps to (make it happen).""Smith's steps involved spending marathon hours practicing football and lifting weights. ""It takes a lot of preparation,"" he said.He definitely had that, said Michael Irvin, who played with Smith in Dallas, also reached the Hall of Fame and now is an analyst at NFL Network: ""Emmitt was always prepared. You never had to worry about him. He was always on time and ready to play.""Before Emmitt was too small, he was plenty big enough. He was so stout as a youngster in Florida, he was moved up a grade to play with older boys in his peewee league.Big PlansBecause the older boys were bulkier, Emmitt wasn't getting the playing time he hungered for.Instead of sulking on the sideline, he studied every position and prepared to play each spot — on offense and defense — so he could get additional time on the field.""I use the context of sports as a metaphor for business,"" he said. ""You have to understand every aspect of your business, whether it's warehousing, marketing, financing, accounts receivable, product ordering. The more you understand, the better you'll be able to run it.""A lot of people come up with great ideas, great concepts, but don't follow up with due diligence, put it all in a business plan, get financing and then execute the plan.""Even if you do all that, every business experiences growing pains. If you are not prepared for those changes it's all for nothing.""The Long ViewEven in his playing days he planned for a career in real estate and construction. He networked with mentors, particularly former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, who provided advice and introductions.Smith also took classes in real estate finance and law as well as related subjects. He wanted to know what questions to ask.""If you're going to do something, you need to do it full throttle,"" he said. ""If I was going to go into real estate, I had to understand the lingo. There is a specific language, and I had to understand it so I could communicate properly about financing, acreage.""So, yes, I had to go back to school, because understanding and being able to communicate were really important to me.""He leapt into real estate soon after retiring from football. And last year in the teeth of the housing flop he started two companies, EJ Smith Construction in Dallas and ESmith Legacy in Baltimore.Approaching life ""full throttle"" is how Smith approached football.""There's a saying in Vegas that scared money can't make money,"" he said. ""You can't play in a major league ballpark if you play afraid (of being injured). You have to take that leap of faith. If you want to get to that next level and stay at that next level, fear cannot be part of your repertoire.""Working in his garage, Bill Gates wasn't worried about whether his operating system was going to work. But it did, and it changed the world. If the Wright brothers were afraid, we wouldn't have the airline industry. Fear is something that can help you find success, but you can't let it dominate you.""When he entered the league, Smith emphasized reality rather than 100-yard games or touchdowns right away.""Setting meaningful goals is absolutely critical,"" he said. ""Anyone can set pie-in-the-sky goals, but I wasn't interested in that. When I got into the league, my first goal was just to average 4 yards a carry.""For the record, Irvin remembers things a little differently.""In his rookie year (of 1990) he said to me, 'I'm going to be the all-time leading rusher and we're going to win Super Bowls.' I told him, 'You're crazy, man. You don't know what you're saying.' But he was right.""Perhaps that's because Smith always wanted more.""I've seen it happen from a sports standpoint,"" he said. ""Some guys with big aspirations come into the league, make an enormous amount of money, more than they've ever had, and they're suddenly content.""But you can't be satisfied. You have to create new goals, new challenges. It's the same in business. What do you do after you open up? How do you sustain it? You grow your business to $2 million. How do you get to $3 million? You have to stay hungry. That's what keeps you on your toes.""Something else that drove him was his desire to leave a positive legacy — not just in terms of statistics, but also moral fiber.In 2003, the Cowboys released him after his 13 seasons wearing the blue star on his helmet.He quickly signed a two-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals. He could easily have coasted, especially after he was injured early in the 2003 campaign — against Dallas. His coach wanted to place him on injured reserve, which would have ended that first season for Smith, but the star refused.He rehabilitated his banged-up shoulder and returned for the last month of the season. He wanted to honor his commitment.He worked so hard in the off-season and training camp, he was named — at age 35 — a starter as a running back. He came through with nine touchdowns and just under 1,000 yards rushing.Healthy OutlookWhy come back that year and risk another injury?""I did not want to go out on a sour note,"" Smith said. ""I wanted to honor my contract and show my younger teammates, who looked up to me, how it should be done. Coming from Dallas, a winning organization, to Arizona, a not-so-winning organization, I wanted to give them a glimpse of how we did it in Dallas, to give them a glimpse of how we carried ourselves and prepared ourselves. To me, all that is, is passing the baton to help others. Oftentimes I hear kids say they want to be like me. I tell them I don't want you to be like me. I want you to be better than me.""Smith the entertainer was all business on the football field. Take the time he exploded past the Atlanta Falcons on a touchdown run.""It was like he bounced off 20 bodies and still kept running,"" recalled Irvin. ""When we got to the sideline I sat down next to him and said, 'That's the most spectacular touchdown run I've ever seen.' You know what he said to me? 'Why were you looking? You should have been blocking.'""

"
204,COG,"Vistaprint (VPRT) added 4% and passed a possible low-handle buy point of 57.97. The market, however, remains in correction, and all buys are off the table. Vistaprint's move was coming in average volume. That may make this just a continuation of building the stock's right side and not a handle. That would be better, as low handles are faulty.
"
205,COG,"On the downside, Micrus Endovascular (MEND) reversed and dived 6%. The stock was up 10 of the past 11 sessions and made gains in the last seven straight. Volume was huge. The developer, manufacturer and marketer of both implantable and disposable medical devices used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases is 46% above its cup-with-handle base. It broke out during the week of Dec. 4.
"
206,COG,"Trina Solar (TSL) fell 5%. The Chinese solar firm gapped below its 50-day moving average after finishing above it for three straight days. Solar stocks are being dragged down after rival First Solar beat views but said industry supply could exceed demand in the second half of 2010.
"
207,COG,"Trina is in its sixth week of an ugly-looking base. The left side of the cup came during two weeks of big losses in huge volume. Such a quick shaping of any side of a base is not ideal. The high volume is also problematic, as the accumulation-distribution count is at -1.

The NYSE composite finished fractionally higher.

WebMD found support at its 50-day line. NetGear (NTGR) gained 2%. The high-volume advance set the stock up into a possible short-stroke pattern.

BWS Financial downgraded the stock to buy from strong buy.HMS Holdings (HMSY) dropped 4%. The move put it back below its 50-day line.

The market, however, remains in correction, and all buys are off the table. Vistaprint's move was coming in average volume. That may make this just a continuation of building the stock's right side and not a handle. That would be better, as low handles are faulty.On the downside, Micrus Endovascular (MEND) reversed and dived 6%. The stock was up 10 of the past 11 sessions and made gains in the last seven straight. Volume was huge. The developer, manufacturer and marketer of both implantable and disposable medical devices used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases is 46% above its cup-with-handle base. It broke out during the week of Dec. 4.Trina Solar (TSL) fell 5%. The Chinese solar firm gapped below its 50-day moving average after finishing above it for three straight days. Solar stocks are being dragged down after rival First Solar beat views but said industry supply could exceed demand in the second half of 2010.Trina is in its sixth week of an ugly-looking base. The left side of the cup came during two weeks of big losses in huge volume. Such a quick shaping of any side of a base is not ideal.

267,COG,"The left's crusade against Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt should be seen for what it is — a witch hunt. We don't need any more conservatives hanged by leftists who major in criminalizing political differences and minor in slander.How dare a Republican president appoint an environmental heretic to head an administrative agency the left views as its sole, separate and absolute property? This agency exists to serve the deep state — the entrenched federal government bureaucracy that is tailor-made to advance the left's agenda and operate above accountability.This conspiratorially organized assault against Pruitt is precisely what Barack Obama and his friends mean by community organizing. It is vicious, relentless street fighting aimed at discrediting Pruitt and taking him down because he is one of the rare administrative officials who won't put politics above the law and will stand up to those who do.The left — always projecting its own malicious practices onto its political opponents — is framing this as its benign campaign to protect the rule of law. Leftists claim that it is Pruitt, appointed by Dr. Donald Evil himself, who is imposing his political agenda. These Alinskyites understand the impact of words and the force of propaganda. Anyone who doesn't swallow whole their radical assumptions on the environment is a menace, especially one who is in a position to make a policy difference.Leftist activists and their media co-pilots are hellbent on disgracing Pruitt and destroying his reputation to effect his removal, so they are throwing all kinds of phony scandals against the wall of public opinion to pressure the White House to give them Pruitt's head.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe energy they are expending on this should tell you how important progressives view unelected, unaccountable administrative agencies in implementing their draconian regulations, which have been choking our individual liberties and wreaking havoc on our economy.The left is blowing a lot of smoke about alleged improprieties with Pruitt's travel expenses. Thank goodness media conservatives, whose very existence leftists lament every day, are on the case. The Wall Street Journal's Kimberley Strassel, in a series of tweets, dismantled this bogus charge simply by comparing Pruitt's travel and security costs with those of his predecessors, whose similar expenses dwarf Pruitt's. And when you add the disturbing factor that Pruitt has been the target of death threats, which have required greater security measures, the contrast between Pruitt's expenses and those of his dutifully liberal forerunners is even more pronounced.There is also the earth-shattering matter of the alleged sweetheart deal Pruitt was given on a condo lease, a transaction that was reviewed and found proper by the EPA's ethics office, which is hardly staffed by Trump supporters.Leftists don't care a whit about these nonissues; they are just using them as cudgels to thwart the democratic process — the legitimate effort of our duly elected president to appoint people who will not advance radical policies by being lawless agents. No matter how desperately leftists want to brand Pruitt as a renegade activist, he is just a cog in the wheel of their activism or, in some cases, the driver who is going to put their environmental vehicle in reverse and slam his foot on the pedal.The left has bullied its way into imposing administrative regulations that are disastrous for business and onerous for individuals. They aren't just horrible in substance; they're also terrible in process. The Obama administration shamelessly thwarted the rule of law and exceeded its authority in issuing many of these regulations.Under Pruitt's leadership, the EPA has eliminated regulations gratuitously detrimental to the coal industry that Obama crafted to achieve his stated agenda of bankrupting that industry. Pruitt has determined, in light of recent data, that the current greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and light trucks for model years 2022-25 are inappropriate and require revision. In announcing his decision, Pruitt said that ""Obama's EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didn't comport with reality, and set the standards too high.""That is, Obama's regulations were not only inappropriate based on the data but also issued unlawfully pursuant to a political agenda. You won't hear leftists or their media water carriers complaining about this.In addition to their angst over Pruitt's revision of the fuel emissions standards, which, incidentally, could reduce the price of new cars by as much as $7,000, The Heritage Foundation's Genevieve Wood offers two reasons the left is going after Pruitt — and neither of them has to do with ethics issues. He has led the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle Obama's ""expensive and ineffective climate legacy piece by piece."" And his EPA is scrapping the transparency-hostile practice of developing regulations based on studies that are kept secret from the public.One thing I appreciate about President Trump is that he is taking action in certain areas that would have been unthinkable to entrenched politicians, many of whom are so used to the inertia of bad policy that they seem to be paralyzed with feelings of futility. The EPA is one of those areas. We are actually seeing concrete results, and it's immensely refreshing.Like many others, I've long said that we can't afford to sleep for one second in our ongoing battles against leftists because they don't. We need to shed some of the defeatism that has crippled the conservative agenda and celebrate the kind of progress we're seeing at the EPA.The left considers Pruitt a hill to die on. So should we.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Stunning Statistical Fraud Behind The Global Warming ScareTrump Dismantles Another Obama 'Achievement' — Just One More To GoSchwarzenegger Wants To Sue Oil Companies For Murder?

Scarcely three days into the new year and the Dow has charged ahead 1.4%, in the process topping 25,000 for the first time ever.But some of the best gains for the full year may come in overseas stock markets and in value equities both in the U.S. and abroad. (Click here for a timeline and detailed chart of 2017's remarkable stock market.)That rotation of big portfolios into more foreign stocks is expected to take place despite economic uncertainty due to the U.K.'s Brexit and escalating tensions with Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, not to mention North Korea's nuclear threats.Two big reasons are the prospect of faster economic growth abroad and cheaper valuations for many foreign equities. GDP growth will likely continue strong in both China and Europe, where European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi says monetary stimulus will continue until at least September.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market ReviewThe U.S. economy looks positive too. Investors are heartened by incoming Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and they're jazzed by a drum roll of moves by President Trump, including tax reform, opening the way for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, throttling back on federal regulations and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.But with many stocks up sharply from a year ago, investment strategists and fund managers expect more modest stock price gains in 2018. The S&P 500's 2017 return was more than double the big-cap bogey's 8.50% average annual gain over the past 10 years. The Nasdaq composite index shot up 29.64% and the Dow Jones industrials gained 25.08%.Align Technology (ALGN), part of the Nasdaq and a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks, jumped 131% in 2017. The company is known for its computer-assisted design approach to straightening teeth.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a key cog in the Dow, rose 24% in 2017. IBD Markets Editor Juan Carlos Arancibia analyzes 2017's top-performing stocks in a separate article.Against this backdrop, money pros say some of the best opportunities lie in non-U.S. stocks. And in both the U.S. and abroad, they see good potential in value-oriented stocks, including cyclical stocks whose performance swings up and down with economic conditions.""Stocks will be better than bonds once again in 2018,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for broker and financial advisor Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""And we like international markets better than domestic. That includes developed markets in the eurozone but not the U.K., and it includes Japan.""Joy cites three reasons why foreign stocks may shine. ""Economic growth relative to potential growth appears to be stronger in those international markets than in the U.S. even though the U.S. is doing well,"" he said. ""And central banks in those (foreign) geographies will be more accommodative than in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve as everyone knows is raising interest rates.""The third reason: Valuations. U.S. stocks as a group have grown expensive, Joy says. Other markets are more attractively valued. So there's more upside potential than in U.S. stocks overall.But Joy added, ""We do think U.S. stocks will go higher."" Ameriprise currently forecasts that the S&P 500 will hit 2865 in 2018, up 7% from its 2673.61 level at year-end 2017.Joseph Davis, Vanguard's global chief economist and head of its investment strategy group, says Vanguard expects the lowest returns for U.S. equities in roughly a decade. His group expects 4% to 6% annual gains for U.S. stocks in the next five years.Ameriprise forecasts 3.0% U.S. GDP growth in excess of inflation in 2018. Before Congress passed tax reform, Ameriprise was predicting 2.4%. China's pace should remain around 6.5%. The eurozone's economy should grow around 2.2% vs. 2.1% in 2017.As for interest rates Ameriprise, among others, expects the Fed to continue raising rates. That ""will be a lid on earnings multiples for U.S. corporations and may bring some (multiples) down,"" Joy said. Research firm Action Economics sees the fed funds rate around 2.12% by the end of 2018, up from its 1.25% to 1.50% band since June 2017.U.S. tax reform is a wild card. ""It should add incrementally to earnings growth and economic growth,"" Joy said. ""It should provide a little tailwind to stocks.""U.S. joblessness should drop to 3.6% by the end of 2018, the lowest rate since 1969, Ameriprise says. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in November 2017.David Polak, equity investment specialist at Capital Group, the parent of American Funds, sees investment opportunities in several geographic markets. Asia and the U.S. remain leading sites of technology innovators, he says.Manufacturers of logic chips are one group of innovators. Industry consolidation has left four key players, including Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and California-based Intel (INTC). Fifteen years ago, there were 25.""Taiwan Semi and Intel are dominant,"" Polak said. ""Consolidation has left the space more disciplined, which should lead to more visibility of earnings and more pricing power.""Another Asia stock he likes is Japan's Murata Manufacturing. ""Their ceramic capacitors are crucial components for smartphones, but relatively inexpensive, so manufacturers can stuff phones with them without impacting their margins much,"" he said.Since the capacitors are used in Apple iPhones as well as Samsung Galaxy and other Android phones, ""It's a way to invest in the growth element without having to bet on which phone will do better,"" Polak said.In gaming, he likes the way Japan's Nintendo (NTDOY) has diversified its addressable market. ""They took their intellectual property away from just hardware,"" Polak said. ""You used to have to play their games only on their hardware. Now it's available on multiple devices.""Then there's Tencent (TCEHY), China's leading provider of messaging and mobile gaming services. Tencent also owns the popular WeChat app.For Polak, a key Tencent trait is its leadership in China's mobile payments services, enabling consumers to use smartphones to pay bills and make online purchases.Peter Bourbeau, co-manager of $9.3 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLYX) sees opportunities among U.S. stocks but says it's time to switch from FAANG stocks because their price run-ups have left less room to rise. The ClearBridge fund is on track to becoming a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner after outperforming the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as in the trailing three, five and 10 years.Schlumberger (SLB) should benefit from a bottoming among energy stocks, Bourbeau says. Oil and gas service companies have regained pricing power, he adds.""SLB currently generates incremental margins of 60%-plus (the highest in its history) and is benefiting from its OneStim U.S. joint venture with Weatherford International (WFT) for pressure pumping,"" he said. ""SLB is the only global service company that is using its balance sheet to invest alongside its customers.""Among health care stocks, Bourbeau likes Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). He calls it ""a leader in ultrarare genetic disease treatments. The company recently cleared the decks with new management and a refocused research and development profile. Alexion also received additional approvals for its lead compound Soliris for (treating other maladies)."" Solaris also was being tested for new ways of being administered.Within the financial services stock group, he likes Visa (V). ""Visa is making very good progress on its recent acquisition of Visa Europe with synergies and client engagement,"" he said. ""Although incremental margins are extremely strong, Visa continues to innovate within its core debit/credit portfolio as well as (creating) new ways to integrate with merchants and cardholders.""What about some of the big stocks that padded his mutual fund's recent gains? FAANG stock Amazon (AMZN), up 56% in 2017, was among his top holdings as of Sept. 30. So was Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 38% for the year.""Amazon continues to execute its plan of disrupting adjacent verticals and margin-rich opportunities,"" Bourbeau said. ""It continues to focus on marketplace, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime. The company has a huge opportunity outside the U.S. and will focus on countries like India, which is more hospitable to Western technology companies. We still see a large opportunity in AWS as we are in early stages of a generational shift to how technology is created and consumed.""Regarding Microsoft, Bourbeau said, ""We expect more of the same strong growth trends for Microsoft as the software maker helps its clients move workloads to the cloud. Its Azure cloud business is at a $20 billion run rate (in sales for 2018) and growing double digits. The company continues to focus on partnerships with service providers and competing technology, a departure from the strategy of previous management.""Celgene (CELG), another top holding, is an inexpensive stock, he said, adding that Celgene has a strategy for coping with the patent expiration of its flagship product, the cancer drug Revlimid, in the middle of the next decade. ""The biotechnology company should have 19 late-stage clinical readouts in 2019,"" he said. ""Cash continues to build and we expect some business development opportunities or acquisitions to further bolster its clinical pipeline.""MORE IBD COVERAGE FOR YOU:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Tax Reform Impacts Your Tax Bracket And RateYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeAI In Business: This Is What The Future HoldsBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

278,COG,"Not since Ronald Reagan graced the Oval Office has Congress been better poised to boost economic growth and prosperity through a thoughtful revamp of the federal tax code.  Unfortunately, the House and Senate are taking entirely different approaches — only one of which is pro-growth — to tackling one of the most blatant drags on the U.S. economy: the estate tax.Known as the ""death tax,"" the estate tax has long been recognized for its destructive nature.  ""Of all taxes imposed by the federal government,"" according to a 1998 report by the U.S. Congress' Joint Economic Committee, ""the estate tax is one of the most harmful to economic growth when measured on a per-dollar-of-revenue raised basis.  Although the estate tax is relatively small in terms of revenue raised, it exerts a disproportionately negative impact of the economy.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveWhen President Trump and congressional Republicans announced their commitment to reform the federal tax code, it was a given that reform would include killing the death tax.  To do otherwise was unthinkable — at least from my perspective as the head of the tax policy implementation staff on Donald Trump's transition team.As expected, the tax reform measure passed by the House earlier this month permanently repeals the estate tax.  The measure adopted by the Senate Finance Committee, however, not only fails to repeal the estate tax, but what little relief it provides is scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.The non-partisan Tax Foundation reckons eliminating the estate tax would lift capital investment, enhance labor productivity, and increase ""labor force participation by the equivalent of 159,000 full time jobs.""XIt's no wonder then the Tax Foundation calculates the estate tax provisions in the House-passed bill would boost the economy 0.7% over the decade.  Eliminating the estate tax accounts for fully one-fifth of the additional 3.5% economic growth the House measure is expected to produce should it become law.The Senate's estate tax provisions, by contrast, would have a negligible impact on the economy.  The Tax Foundation estimates the Senate's proposal to double the estate tax exemption would boost the economy 0.1%.  But because the increase in the exemption is temporary, even this meager benefit would soon dissipate.While the estate tax's deleterious impact on the economy is well known, you'd be surprised by how little revenue the tax actually generates.  Adding up all the money raised by levying the estate tax on the lifetimes of work and savings of Americans who died last year amounts to roughly one-half of one percent of federal revenue.  That's literally enough to fund the federal government for all of two days.And if repealing the estate tax leads to faster economic growth as expected, much of that revenue would be replaced by increased tax revenue via the individual and corporate income taxes, the payroll tax, and federal excise taxes.  Most tax cuts don't ""pay for"" themselves, but repeal of the estate tax is perhaps, in the long run, the exception that proves the rule.Repealing this tax is more than just tinkering with a cog in the machine that generates (a little) federal revenue.  Its significance transcends mere numbers.  It's the impact on the family owned hardware store or supermarket, the farm that's been cultivated for decades, and the ranch that's grazed cattle for generations.For hundreds of years, these sectors of the economy were the very best representation of the American Dream: individual families working and striving to build a business, prosper, and accumulate wealth that can be handed down to the next generation.  Today, that dream is chiseled away by a government that sees fit to confiscate as much 40% of those assets because mom or dad or grandpa's heart stopped beating.And before people start complaining how this is another ""tax break for the rich,"" can we all just admit that genuinely wealthy people (and you know who you are), don't pay the estate tax anyhow?  Those people choose instead to pay accountants and tax lawyers to come up with work-arounds.Abolishing the estate tax would benefit rich and poor Americans alike.  As the Tax Foundation writes, ""After macroeconomic impacts of a larger capital stock are considered, it (eliminating the estate tax) would increase after-tax incomes for all taxpayers.""  Granted, the increases would be relatively small at first—ranging from 0.7%  to 1.8% across income quintiles — but a return to shared prosperity trumps continued stagnation.If the aim of tax reform is to increase available capital, promote labor, and grow the economy, few steps are more obvious than abolishing the estate tax.  They've figured this out in the House.  Let's hope the Senate follows suit.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

279,COG,"To hear one expert tell it, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) is an ""anomaly,"" a ""favorite"" and there's ""a running joke on Wall Street that it's a unicorn.""X""It's what I would consider to be college-fund money,"" Stifel analyst Karl Chalabala told Investor's Business Daily. ""If I wasn't restricted from owning companies I cover, I would have a significant portion of my capital into it.""The reason for such bullishness? The natural gas producer, which started drilling in the Marcellus Shale in northeastern Pennsylvania about a decade ago, ""happened upon the very best rocks in North America,"" he said.There's just one little problem: Because of a takeaway-capacity bottleneck that prevents the company from transporting all of that precious gas to market, Cabot hasn't been able to fully exploit its primo location above the rock formation.But that bottle is about to get uncorked.The recent federal approval of Atlantic Sunrise — a nearly 200-mile pipeline designed to move product from the Marcellus Shale to Gulf Coast states — is expected to unlock the company's capacity. Some Pennsylvania residents are not happy about a pipeline running through their backyards, but analysts are enthusiastic. The pipeline is expected to go live sometime next year.""Cabot remains our favorite gas stock given its top-tier Northeast Marcellus asset coupled with the substantial margin expansion the company likely will realize when its new takeaway projects come online in 2018,"" wrote Barclays analyst Thomas Driscoll in a July 31 note. He has an overweight rating on Cabot and in late July upped his price target on the stock to 28 a share.By Stifel's calculations, the major pipeline will result in 23% year-over-year production growth in 2018 and a 47% pop in 2019. Barclays sees a 24% rise in production in 2019.Headquartered in Houston and founded in 1989, Cabot operates primarily on the East Coast, with about 179,000 net acres and more than 500 wells in the Marcellus that accounted for 93% of its proved reserves at the end of 2016. The midsize player also owns 84,000 net acres and a lone oil rig in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas, which the company is said to be considering selling.Over the years, shale gas technology has outpaced that of shale oil, said Chalabala, which means ""a lot more gas for a lot less money.""""At this point in time, Cabot now has the lowest break-even costs in North America, if not the whole globe for natural gas,"" he said.But the oversupply of gas has meant pressure on Cabot's prices.In terms of competition, Cabot's not the only player in northeastern Pennsylvania, nor is it the largest. Bigger players Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Southwestern Energy (SWN) both count Marcellus as one of their many operations across the country.But Cabot's position on the formation's sweet spot means that while Chesapeake has some rocks that are ""very, very good,"" per Chalabala, Southwestern's rocks are ""not even close to even Chesapeake,"" let alone Cabot, in terms of quality.""To call (Cabot) the main beneficiary (of Atlantic Sunrise) is an understatement,"" he said.The company is also hailed for its strong cash flow, having returned over $100 million to shareholders in the first half of fiscal 2017, including a 3 million share buyback in its second quarter.Barclay's Driscoll expects 35% cash flow growth from the company in 2019. Stifel is much more bullish, forecasting 2018 free cash flow popping 312% year over year, and 2019's rising another 229% on top of that.IBD'S TAKE: Cabot shares briefly ventured near buy range early last month after consolidating for roughly a year. Shares took a sour turn in recent days but are starting to climb back toward buy range. Cabot ranks seventh among explorers and producers in the oil and gas sector, with Viper Energy Partners ranked No. 1.""We're going to be opportunistic, but we also feel very confident of our future generation of free cash,"" Cabot Chief Executive Dan Dinges told analysts on the most recent earnings call. ""And that is instrumental in our decisions to move forward with the share repurchases.""When Cabot reports third-quarter results on Oct. 27, analysts expect earnings to swing to a profit of 11 cents a share from a 5-cent per-share loss in the prior-year period. Revenue is seen growing 33% to $411 million.""They're not going to have a good quarter, and they're not going to have a good guide on price,"" said Chalabala, but he suggested that investors will be able to see past that, ""because this is the last year we're going to have pricing like this in Appalachia where it's so very bad.""Shares ended trading Friday unchanged at 26.In the wake of regulators giving the OK to Atlantic Sunrise, Morgan Stanley imagined in September a quartet of catalysts that could drive 20%-35% upside to Cabot shares: the potential sale of its Eagle Ford position, approval of the Constitution pipeline, success with exploration plays and share buybacks.Analysts there, too, have an overweight rating on the stock.""It's at the top of my list, and it's also at the top of a lot of people's lists, in regards to (being) a quality company with extraordinarily good rocks, that handled the worst pricing environment in the United States — in history probably — in natural gas, and came out the other side unscathed and is now positioned to capture that work in terms of just an extraordinary free cash flow growth,"" said Stifel's Chalabala. ""They're one of the few people in this whole sector that could even point to something like this. No one can compete with it.""

285,COG,"Oil prices rose on Monday to their highest levels since mid-2015 amid political unrest in Saudi Arabia, but there is more than just palace intrigue boosting prices.XU.S. crude jumped 3.1% to settle at $57.35 a barrel, the highest since July 2015. Among oil majors with holdings in Saudi Arabia, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.6% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) gained 1.8%, after falling out of buy range last week, BP (BP) rallied 2.1% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) advanced 2.2%. BP and Shell are extended out of buy range.Even before the weekend's purge of top officials in Riyadh, prices had been trending higher. Here are five reasons why oil prices have been and may continue to be on the uptick:In an unprecedented move, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman ordered the arrests of several high-profile members of the royal family including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard.Salman has signaled support for OPEC's deal with Russia and other nonmembers to curb production and prop up prices. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said in a note Monday that he expects Salman to continue to constrain production.But Salman's power consolidation also comes with some risks, especially as he seeks foreign investment to help fuel economic reforms.""The arrest of prince al-Waleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia's richest businessman with a net worth of nearly $19 billion, could well dampen international interest in investing in the crown prince's much-heralded Vision 2030 to make the non-oil private sector the new motor of the economy,"" David Ottaway, Middle East Fellow at the Wilson Center, wrote in a note.Ramped-up regional tensions are adding upward pressure on prices, and Salman's stronger hand may also be factor on this front too, as he has been more hawkish on foreign policy.This weekend, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a missile from Houthi rebels in Yemen near Riyadh. The kingdom is fighting a proxy war with Iran against the rebels in Yemen. Tehran is believed to have supplied the rebels with the missile, but Iran denies the allegations.The attack could be considered ""an act of war against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement Monday.Analysts don't expect the power consolidation and increased tensions with Iran to affect the likely extension of the oil output deal. Last year, OPEC, Russia and other top producers agreed to curb production to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market to stabilize prices.Salman has been supportive of the deal as the country needs higher oil prices to hype up Saudi Aramco's initial public offering and Russian President Vladimir Putin has also shown signs of supporting an extension.The current production deal expires in March, but analysts expect an update at OPEC's biannual meeting at the end of this month.After looking for ways to expand production, shale producers are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline and not working unprofitable plays, even as oil prices climb higher.Devon Energy (DVN), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), EOG Resources (EOG) and other shale exploration and production companies showed spending discipline in their third-quarter results out last week.Meanwhile, U.S. rig counts have been falling and on Friday saw the biggest drop since May 2016, according to Baker Hughes (BHGE) data.Global demand for crude is rising, and the International Energy Agency said last month that global supply and demand will balance next year as demand growth rises 1.4% in 2018.Gasoline demand from China remains especially robust thanks to a 17% increase in SUV sales. And in the U.S., trucks and SUVs remain popular.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

288,COG,"For the past two years, shale exploration and production companies have focused on growing the flow of oil, but now the focus may be shifting toward the flow of cash.XConcho Resources (CXO), Apache (APA), EOG Resources (EOG) and a slew of other U.S. shale producers report third-quarter results this week. While U.S. crude prices have climbed to $54 a barrel they have struggled to stay above $50 ever since prices collapsed in 2014, and producers' spending vs. cash flow will likely be a key metric for investors.The outlook for capital expenditures is dimming, as companies focus more on financial returns and operating within their cash flows vs. expanding production, oilfield service provider Schlumberger (SLB) said earlier this month.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" CEO Paul Kibsgaard said on the earnings call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Early reports from shale companies echoed this sense of caution. On Friday, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) reported Q3 results that fell short of Wall Street estimates and reaffirmed its total 2017 program spending forecast of $845 million.""We remain committed to delivering positive free cash flow in 2017 and beyond, while continuing to focus on improving our corporate returns and increasing our return of capital to shareholders through prudent capital allocation,"" Chairman and CEO Dan Dinges said in a statement.Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said he will be looking for a focus on wellhead profitability in the shale earnings reports and expects companies to be less aggressive about production.""Before it was a rush to raise production now it's a rush to produce profitability,"" he said. ""It could be positive if companies said they were going pull back and focus on cash.""Among U.S. oil giants, however, the spending picture is mixed. Chevron (CVX)  said Friday it would spend less money than expected this year, while Exxon Mobil (XOM) said it would spend more next year to increase drilling in U.S. shale plays. That could be a reflection of the uncertainty that continues to permeate oil markets, which increasingly look to the U.S. oil patch as the swing producer.""I think there's still one more big surge coming from U.S., which will knock prices down,"" Ian Taylor, CEO of Vitol Group, said at the Oil & Money conference in London last month.He expects Brent crude to fall to $45 per barrel in 2018 as U.S. shale production increases vs. $60 today.Shares of EOG Resources, a bellwether of the industry that is known as the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" for its tech advances, were up 1.1% at 99.53 on the stock market today, climbing further into buying range after breaking out from a 98.47 cup-with-handle base on Friday.U.S. crude futures closed up 0.5% to $54.15 a barrel on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Concho Resources, Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Devon Energy (DVN) kick off the busy earnings week, reporting results after the market closes Tuesday. Concho's earnings are seen falling 19% to 26 cents per share but revenue is expected to jump 44% to $622 million.Anadarko is expected to report a loss of 56 cents per share up from a loss of 89 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 23% to $2.32 billion. Last month, Anadarko announced a $2.5 billion share buyback plan.Devon's EPS is expected to soar 333% to 39 cents from 9 cents a year ago but revenue is expected to fall 25% to $3.16 billion.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) are scheduled to report Wednesday. Analysts expect Laredo's EPS to rise 8.3% to 13 cents with revenue up 14.4% to $183 million.Pioneer's EPS is seen jumping 123% to 29 cents as revenue climbs 8.3%b to $1.3 billion.In Q2, Pioneer lowed its outlook of how many higher-value oil barrels it would produce in 2017. But at the Oil & Money conference, Pioneer said it plans to quadruple production over the next decade thanks to increasing output from Texas.CEO Timothy Dove said that the company's break even is $20 per barrel, giving it more room to expand and more cushion if oil prices fall.Apache and EOG Resources are due Thursday.Analysts see Apache reporting a loss of 2 cents per share vs. a 3-cents-per-share loss in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is expected to dip 2.1% to $1.41 billion.EOG is seen swinging to a profit of 10 cents per share vs. a loss of 40 cents per share a year ago.

289,COG,"Investors continued to deploy capital in U.S. stocks Monday, the start of the fourth quarter, despite a horrific mass shooting at a country music event on the Las Vegas Strip late on Sunday. President Trump condemned the incident as an ""act of pure evil"" and urged Americans to unite and resolve their differences.XThe small-cap Russell 2000 led the markets with a 1.2% gain. The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average followed, advancing nearly 0.7% as at least 10 components rose 1 point or more. Most of them hailed from the medical, financial and industrial sectors.The S&P 500, benefiting from rallies in housing and media-related stocks as well, rallied slightly more than 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite was not far behind, up 0.3%, following a solid gain of more than 1% last week that also featured a bullish test of support at the index's 10-week moving average.Volume was slightly lower on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE, according to preliminary readings. However, as seen in a daily chart, the Nasdaq has now waged a fifth straight gain and each up day came in higher than normal volume.A rise in the major indexes in higher or heavier volume is a sign of heavy institutional accumulation in shares. That's positive for equities.As seen in IBD Big Picture and Market Pulse, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend, and few distribution days are on the books. A distribution is a significant decline in higher volume, which signals professional selling.The Nasdaq's Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a 13-week gauge of institutional activity, was a poor D+ Rating on a scale of A to E last week. Watch to see if this rating improves.Meanwhile, Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Bioverativ (BIVV), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Goldman Sachs (GS) and IBD 50 name Stamps.com (STMP) are just five of perhaps a few dozen companies that get high IBD ratings and are forming the right side of bases.Key bases to know and utilize when hunting for excellent breakouts include the following:The cup with handle, a minimum seven weeks in length.The double bottom, also a minimum seven weeks.The flat base, a minimum five weeks in length (or 25 trading sessions as seen in a daily chart).The saucer base, which has the look of the silhouette of a saucer and appears to show a milder decline from head to toe vs. a normal cup pattern.Also be sure to know what's the average turnover for a stock. IBD uses the 50-day moving average as the gauge. You can see the 50-day moving average for volume on every IBD and MarketSmith chart.On a weekly chart, use the 10-week moving average, which is the average weekly turnover over the past 10 weeks.Advanced Energy, a specialist in power conversion products, notched a fourth day in a row of stout gains in strong turnover, a positive sign. While shares are now extended past a 78.95 handle within a 16-week cup base, Advanced Energy has yet to clear the base's left side.Earnings have taken off since 2016, when profit jumped 43% for the year to $3.11 a share. Analysts see profit climbing even faster this year, up 48% to $4.59 a share, before cooling off for just a 1% EPS gain in 2018.Over the past five quarters, the Fort Collins, Colo., firm's earnings have jumped 16%, 28%, 231%, 89% and 67% vs. year-ago levels. Q3 profit is expected to rise 52% to $1.17 a share.Goldman is forming a saucer base, which can stretch longer than a year and shows a generally gentle pullback and slow rise near 52-week or all-time highs before the breakout. If a handle forms over a minimum five sessions, add 10 cents to the highest price within the handle to find the correct entry.The Wall Street firm has yet to form a handle, so for now the proper entry is 255.25.Analysts see Goldman's profit rising 12% this year to $18.17 a share and another 10% to $19.94 in 2018. However, keep in mind that the company depends on a big bulk of its revenue on trading in the fixed income, currencies and commodities markets. Flatlining action in any of these sectors could materially impact Goldman's top and bottom lines.Bioverativ, a spinoff from Biogen (BIIB), rallied nearly 2% and crossed over its 50-day moving average price-wise in heavy turnover, a bullish sign. Shares are forming a cuplike pattern and are 10% below the cup's left-side high of 64.41.The decline within the cup is a mild 16%, well within the maximum threshold of 33%, and it shows that holders are not so willing to dump their shares.Bioverativ is an expert in blood-related diseases such as hemophilia. The company lost money in 2013 and 2014, then earned 79 cents a share in 2015 and $2.30 in 2016.The Street sees earnings barreling 26% higher in 2017, to $2.90 a share, and up 11%, to $3.22, in 2018.The current base has the look of a cup, but it could also wind up being a saucer pattern.In addition to the Accumulation grade, use a weekly chart and count how many up weeks within the base came in above-average turnover vs. the number of down weeks in heavy trade. In Bioverativ's current base, the count is equal at one up week in heavy volume vs. one down week in heavy trading.Stamps.com, which has posted terrific gains in the top and bottom lines in recent years, rallied 4.4% to 211.60 in thin volume and appears to have formed a nearly eight-week cup with handle. The proper buy point is 212.75.Keep in mind that Stamps.com faces very tough year-over-year comps on EPS, as Q3 earnings are seen falling 16% to $1.95 a share after a 104% increase in the third quarter of 2016.Stamps.com also has risen more than 330% since initially breaking out of an early-stage flat base on top of a longer base at 51.16 in the week ended Feb. 13, 2015.RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: How Do Bases Help You Make You Money?Finding Great Stocks To Buy: Peek Inside The IBD 50Hot Stocks With Less Volatility: Look Inside Big Cap 20

301,COG,"Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as a slew of energy companies are gushing their best profits in years, yet crude prices are plunging again to levels last seen in November, clouding the outlook for dividends.Will glimmers of a profit recovery in the troubled energy sector mean a rush to plow money back to shareholders? Or will weakness in oil prices keep shareholder returns muted?""First and foremost, oil prices need to improve"" before the energy sector's dividends and buybacks return to historical levels, said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""Energy earnings are very highly correlated to energy prices. With oil prices at $45 a barrel, it will be very hard for those stocks to perform.""Grant Engelbart, a portfolio manager at CLS Investments, agrees that rebounding oil prices will be key to energy companies' profitability — and therefore their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares.At the same time, he notes that no energy company has actually cut dividends this earnings season and a few — including Exxon, Phillips 66 (PSX) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) — actually raised dividends.""We think dividend cuts have probably come to an end, and companies that have mandates to raise dividends will continue to do so,"" Engelbart said in a phone call.The latest reports reveal energy companies have done a good job navigating the new landscape by cutting back expenditures during the price bust and holding off on massive outlays with the rebound, he added.Helped by cost cuts, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) pumped out $9.5 billion in cash flow, which the Anglo-Dutch giant used to cover dividends for a third straight quarter and reduce debt in Q1.Yellow flags remain. Revenue for Exxon was worse than expected in the first quarter, and Chevron kept its dividend unchanged even as Exxon raised its payout. The two companies alone account for nearly 40% of the S&P 500 energy sector's market cap.The energy sector will also face tougher year-over-year comparisons over the course of 2017, making earnings growth less dramatic.Oil and gas companies floundered in the ugly commodity collapse of 2014-15. By early 2016, with a hoped-for rebound yet to materialize and their profits cratering, the likes of ConocoPhillips (COP), Kinder Morgan (KMI), Anadarko Petroleum (APC)  and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) were forced to slash dividend payouts.  In some cases, as stock prices plunged, dividend yields spiked as much as 12%.Even Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, was forced to borrow money to pay out dividends. Smaller-cap energy companies struggled the most to increase or maintain their dividend payments.Share buybacks, a form of shareholder returns that is easier for companies to turn on and off than dividends, were pared back even more.For 2016 as a whole, the energy sector represented 1.1% of all S&P 500 buybacks vs. 2.7% in 2015 and 7.4% in 2014, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. It contributed 9.1% to S&P 500 dividends  in 2016 vs. 10.56% the previous year.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the combined dividend yield and buyback yield for the energy sector was 3.19% — the lowest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.Exxon, which has grown dividends for 35 years in a row, is now no longer the biggest dividend payer in the S&P 500.Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012 and has been hiking payouts aggressively, is the new king. The iPhone maker on May 2 hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to 63 cents, taking its annual dividends to $13.22 billion vs. $12.77 billion for Exxon.Still, dividend yields for energy stocks are more attractive. With Apple stock hitting new highs, the dividend yield is just 1.6%, less than half of Exxon's 3.7% and Chevron's 4%.Apple also has replaced Exxon as ""the poster child for buybacks"" in recent years, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple buybacks in 2016 totaled $33.71 billion, making it the second largest S&P 500 company for buybacks, behind Allergan (AGN).Meanwhile, Exxon did not even rank among the top 20 and ""has done very little in the way of buybacks of late,"" Silverblatt wrote recently.Despite some recent good news for shareholders, current prices don't bode well for revenue or payouts.U.S. crude prices settled 3.2% higher Wednesday at $47.33 a barrel, on data showing a sharp drawdown in U.S. inventories. Meanwhile, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers have suggested they will extend production cuts through the end of this year and possibly into 2018.Prices could get a bump from new, aggressive moves by the oil group and its partners to further reduce the global glut of inventories. But that would likely be offset by increased production from U.S. companies.Still, while the top line remains challenged, companies could improve their bottom lines — and their cash flow — by focusing on lower-cost regions like the Permian Basin. U.S. producers have also been using new technologies and techniques that allow them to extract oil profitably, even at lower prices.RELATED:Uh-Oh, OPEC: Top Shale Play Vows Big Output Boost Even With Sub-$50 OilEOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, DataEven This Latest Idea From OPEC May Not Lift Oil Prices As Shale Looms

302,COG,"The U.S. government accused Russia of directing some of the world's most notorious hackers to break into computer systems, namely a half-billion accounts at Yahoo (YHOO), in a broad scheme pairing cybercrime with intelligence gathering.The broadside against the Russian government appeared in an indictment unsealed Wednesday in San Francisco federal court against two Russian FSB security agents and a pair of criminal hackers. Only one was arrested, a Canadian. The U.S. government has little chance of getting the other three extradited from Russia, but was sending a clear message to Moscow that heightened cyberactivity wouldn't be tolerated.""We have reason to believe, based on our evidence, they were acting in their capacity as FSB officials,"" said Mary McCord, acting assistant attorney general for the  Department of Justice's national security division.Prosecutors accused the four of conspiracy, economic espionage, wire fraud and theft of trade secrets connected to the 2014 Yahoo breach, which threatened to derail its acquisition by Verizon Communications (VZ) and ultimately led to a lower purchase price. The U.S. indictment essentially contends that the hackers had access to the accounts of 30 million users of Yahoo.""­The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored,"" ­­said Chris Madsen, an assistant general counsel for security and law enforcement at Yahoo. Yahoo's shares declined 0.2% to 46.28 in late afternoon trade on the stock market today.The indictment appears to pull back the curtain on the use of criminal hackers by Russia's spy agencies to attack key U.S. targets, including the largest purveyors of web-based email, Google and Yahoo.It lists a diverse group of hacking victims in the U.S. including the White House and its military and diplomatic corps. The missions also reaped information on a swath of global companies and their executives, including a U.S. financial services company, an airline and private equity firms.The U.S. also reveals how Russia has used criminal operations to hide government spy activities, sheltering those criminals from prosecution while using the threat of charges as a recruiting tool for the country's best criminal talent.After the indictments were announced, a Putin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, didn't directly address the charges against Russian security officials but said Moscow was interested in cooperating with the U.S. to combat cyber threats. The press office for the Federal Security Service didn't answer phone calls.The U.S. government has been ratcheting up pressure on Russian hacking networks over the last few months. In December, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Russians -- Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev and Aleksey Alekseyevich Belan –- for engaging in ""malicious cyber-enabled activities."" The announcement was made as President Barack Obama took steps against Russia for attempting to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.One of those hackers, Belan, was charged in the Yahoo case. He has been charged twice previously for cyberattacks of technology companies.The agents from the FSB included Igor Sushchin, who worked for the agency and specialized in cyber investigations. The other was Dmitry Dokuchaev, described as a hacker for hire who was pressed into working for the FSB to avoid prosecution for bank-card fraud. Russian authorities detained him in December and accused him of ""interacting"" with U.S. intelligence.Karim Baratov, a Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan, was arrested in Canada and charged by the U.S. He's accused of targeting people inside Russia in information-gathering schemes. Calls to his home weren't immediately returned. The other three defendants couldn't immediately be reached for comment.Belan used access to Yahoo to line his own pockets, according to the indictment. He was paid a bounty for his intelligence gathering missions, the U.S. said. The Yahoo email accounts almost certainly provided sensitive personal data to Russia's increasingly unpredictable spy agencies.While the Yahoo intrusion was the central cog of the operation, the indictments describe a broader intelligence-gathering effort that often went after Russian citizens, including the country's key politicians.In one mission, the hackers were instructed to compromise Google accounts belonging to an assistant to the deputy chairman of the Russian Federation, an officer of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and a training expert for Russia's Sports Ministry, the indictment says. Other Russian targets included journalists and politicians critical of the government, a board member and senior officer of a Russian financial firm and a senior officer of a Russian email provider.Baratov was said to be heavily involved in targeting Russians for the FSB. He was paid to gain access to 80 email accounts, including 50 Google accounts, the U.S. said. He would mount spear-phishing attacks, using fake emails to compel targets to provide sensitive information. Once he obtained passwords, he would sell them to Dokuchaev, the U.S. said.An extradition hearing for Baratov was postponed until Friday, according to court officials in Hamilton, Ontario. The U.S. is seeking forfeiture of funds held in a PayPal accounts controlled by Baratov and Dokuchaev, and two luxury cars -- a gray Aston Martin DBS with a ""Mr. Karim"" vanity plate and a black Mercedes Benz C54.

307,COG,"After years of calling for it privately, Barnes Hauptfuhrer decided that early 2017 was finally time to go public with his desire to see a makeover of America's hottest natural gas play.Last week, the 62-year-old sent a 10-page open letter to the board of EQT (EQT), urging the gas explorer to merge with either Range Resources (RRC) or Antero Resources (AR). That prompted Range to put out a statement saying it hadn't been contacted by EQT about a potential deal and that it had no plans to hold talks.It was a ""difficult decision"" to go public for the founder of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chapter IV Investors, who prides himself on having spent the past decade working quietly and amicably alongside corporate leaders.""It creates a bit of awkwardness,"" Hauptfuhrer acknowledged in a phone interview Friday. ""Sometimes in life you have to encourage management to think outside of the box about something big.""In this case, that ""something big"" would usher in a new era for the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, where the last decade's gas boom has helped reshape America's energy markets. The region is ""fragmented"" with too many companies and should follow the example of North America's midstream sector, which saw several multibillion-dollar deals last year, he said.The timing's right for consolidation on the production side, Hauptfuhrer said, as energy prices recover from last year's lows and it becomes clearer who the strongest companies are. Hauptfuhrer wants EQT — because of its low debt levels and high market capitalization — to lead the way by either pairing off with Range or Antero.He's calling for an all-equity transaction that would result in a company with a $25 billion enterprise value that could produce twice as much gas as any of its Marcellus and Utica rivals.Such a large-scale merger would be rare in the exploration and production sector, where companies have historically been more likely to buy up acreage or smaller assets, said Vincent Piazza, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.""The basic premise for corporate consolidation in the E&P space may not really hold,"" Piazza said. ""Usually smaller and bolt-on transactions tend to work.""Hauptfuhrer's decision to go public owed, in part, to the fact that EQT will change its leadership this spring. Starting March 31, Steven Schlotterbeck will take over as chief executive of the company.""That unique moment allows them to objectively look at the pros and cons of a potential merger of equals,"" Hauptfuhrer said. ""What we want to see is the company emerge as the 800-pound gorilla.""EQT was down 3.3%, Range fell 4.3% and Antero lost 2.3% by Monday's close. U.S. natural gas futures ended the day down roughly 5%, extending declines after capping the worst weekly loss in a year.Hauptfuhrer started Chapter IV in 2006, with plans to invest up to half of his assets in private equity and the rest in publicly traded companies. After the 2008 crisis, he decided to focus solely on the latter. He likes investing for the long term in about 10 companies. He's owned shares of EQT and Range since 2010 and Antero since 2014.Chapter IV isn't a huge player. The fund has about $250 million under management and had a less than 1% ownership stake in all three of those gas companies as of Dec. 31, he said. Beyond that, it has stakes in Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) — as well as companies in the paper and packaging and construction sectors.Hauptfuhrer expects U.S. gas output to grow by 3% annually for the next decade or two. Gas prices will stay mostly between $2.50 and $3.50 per million British thermal units for the next few years, which he acknowledges is cheap.""We are focused on owning the lowest-cost producers,"" he said. ""If you're the low-cost producer, you can still make money.""Chapter IV's name reflects the fact that Hauptfuhrer's in the fourth phase of his career, he said. He started at Kidder, Peabody during the 1980s, where he specialized in mergers and acquisitions. Then he founded and ran the private-equity group First Union Capital Partners. From there, he became co-head of First Union's — later, Wachovia's — corporate and investment bank. He left that post in 2004.Generally, he likes establishing relationships with management teams and working with them privately. He's talked with the EQT, Range and Antero management teams for years about consolidation, he said. While he knew that going public with his pitch could risk those relationships, he said the response he's heard thus far from other investors and analysts has been mostly good.""We haven't had one person, not one, who hasn't said: 'This makes a lot of sense,' "" Hauptfuhrer said. ""We think we're going down the right path.""Neither EQT nor Antero immediately responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. Range referred to its earlier statement.

The Dow industrial average managed a fractional gain.The session nevertheless left all three indexes with solid gains for the month.

"
309,COG,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has put payday loans in its cross hairs as it rewrites the rules for short-term loans that carry an interest rate in excess of 36%.Maybe it should investigate ObamaCare, which effectively charges more than 100% interest to members of the working class for accessing their own cash because they only see unaffordable options under the law and opt to remain uninsured.There were noble intentions behind the mandate as a cog in ObamaCare's machine for making coverage affordable and accessible to those who were priced out of it due to income or a pre-existing condition. Yet the reality of the coverage options and the way the law is administered have undermined those high-minded goals and often made income inequality worse.The individual mandate is looking like a failure in its goal to make coverage affordable by coaxing the relatively young and healthy to get coverage. Premiums for the cheapest HealthCare.gov bronze plans are set to spike 28% in 2017 to cover the costs of the exchange pool that is disproportionately old and unhealthy. UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET), and Humana (HUM) are bailing out of most of the state exchanges where they do business this year. Now Anthem (ANTM), which runs Blue Cross Blue Shield in many states, says it may follow suit.This year, roughly 8 million people faced ObamaCare individual-mandate penalties totaling more than $3 billion, even before the penalty jumped from a minimum $325 to at least $695 in the coming tax season. It's now clear that the actual impact of ObamaCare's individual-mandate tax penalty is far worse than the benign intent that the Obama administration claimed when it made the case for it.""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate states.Consider, by contrast, the perspective of diner cashier Wylene Gary of Yazoo City, Miss., who dropped her coverage in 2014 when she discovered it had a $6,000 deductible, enough to torpedo her finances if she landed in the hospital. ""This ain't worth a tooth,"" she told Kaiser Health News.Democratic politicians rail against income inequality. Yet they defend ObamaCare, when the individual mandate in 2017 will tax away something like 3% of pretax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage that may prove of little use to them.IBD'S TAKE: News that the Justice Department is investigating generic drug makers for price collusion is just the latest sign of the growing political risk facing the health care sector as cost growth ramps up again.Although ObamaCare's problems run much deeper, consider for a moment how the administration of the mandate penalty undermines the law and has a negative effect on the working class.The Obama administration likes to tout affordability by saying that most people eligible for subsidies can get a plan for $75 a month (or less). But paying around $900 a year for a bronze plan that carries deductibles as high as $7,150 in 2017 may seem like too much of a stretch for many.That first $75-a-month payment comes due in December 2016, while the penalty of $695 isn't paid until March or April 2018.The option of keeping your $75 a month is akin to letting ObamaCare be one's payday lender on a loan that averages $450 over the course of the year and charges $695 in interest.And like payday loans, people who have their finances sapped in this way are more likely to pay the mandate penalty again. That's because $75 a month may seem even less affordable the following December if they're about to have $695 taken out of their tax refund in April.ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate, even as some on the left are arguing that the fines need to be strengthened.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These CitiesObamaCare Enrollment Sinks Again, Now Trails Worst-Case Scenario

310,COG,"Two heads can be better than one. Or, if not better, at least less volatile. For proof, look no further than $25.6 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX).The $25.6 billion portfolio, which is sold through financial advisors, is up 4.75% this year going into Monday. Its stablemate is $108.5 billion Contrafund (FCNTX). Both funds have marquee manager Will Danoff at the helm. New Insights — once a clone of Contrafund — has behaved differently since John Roth became co-manager three years ago.Contrafund's 9.27% average annual gain ranks in the top 1% of large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 15 years. New Insight's 7.95% ranks in the top 38% over the past 10 years. But so far this year New Insights 4.75% gain is in the top 14% of the same peer group vs. top 38% for Contrafund's 2.62% gain.Roth's portfolio picks go a long way to explaining why two top-notch funds, sharing a lead manager, have performed differently in the short term. Roth and Danoff talk together a lot and powwow formally once a week. But they run separate sleeves of Insights' securities.Differences in their picks add diversification. ""That gives us more ability to weather volatility,"" Roth said.On Friday, New Insights had a trio of 2%-plus gainers, as Netflix (NFLX), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) each tacked on more than two percentage points.Netflix announced a deal last week with Liberty Global (LBTYA) to expand its global footprint. That's a key goal as the company nears saturation in the U.S. Customers of the jumbo global cable operator will be able to access Netflix content via Liberty set top boxes, but Netflix will retain a billing relationship with viewers. Netflix has recently announced other deals with other cable operators, including Comcast (CMCSA). And this month it is slated to become the exclusive viewing platform for certain films made by Walt Disney (DIS).Tesla rose amid an intensifying friction with former BFF (best friends forever, as the kids say) Mobileye (MBLY). Tesla accused Mobileye of trying to throw a monkey wrench into its efforts to develop vision chips on its own. Mobileye said it ended its relationship with Tesla in July because the electric car maker was ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety.""Tesla said Mobileye bailed because Tesla was planning to rely more on radar systems and less on camera-based driver-assistance systems such as those developed by Mobileye.IBD'S TAKE: Our Ed Carson digs into details of the spiraling cat fight between Tesla and Mobileye in this report.Tesla's 6% share price surge Friday -- lifting it 6% for the entire week -- and Mobileye's pullback show which side investors favor in this feud.New Insights owns both stocks.As for UnitedHealth, its Friday rise was on good volume. The stock is shaping a flat base with a 144.58 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: To learn more about UnitedHealth's prognosis, see how it stacks up against other stocks in its industry at IBD's Stock Checkup.Roth says some stocks he likes today reflect his past experiences at the helms of Fidelity's sector funds focused on multimedia, chemicals and utilities. ""I'm opportunistic, with a growth bias and a valuation sensibility,"" he said.Roth, who also runs $3 billion New Millennium (FMILX), says he prefers fewer stocks in his sleeve of New Insights than Danoff. He also tilts more to midcaps. His eye on valuation recently has led Roth to beaten-down names in energy and financials.Among the names in New Insights that are not in Contrafund, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence: American International Group (AIG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Antero Resources (AR), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Chevron (CVX), Energy Transfer Equity (ETE), Exelon (EXC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).""I'm more of the energy guy,"" Roth said. ""I do think there are points in time when you want different cyclical groups.""Share prices of most of the energy names, for example, have yet to perk up a lot. But Roth says the conditions for a rebound are falling into place. U.S. production is sliding, he says, adding, ""Share prices are down, demand (for energy) is relatively good and we've seen a massive amount of capital come out of the space over the past 12 to 18 months. Rig count is down 40% to 60%. Hundreds of billions of dollars in exploration-and-production cap ex has come out.""Roth describes his thesis as of his latest disclosure for Diamondback Energy (FANG): ""We have bigger diversified companies, some service companies and smaller U.S.-focused E&Ps,"" he said. ""Diamondback is a classic one of those. It is an independent E&P with a good spot in the Permian Basin. It has great acreage that it will exploit at attractive costs.""Energy accounted for about 8% of New Insights' assets, its fifth-largest sector by weight, as of July 31. Contra has about 2% in the sector and New Millennium 16%.Technology, with a 26% weighting, is tops. The fund's top-three holdings are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The fund has been trimming Facebook, but only to take profits and prevent the stake from getting too big. It was about 5% as of July 31. ""It's still our largest relative bet. It is our most important stock,"" said Roth.One leg of Facebook's appeal has been its success in shifting from a web focus to a mobile one. Another has been its success at remaining relevant to users through platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. A third has been its ability to show advertisers the link between an ad and a sale. ""That's the ability to optimize ad campaigns and (let advertisers) see the return on investment,"" he said.Google is a similar story, Roth adds.Amazon's retail and music businesses do well, Roth says. But Amazon's key improvement is its AWS web services business. It wasn't until mid-2015 that Amazon broke out AWS' financial results. ""Investors were surprised by how profitable the business is,"" Roth said. ""It is a complete game-changer.""AWS has proved more attractive than rival services from Google, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT), he adds.The cloud-services platform lets customers rent all the capacity they need at peak times, even if most of the time they need far less. Thus they avoid hefty capital expenditures.In summarizing their teamwork, Roth says that Danoff uses more small starting positions in individual stocks. Roth makes bigger initial buys. ""Our process keeps evolving,"" Roth said. ""I'm excited about it.""RELATED:Diamondback Dominates Shale-Rich Permian Basin With Conservative DealsHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The DownturnP-s-s-st!

311,COG,"Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) are buys, while Permian-focused Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE) were started with hold ratings at Williams Capital on Monday.Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (COP) CEO Ryan Lance told an industry conference in Norway that the global oil glut will extend into next year with cost cutting in the industry continuing, according to Reuters. But he doesn't any further dividend cuts after the company in February cut its payout for the first time in 25 years. Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) chief energy adviser Wim Thomas also told Reuters the oversupply may last until the end of next year.U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.4% lower at $46.98 per barrel. Brent fell 1.3% to $49.26 a barrel.Cabot was started with a buy rating and 30 price target, while Pioneer's buy rating came with a 217 price target. Diamondback Energy was initiated at hold with a 105 price target, and Parsley Energy was started with a hold rating and 37 price target.Diamondback and Parsley focus on the Permian basin in West Texas, the epicenter of low-cost U.S. shale oil production. Earlier this month, Diamondback raised its full-year production guidance to 38,000-40,000 barrels per day from an earlier outlook of 34,000-38,000 barrels on increased activity in the second quarter in the Permian region.ConocoPhillips shares rose 0.1% to close at 42.35. Cabot shares dipped 0.3% to 25.16 after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base and buy point of 26.42. Pioneer shares rose 1.9% to 182.92, edging above buy range after coming out of a 70-day consolation with a 171.98 buy point earlier this month.Diamondback shares rose 1.1% to 97.36, in buy range after coming out of a flat base with a buy point of 96.11. Parsley shares 0.4% at 33.78 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: A bounce in oil prices and rising confidence that the oil supply glut will end heading into 2017 are luring speculative dollars back into U.S. exploration and field service stocks. Diamondback Energy and Parsley Energy are among the top stocks expected to rise first and show the biggest earnings gains next year. Rice Energy (RICE) was started with a hold rating and 29 price target, and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) was started with a hold rating and 14 price target.Rice shares fell 1% to 26.64. Laredo shares climbed 1% to 12.73, near their buy point of 13.83.RELATED: Oil Falls As Stockpiles Rise, But U.S. Production DropsBrent Crude Hits $50; Oklahoma Oil Bonanza Heats Up.

312,COG,"The rise in the popularity of electric cars from Tesla Motors (TSLA), Nissan Motor (NSANY) and Honda Motor (HMC) is putting the pressure on gasoline demand, according to a report Monday by an energy consulting firm cited by the Wall Street Journal.Wood Mackenzie said that in the extreme case, U.S. gasoline demand could fall by 2 million barrels a day by 2035 if electric cars account for more than 35% of the market. Currently, the U.S. uses more than 9 million barrels a day. But demand is likely to only fall 5% by 2035 if electric cars account for just more than 10% of all U.S. automobiles.Pure electric cars have made up less than 1% of total sales so far in 2016, as consumers enjoy lower gasoline prices and are concerned about the range of the battery in electric cars.But Tesla and other automakers are looking to build longer-range electric vehicles with lower price points. The report said that Tesla's Model 3, priced around $35,000, will shake up the market and make electric vehicles more mainstream. General Motors' (GM) Chevrolet Bolt will cost $30,000 after tax credits when it debuts later this year.GM shares ended trading up 1.4%, while Tesla climbed 2% on the stock market today. Nissan was up 1.9%, and Honda gained 1.2%.But the growth of electric cars would be good for natural gas companies like Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Anadarko (APC) and Apache (APA), as the uptick in electricity use would put more demand on natural gas-burning power plants.Apache shares jumped 2.7%. Cabot rose 2% while Anadarko added 1 cent to 54.87.

313,COG,"With the Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, drawing to a close in Los Angeles, Wall Street analysts are chiming in with their thoughts on which publicly traded companies performed the best at the annual trade show and which came up short.Several analysts proclaimed ""Battlefield 1,"" a World War I combat game from Electronic Arts (EA), as the title with the most positive buzz at E3.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said “Battlefield 1” stole the show. He also was impressed with EA's sci-fi action game ""Titanfall 2.""""Given the initial positive feedback on 'Battlefield 1,' coupled with improved 'Titanfall 2' functionality (now includes single-player campaign), we believe management's current guidance could prove overly conservative,"" Sebastian said in a research report. He rates EA stock as outperform, with a price target of 80. EA rose 0.8% to 75 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) overcame negative pre-show buzz for its game ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and won over some skeptics.“Before E3, many investors were concerned about the negative reception for (Activision's) ‘Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare’ trailer,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a report. “However, we think CoD showed better this week.”Wilson rates Activision stock as overweight with a price target of 43. Activision climbed 1.8% to 39.03 on Thursday.Still ""Infinite Warfare"" faces ""stiff competition"" from ""Battlefield 1,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report. “Infinite Warfare” is set for release on Nov. 4, following two big EA titles. “Battlefield 1” comes out on Oct. 21 and “Titanfall 2” drops on Oct. 28.The highlight for Activision at E3 came not from the show floor, but from an upbeat report about its recently launched sci-fi shooter game ""Overwatch."" Activision announced during the show that it has over 10 million users for ""Overwatch"" worldwide since the game's release on May 24.Baird's Sebastian raised his price target on Activision stock to 43 from 42 on Thursday based on the ""Overwatch"" news. He maintained his outperform rating on the stock.“While users will likely exceed unit sell-through due to time-based usage in Asia and disc-sharing, we now expect material upside to our original 6 million unit expectation,” he said. “As such, we are increasing our Q2 fiscal 2016 estimates to reflect 8.5 million unit sales.”What’s more, his firm’s checks in China suggest that “Overwatch” is taking significant share from Tencent’s (TCEHY) “League of Legends,” at least temporarily, Sebastian said.On the downside, Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) disappointed analysts and fans at E3 by not announcing any big new titles.“The Street’s biggest takeaway from Take-Two’s E3 2016 will be the lack of an announcement for the next ‘Red Dead’ (or any other new IP), despite a strong showing for ‘Mafia 3’ and ‘Civilization 6’ at the event,” Piper's Olson said. “‘Mafia 3’ in particular could be the critical cog for the company to reach its internal goals. However, little was discussed related to ‘Borderlands,’ ‘Red Dead’ or any other new IP, which is the primary focus of most investors.”Here's our interview with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick from E3.Olson rates Take-Two stock as overweight with a price target of 40. Take-Two rose 0.7% to 37.77 on Thursday.Pacific Crest's Wilson called Take-Two's game slate this year ""uninspired.""Another letdown at E3 was the lack of major AAA game titles for new virtual-reality headsets from Sony (SNE), HTC and Facebook's (FB) Oculus.The major game publishers are unwilling to devote resources to VR games until the installed base of headsets makes the market opportunity worthwhile, Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said in a report.“From a publisher perspective, VR looks more like a 2018 story (at the) earliest,” Pitz said. “Every management team we spoke with had the same two concerns about VR. First, what kind of games will succeed on VR? Second, how long will gamers be willing to wear the headsets?”The three-day E3 conference officially opened Tuesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, but several large companies held pre-show events.RELATED:‘Clash Of Clans’ Game Maker Possible $9 Billion Takeover TargetElectronic Arts Impresses At E3; Why Take-Two’s Stock Sold OffWedbush’s Pachter On The ‘Conspiracy Theory’ Behind EA’s E3 Snub

314,COG,"Robert Charles (Bob) Wright’s finest business accomplishment was as CEO of NBC, then a subsidiary of General Electric (GE). He took an underachieving broadcast network, kicking and screaming, into the modern media universe, fighting off risk-averse GE execs, NBC honchos who wanted nothing to do with the new world of cable and the network’s many local affiliates, who felt supporting cable would hurt their business.Ignoring naysayers, he managed a stunning victory. When he took over the network in 1986, it showed a profit of $400 million. When he retired 21 years later, profits had risen to $3.1 billion.It was a capstone to a lengthy career, mostly at GE, one that began rather inauspiciously in January 1969, about six months after he earned his bachelor's degree in law from the University of Virginia. It was a staff job at a power transformer plant in Pittsfield, Mass., and, as he describes it in his forthright new memoir, “The Wright Stuff: From NBC to Autism Speaks,” it wasn’t exactly what he expected:“Everyone had their head down, going about their business. I was just a cog in a huge machine.”If it wasn’t a dream job, it did teach Wright, 73, a valuable lesson. In a phone conversation with IBD, he said:“You can get lost in that world. They paid me well, relatively speaking. I met a lot of nice people. But I realized it was going to be difficult to stand out and difficult to sell an idea there to other people.”Rather than turn him off, it fueled his drive: “I realized I was going to have to push hard and do it on my own, and that is fundamentally where I got into that mode.”If there is a single word to describe Wright’s career, it is responsibility. “Whatever it is you hope to achieve,"" he said, ""you must decide how to go about changing your situation and moving forward and then you must accept responsibility for the outcome. You cannot wait for good fortune.”So in 1970, he left GE and accepted a clerkship with a federal judge. He returned to GE in 1973, mostly for the opportunity to work with his mentor, Jack Welch. And, in 1979, Welch appointed Wright to a “job” that ultimately would change his life.GE was about to acquire Cox Broadcasting and sent Wright down to that company's Atlanta headquarters to head the operation. He was there around six months. He’d bought a house, enrolled his kids in school and was building a team when the deal fell through. Fortunately, Cox executives liked what they saw and asked him to join the company as president.Wright liked what he saw, too: a brave new media world. Years before the iPod, before iPads were a twinkle in Steven Jobs’ eye, under Wright’s leadership the company secured cable franchises around the country.Wright says that he loved his time at the family-owned company. It was there, he believes, that he honed the vision that would put him in good stead at NBC. It was there, too, that he learned “the power of empowering others to execute the vision and ideas” he felt strongly about.“I couldn’t believe I went to work every day on top of the world.”Ultimately, however, his ascent was limited. “My name wasn’t Cox,” he said. So when Welch wanted him to come back and head the housewares and audio electronics business, Wright returned to GE again. There, Wright was asked to offer an appraisal of the unit he was supposed to lead.“Jack said to me: I need your honest opinion about the business. I came back to him and said you have every reason to be nervous. We put our best products out there and in three weeks they all become promotional items. We’re never going to make a lot of money and all our science” -- research designing new products -- “is going down the drain.”Welch saw the wisdom of Wright’s analysis -- he ultimately sold those units --  and rewarded him with a plum assignment -- head of GE Financial Services, a job he held until 1986 when GE purchased RCA and Wright was named CEO of RCA’s NBC subsidiary.The television network was in third place in what was then a three-horse race, and frankly, GE didn’t know what to do with it.“It wasn’t in their wheelhouse,” Wright said.  “GE never seemed comfortable with service-oriented consumer companies that were not capital-intensive.”Fortunately, his new assignment was very much in Wright’s wheelhouse. And while his bosses didn’t see it, “I could see that the real game was going to be in cable and we had to be in it.”That insight was not universal. Not only was GE reluctant to invest additional funds into a business it didn’t understand, but NBC executives and its affiliates weren’t pleased with Wright’s plans to expand into cable.David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications (DISCA), spent 18 years working with Wright, as president of NBC Cable Distribution, among other jobs. He told IBD:“I think Bob showed great courage and leadership in the late '80s and early '90s when it was not a popular road for a broadcaster to be investing in cable and championing it within the broadcast culture. Today they go together.""Bob was a great champion of that even when (early on) the cable investments were losing money and (GE was) asking, ‘Why are we doing this?’ ”Wright’s courage, Zaslav added, extended to his dealings with the “strong personalities” whom he supervised (most of whom he hired), people such as Dick Ebersol, Don Ohlmeyer, Andy Lack, and Lorne Michaels -- legendary television executives who freely and sometimes loudly disagreed with their boss.But that didn’t bother Wright. In fact, he thrived in that environment. Zaslav noted that if you sent Wright a report “about a complicated transaction, he read every page and then did his own analysis. He read everything you gave him. If you sat down in a meeting with him, he was very prepared and he loved to debate.”As he noted in his memoir, he knew he’d occasionally have to make “an end run around GE’s aversion to taking risks and investing in emerging businesses such as cable and internet.”“I’m a realist,” Wright told IBD. “Working in a real company you can’t always do what you want when you want.”At the same time, Wright recognized that where there’s a will, there’s very frequently a way. For example, he formed several strategic alliances -- “an absolute necessity to growing a company that is lodged inside a corporation that does not want to invest in your future vision” -- so that GE wouldn’t shoulder all the financial risk of expansion.A partnership with Chuck Dolan of Cablevision led to the creation of Rainbow Programming Services, which gave NBC a 50% interest in several regional sports networks, American Movie Classics and Bravo.An alliance with Microsoft led to the creation of MSNBC. “Both Microsoft and NBC were taking a chance by moving outside their comfort zones,” Wright noted. “But that is the only way to achieve the extraordinary.”Not everything he wanted came to fruition. Wright couldn’t sell a plan to buy a stake in the Discovery networks. Similarly, a proposal to merge with Turner Broadcasting didn’t work out, in part, Wright notes, because mixing Ted and Jack was the equivalent of the proverbial oil and water.But more of Wright’s vision worked than not and, in 2011, When Comcast (CMCSA) bought what was then NBCUniversal, 85% of operating income came from the cable operations. And while people looking at Wright’s career tend to concentrate on his cable successes, it was during his tenure that NBC became “Must See TV,” and had the highest rated shows on the tube, including ""Cheers,"" ""Seinfeld,""  ""Friends"" and others.Wright retired in 2007. Since then he has been active with Autism Speaks, which he co-founded with his wife of 49 years, Suzanne.  He started the group, which sponsors research and creates awareness about autism, after his grandson, Christian, was diagnosed with the disease.Fought the conventional wisdom to bring NBC broadcast network into the cable ageOvercame: Risk aversion of parent company GE and skepticism of NBC and affiliate station executivesLesson: You got to know when to hold ‘em, but also when to fold ‘em.“I knew I couldn’t sell it (buying a 25% stake in Discovery Communications). That would have to wait. I had to keep picking my spots.”

315,COG,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As U.S. oil prices near $45 per barrel, some producers could start bringing wells online, with more than 1 million barrels a day in Texas alone ready to be tapped.Shale companies have held off on completing thousands of wells, choosing to save money and wait for oil prices to rebound. Drilling accounts for 40% of a new well's cost, while completion accounts for 60%, according to Suzanne Minter, manager of oil and gas consulting at Platts Analytics, in prepared remarks to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Tuesday.Producers also have been improving efficiency and slashing costs, which means that they can pump oil profitably at lower prices. The breakeven price is now about $45-$55 per barrel, depending on the play, Minter said, adding that she wouldn't be surprised if some producers start to pump at $40 a barrel.On Tuesday, U.S. crude futures rose 3.3% to settle at $44.04 a barrel, and Brent climbed 2.8% to $45.74.If producers in Texas alone decided to complete all their 2,500 drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells at once, they could add 1.25 million barrels of oil per day to the world market, Minter estimated.Production from Texas DUCs could come back on fairly quickly, as completion times average 30 days. But Minter cautioned that the response could take longer if producers don't have enough cash or labor on hand.Some shale producers with major operations in Texas are already seeing some growth.On Monday, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), which is active in the Permian Basin in West Texas, boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Last week, Sanchez Energy (SN), which operates in south Texas, reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000-barrel guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie reportedly has said that Pioneer plans to complete some of its wells this year, along with Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Hess (HES).Pioneer shares jumped 7.6% in the stock market today. Sanchez shares were up 1.3%. Cabot added 2.3%, Oasis rose 3.5%, and Hess gained 2.2%.With more production potentially coming back back online, more dramatic price swings could be ahead, warned Minter.Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, also noted that bringing wells online may not happen that quickly.""It will take a little longer than what people think -- nine months, 12 months -- because you have to get the capital markets back open again, workers to come back and rigs to come back,"" he told the Senate committee.Meanwhile, Iran is also working on bringing more crude back to the market as it looks to boost production to presanction levels.So far this month, exports rose to 1.75 million barrels per day, up from 1.6 million barrels a day in March, according to Reuters, citing an industry source.But an Iranian official said that production is around 3.5 million and that exports will hit 2 million in May.

316,COG,"Continental Resources (CLR), a top producer in the Bakken shale formation, said Wednesday it has ceased fracking operations there amid the continued slump in oil prices.The bellwether shale company had already planned to defer most Bakken completions in 2016. It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken with plans to maintain that level through the year.But Continental said it currently has ""no stimulation crews deployed in the Bakken.""Shares were up 2% in after-hours trading in the stock market today.Continental posted an adjusted net loss of 23 cents per share in Q4, down from a profit of $1.14 per share a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a loss of 21 cents per share. Revenue sank 55.6% to $575.5 million, above views for $568.2 million.But Continental was bullish on acreage in its STACK play in Oklahoma, and expects an average estimated ultimate recovery of 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per well.""Our overpressured Meramec wells in STACK are delivering some of the highest returns in the Company,"" said COO Jack Stark in a statement. ""We clearly have another high impact, long-term platform for growth underlying our 155,000 net acres of leasehold in STACK.""The company plans to average four-to-five operated drilling rigs in the STACK play in 2016.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Other shale companies reported Q4 results below estimates late Wednesday and further reduced capital spending plans.Concho Resources (CXO) swung to a Q4 adjusted loss of 7 cents per share from a profit of 88 cents per share a year ago, missing views for a profit of 4 cents a share. Revenue sank 34.5% to $389.2 million, well below views of $525.4 million.Concho sees 2016 capital spending of $1.1 billion-$1.3 billion vs. $1.8 billion in 2015, which was already a 20% drop from 2014. The company expects full-year 2016 production will be flat-to-down approximately 5% vs. 2015.Shares were unchanged late.Oasis Petroleum's (OAS) earnings tumbled 85.7% to 5 cents a share, missing analyst estimates by a penny. Revenue fell 39.2% to $182.1 million, under views for $238 million.Oasis set its total capex budget at $400 million, down from $610 million in 2015, when it dropped 61%.For the year, Oasis said that 70% of its projected oil volumes are hedged to more than $51 per barrel for U.S. crude. On Wednesday, West Texas Intermediate futures settled at $32.15 a barrel, up 0.9%.Oasis shares jumped 4% after hours.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM)  and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don’t have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Earlier this month, Cabot Oil & Gas' (COG) quarterly results swung to a loss and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday. EOG is expected to swing to a 31 cent per-share loss down from a per-share profit of 79 cents. Revenue is expected to fall 53.2% to $525.4 million.Earlier Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) said it is closing its unconventional resources unit, with its shale assets becoming part of its upstream business, and projects in Canada becoming part of its downstream unit.Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) Q4 results swung to a loss and revenue fell 47.5%. The oil and gas producers said it has signed deals to divest $700 million in gas fields and other assets, well above its $200 million-$300 million target, and plans to sell $500 million-$1 billion in additional assets this year. Chesapeake will also cut 2016 capital spending by 57% to $1.3 billion-$1.8 billion and sees production falling by as much as 5% excluding asset sales.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said that U.S. inventories rose by 3.5 million barrels vs. the 7.1 million barrel build the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported late Tuesday. Analysts expected a rise of 3.4 million barrels. 
"
317,COG,"Saudi Arabia's oil minister quashed hopes for a near-term rally in crude prices Tuesday, ruling out a production cut while also dismissing worries of oversupply and slowing demand.At the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston, Ali al-Naimi said there would be another meeting among top producer countries, possibly in March, to freeze production and ease high inventories.But a production cut ""is not going to happen,"" he said. ""Not many countries are going to deliver, even if they say they would cut production.""Instead, al-Naimi thinks it's “easier to freeze production and let demand rise and some inefficient supplies decline.""Brent fell 4.1% to $33.72 per barrel Tuesday, and U.S. crude lost 4.6% to $31.87. Top oil stocks followed, with Exxon Mobil (XOM) closing down 1.4%, Chevron (CVX) down 4.4%, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) down 4.1% and BP (BP) down 4.3%.James Williams, a WTRG energy economist, said Saudi Arabia could still cut production later, noting the next OPEC meeting in June ""is a good time to start talking about quotas"" and offers three more months of data on declining U.S. output.But he doesn't expect Saudi Arabia to let prices go past $50 per barrel, which would spark new drilling in North America.Omar al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, pointed out that Saudi Arabia and Iran have cut off diplomatic ties with each other, and Russia is engaged in a proxy war in Syria against other OPEC members.""The idea of cutting production is never going to work in the near future,"" he told IBD. ""In order for a cut to work, you need to be able to effectively monitor each other.""Al-Ubaydli sees a drop in production from global oil markets over the next 12 months, as output from older oil fields decreases and new investment slows.""Output will decrease, but not because cartel members are sitting at a table playing with numbers,"" he said.Still, Williams noted, OPEC has survived even when member countries were at war with each other, like Iraq and Kuwait at the beginning of the 1990s.Al-Naimi also said Tuesday that he doesn't have any concerns about demand, which ""remains strong."" Markets, however, have been worried that slowing global economic growth, especially in China, could dampen oil demand.And he appeared to brush off supply fears, saying he welcomes new supplies, including shale oil. The boom in U.S. shale over the past decade has been a major driver of the current oil glut.Al-Naimi's remarks come as Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar, Venezuela, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to freeze their production at January levels, but only if countries such as Iraq and Iran also participate.Iraq and Iran have said they support a freeze but won't commit to join in limiting output. On Tuesday, Iran appeared unlikely to participate.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said the proposal to cap output at January levels puts ""unrealistic demands"" on Iran, according to state-run media. Iran’s production last month remained well below historic levels, as sanctions from the West had just been lifted over its nuclear program.The probability of Iran and Iraq agreeing to a freeze eventually is ""fairly high,"" Williams said, but not until Iran boosts daily production to 4 million barrels a day, roughly its production before the sanctions.Iraq will have a hard time agreeing to terms as its central government doesn't control the oil flows from the Kurdistan region, Al-Ubaydli noted.Speaking to a room of shale firms, al-Naimi added that high-cost producers ""must find a way to lower their costs, borrow cash or liquidate."" Later he said that ""inefficient and uneconomic producers will have to get out.""Unconventional drilling is more expensive than traditional means, but shale producers have been resourceful as oil stays lower for longer. Companies were able to weather the low-price environment in 2015 by slashing costs, payrolls, drilling rigs and capital expenditure budgets. They also used new techniques on their most efficient, productive wells.But gains from drilling innovations, such as using higher sand concentrations and higher proppant volumes, are expected to slow this year, and costs have less room to drop.Top shale firms report Q4 results this week, and the latest news is expected to be grim. Earlier reports pointed to further deterioration. Last week, U.S. shale producer Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) swung to a loss below analyst views, and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Concho Resources (CXO) are expected to announce results this week.Cabot shares plunged 10.6%. Pioneer shares fell 4.35%. Continental shares lost 3.4%. Oasis plunged 9.5%. Concho shares fell 4.3%.

318,COG,"ConocoPhillips (COP) and other oil giants took a beating earlier this month when they reported grim quarterly results, and upcoming reports from top U.S. shale firms won't look any better.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don't have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Some shale firms have already reported. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)  swung to a loss below analyst views as oil prices stay lower for longer. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.Continental Resources (CLR) and other bellwether shale players are on tap in the coming week.Continental, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Concho Resources (CXO) are scheduled to report fourth-quarter results Wednesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Continental swinging to a quarterly loss of 21 cents per share from a per-share profit of $1.14 a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 56.2% to $568.2 million.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Continental is one of the few large independent E&P companies that haven't issued a round of job cuts, and CEO Harold Hamm has predicted that oil could hit $60 per barrel by the end of the year.Analysts expect Oasis's quarterly EPS to plunge 83% to 6 cents. Revenue is seen falling 20.6% to $238 million.Wall Street sees Concho Resources' earnings tumbling 95.6% to 4 cents per share and revenue down 11.6% to $525.4 million.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday. EOG is expected to swing to a 31 cent per-share loss down from a per-share profit of 79 cents. Revenue is expected to fall 53.2% to $525.4 million.

321,COG,"President Obama signed the 2016 spending bill Friday, including a provision that would allow the export of U.S. crude for the first time in more than 40 years.The bill passed through Congress quickly, with politicians eager to start their holiday vacations, even though some Democrats were upset it included the provision to lift the crude export ban and didn't allow Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy. But the legislation, which included a tax credit for wind and solar energy, included enough for Democrats to push it through.First Solar (FSLR) shares fell 1.7% to close at 63.41 in the stock market today. SunPower (SPWR) shares closed up 3.5%. SunEdison (SUNE) share jumped 4.2% after making large gains earlier this week.The $1.1 trillion omnibus budget got President Obama's signature late afternoon Friday, even though he threatened to threatened to veto legislation lifting the ban.Now Continental Resources (CLR), EOG Resources (EOG) and other shale players, along with oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), can start exporting crude extracted from U.S. oilfields.The ban started in the 1970s as an attempt to protect Americans from price spikes, some of which were caused by Middle Eastern countries using oil as a political weapon.But shale producers have long argued the ban is outdated, and since oil prices have plunged, they have also said allowing exports would help support continued drilling activity.The Energy Department also has said lifting the ban would boost the U.S. economy and could help lower gasoline prices, echoing what economists have being saying for years.Oil prices have been falling on worries over a supply glut, and U.S. crude futures settled down Friday.Continental shares plunged 6% to 22.71.

323,COG,"A gang of Iranian hackers who spent nearly two years targeting U.S., Saudi Arabian and Israeli researchers and duped 26% of its targets into handing over their credentials failed at the most rudimentary protection: locking its own back door.So Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) walked right in, Shahar Tal, one of the company's researchers, told IBD.The hackers' database coding was ""configured to be viewable to any visitor,"" Tal said. ""Certainly, we did penetrate the server, and we retrieved a lot of information.""The Check Point Incident Response Team last month published ""Rocket Kitten: A Campaign With 9 Lives,"" its report after four months of tracking a phishing and malware group dubbed Rocket Kitten, with supposed ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, a branch of the Iranian military dedicated to preserving the Islamic system.Over the course of two years, the Rocket Kitten hackers used targeted phishing attacks and custom-written malware to steal information from nearly 2,000 victims in the U.S. and Middle East. And, when discovered, they made simple code changes to continue operations.Revolutionary Guard Ties?Check Point isn't the first to investigate the Rocket Kitten hackers. Gadi Evron and Tillman Werner coined the ""Rocket Kitten"" term in a December 2014 lecture during the 31st Chaos Communication Congress of the Chaos Computer Club.Since 2014, FireEye (FEYE), iSight Partners, ClearSky, Trend Micro and The Citizen Lab have also launched investigations into seemingly disparate hacking groups that might all, in fact, be Rocket Kitten operatives, Tal said.And all appear to have a connection to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, he said.""You can pretty much imagine what they were after, based on the verticals and the types of theft we found,"" he said. ""You don't need a lot of imagination to tie the knots here and close the loop on what the Iranians were interested in.""Check Point turned its research over to authorities, and Tal says he can't comment further on the hackers' targets or on other details.'A Gaping Hole'Check Point's probe started in August on the phishing page where, via a query, researchers found a crack allowing password-less entry.""Such a gaping hole must be a decoy,"" the researchers wrote in their report. ""There is no way nation-state attackers would err in such amateur fashion, leaving their phishing server database exposed ... would they?""They would, Tal said.Within the database, Check Point researchers found 1,842 records outlining attacks beginning in August 2014. Of those attacks, 18% were leveraged at victims in Saudi Arabia, 17% in the U.S. and 16% within the Iran, said the report. Another 18% were directed at what the report called ""other.""""All you need is some creativity, a nice story and the right pitch, and you're going to get the click,"" Tal said. ""They're probably aware they're not the most sophisticated guys, but they were creative enough.""People are the weakest cog in the security wheel, Proofpoint (PFPT) CEO Gary Steele told IBD.""These schemes do work because they look legitimate,"" he said. ""The technology to block it has to be sophisticated.""Check Point researchers also identified the alleged ringleader, a self-described ""programmer, analyst, consultant and lecturer."" A simple online search turned up the man's resume, but he has not been charged with any crimes, so he won't be named in this report.Rogue AccessShortly after Check Point's onslaught, the Rocket Kitten hackers locked their database doors, Tal said.""People will say we're alerting them to be more secure,"" he said. ""But I think those are the wrong questions to ask. I think these guys needed to be checked out, they needed (to suffer) that blow, they needed to be exposed.""That exposure is key in educating the public, which security firms say is the bigger goal. Hackers don't have to be professionals with a budget in the billions of dollars to cause real damage, Ryan Olson, director of threat intelligence for Palo Alto Networks (PANW), told IBD.""Most attackers, even those you might consider amateurs, would secure their infrastructure better than Rocket Kitten did,"" he said. ""But (such lapses are) not unheard of.""Because of the nebulous nature of the cybercrime underworld, it's hard to connect the Rocket Kittens with other attacks with 100% accuracy, Olson said. Hackers are both professionals and amateurs.Also difficult, says Olson, is naming what software tools Rocket Kitten used and who, if anyone, backed them.""It depends on how a government is operating and how exposed they want to be to the attack themselves,"" he said. A government can avoid possible retribution by going with an outside hacker group, he points out.Of course, a hacker group could just attack on its own, he said, ""looking for rogue access to information with intent to sell it to the government.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

324,COG,"Corruption: The White House's tale that the Benghazi terrorist attacks were caused by a video was long ago revealed as a lie. Still unclear was Hillary Clinton's role in fabricating the story. But that's clearing up now.On Sept. 16, 2012, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on five Sunday TV news shows to explain why a few days earlier attacks on U.S. State Department facilities in Benghazi, Libya, killed four Americans, including our ambassador. It was all just a demonstration provoked by an Internet video that got out of hand, Rice said.It was a cover-up, of course. Rice was pushing in a re-election year a fiction that the administration believed would do the least amount of damage to President Obama's campaign.The administration couldn't allow itself to admit that things were going poorly in the Middle East after it had been saying progress was being made.Clinton herself went with the story even though she knew it wasn't true. But was she merely a cog in the conspiracy to cover up the truth, or one of its planners?An email from a batch released Monday strongly suggests she was an architect.Her schedule, the Washington Examiner has reported, shows that Clinton met with Rice in Clinton's office from 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Sept. 14, 2012 — two days before Rice misled the American people.The emailed schedule shows only that a meeting with Rice was planned. No subject was referenced. But a previously released Sept. 14, 2012, email that White House aide Ben Rhodes sent to several high-ranking administration staffers had the subject line: ""RE: PREP Call with Susan: Saturday at 4:00 p.m. ET.""At that prep session, Rice was told ""to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.""Was this narrative concocted that morning when Clinton and Rice met? And did Clinton participate in the prep session? Her schedule indicates that she was back in her office by 3:30 p.m. She could have orchestrated the session in a videoconference after she returned from Andrews Air Force Base, where she greeted the remains of the Benghazi victims and told their families the same lie that Rice told the nation.Neither Clinton nor Rice, who failed upward into the job of national security adviser, will ever say the truth, even under oath, we'd imagine.So all we have are conjecture backed by the steady drip of Clinton emails.About those emails: They continue to plague the former secretary of state's presidential aspirations, and could, if a Politico story published Tuesday is right, knock Clinton out of the race entirely.Reporters Bob Cusack and Ian Swanson speculate that FBI Director James Comey, though an Obama appointee, just might derail Clinton's campaign through the FBI's investigation into the personal email account and private server she used while at State.If Comey indeed recommends that Clinton be prosecuted, he'd be justified. Nearly 1,000 Clinton State Department emails from her personal account had classified material on them.Given this reality, it would not be outrageous if Clinton were indicted for violating the Espionage Act. She is clearly guilty of ""gross negligence"" in handling ""information relating to national defense,"" a dangerous breach of our security. Those found guilty of such an offense can find themselves in prison for 10 years.Of course, Clinton will never be a federal inmate. But a simple indictment is needed, if only to show that our nation's justice system still works.It might also save the country from a four- to eight-year prison stint that would also be known as the second Clinton administration.

351,COG,"Tyranny: The Castro regime showed its worst face on the arrival of Pope Francis in Cuba, hauling out its goons and showing how risky this papal visit is to the Marxist dictatorship.Some 60 dissidents were arrested and beaten across Cuba by security agents. Their crime? Wanting to attend Mass with the visiting pontiff, who had reached out to them with formal invitations.They were some of the top names among Cuba's democracy campaigners and included Marta Beatriz Roque, Jorge Luis ""Antunez"" Garcia Perez and Berta Soler of the human rights group Ladies in White. The Castro regime wasn't subtle, either, attacking and hauling off the bloodied dissidents even as the global television cameras rolled.Such a crackdown called for a far harder reaction from the Vatican, which had a right to expect basic respect for its choice of Cuban guests for Mass and other events. All the same, there was plenty in Francis' visit that could be described only as subversive, and the regime's violent reaction was proof.History shows that papal visits to such hideous regimes have resulted in their toppling within a year or so, and not just in Eastern Europe, where Pope John Paul II's 1976 visit is widely credited with injecting life into the Solidarity movement.Repressive regimes in Paraguay, Argentina and Chile fell after papal visits in the 1980s, says Vatican expert John L. Allen, who edits the Catholic website Crux. We might add Nicaragua, where John Paul lowered a finger at the Sandinista regime and blasted its repression.Francis didn't have the wherewithal to do that in Cuba. But his condemnation of ""ideology"" was significant enough. He needn't be more specific by attaching an ""ism""; Cuba has only one ideology — communism.The Pope's homily to the Cubans, on the Gospel story of how the tax collector Matthew converted from being a detested cog in the repressive state apparatus in favor of following Christ, was also subversive. It was an invitation to bureaucrats to reject Cuba's evil system in favor of something more just.Yes, the pope could have done more, and dictator Raul Castro bird-dogged him everywhere in a bid to use him to reinforce his legitimacy.But Francis did a lot on his Cuba visit to hit Castro where it hurts. Castro has survived two papal visits, but with this he may not make it three times lucky.

"
369,COG,"Jack Welch was 45 when he became General Electric's CEO. At the time, early 1981, GE (GE) had a market cap of $14 billion. Twenty years later, when he announced his retirement, the conglomerate's market cap stood at $400 billion. Plus, he had overseen the firm's stock sprint of 5,600% into its high of 2000.During those two decades, Welch earned numerous accolades, including Manager of the Century by Fortune in 1999.Yet his career almost imploded before it began.Welch earned degrees in chemical engineering from the Universities of Massachusetts and Illinois.Ph.D. in hand, he joined GE in 1960 as a chemical engineer in Pittsfield, Mass.A year later, he was about to quit.Standing Up""I was working with about five other engineers and I got a nice 10% raise, in the $1,000 range,"" Welch, 79, told IBD. ""I thought that was pretty good, until I found out all my office mates got the exact same raise. I thought I deserved more and didn't like the socialistic aspects of the raise.""It was my first lesson in differentiation. I started looking around, and I got a beautiful offer from International Minerals & Chemical (now ICM Global). I was about to leave. I already had my going-away party. My boss flew up. He convinced me to stay and even paid back International for their expenses recruiting me.""The experience taught him a valuable lesson on the way to building his fortune of $750 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com: ""It made it clear to me that you don't want to lose your great employees by leveling the field. You give different rewards to different people.""Welch, who played hockey and golf in college, carries the playing field analogy further. When you chose up sides in the schoolyard, the first person picked will likely play a premium position; the last person will be stuck in the least important place.""All my life I've been associated with differentiation,"" he said. ""Suddenly I was one guy in a bullpen in a company of 400,000. I don't want anyone who ever works for me to feel like a cog in a wheel.""These are lessons Welch hopes to pass on to a new generation of corporate leaders.After his GE days, he founded an online MBA program, the Jack Welch Management Institute, part of Strayer University.Also, along with his wife, Suzy, he recently wrote ""The Real-Life MBA: Your No-BS Guide to Winning the Game, Building a Team and Growing Your Career.""Clearly, Welch communicates from experience.He moved rapidly up the GE ranks and, 21 years into his tenure, succeeded Reginald Jones as CEO.Welch insisted that GE units stand No. 1 or 2 in their industries. If not, he shuttered or sold them.He shed about 100,000 employees in the process, earning the unenviable nickname of Neutron Jack for blowing up people and leaving buildings intact.It wasn't easy for Welch, who knew all about the blue-collar world, since his father was a railroad conductor.""It was terrible to be called Neutron Jack. No fun,"" he said. ""And it stayed with me forever. Who wants to be thought of as impacting people's lives negatively? You want to impact them positively. I want to spend time improving people's lives.""Ultimately, he contends, he had no choice.He offers an example: ""The Japanese were coming. We were making TV sets in Syracuse, N.Y., and the Japanese were selling TVs in the mall in Syracuse for less than we were manufacturing them.""Welch notes that GE was the first company to bite the bullet because of foreign competition, enabling his firm's subsequent growth.""It was an awful experience,"" he said, ""but years later, when they (other American companies) were laying off, we were adding.""And now GE, which produces everything from locomotives to jet engines and medical equipment, employs 300,000.Jeffrey Immelt, who replaced Welch as GE CEO, said his former boss ""was tough minded but fair, challenging and fun.""The two did not have a mentor-mentee relationship.""CEOs aren't good mentors, really,"" Immelt said. ""Jack taught me leadership skills by his example. The combination of informality and access is important in a big company. I learned that from Jack, and I practice it today.""The Welch WayImmelt hit on two mainstays of Welch's management style: Informality. Everyone called him Jack at GE.And when an employee did something noteworthy, he would send a handwritten note of congratulations.""A lot of that (personal touch) is lost today with emails,"" Welch said. ""These things are meaningful to people. I was just talking to someone from (New York City radio station) WOR who said I was only 'one of two people who came on my show to write me a handwritten thank-you note. I have it framed in my office.'"" Access. Welch was famous for his surprise visits to GE offices around the world. ""That's how you find out what's (really) going on,"" he said. And he regularly taught a management class at GE's training facility in Crotonville, N.Y.""I never missed a class,"" he said. ""I'd teach three hours, small lectures, do a couple of hours of Q&A and then hang out. I'd learn a lot and get the message across where we were going and what's in it for the people.""One reason why he lingered after the official class ended was his quest for an honest exchange of ideas. But how do you get employees to open up when your nickname is Neutron Jack?""The way you do it is by setting an example,"" he said. ""You're in a meeting, discussing a project, and someone says, 'Jack, you're full of baloney.' And believe me, they'll do it. We used to have food fights over decisions. You right away have to let people know that that's the right kind of behavior.""You get the behavior you reward. If you reward risk taking and not shoot the person who takes a risk, you will have people taking risks.""To encourage that atmosphere, Welch instituted what he calls battlefield commissions, bonuses handed out ""within 48 hours to people who do something we really like. People say, 'Holy cow, they really mean it.'""Rich ApproachWelch still emphasizes that giving sensibility in prospective managers — as well as a real touch.""Authenticity — brains, passion and people who have the generosity gene,"" he said. ""I want people who have a passion for promoting people, who love to give raises, who love to give stock options.""We had 60,000 people at GE with stock options. The stock went up 5,000%. What a treat to make that many millionaires. We had leaders who were giving (bonuses) out and loved to see (employee successes). I remember Friday afternoons getting those old IBM (IBM) printouts and seeing an engineer making $80,000 cashing in bonus options for $400,000. It was a turn-on. We already had our pile and we felt if people went the extra mile they should get theirs.""Said Immelt: ""Jack sincerely liked people and wanted to get the best out of them. He was extremely demanding. Not to be critical, but to get the best out of them.""For Welch, that means mixing today with tomorrow. ""That's your job,"" he would tell his GE execs.He notes now: ""Any jerk can say, 'I can't tell you how things will be next quarter or next year.' Any jerk can squeeze the budget to make the numbers for the quarter.""The job of a real leader is to balance the short and the long term.""He added: ""When we talk about growth, we talk about going all in (on a project) if you believe in it. You can't sprinkle it on. You have to be willing to make bets. When we decided to make (aircraft) engines, the GE launch would have cost billions if we were wrong. And we wouldn't know the answer for five years. The same thing for turbines.""That's your job, attaining your short-term goals while planning your long-term future.""(Management) is not Einstein. It's not some massive scientific endeavor. It's just common sense.""

399,COG,"Richard Weiss is a key cog in the machinery that outlines how American Century's asset allocation mutual funds play the market in 2015.
"
400,COG,"He is on the team overseeing the investment strategies for that group of mutual funds.
"
401,COG,"And he co-manages the firm's nine One Choice target-date funds, its six One Choice target-risk funds, its three Strategic Allocation funds, its Global Allocation Fund and its Multi-Asset Income Fund.
"
402,COG,"That's $19.6 billion in assets, in addition to his asset-allocation strategy work.
"
403,COG,"Just before the New Year, IBD asked the 54-year-old El Segundo, Calif.-based Weiss for his thoughts on the best stock investing opportunities in 2015.
"
404,COG,"IBD: Let's clarify how your fund groups differ from each other, Rich. The One Choice funds whose names include a year, such as $1.5 billion One Choice 2020 Portfolio , are target-date funds, whose mix of stocks and bonds changes as the target date gets near, right?
"
405,COG,"Weiss: Yes.
"
406,COG,"IBD: And the One Choice mutual funds whose name includes a description of its investment style are target-risk funds, which some people call lifestyle funds, whose asset mix generally stays the same over time, right?
"
407,COG,"Weiss: Also correct, with one slight modification. In the target-risk funds, we do make tactical re-allocations from time to time, depending on the intermediate-term outlook.
"
408,COG,"IBD: And how do the target date and target risk groups differ from the Strategic Allocation funds?
"
409,COG,"Weiss: The One Choice portfolios are funds of funds. The Strategic Allocation funds invest in individual securities.
"
410,COG,"IBD: Characterize how all of those portfolios are deployed now, please.
"
411,COG,"Weiss: In the One Choice and Strategic Allocation portfolios, we have been and remain overweight in equities. At least (in all of 2014).
"
412,COG,"IBD: How would you describe the stock market's performance in 2014?
"
413,COG,"Weiss: Without appearing too glib, you can sum up all of 2014 in two letters: U and S. The U.S. dominated, economically and marketwise.
"
414,COG,"The U.S. showed some of the strongest, if not the strongest, economic growth in 2014 and likely will in 2015 vs. most developed markets and emerging markets.
"
415,COG,"IBD: What does that tell investors about 2015?
"
416,COG,"Weiss: We're seeing the bull market get long in the tooth. If you look at sector rotation, the market was led by a handful that are notoriously late-cycle economic sectors. They tend to thrive toward the end of an economic cycle.
"
417,COG,"IBD: Such as?
"
418,COG,"Weiss: Utilities, health care, consumer staples. Tech also was strong, but it's a growth sector.
"
419,COG,"So three of the top four sectors are late-cycle, defensive sectors. Typically, they only lead the market shortly before it turns down.
"
420,COG,"IBD: Sounds like everyone should dive into the nearest foxhole.
"
421,COG,"Weiss: We're late (in the) cycle. But the cycle is not over yet.
"
422,COG,"We remain overweight in equities and in late-cycle growth stocks. We are beginning to diversify and move into more international securities.
"
423,COG,"U.S. equities outperformed foreign developed markets by about 60 percentage points over the last five years. As a result, U.S. valuations relative to major foreign economies have gotten to historically high levels.
"
424,COG,"IBD: And what should investors do with that knowledge?
"
425,COG,"Weiss: I see this as an opportunity to take profits in U.S. equities and diversify into developed foreign markets.
"
426,COG,"IBD: So which foreign markets appeal to you most?
"
427,COG,"Weiss: Predominantly in Europe, despite their problems. Even because of their problems.
"
428,COG,"The valuations metrics are discounting some severe issues in developed markets in the eurozone.
"
429,COG,"IBD: And which sectors do you prefer?
"
430,COG,"Weiss: We'd lean to late-cycle growth and utilities. We continue to favor types that did well this year: tech, health care.
"
431,COG,"Consumer staples are No. 1. We like companies that sell items that consumers need regardless of whether we're headed into a recession or a recovery.
"
432,COG,"IBD: Do you like some parts of the eurozone better than others?
"
433,COG,"Weiss: We're staying away from the periphery, where the risks are greatest. We're staying in larger economies — predominantly Germany and France. We also find the U.K. attractive, although it's not formally part of the eurozone.
"
434,COG,"IBD: Do you like any emerging markets, perhaps some that don't depend on commodity exports?
"
435,COG,"Weiss: We do have positions in emerging markets in virtually all of our portfolios, but we're not looking to increase those in the near future.
"
436,COG,"IBD: What about emerging markets that are not big oil exporters?
"
437,COG,"Weiss: Our stock selection is bottom-up rather than top-down. But we are currently overweight in three countries in our emerging markets funds: China, Peru and Turkey.
"
438,COG,"IBD: Why is that?
"
439,COG,"Weiss: We are finding companies in China that benefit from the growth and increasing penetration of modern retail, specifically online retailing.
"
440,COG,"China also benefits from a loosening of government fiscal policies regarding such things as lending and housing purchases and infrastructure investment.
"
441,COG,"From an e-tailing perspective, logistics-transportation becomes important too.
"
442,COG,"We own Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) and Vipshop (VIPS) to name a few that benefit from the above themes.
"
443,COG,"IBD: What about Peru, please?
"
444,COG,"WEISS: It's overweight due to one stock: Credicorp (BAP), which is a high-quality, well-managed bank.
"
445,COG,"It benefits from increasing banking penetration in Peru, as well as a resetting of government policies.
"
446,COG,"IBD: What do you like in Turkey?
"
447,COG,"Weiss: We favor Ulker Biskuvi, a chocolate and cookies company; and two transportation stocks — TVA Holdings, an airports' operator, and Pegasus Airlines, a low-cost carrier.
"
448,COG,"Those stocks benefit from increasing penetration of modern retail and increasing penetration of air travel.
"
449,COG,"IBD: What are your sector overweights, and why?
"
450,COG,"Weiss: Our team selects the most attractive stocks around the world. Country and sector weights are a result of that.
"
451,COG,"In consumer discretionary, (we like) high, visible space growth opportunities like Pandora, the jewelry company, and Inditex (the Spanish fashion retailer, which owns Zara stores).
"
452,COG,"Airline, hotel and travel companies benefit directly or indirectly from tightening supply-demand, which is helping to drive pricing improvement. (We also like) beneficiaries from lower energy costs — stocks like Whitbread, the U.K. three-star hotel operator; International Airlines Group, which operates British Airways and Iberia airlines; and Carnival (CCL) cruise line.
"
453,COG,"IBD: Is your team overweight in tech?
"
454,COG,"Weiss: Yes. In technology (we like) new product cycles such as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6/6+, and the rise of new, lower-cost smartphone original equipment makers focused on growth in emerging markets, like (privately owned handset maker) Xiaomi in China, and chip manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) (TSM), the Taiwan-based foundry company.
"
455,COG,"The intensifying competition among smartphone and other electronics OEMs is resulting in increasing demand for leading edge semiconductor content. This benefits (Dutch based) ASML Holding (ASML), the largest provider of lithography equipment.
"
456,COG,"The rising use of e-commerce and the shift to mobile usage is benefiting Alibaba and Japan's Rakuten (which runs the large Ichiba e-commerce site).
"
457,COG,"The increased use of social media applications, particularly in China, is helping stocks like TenCent.
"
458,COG,"And the accelerating trend of advertising dollars shifting from traditional media to digital benefits stocks like Baidu (BIDU), the GoogleGOOGL of China.
"
459,COG,"IBD: What other sectors?

460,COG,"Weiss: In health care, more efficient spending on R&D, combined with benefits of mapping the human genome, is resulting in accelerating new product launches, driving improved revenue growth for the pharmaceuticals industry. (One beneficiary is) Roche (RHHBY), a cancer drug leader and beneficiary of immunotherapy drug development.Richard Weiss is a key cog in the machinery that outlines how American Century's asset allocation mutual funds play the market in 2015.He is on the team overseeing the investment strategies for that group of mutual funds.And he co-manages the firm's nine One Choice target-date funds, its six One Choice target-risk funds, its three Strategic Allocation funds, its Global Allocation Fund and its Multi-Asset Income Fund.That's $19.6 billion in assets, in addition to his asset-allocation strategy work.Just before the New Year, IBD asked the 54-year-old El Segundo, Calif.-based Weiss for his thoughts on the best stock investing opportunities in 2015.IBD: Let's clarify how your fund groups differ from each other, Rich. The One Choice funds whose names include a year, such as $1.5 billion One Choice 2020 Portfolio , are target-date funds, whose mix of stocks and bonds changes as the target date gets near, right?Weiss: Yes.IBD: And the One Choice mutual funds whose name includes a description of its investment style are target-risk funds, which some people call lifestyle funds, whose asset mix generally stays the same over time, right?Weiss: Also correct, with one slight modification. In the target-risk funds, we do make tactical re-allocations from time to time, depending on the intermediate-term outlook.IBD: And how do the target date and target risk groups differ from the Strategic Allocation funds?Weiss: The One Choice portfolios are funds of funds. The Strategic Allocation funds invest in individual securities.IBD: Characterize how all of those portfolios are deployed now, please.Weiss: In the One Choice and Strategic Allocation portfolios, we have been and remain overweight in equities. At least (in all of 2014).IBD: How would you describe the stock market's performance in 2014?Weiss: Without appearing too glib, you can sum up all of 2014 in two letters: U and S. The U.S. dominated, economically and marketwise.The U.S. showed some of the strongest, if not the strongest, economic growth in 2014 and likely will in 2015 vs. most developed markets and emerging markets.IBD: What does that tell investors about 2015?Weiss: We're seeing the bull market get long in the tooth. If you look at sector rotation, the market was led by a handful that are notoriously late-cycle economic sectors. They tend to thrive toward the end of an economic cycle.IBD: Such as?Weiss: Utilities, health care, consumer staples. Tech also was strong, but it's a growth sector.So three of the top four sectors are late-cycle, defensive sectors. Typically, they only lead the market shortly before it turns down.IBD: Sounds like everyone should dive into the nearest foxhole.Weiss: We're late (in the) cycle. But the cycle is not over yet.We remain overweight in equities and in late-cycle growth stocks. We are beginning to diversify and move into more international securities.U.S. equities outperformed foreign developed markets by about 60 percentage points over the last five years. As a result, U.S. valuations relative to major foreign economies have gotten to historically high levels.IBD: And what should investors do with that knowledge?Weiss: I see this as an opportunity to take profits in U.S. equities and diversify into developed foreign markets.IBD: So which foreign markets appeal to you most?Weiss: Predominantly in Europe, despite their problems. Even because of their problems.The valuations metrics are discounting some severe issues in developed markets in the eurozone.IBD: And which sectors do you prefer?Weiss: We'd lean to late-cycle growth and utilities. We continue to favor types that did well this year: tech, health care.Consumer staples are No. 1. We like companies that sell items that consumers need regardless of whether we're headed into a recession or a recovery.IBD: Do you like some parts of the eurozone better than others?Weiss: We're staying away from the periphery, where the risks are greatest. We're staying in larger economies — predominantly Germany and France. We also find the U.K. attractive, although it's not formally part of the eurozone.IBD: Do you like any emerging markets, perhaps some that don't depend on commodity exports?Weiss: We do have positions in emerging markets in virtually all of our portfolios, but we're not looking to increase those in the near future.IBD: What about emerging markets that are not big oil exporters?Weiss: Our stock selection is bottom-up rather than top-down. But we are currently overweight in three countries in our emerging markets funds: China, Peru and Turkey.IBD: Why is that?Weiss: We are finding companies in China that benefit from the growth and increasing penetration of modern retail, specifically online retailing.China also benefits from a loosening of government fiscal policies regarding such things as lending and housing purchases and infrastructure investment.From an e-tailing perspective, logistics-transportation becomes important too.We own Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) and Vipshop (VIPS) to name a few that benefit from the above themes.IBD: What about Peru, please?WEISS: It's overweight due to one stock: Credicorp (BAP), which is a high-quality, well-managed bank.It benefits from increasing banking penetration in Peru, as well as a resetting of government policies.IBD: What do you like in Turkey?Weiss: We favor Ulker Biskuvi, a chocolate and cookies company; and two transportation stocks — TVA Holdings, an airports' operator, and Pegasus Airlines, a low-cost carrier.Those stocks benefit from increasing penetration of modern retail and increasing penetration of air travel.IBD: What are your sector overweights, and why?Weiss: Our team selects the most attractive stocks around the world. Country and sector weights are a result of that.In consumer discretionary, (we like) high, visible space growth opportunities like Pandora, the jewelry company, and Inditex (the Spanish fashion retailer, which owns Zara stores).Airline, hotel and travel companies benefit directly or indirectly from tightening supply-demand, which is helping to drive pricing improvement. (We also like) beneficiaries from lower energy costs — stocks like Whitbread, the U.K. three-star hotel operator; International Airlines Group, which operates British Airways and Iberia airlines; and Carnival (CCL) cruise line.IBD: Is your team overweight in tech?Weiss: Yes. In technology (we like) new product cycles such as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6/6+, and the rise of new, lower-cost smartphone original equipment makers focused on growth in emerging markets, like (privately owned handset maker) Xiaomi in China, and chip manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) (TSM), the Taiwan-based foundry company.The intensifying competition among smartphone and other electronics OEMs is resulting in increasing demand for leading edge semiconductor content. This benefits (Dutch based) ASML Holding (ASML), the largest provider of lithography equipment.The rising use of e-commerce and the shift to mobile usage is benefiting Alibaba and Japan's Rakuten (which runs the large Ichiba e-commerce site).The increased use of social media applications, particularly in China, is helping stocks like TenCent.And the accelerating trend of advertising dollars shifting from traditional media to digital benefits stocks like Baidu (BIDU), the GoogleGOOGL of China.IBD: What other sectors?Weiss: In health care, more efficient spending on R&D, combined with benefits of mapping the human genome, is resulting in accelerating new product launches, driving improved revenue growth for the pharmaceuticals industry. (One beneficiary is) Roche (RHHBY), a cancer drug leader and beneficiary of immunotherapy drug development.

465,COG,"Extracting oil and gas out of the ground is one thing, but having access to the necessary infrastructure in order to distribute those resources appropriately is quite another.
"
466,COG,"Fortunately for Antero Resources (AR), it has mastered both sides of the equation.
"
467,COG,"The Denver, Colo.-based oil and gas explorer and producer has mostly focused on two geographic areas: the Marcellus Shale in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, and the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio.
"
468,COG,"The company went public last October and had 7.6 tcfe (trillion cubic feet equivalent) in proved reserves at the end of 2013. By volume those reserves were 88% natural gas, 11% natural gas liquids and 1% oil. The proportion of liquids is expected to rise to 15% by 2016.
"
469,COG,"In Marcellus, Antero has 350,000 net acres, where it's currently running 15 rigs. That area accounts for approximately 80% of Antero's reserves. While the liquids portion of the production vs. dry gas is rather small right now, it is expected to grow to at least 15% of the production by 2015.
"
470,COG,"""If you look at some of the operating metrics there, they've found some huge wells, they operate a large number of rigs in that region and really continue to refine their production techniques, so they're able to extract more gas per well,"" said David Beard, energy analyst at Iberia Capital Partners.
"
471,COG,"The company is very quick at getting the best land position, he said. ""These are very prolific wells. A lot of it has to do with geology, and then you also have to have the right people to go out and sign the leases. The whole leasing process is very complicated.""
"
472,COG,"Antero has also amassed some of the best acreage positions in the Utica Shale. It has 106,000 net acres in the core rich gas and condensate area and operates five rigs. Utica has been an emerging play, with its production run rate growing from nearly zero in 2012 to 13% in 2013, and anticipated to keep expanding in 2014 and beyond.
"
473,COG,"Working The Wells
"
474,COG,"The company's overall goal is to drill out its substantial — approximately 25-year — inventory of high-return, low-cost well locations, writes Beard in a research report.
"
475,COG,"In addition to its solid drilling activities, Antero has also been the frontrunner in establishing firm contracts and building out the necessary infrastructure to get its gas into the pipelines and out of the region.
"
476,COG,"A key competitive advantage for Antero, noted Beard, is ""they've really done a good job getting what they call midstream capacity, so that's not only building their own gathering systems but then securing takeaway capacity on pipelines.
"
477,COG,"""And they are big enough to negotiate room on the pipeline, because the pipelines need them as much as they need the pipelines.""
"
478,COG,"The company estimates its cumulative year-end 2014 total capital investment in midstream to be $1.6 billion. This includes gathering pipelines, compressor stations and water-distribution pipeline and storage facilities.
"
479,COG,"""I think they've been a little bit more forward-looking with how they lock up their takeaway capacity agreements,"" said David Deckelbaum, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""They've been certainly ahead of peers in that regard. That's a pretty big differentiating factor. You're looking at almost over 1.5 bcf (billion cubic feet) a day of gas firm capacity in 2015.""
"
480,COG,"Range Resources (RRC), EQT (EQT) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) are some of the other operators in the space.
"
481,COG,"To monetize its midstream assets better, Antero filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 7 for an initial public offering of its midstream business as a master limited partnership, or MLP.
"
482,COG,"""From a pricing perspective ... the benefit there is that you could potentially get a better multiple for your midstream business than what you're getting for your consolidated business right now,"" said Deckelbaum. ""As an Antero holder right now in the upstream, you would be able to benefit from the company getting a certain percentage of proceeds from that deal.""
"
483,COG,"The company can use some of the money to fund growth endeavors in 2014 and 2015. Beard expects production to grow in the 60% to 65% range in 2014 and the 30% to 50% range through 2016.
"
484,COG,"Given the ramp-up in drilling and production, Antero is expected to need $2.3 to $2.6 billion per year for capital expenditures. This need is driven by drilling up to 250 wells per year and adding an additional $850 million in infrastructure spending, writes Beard.
"
485,COG,"Operating cash flow would increase from $500 million in 2013 to $2.3 billion by 2016. As a result, the company's net debt could climb from the $2.1 billion on its books at the end of last year to $4.3 billion by 2016, Deckelbaum notes. Antero raised about $1.6 billion in its IPO.
"
486,COG,"The company currently has a $2 billion revolver and the potential for additional credit lines. It also has access to the high-yield credit markets and may raise additional capital at some point in the future, according to analysts.
"
487,COG,"Risk Profile
"
488,COG,"Due to the abundance of natural gas, especially in the Marcellus Shale, there is always a risk of a collapse in gas prices. Such a collapse happened in April 2012 as natgas prices sank to $1.90 per thousand cubic feet (mcf). Because of this sensitivity, Beard says each $0.50/mcf change in gas prices would equate to a $9 change in share value.
"
489,COG,"Other risks include problems or delays with the infrastructure, resulting in a shortage of takeaway capacity. While there have been some challenges recently, the company's guidance has allowed for some production that cannot be put to sale.
"
490,COG,"Issues with deployment of new technologies can also pose risks. Beard notes that hydro-fracturing has come under increased scrutiny by environmental and regulatory groups, and that some groups believe ""fracking"" is damaging to the environment.
"
491,COG,"""The science of fracturing is probably not causing a lot of these problems, but that's only one step in many, many steps to get gas to your stove,"" Beard said. ""And it only takes one innocent mistake or an unscrupulous operator to cut corners and bad things happen.""
"
492,COG,"Antero's management has a solid track record, with CEO Paul Rady and CFO Glen Warren, Jr., having been in the oil and gas business for a long time. Private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Yorktown Energy Partners V have stakes in the company, Beard notes.
"
493,COG,"""Management definitely has a vision and they have proven themselves to be world-class operators as it relates to getting some of the best wells in the Utica and certainly in the Marcellus,"" said Deckelbaum. ""They've done a very commendable job of managing midstream needs with upstream production. I think that's very evident in the level of production they have. I think they've done a good job.""Extracting oil and gas out of the ground is one thing, but having access to the necessary infrastructure in order to distribute those resources appropriately is quite another.Fortunately for Antero Resources (AR), it has mastered both sides of the equation.The Denver, Colo.-based oil and gas explorer and producer has mostly focused on two geographic areas: the Marcellus Shale in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, and the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio.The company went public last October and had 7.6 tcfe (trillion cubic feet equivalent) in proved reserves at the end of 2013.

494,COG,"Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) traded at an all-time high Tuesday. It's extended from a flat base and has successfully tested its 10-week line.The Houston-based company is engaged in the exploration for and production of oil and gas in Pennsylvania, south Texas and the Texas panhandle.The source of its growth is 200,000 acres in Susquehanna County in northeast Pennsylvania, where it is in the sweet spot of the Marcellus Shale, a highly lucrative area of natural gas production. Never mind that natural gas prices have dropped dramatically. Cabot is the low-cost producer in the region.The company is putting up the numbers to prove it. In the most recent quarter, EPS rose 667% and sales rose 69%. For both earnings and sales, that marked the fourth quarter of acceleration. Not many companies can claim that distinction.The return on equity was a subpar 6.6% in 2012, amid a modest debt-to-equity ratio. Profit margins were 19.8%. Analysts on consensus are looking for an 82% earnings increase to 20 cents a share in the current quarter.The Relative Price Strength Rating is 91. There are signs of accumulation by big investors. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is B+. But the up/down volume ratio is 0.9, slight below the neutral 1.Cabot gapped out of an eight-week flat base July 25 on volume that was 142% above average. It was not easy sailing for the investor who bought the breakout. It settled back below its 37.21 buy point, but then found support at its 50-day moving average line.Analysts are looking for a 139% increase in earnings per share to 79 cents this year and a 72% increase next year.There are reasons to be cautious. The energy business is cyclical and is affected by changes in prices and in the economy. The flat base is 3rd stage. Late-stage bases are more prone to failure. And there have been two 2-for-1 stock splits in the past two years. Multiple splits can be a red flag.

497,COG,"Gas pedal. Brake.When you first start to drive cars, those are the basics. But experienced drivers develop an intuitive feel for when and how much gas or brake to apply. That intuition ultimately makes their vehicle a less risky, more effective form of transportation.When you first start to trade in the stock market, the basics are buy and sell. Over time, you evolve into a more nuanced understanding of moving into and out of stocks.An important step is learning to build positions as you identify, analyze and buy into a winning stock. There are a couple different components to this tactic.The first is pyramiding, a strategy discussed in detail in Wednesday's Investor's Corner .The next is to capitalize on follow-on buy opportunities. This is how they work.Let's say you are in a stock with a full position. The market is ticking its way through an uptrend. You bought into five stocks at the start of the uptrend. Two of those turned lower and triggered sell rules. As a result, you have idle capital in your account.Among your other stocks, one is lagging, but not yet tripping the sell wire. Two are turning in productive gains and worth holding.Your goal is to fold a prudent amount of your parked capital into your most productive stocks. You can do this through add-on buy opportunities such as rebounds from 10-week support and three-weeks-tight patterns.Don't treat follow-on opportunities as you would an initial base. Follow-on buys are places to spoon in capital.At a 10-week rebound, in general you don't want to deploy cash worth any more than 20% to 25% of the amount of your full, initial position. At three-weeks-tight buy points, 10% should be a maximum. Much less than 10% is preferable.Why? Primarily because you want to keep your average cost at a sustainable level.Your average cost determines your cushion in the stock. Adding more shares at follow-on levels narrows your cushion.Another point: A stock's first two pullbacks after a breakout are its most promising. A third rebound is more risky. Don't buy beyond the third rebound.Also, count rebounds only from breakouts from bases. A breakout from a three-weeks-tight pattern does not meet the rebound count.Cabot Oil and Gas (COG) executed successful rebounds last year during the weeks ended Sept. 14, Oct. 26 and Dec. 21. (1) In that first rebound, Cabot was also breaking out of a long, deep cup with handle. This year, the stock rebounded during the weeks ended Jan. 18 and Feb. 22. (2)It briefly cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern on April 8, (3) then pulled back more than 8% below that buy point. This would trigger the golden sell rule of cutting losses, but only for the portion of capital invested at that buy point.

507,COG,"Cabot's management believes the Marcellus Shale could yield more than 3,000 potential drilling locations over time. This translates into a 25-year inventory and production rates of 44% to 54% in 2013 and 30% to 50% in 2014.
"
508,COG,"""I'm pretty bullish on the Marcellus, which is the heart of this company,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Robert Christensen. ""Natural gas is going to be developed by this company over the next 20 years.""
"
509,COG,"He cites several factors that will put the company in an advantageous position. ""It's going to be the lowest-cost, largest natural gas play ever to be had in the U.S.""
"
510,COG,"The nation's energy outlook has been improving. In October the Energy Information Administration estimated that the U.S. will be the top producer of petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbons combined this year, passing Russia and Saudi Arabia. Tuesday, the International Energy Agency's calculations pegged the U.S. as leader in oil output in 2015, two years earlier than expected.
"
511,COG,"The Right Rocks
"
512,COG,"One of the contributing factors to low-cost production is the quality of the rock, which absorbs more natural gas than in other areas of the U.S. Cabot ""chose the rocks that really make a difference,"" Christensen noted.
"
513,COG,"Another factor is the increased efficiencies that Cabot is able to realize in the area. Technological improvements as well as better gathering, processing and transporting of natgas allow Cabot to have a lower cost structure than its competitors have.
"
514,COG,"Thanks to the company's extensive experience in the region and improved technology, it's been able to reduce drill times from 22-25 days to 12-15 days, noted Global Hunter Securities analyst Curtis Trimble.
"
515,COG,"""If you look at the behavior of the stock, it's been amongst the best performers for the past year and a half, and that's despite a very challenging natural gas price environment,"" said Trimble, speaking of stocks in his energy coverage area.
"
516,COG,"""Cabot has done an excellent job of lining up transport capacity and contracts for gas, and this has allowed them to retain a more resilient price basis than many of the competitors in the Marcellus,"" Trimble said.
"
517,COG,"Cabot stock is up 36% this year through Wednesday, but in recent weeks has been trading off a high above 40 that it notched in early September.
"
518,COG,"During the last five reported quarters, the company's earnings per share have grown between 22% and 667% and revenue has improved between 13% and 69%. Cabot's third-quarter report, delivered Oct. 24, showed a 64% EPS gain to 18 cents on sales up 47%, to $435.9 million.
"
519,COG,"Industry Group Performs
"
520,COG,"Cabot is the ninth largest by market capitalization in the 102-company Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production industry group. This group, whose largest constituents are EOG Resources (EOG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Noble Energy (NBL) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), is ranked No. 6 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks. It's up 38% year to date through Wednesday, but like Cabot is trading off its highs.
"
521,COG,"Cabot recently divested some minor assets in Oklahoma and Texas so it could further streamline operations and focus on only the best areas.
"
522,COG,"The company expects to have 100 net wells in the Marcellus region this year and 130 to 140 net wells next year. It will have seven rigs in Marcellus and two in Eagle Ford in 2014. Eagle Ford drilling should result in 30-35 net wells in 2013 and 40-50 net wells next year.
"
523,COG,"Cash Is Coming In
"
524,COG,"Analysts forecast that Cabot will generate $1.1 billion in operating cash flow in 2013, which should fund all or nearly all of the firm's capital investment requirements. In 2014, Cabot is estimated to produce $1.6 billion in operating cash flow, of which some $300 million will be in excess.
"
525,COG,"The company will then be evaluating potential uses for the extra cash. It has a $10 million share repurchase authorization and it could also increase or offer a special dividend. It did this in July, when it doubled its dividend and announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
"
526,COG,"Drilling, Moving, Selling
"
527,COG,"Cabot's midstream operations also have been improving. The company's gas marketing has transportation contracts and long-term sales agreements with durations of eight to 15 years on many pipelines that provide access to various markets, wrote Barclays Capital analyst Jeffrey Robertson in a research report. Cabot currently transports gas on three interstate pipelines and there could be others in future years.
"
528,COG,"It also established a partnership with Williams Cos. (WMB) to build gathering, dehydration and compression infrastructure to bring gas to the interstate pipelines.
"
529,COG,"""Low-cost production is marketable and when it's abundant, it's more marketable,"" Christensen said. Having access to power plants, committing your gas long-term to an interstate pipeline or to industrial facilities "". . . to the extent you have that long-term supply and to the extent it's low cost, you have an edge in moving your gas out of the region.""
"
530,COG,"Some of the risks for Cabot's business include natgas prices and the quality of the free cash flow reinvestment choices next year. However, Christensen believes that the price pressure risk is overdone. He noted that the company's marketing force is very strong and that a lot of action is taking place behind the scenes, to do with the infrastructure and improving access via various pipelines.
"
531,COG,"Management has improved significantly over the past several years, analysts say.
"
532,COG,"""When CEO Dan Dinges came in, Cabot was not perceived amongst the highest-quality operators,"" Trimble said. ""I think what you see is a company willing to take their lessons learned and apply those."" The evolution of the quality profile of the company ""very much has mimicked the massive increase in shareholder value,"" Trimble said. ""I don't think they'd get to where they are in terms of share price without a very high-quality level of execution.""Having a laser-sharp focus in business is an important element of success. And for Cabot Oil & Gas, its focus on the Marcellus Shale has paid off handsomely.Not only is the Houston-based oil and gas explorer and producer reaping results this year from the Pennsylvania shale, it's also expected to have excess cash flow in 2014.The company will then need to decide what to do with the free cash flow: issuing a dividend increase, repurchasing shares, exploring new ventures or accelerating development of existing acreage positions.

It cited growing production and the potential of natural gas reserves in the Marcellus Shale, which extends through the Appalachian Basin.U.S. crude oil output is soaring amid a boom in hydraulic fracturing, in which a mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into a well at high pressure to fracture rock and release trapped oil and natural gas.Production rose 15.3% in May from a year earlier to 7.317 million barrels a day, according to the most recent data from the Energy Information Administration. The increase in output has helped the U.S. reduce its reliance on oil imports, which fell to an 18-year low in May.That month, the International Energy Agency said rising U.S. oil production will be a ""real game changer,"" helping to meet ""most of the world's new oil needs in the next five years.""Institutional investors have increased their holdings of Cabot Oil and Continental Resources in recent quarters. They include top-rated mutual funds such as Fidelity Balanced and Columbia Acorn.

560,COG,"Before the Marcellus Shale leaped into prominence as the largest natural gas play in the U.S., there was the Barnett Shale in Texas.Range Resources (RRC) has worked both basins. But the Fort Worth, Texas-based firm is now largely focused on the Marcellus in Pennsylvania, which has fueled most of its growth.Range Resources is so sold on the Marcellus that it sold off all its holdings in the Barnett. The $900 million in proceeds from that sale two years ago were reinvested into the Marcellus.""The Marcellus Shale is now larger than the Barnett and the largest gas field in the U.S. by far,"" said Range's CEO Jeff Ventura. ""In fact, you could argue that its reserves' potential makes it the second largest in the world.""The largest is the South Pars/North Dome field in Iran and Qatar. As Ventura tells it, Range ""discovered"" the Marcellus and ""everyone agrees with that.""In looking to find ""the next Barnett,"" Range saw that the Marcellus Shale had a lot of the same characteristics as the Barnett.That was in 2004. Range began drilling in the Pennsylvania portion of the play soon after, using the then-new hydraulic fracturing techniques needed to crack the hard shale rock in order to extract gas. It found great commercial value there.""Barnett is a good play, but the quality of the rock and the economics don't really compete with the Marcellus,"" Ventura said.He says wells in its southwest Pennsylvania sweet spot produce three times as much as its wells had in the best spots in the Barnett.Other firms followed Range into the Marcellus in what eventually became a virtual stampede. They include Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), EQT Corp. (EQT) and Chevron (CVX), among others.""Chevron has good (acreage), but I would argue that ours is better,"" Ventura said. ""They're in the dry (gas) area of southwest Pennsylvania. We have the advantage of having more wet gas, plus we have more net acreage than Chevron, which gives us greater leverage for future growth.""Though Range still has some oil operations in Oklahoma and Texas, most of its production comes from the Marcellus.Range is currently one of the largest producers in the Marcellus, accounting for 10% of the basin's total production.100% PositionsWhile its 1 million net acres may be topped by a couple of other players, Ventura says Range stands out for holding 100% positions in its acreage, unlike others that often form joint ventures and other deals with third parties.Moreover, most of Range's holdings are in the core region of the play, especially the more lucrative liquids-rich southwest part of Pennsylvania. Liquids-rich gas fetches higher prices than dry gas.""The best wet gas is in the southwest corner and the heart of it is in our big position in Washington County, the bull's eye of the highest quality rock with the wet gas in it,"" Ventura said.Analyst Leo Mariani of RBC Capital Markets says Range has ""the largest net acreage position in the wet gas window,"" which makes it stand out from other operators. He says it's also a low-cost producer with ""extremely substantial inventory to drill.""Range operates 500 wells and counting in the Marcellus.Range expects to grow production 20% to 25% annually for the foreseeable future. At that pace, Ventura says, its output will double about every three years.At the end of 2012, Range was producing nearly 800,000 million cubic feet equivalent per day. He thinks the firm can get to 1.6 billion cubic feet in roughly three years. And in six years, it would be about 3 billion.That latter number is significant. It would mean Range would surpass the previous U.S. record set by a single company in a single play, the 2.6 billion cubic feet per day by ARCO in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oilfield in the late 1970s.""The largest producing oilfield in the U.S. still is in Prudhoe, though the Bakken may surpass it,"" Ventura said.""My expectation is that (Range) will do better than that 20% to 25% (growth),"" said Mariani. ""Production in the play has grown like a weed for the last several years.""While second-quarter financial results won't be released until Wednesday, Range reported that production volume in the quarter reached a record high of 910 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. That's a 27% gain over the prior year's same quarter.Of that total, 79% was natural gas, 15% natural gas liquids and 6% crude oil and condensate.Natural gas fetched $4.20 per mcf, natural gas liquids $32.92 per barrel and crude oil and condensate $89.09 per barrel.Natural gas prices have risen from ultralows last year of around $2. Earnings fell 17% last year to 92 cents a share due largely to ultra-low gas prices.Earnings SurgeAnalysts expect second-quarter earnings to rise 190% over last year to 32 cents a share and end the year 60% higher than in 2012, to $1.47, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue is seen growing 19% to $1.7 billion.""You're going to see strong growth and cash flow,"" Mariani said, adding he expects natural gas prices to keep trending up.But analysts from Societe Generale caution that greater activity in the Marcellus could create shortages in rigs and services, which could hurt operating margins and cash flow.And Macquarie Capital analysts note that other challenges may surface in the future if volumes ""outrun available take-away capacity.""CEO Ventura doesn't seem too worried: ""Infrastructure is better in the southwest part of the state.""

"

"
572,COG,"""Sustainable free cash flow is one of the ultimate goals of shale development, and Cabot is one of the first companies to reach it,"" Perincheril wrote. ""The company will soon have to wrestle with the novel question of what to do with all that cash.""
"
573,COG,"How much cash? In the first quarter alone, Houston-based Cabot generated $212.7 million in cash flow from operations.
"
574,COG,"Jefferies & Co. estimates Cabot will have a cash flow surplus of $60 million in 2013 and at least $300 million in 2014, based on a $3.60 to $4.00 gas price and $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in capital spending.
"
575,COG,"Portillo expects gas prices to stay range bound between $4 and $4.50 through 2015 as the number of gas rigs rises because of higher prices fetched this year and as coal takes back market share lost when natural gas prices fell below $3.
"
576,COG,"Management didn't respond to a request for an interview. But it's indicated that higher investments in the Marcellus would be the most likely use of free cash flow. Other options include a dividend hike and share buybacks.
"
577,COG,"Another option would be further investments in infrastructure, something akin to the Constitution Pipeline, in partnership with Williams Partners (WPZ), set to go into service in March 2015.

"
587,COG,"With a sixth rig Cabot expects to bring into the Marcellus in early fall, wells drilled per year could rise from around 85 to 100, Perincheril estimates.
"
588,COG,"Seven-Fold Increase
"
589,COG,"Through hydraulic fracturing methods, gas production in the Marcellus has soared almost sevenfold since 2009, going from 1 billion cubic feet per well a day to 7 billion currently, Portillo says.
"
590,COG,"Cabot generally spends $6.5 million to drill and complete one well, he says. That well will produce reserves of about 14 Bcf, at the high end for the Marcellus, which starts at 4 Bcf per well for the dry gas.
"
591,COG,"In contrast, some of the legacy fields that initially drove the shale revolution in the U.S., such as the Barnett in Texas, produce 1 to 3 Bcfs per well, Portillo adds.

596,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies. The bullish report boosted the fuel’s price, which added around 3.5% for the week.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Smaller-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 89 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended May 4, below the guidance (of 92 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.While the second injection of the 2018 refill season was higher than both last year’s build of 49 Bcf and the 5-year (2013–2017) average addition of 75 Bcf for the reported week, the current storage remains well below benchmarks. At 1.432 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – natural gas inventories are 520 Bcf (26.6%) under the five-year average and 863 Bcf (37.6%) below the year-ago figure.Following EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices gained around 3.5% last week to settle at $2.806 per MMBtu on Friday.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 85.9 Bcf per day, essentially flat on a weekly basis due to steady production.Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption fell 4.3% to 55.3 Bcf. The decrease in demand was triggered by a 36.9% plunge in residential/commercial consumption due to warmer weather, partly offset by higher natural gas usage for power generation.Positive Long-Term ThesisThe fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Cor. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Antero Resources Corp.

599,COG,"First-quarter 2018 earnings cycle is in full swing, with reports from 154 S&P 500 members already on board. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 25.4% from the prior-year quarter on 10.3% higher revenues, with 80.5% companies delivering positive earnings surprises and 72.1% beating revenue estimates.For the first-quarter of 2018, we expect Energy to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors, posting earnings growth of 58.6%. For the January-to-March quarter, we project earnings of $14 billion — the highest in the last four quarters.  Importantly, Energy will likely be among the major drivers behind the S&P 500’s year-over-year earnings growth. Excluding Energy, the index’s Q1 earnings growth will likely drop to 16.5% from 17.8%.A favorable Q1 oil pricing scenario is expected to back Energy’s performance. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price for the month of January, February and March was reported at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively. The average oil price never touched $60 in any of the months in the 2015-2017 period, thanks to the extension of OPEC’s production cut deal through 2018-end.Stocks to Watch for EarningsOil giant ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the opening bell.In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 17% on the back of lower throughput margins.

600,COG,"Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 27.The company is an upstream energy entity, which delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2% in the trailing four quarters, missing estimates on two occasions.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this Houston, TX-based Cabot Oil & Gas prior to the earnings announcement.Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Trending?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions to draw a clear picture of analysts’ thoughts on the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents for the first quarter has seen two upward and one downward revision by firms in the last 60 days, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 42.1%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $463.8 million in the upcoming results, representing a 10.4% decline from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total equivalent production is 167 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), lower than 170.1 Bcfe in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total natural gas production to be 162 billion cubic feet (Bcf), 1.2% down year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for crude oil and condensate production is 703 thousand barrels (MBbl), down 43.2% sequentially and 23.7% year over year.Additionally, the consensus mark for average natural gas sales price (including hedging) per thousand cubic feet is $2.50, down from $2.64 in the year-earlier quarter but up from $2.18 reported last quarter. The consensus estimate for crude oil and condensate price (including hedging) is pegged at $56 per barrel, up from $46.73 in first-quarter 2017 and marginally up from $55 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenues from operations will likely decline in the to-be-reported quarter compared with year-ago period due to lower equivalent production and an estimated decline in gas prices.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from crude oil and condensate stands at $41.8 million, down from the year-ago quarter’s $43 million and the prior quarter’s $68 million. Analysts polled by Zacks project operating revenues from natural gas production at $412 million, 4.8% down year over year. However, the figure is 16.4% above the previous quarter’s result.Additionally, the company’s Marcellus program is ramping up with exceptional results. The company has around 200,000 net acres in the prime Marcellus acreage with an estimated 3,000 remaining undrilled locations. This high-quality asset base in the prolific region can benefit it in its first quarter operations.What Does Our Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cabot Oil & Gas is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cabot Oil & Gas has an ESP of -6.23% as the Most Accurate estimate of 25 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. The figure represents the percentage difference between the two above-mentioned estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cabot Oil & Gas carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as only a positive ESP increases the confidence about an earnings surprise.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies from the energy space, which per our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around.Frisco, TX-based Comstock Resources, Inc.

602,COG,"Over the last three years, the energy market has experienced intense price volatility. However, it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness, energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. With crude now firmly back over $60, the panic that swept over the market are all but gone. The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the first quarter of 2018.Posting its third quarterly gain in a row, oil prices ended March 2018 up nearly 8% year to date. The commodity got off to a strong start this year with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbing 7.1% in January. Though the benchmark tumbled 4.8% in February in the wake of a broad stock market selloff, it staged a rebound in March, with the contract up 5.6% for the month.The first quarter of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by a variety of catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.What’s encouraging is that the quarterly price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into 2018 following the futures contracts’ back-to-back yearly increases. To be precise, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.94 per barrel.A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $50 per barrel mark.Gains Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q4 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The October-December period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 153.7% jump from the same period last year – the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way – on 23.6% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q1 earnings season as well, which is on track to be the fourth successive quarter of positive earnings growth for the Oil/Energy sector. This is not surprising, considering that crude prices improved considerably from the year-ago period. In fact, the strongest growth in Q1 is again set to come from Oil/Energy. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the bottom line for energy companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 60.2% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 15.6%.Not all Stocks Will Outperform EstimatesSure, investing in companies that positively surprises estimates can fetch handsome returns for investors. This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat.But, the flip side, not all energy companies will deliver positive earnings surprises despite the promising backdrop. And when a stock negatively surprises and its scrip plummets subsequently, it can destroy a trade, set back an entire portfolio, and make a trader lose his confidence. Few things can decimate a stock like a negative earnings surprise.Utilizing Zacks' Earnings ESP system can greatly increase your odds of finding these potential underperformers before they report. And excluding these stocks from one’s portfolio can actually increase return by minimizing losses. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Apart from Earnings ESP, we have relied on our proprietary Zacks Rank and Style Score systems to help you avoid a few oil and gas companies this earnings season. Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) along with a VGM Score of D or lower are best avoided.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.As per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of 1, 2 or 3 to beat estimates.

603,COG,"Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for COG broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 4.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for COG stock.If that wasn’t enough, COG isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 2 estimates have been reduced, while one has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for COG.

604,COG,"Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) recently announced that its UK-based subsidiary, Valero Logistics UK Ltd, has agreed to acquire the SemLogistics Milford Haven fuel storage facility from SemGroup Corp. (SEMG  -  Free Report), which is located on Wales' west coast. Valero struck the deal with SemGroup Corporation's subsidiary, SemGroup Europe Holding L.L.C. With a storage capacity of 8.5 million barrels, the Milford Haven facility is one of the largest in the United Kingdom. It stores crudes, diesel, gasoline, gasoline blendstocks, gas oil, jet fuel and naphtha. The company expects the deal to close in the July-September quarter of 2018.Valero wants to retain the present employees in the facility, who can bring further expertise in their operations. Although the financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed, Valero will make earn-out payments to SemGroup if it can reach certain revenue goals in the four years following the deal closure.How Will Valero Benefit?The storage facility is located near Valero's Pembroke refinery and expected to complement its operations in the U.K. and Ireland. Additionally, more than 67% of the storage volume is multiproduct that can provide the acquirer flexibility to meet clients' demands in the European region. Moreover, Valero announced that SemLogistics Milford Haven will keep serving as a third-party storage facility, benefiting third-party clients in Europe.Valero’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joe Gorder said, “This purchase demonstrates Valero’s commitment to Wales and the UK, and it aligns with our strategy to grow the logistics business and reduce secondary costs.”The deal is also expected to provide Valero with stable and predictable cash flows in the long term. Of the total 2017 revenues of the company, only 1% came from the Storage & Other category.The deal is also in line with SemGroup Corporation’s strategy to divest its non-core assets. The company is expected to use the proceeds from the deal to fund its capital growth projects.About ValeroSan Antonio, TX-based Valero is one of the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. It has a refining capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day across 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Valero is also a leading ethanol producer with 11 ethanol plants in the Midwest that have a combined capacity of 1.45 billion gallons per year.Majority of the company’s refining plants are located in the Gulf coast area from where there is an easy access to the export facilities. This Gulf coast presence has helped Valero to increase its export volumes over the last few years.We are concerned about the company’s escalating debt level over the past two years. From no debt as of December 2015, Valero’s long-term debt is now $8.9 billion.Price PerformanceValerohas gained 37.5% in the last year compared with 14.8% growth for its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderValerocarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.

605,COG,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 978 in the week ended Feb 23 — higher than the prior week’s 975. Notably, the total count increased for three in the prior five weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 754.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 959, higher than 956. Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, up from the count of one for the week ended Feb 16.  However, the tally for offshore was 17, down from 18 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 799 was up from 798 for the week ended Feb 16. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 602.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 179 was up from 177 for the week ended Feb 16. With this, the tally increased twice in the last three weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 151.  Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 67 units increased from 65. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by one unit to 911.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 17 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — compared with 18 for the week ended Feb 16.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of two oil rigs in each of Permian basin and Cana Woodford resources. Moreover, the Utica and Haynesville basins added one natural gas rig each.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

606,COG,"Independent oil and gas firm SM Energy Company’s (SM  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 8 cents per share came narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents and the year-ago quarter’s loss of 31 cents. The improvement in bottom line can be attributed to an increase in oil-equivalent price and fall in operating expenses.Although total revenues (Oil, gas and NGL production sales) decreased to $341 million from $380 million in the prior-year quarter, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $330 million. The year-over-year decline in revenue performance was due to a fall in production.Even though SM Energy managed to beat the fourth-quarter estimates, investors seem concerned with the company’s 2018 outlook as the stock fell 9.3% following the earnings release. The company’s capital spending plan of $1.27 billion indicates a 36% rise from the prior-year figure of $936 million but the guidance for total production does not reflect much change, as shown below.SM Energy Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SM Energy Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SM Energy Company QuoteOperational PerformanceIn the fourth quarter, production was 112.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), down 23% from the year-ago level of 145.6 MBoe/d. This stemmed from natural declines in Eagle Ford volumes and absence of new wells in the region.Production in the fourth quarter reflects strong 21% sequential growth in Permian Basin volumes, which was more than offset by lower sequential Eagle Ford volumes as a result of the previously-announced joint venture as well as natural declines, as no new wells were completed in the Eagle Ford during the quarter.SM Energy produced 282.5 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas in the quarter, down 26% year over year. Oil production decreased 5% from the prior-year quarter to 41.5 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d). Natural gas liquids contributed 24 MBbls/d to total volume, down 37% from fourth-quarter 2016.   Due to hedging, the average equivalent price per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) was $32.16 compared with $27.59 in the year-ago quarter. Including hedging activities, average realized price of natural gas increased 26% year over year to $4.03 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). Average realized prices of oil at $48.90 per barrel, came in line with the year-ago quarter, whereas average realized prices of natural gas liquid grew 11% year over year to $18.84 per barrel.CostsOn the cost front, unit lease operating expenses (LOE) increased 39% year over year to $5.10 per Boe. Transportation expenses decreased to $5.01 per Boe from $6.39 per Boe in the year-ago period. General and administrative expenses flared up 36% to $3.38 per Boe from the prior-year level of $2.49. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) expenses were down 1% to $12.69 per Boe from the year-ago level of $12.81.    Operating ExpensesOperating expenses amounted to $441.4 million in the fourth quarter compared with $664.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Exploration expenses decreased to $16.9 million from $23.7 million in the comparable quarter last year.LiquidityNet cash from operating activities increased to $144.8 million during the reported quarter from $137.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, SM Energy had cash balance of $313.9 million and long-term debt of $2,908.770 million. The company had a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54.9% in the quarter.Proved ReservesAt the end of the year, the company had proved reserves of 468 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), which increased from 396 MMBoe reported at the end of 2016.GuidanceSM Energy has set its 2018 production estimate to be within 42-46 MMBoe, of which 41% is expected to be oil. In comparison, the company’s production for full-year 2017 came in at 44.5 MMBoe. If the company’s 2018 production is at the lower limit of the guided range, it will be lower year over year, even though total capital spending for the full year is estimated to rise 36%.Production for the first quarter of 2018 is projected between 9.5 and 10 MMBoe, of which 40% is expected to be oil.Q4 Price PerformanceSM Energy's shares declined 34.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the 14.4% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSM Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc.

611,COG,"EQT Corporation’s (EQT  -  Free Report) board of directors has finally succumbed to months of pressure from investors and agreed to separate the company's upstream and midstream businesses. It will form an independent publicly traded company (NewCo), whose operations will focus on the midstream businesses of EQT. Following the news of spin-off, the stock declined 3.1%, making the stock fall 11.1% in the last 30-day time period.Notably, since the $6.7 billion Rice Energy acquisition by EQT, activist Jana Partners and hedge funds D.E. Shaw & Co had pushed for the separation, as they thought it would bring better returns for shareholders.DetailsThe deal is devised to be tax-free for the company's shareholders, who will retain their EQT shares and receive a pro-rata share of the NewCo.Moreover, midstream assets of the company will drop down to its master limited partnership, EQT Midstream, which will then merge with the Rice Midstream Partners, the master limited partnership of Rice. The merged entity, NewCo, will focus on midstream businesses. The deal is expected to be over by the third quarter of 2018.  The Senior Vice President of EQT, Jerry Ashcroft, is expected to continue as the CEO of the newly independent company.How will it Help EQT?The spin-off is expected to enable the company to concentrate on its upstream assets, and exploration and production business. The deal will leave EQT with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 65,000 Ohio Utica acres. With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters, this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital, compared with the previous company set-up that constrained the company's returns in the recent years.Additionally, $2.3-$2.8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019-2023 time frame is expected to trickle down from the move, which forecasts 10-15% annual production growth. This is much needed for the company as its free cash flow generating ability did not work much in the last few years, staying in the negative region for most of the quarters.Price PerformanceEQT has lost 17.7% in the last year compared with 15.1% fall of its industry.About EQT CorporationBased in Pittsburgh, PA, EQT Corporation is an integrated energy company. It focuses on natural gas production, gathering and transmission in the Appalachian region.

618,COG,"Building on the sector's second annual gain in a row, energy stocks have witnessed a solid start to 2018 and look poised to continue climbing in the coming months.Just a few months ago, or until September last year, the commodity had a very difficult year. In June 2017, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to nearly $42 a barrel - the lowest in ten months. Since then, the contract has risen more than 50%. In fact, WTI hit a more than three-year high of around $66 recently.Unlike other short-lived rallies over the past three years, we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals. Declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 are the two major factors helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend.Production Cut Deal ExtensionOne of the significant reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared, revolves around the expansion of the output-cut deal between OPEC and other major producers beyond March. True to predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018.The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut. While there are several question marks over the degree to which the cartel members are adhering to their quotas, there's no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances.Sharp Inventory DrawdownsInvestors have pinned hopes of recovery over the U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles – pointing to a slowdown in shale output. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015.Investors Bet on a Sustained Rise in the Price of WTI crudeCurrently at around $63 a barrel, the price of oil has more than doubled from the multi-year lows of early last year and it’s a whole new ballgame for investors who are now the most optimistic on the commodity than at any time in the past three years. They believe that the OPEC and Russian agreement will help whittle down huge global stockpiles and lead to even higher prices in the near-term.Strong Oil Market Supported by a Robust U.S. Macro EconomyNotwithstanding recent hiccups, U.S. stock markets have hitting all-time highs on a regular basis. Stocks have mostly rallied since last year’s election, with a booming U.S. economy, supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key triggers. Expectations that the Trump administration’s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies’ and consumers, have given investors further reasons to put their money in stocks.Improving Cash Flows Prompt Oil Companies to Reward ShareholdersAs low oil prices over the past three years weighed on the energy companies' top and bottom lines, the industry was forced to chalk out new strategies and resort to dividend cuts and cost-reduction initiatives to shore up cash flows. The downturn not only impacted the smaller and the more-leveraged companies, it also affected the fairly larger companies (generally considered safe haven investments). They were forced to cut or suspend cash dividend and share buyback programs.Thanks to rebounding oil prices and strategic initiatives, most of the energy firms have finally managed to successfully come out of the slump. A stable floor under crude price, together with lower operating expenses not only helped boost profits but also encouraged a number of companies to raise dividend payouts.How to Pick the Right Stocks?With a host of oil producers raising payout of late, It is no easy task to select outperformers. Therefore, we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals.To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight four energy stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

619,COG,"The U.S. Energy Information Administration is officially predicting continued development of U.S. shale, along with increased liquid and natural gas production, through 2042.The new prediction comes in the EIA’s “Annual Energy Outlook” report. The agency notes that almost all “new electricity generation capacity” will be “fueled by natural gas and renewables after 2022.”The 2018 EIA report also projects that technological advancements and greater energy efficiencies will lead the U.S. to become a net energy exporter for the first time since the early 1950s. The EIA expects the U.S. will reach that milestone by 2022—years sooner than originally projected.With that said, let’s take a look at five companies that run U.S. natural gas businesses that are set to capitalize on its continued growth and importance both domestically and abroad.1.      Centennial Resource Development, Inc. (CDEV  -  Free Report)This Denver, Colorado-headquartered independent oil and natural gas company focuses on the development of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the booming Permian Basin area. Centennial is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.The company has also recently seen analysts up their fiscal 2018 earnings estimates, and now our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company’s EPS figure to skyrocket 170% to $0.75 next year. Looking even further down the road, Centennial is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of a whopping 47.01% over the next three to five years.2.       Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) This Houston-based company is engaged in the development, exploitation, and exploration of oil and gas exclusively in the continental U.S. COG is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and boasts “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum.Cabot is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 30% over the next three to five years as demand for natural gas climbs. What’s more, the company is projected to see its earnings hit $1.10 per share in fiscal 2018, which would mark an impressive 115% year-over-year jump from 2017’s projected total.3.      Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report)The second-largest U.S. refiner based on crude oil refining capacity is also heavily invested in natural gas after a $15.6 billion acquisition in 2015. Marathon is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an “A” VGM grade, supported by “A” grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system.Marathon has seen its earnings estimate revisions climb for fiscal 2018 recently, with the oil and gas giant also expected to expand its bottom-line by 34% from 2017’s projected total, based on our current estimates. On top of that, Marathon projected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 14.24% over the next three to five years.4.       RSP Permian, Inc. (RSPP  -  Free Report)This Dallas, Texas-headquartered independent oil and natural gas firm works in the same thriving area of West Texas as many other companies. RSP is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and earns “B” grades for both Growth and Momentum.

620,COG,"Oil major ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently announced the mechanical completion of its new 1.5 million ton a year ethane cracker at its Baytown, TX complex. Production at the site is expected to commence in the April-June period of 2018. The commissioning process of the facility has also been initiated. What Does the New Facility Hold in Store?Regional Benefits: ExxonMobil started the construction of the ethane cracker in 2014, which generated at least 10,000 construction jobs in the locality along with 4,000 associated jobs. It is expected to add 350 new permanent jobs after coming online. Notably, the project is expected to contribute $90 million a year to local tax revenues when it becomes operational. The company expects to inject $870 million per year in local economic activities. The project is in line with the company’s $20 billion Growing the Gulf initiative, which spans 10 years.Per John Verity, the president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company, “Our new ethane cracker will allow us to economically meet rapidly growing demand for high-performance polyethylene products around the world while continuing to sustain economic development and create jobs for decades to come.”Benefits for the Company: The new multibillion-dollar development is expected to ramp up ExxonMobil's ethylene capacity by 1.5 million tons per year. The project signifies one of the largest U.S. Gulf Coast investments made by the company. The facility is expected to benefit the company's export initiatives and improve its global competitiveness. We expect the new ethane cracker to help ExxonMobil compete with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP's Baytown petrochemical project, a joint venture between Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).Moreover, the two new high-performance polyethylene lines in Mont Belvieu, which became operational last year, will benefit from ExxonMobil's ethylene feedstock.

626,COG,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) recently struck two deals in Alaska. The company divested its Kenai liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report). In another deal, ConocoPhillips acquired stake in Western North Slope of Alaska from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report).About the DivestmentConocoPhillips has already closed the divestiture as it transferred Kenai operations to Andeavor on Jan 31, 2018. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed. With the sale of the Kenai assets, ConocoPhillips completed its retreat from the Cook Inlet region.Divestment RationaleConocoPhillips started its search for a company to divest its Kenai LNG plant toward the end of 2016. The divestiture will enable ConocoPhillips to shift its focus to North Slope region operations. Notably, ConocoPhillips is investing in new projects in the North Slope region like GMT-1 and GMT-2, which have bright future. While GMT-1 is in its final construction phase and expected to come online this year, GMT-2 awaits federal approval.Apart from concentrating on more profitable assets, the deal is also expected to strengthen ConocoPhillips' balance sheet and reduce its leverage, which is one of the best in the industry. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had a total debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%.About the AcquisitionConcurrent with its fourth quarter 2017 earnings, ConocoPhillips' announced that  it will buy Anadarko Petroleum's 22% non-operating stake in the Western North Slope of Alaska and its interest in the Alpine pipeline for a cash consideration of $400 million. In 2017, production from these assets was 63 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). The acquisition reflects ConocoPhillips’ optimism on North Slope oil prospects. The company expects the Trans Alaska Pipeline System to carry more new oil in the coming years.Price PerformanceConocoPhillips has gained 15.2% in the last year against the 14.7% fall of its industry.About ConocoPhillipsHouston, TX-based ConocoPhillips is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations and activities in several countries that include the U.S., Canada, the U.K./Norway, China, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Russia and Qatar. The company is involved in exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas worldwide.We also appreciate the company’s initiative to divest non-core assets as the explorer could use the proceeds in the lucrative Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin. The proceeds will also help the upstream company lower debt that has accumulated owing to the persistent slump in oil for more than three years.It is to be noted that during 2017, ConocoPhillips generated $16 billion from the asset sale program. However, the company’s 2018 production guidance, which is in the range of 1,195 to 1,235 MBOED is lower than the production of 1,377 MBOED in 2017.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the oil and energy sector is Cabot Oil & Gas (COG  -  Free Report).  It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The downside was caused by lower ethanol prices.Gross operating income from the VLP segment was $80 million compared with $70 million in the prior-year quarter and marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81 million.

631,COG,"Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) investors have more than one reason to cheer about. The board of directors of the company approved a 3.7% hike in its quarterly dividend. Also, it has made a significant oil discovery in Gulf of Mexico's (GoM) Ballymore prospect.About the Dividend HikeChevron – which is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 2 – will now reward shareholders with a dividend of $1.12 per share compared with $1.08 earlier. This translates to an annualized dividend of $4.48 per share. We note that this puts Chevron in line for a 31st consecutive annualized dividend hike in 2018. It is one of the only two energy stocks on the list of Dividend Aristocrats - a group of 51 companies in the S&P 500 that have raised their payouts for more than 25 years in a row. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Feb 16, 2018.What Possibly Led to the Hike?In the third quarter of 2017, Chevron generated $5.4 billion in operating cash flow, while shelling out around $5.2 billion in capital expenditures and dividends. This led to around $200 million in excess cash flows - something the company achieved for the first time since 2012. Moreover, as a result of Chevron's focus on planning and execution, the company continues to reduce its operating costs with underlying expenses down almost 5% year to date.In addition, the company’s financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are real assets, which support the company's dividend hike – the first since the fourth quarter of 2016. Chevron is in excellent financial health, with more than $6.6 billion in cash on hand and an investment-grade credit rating with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 22.2%.About the DiscoveryAround three miles away from its Blind Faith platform, Chevron has found oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico's Mississippi Canyon area. The Ballymore prospect is at a water depth of 6,536 feet. The prospect holds at least 670 feet of net oil pay. The company discovered that the well has a great reservoir and fluid properties. Chevron holds 60% operating stake in the new finding, while the rest is owned by Total E&P USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceChevron has gained 12.9% in the last year compared with 15.3% growth of its industry.About the CompanySan Ramon, CA-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas entities in the world as per proved reserves. It engages in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing of petroleum products plus manufacturing of chemicals and other energy-related businesses. The company divides its operations into two main segments: Upstream and Downstream.Cash capital expenditures for the first nine months of the year declined 30%, which will boost its financial strength. However, we remain worried about the headwinds faced by Chevron's U.S. production. The company's exposure to violence-prone regions in Nigeria poses an additional risk.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderChevron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas (COG  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report).  Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

632,COG,"Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) recently announced that its proved reserves as of Dec 31, 2017 increased 27% year over year to 1,162.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (Bcfe). Following the news, the company’s shares rallied more than 8%. This continues the recent uptrend for the company as the stock is now up 24% in the last 30 days.Per the company, it has taken into account oil and natural gas prices, which were a respective 30% and 26% higher than 2016, in order to determine the proved reserves. Comstock operates 98% of the proved reserves.The notable rise in proved reserves is primarily due to the success of the Haynesville shale drilling program in 2017, which helped the company to add 292 Bcfe to its reserves. Moreover, the improvement in realized prices and solid well performance last year added 41 Bcfe to the company's reserves. Notably, the company's development activities witnessed spending of $174.6 million in 2017. We would like to remind investors that the company has low liquidity and high leverage, which remains an overhang on its growth plans. It has a long-term debt to capital ratio of 91.8%, much higher than the industry’s 49.3%. To counter the situation, Comstock plans to divest its Eagle Ford shale properties in South Texas. These assets include 10.5 Bcf natural gas and 7.1 million barrels of oil of the latest proved reserves. About the CompanyFrisco, TX-based Comstock is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas properties.Comstock’s major position in the prolific Haynesville/Bossier Shale play provides a highly visible and cost-effective production growth profile. However, being a relatively small player, Comstock lacks the financial resources of larger industry giants. As such, during periods of prolonged credit crunch, the company is forced to spend within its internal cash generation. This may prove detrimental to its growth plans.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderComstock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Suncor Energy Inc.

The estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 273.1%.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $4.70 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), higher than last quarter’s $4.11 per Mcf and the year-ago quarter’s $3.44 per Mcf. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas production for the fourth quarter has declined to 2,793 million cubic feet per day (Mmcfd) from 2,918 Mmcfd in the last quarter and 3,863 Mmcfd in the year-ago quarter.The average sales price of natural gas liquids for the fourth quarter is estimated to be $30.20 per barrel, higher than last quarter’s reported price of $23.82 per barrel and $21.82 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. However, production is expected to fall to 94 thousand barrel per day (MBD) from third-quarter production of 95 MBD and the year-ago quarter’s production of 143 MBD.Average crude oil sales price is expected to be $55 per barrel, higher than third quarter’s $49.39 per barrel and the year-ago quarter’s price of $47.05. Moreover, production of crude oil per day for the fourth quarter is expected to rise to 604 MBD from previous quarter’s 420 MBD and the year-ago quarter’s 596 MBD.Though we expect average realized prices in the fourth quarter to increase for all the commodities, their production is expected to decrease, except crude oil output. The fall in production can be primarily attributed to the company’s asset sales in 2017. These divestures include the sale of mining operations in Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands and Western Canada’s Deep Basin gas assets. The company also closed the divesture deals of San Juan asset and Barnett asset in the third quarter of 2017. Hence, it is difficult to conclusively predict the net impact on fourth-quarter results.Q4 Price PerformanceConocoPhillips gained 9.6% in the fourth quarter compared with 9.4% growth of its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ConocoPhillipsis likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -10.30%. While the Most Accurate estimate stands at 40 cents, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 45 cents.Zacks Rank: ConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #2,which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Houston, TX -based Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is an independent energy company. Its Earnings ESP is +15.15% and the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1.Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) is a Calgary, Canada based integrated energy company. Its Earnings ESP is +12.44% and it carries a Zacks Rank #1.Irving, TX-based Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.85% and it sports a Zacks Rank #1.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

634,COG,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 947 in the week ended Jan 26 — higher than the prior week’s 936. This marked an increase in rig count after the tally fell for the week ended Jan 19.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 712.  For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations – the tally rose from 916 to 929. The tally for inland waters was 1, in line with the count for the week ended Jan 19. However, the number of offshore rigs were 17, lower than 19.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 759 jumped from 747 recorded for the week ended Jan 19. This marked an increase after the domestic plays witnessed the removal of five rigs through the week ended Jan 19.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 566.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 188 was down from 189 for the week ended Jan 19.However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 145. Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.3%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units jumped from 57 for the week ended Jan 19. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 881.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 17 units — 15 of which were oil-directed — down from 19 for the week ended Jan 19.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil surged, while the count for natural gas decreased. Overall, the total tally of rigs in the United States jumped, courtesy of the addition of 18 oil rigs in the Permian basin. In the basin, the number of oil rigs has been rising for four weeks in a row. Four rigs were added in the Marcellus shale play.              Crude is trading above the $65-per-barrel psychological mark, which might lead to ramped up activities by oil drillers in domestic shale plays. Energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report). Cabot sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while EOG Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year earnings growth of more than 352.4% in 2017.Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources is also an upstream energy player. The company is likely to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 159% in 2017.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

635,COG,"We issued an updated research report on Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) on Jan 25.Schlumberger recently reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results. Earnings of 48 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-ago figure of 27 cents. Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong results.Banking on the bullishness, Schlumberger — the largest oilfield services player in the world, with presence in the world’s prospective energy market — issued a positive outlook for 2018. The company, which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services, believes that the positive oil market sentiment will drive investments by upstream operators in North America shale plays. It is to be noted that the partial recovery in crude price has favored explorers like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) and Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report).Increased investment in shale operations in North America might result in higher demand for Schlumberger’s oilfield services. Meanwhile, the international market is expected to witness 5% higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline.We appreciate the company’s increased reliance on lucrative international markets. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfield projects, Schlumberger is better positioned than most peers to take up offshore projects in the shallow water basins outside North America.However, Schlumberger has lesser exposure to U.S. shale plays — where more drillers have gathered following a partial recovery in crude prices. This is reflected in the fact that during the third and fourth quarter of 2017, the company generated 33% and 34% of revenues from North America. Thus, the low exposure deprives Schlumberger of profitable contracts from shale drillers.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

636,COG,"Extreme cold hit much of the U.S. in recent weeks, causing heating bills to skyrocket. When this happens, companies in the natural gas business often benefit, as natural gas accounts for the highest percentage of electricity generation in the U.S.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas accounted for 34% of U.S. electricity generation in 2016, ahead of coal, nuclear, and renewables. Therefore, as many Americans crank up their heat to combat the bitter temperatures, companies in the natural gas industry stand to make more money.For investors that think natural gas is simply a seasonal investment, that is not necessarily the case. The EIA expects natural gas consumption to climb in 2018 and 2019. On top of that, as coal plants slowly fade away, our reliance on natural gas is likely to increase.With that said, let’s take a look at three companies that run U.S. natural gas businesses that stand to benefit, not only from the cold, but also from the continued importance of natural gas.1.      Marathon (MPC  -  Free Report)The second-largest U.S. refiner based on crude oil refining capacity is also heavily invested in natural gas after its $15.6 billion acquisition of MarkWest in 2015, and now operates natural gas gathering systems in six states. Marathon is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an “A” VGM grade, supported by “A” grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system.Most of the harsh winter won’t be reflected in the company’s upcoming Q4 results. However, looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018, Marathon is projected to see its earnings climb by 983% to hit $0.65 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of that, the company’s sales are expected to surge from $16.39 billion in the year-ago period to $21.23 billion.Looking even further down the road, Marathon is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 14.24% over the next three to five years, driven in part by the continued growth of natural gas.2.       Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) This Houston-based company is engaged in the development, exploitation, and exploration of oil and gas exclusively in the continental U.S. Cabot produces and also buys natural gas for resale throughout the U.S. Therefore, Cabot stands to benefit greatly from increased natural gas consumption in the U.S. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), boasting “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum.Cabot is projected to see its sales jump by over 37% in Q4, while its bottom-line is projected to expand by 1,200%. The brutal weather is somewhat reflected in these growth projections. But investors should also be very happy to note that Cabot is expected to expand its EPS figures at a annualized rate of 30% over the next three to five years, as the use of natural gas goes up in the U.S.3.       BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report)BHP, which operates throughout the world, is diversified across an array of minerals, as well as conventional and unconventional oil and gas operations. The firm’s U.S. operations include major natural gas production.BHP is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports “B” grades for both Value and Momentum. Looking ahead to its current full-year, which BHP is slated to report in late June, the company is projected to see its sales soar 43% year-over-year to hit $44.23 billion. As far as bottom-line expansion goes, BHP is expected to see its EPS figures pop by nearly 21%.What’s more, the company’s current cash flow growth rate of 46% crushes its industry’s average and should theoretically help the firm invest in new operations in order to follow the money and production demand—which in the U.S., at least, points to natural gas.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

637,COG,"Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. (PTEN  -  Free Report) shares declined more than 2% in the wake of an explosion in a well in Quinton, OK, owned by Red Mountain Energy. The tragedy, one of the deadliest oil and gas related accidents in the last few years, occurred at one of Patterson-UTI's APEX 1500 rigs. The rig had operated for 10 days and dug 13,500 feet when the accident took place. Notably, the company has 25 drilling rigs online in the state.Although the reason for the explosion is still not clear, gas from the well may have been a factor. Out of the 22 workers at the site, 16 managed to escape while five went missing. Their bodies were found in an adjacent building, one day after the explosion took place. Three of them were working for Patterson-UTI.Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) well control and prevention service providing unit, Boots & Coots was summoned to extinguish the fire at this eastern Oklahoma site.Currently, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board and Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States are investigating the disaster. The public utilities commission of the state, Oklahoma Corporation Commission, is also examining the incident.About the CompanyPatterson-UTI is one of the largest onshore contract drillers in the United States. Its focus areas are located in continental United States and western Canada. The company also provides pressure pumping services - an umbrella term used to describe a number of vital services performed on new and existing wells. Patterson-UTI is based in Houston, TX.The strategic acquisition of MS Energy and Seventy Seven has not only bolstered Patterson-UTI's scale and customer base but also provided an impetus to the company’s earnings and revenues. However, we remain concerned about Patterson-UTI's lowering rig margins and increasing costs.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPatterson-UTI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report).  Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

638,COG,"Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) is likely to face tighter emissions barriers at its Wheatstone LNG project, located in Western Australia, depending on the latest environmental inspection by the state government.The government approached the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), which will conduct an investigation to check if the company is faring well in terms of environment responsibility, since it witnessed a waiver of the Clean Energy Act in 2012. Before Chevron received the waiver, the project was given the carbon dioxide emissions' offset limit of 2.6 million tons per year. Following the repeal of the clean energy act in 2012, the EPA is expected to probe the emission in the Wheatstone project and find out whether it is within the permissible limits. Then the environmental regulatory body will provide the government with a report, slated to cover advice and instructions in case the project needs an environmental practice upgrade.Although the company believes that it has met all the requirements so far, a negative report can affect the company's operations. Following the initial Wheatstone project approval, the company had committed to an A$13 million environmental offsets package. It has 64.1% operating interests in the $34 billion Wheatstone Project. Overall, the company has 80.2% interest in the offshore licenses containing the Wheatstone and Iago fields.About the CompanySan Ramon, CA-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas entities in the world as per proved reserves. It is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing of petroleum products plus manufacturing of chemicals and other energy-related businesses. The company divides its operations into two main segments: Upstream and Downstream.Owing to Chevron's focus on well planning and execution, the company continues to reduce its operating costs with underlying expenses, down almost 5% year to date compared with the figures recorded in 2016. Cash capital expenditures for the first nine months of the year also declined 30%. However, we remain worried about the headwinds looming large on Chevron's U.S. production. The company's exposure to production in the vulnerable and violence-prone regions in Nigeria poses an additional risk.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderChevron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

639,COG,"SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) lost roughly 5% after Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina, requested for a bill that will disallow the company from charging customers for the pair of failed reactors at its V.C. Summer nuclear plant.A report from Office of Regulatory Staff claimed it is unlikely that SCANA will face bankruptcy if the ratepayers are not charged. This prompted McMaster to write to the lawmakers.  However, SCANA did not hold the same opinion about the report.When the markets thought that the proposed accord between SCANA and Dominion Energy, Inc. (D  -  Free Report) might be hurt by the letter from the Governor, media reports confirmed that the deal is still on the table.Recently, electric utility SCANA signed a merger accord with larger peer Dominion Energy. Per the accord, each stock holder of SCANA will likely get 0.669 shares of Dominion. Considering the assumption of $6.7-billion debt of SCANA by Dominion, the transaction is worth roughly $14.6 billion. SCANA and Dominion expect the all-stock transaction to close this year, which awaits regulatory approvals.SCANA lost 45.7% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s 6.5% gain. The underperformance was led by the company’s decision to conclude construction works of units 2 and 3 at the VC Summer Nuclear Station.SCANA was forced to discontinue the project after the builder of the plants, Westinghouse Electric Co, went bankrupt. SCANA also filed for withdrawing operating licenses of the units as a series of delays and mounting costs became a concern for the company.However, the recent merger agreement has pleased customers. This is because upon deal closure, Dominion is expected to make a payment of $1.3 billion to the customers of SCANA. Hence, on average, each client of SCANA will likely receive $1000.Scana Corporation Price Scana Corporation Price | Scana Corporation QuoteSCANA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

640,COG,"Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted operating loss of 2 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents.The outperformance was primarily driven by higher drilling activity at its biggest segment – U.S. Land. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago adjusted loss of 41 cents.Revenues of $564.1 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $538 million. Further the top line witnessed an increase of more than 53% from the year-ago number of $368.6 million. Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Quote Segment PerformanceU.S. Land: During the quarter, operating revenues totaled $461.6 million (81.8% of total revenues), up 75.1% year over year. While average rig revenue per operating day was $22,400 — 10.7% below the year-ago period — average rig margin per day was down 7.6% to $8,854. However, utilization levels of 57% in the quarter under review (versus 31% in first-quarter fiscal 2017) resulted in an operating income of 24.7 million at the segment marking a turn around from the year-ago loss of $30.9 million.Offshore: Helmerich & Payne’s Offshore revenues came in at $33.4 million compared with $33.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Daily average rig revenue rose 14.2% to $35,776 and average rig margin per day rose 18.1% to $12,375. Owing to this, the segment’s operating income increased 28.6% to $8.7 million. However, rig utilization came down from the year-ago level of 78% to 63%.International Land: Helmerich & Payne’s International Land operations generated revenues of $63.2 million, down slightly from $68 million in the previous-year quarter. Average daily rig revenue was $38,039, down 32% from the corresponding period of last year and rig margin per day was $11,351, down from the year-ago figure of $12,969.However, average rig expense per day decreased 38%, while activity levels increased to 45% from 33% a year ago.

As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $383.7 million in cash, while long-term debt stood at $493.2 million (debt-to-capitalization ratio of 9.7%).GuidanceThe Tulsa, OK-based company expects activity in the U.S. land segment to rise by 3-4% sequentially during the second fiscal quarter of 2018. While the average rig revenue per day is likely to be flat compared with the first fiscal quarter, daily average rig cost is expected to be roughly $13,900 during next quarter.As for the offshore segment, Helmerich & Payne sees the average rig margin per day to be around $11,500 during second-quarter fiscal 2018 and revenue days to fall 2% sequentially.The international land segment will likely suffer a 4% decrease in revenue days during the next quarter, while average rig margin per day is expected to average roughly $8,000.For fiscal 2018, Helmerich & Payne projects a capital budget of $350 million.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHelmerich & Payne currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Meanwhile, one can look at some better-ranked energy players like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources, Inc.

641,COG,"Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) has provided a glimpse of its 2018 capital budget, having stipulated a sum of $941 million for the year. The upstream energy player has also announced details of its proved reserves.Capital Budget for 2018 Although the expected capital spending for 2018 is less than the company’s 2017 expenditure of roughly $1.27 billion, yet this year’s spend will be lower than the projected cashflow for 2018 considering the present strip prices. Notably, the 2018 capital budget will likely reward Range Resources with 11% production growth from the year-ago period.  Investors should know that for operations in the natural gas-rich Marcellus shale play, Range Resources has decided to allocate roughly 80% of its 2018 budget. For supporting the spending plan, the firm has further strengthened its hedge position. At an average price of $3.09, the company’s 70% of anticipated natural gas production for 2018 has been hedged. The company added that if any additional cashflow got realized this year, out of higher commodity prices realizations or non-core asset divestments, will be allocated for reducing debt load.Better-Than-Expected 2017 Spending: Range Resources announced that its 2017 actual capital spending was 10% higher than $1.15 billion of spending earlier planned. Higher capital spent on Marcellus program as well as expansion projects in North Louisiana attributed to better-than-expected spending.  Future ProjectionOver a period of five years, Range Resources has been expecting a compound annual growth rate of production at roughly 13%. Also, the cumulative free cash flow over the same time span will likely be recorded at $1 billion, considering strip pricing.The company also anticipates its debt structure to improve. Excluding its divestment of assets, Range Resources projects its debt-to-EBITDAX ratio below 2x.Higher Proved ReservesAs of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s proved reserves came in at 15.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), higher by 26%.The firm also estimates its fourth-quarter 2017 production at 2.17 Bcfe (billion cubic feet equivalent) per day, in line with its expectations.About the CompanyHeadquartered in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources is primarily involved in exploring prospective resources for natural gas and crude.The company’s pricing chart is not impressive. The stock has lost more than 50% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s10.1% decline.Range Resources Corporation Price Range Resources Corporation Price | Range Resources Corporation Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderRange Resources carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

642,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Larger-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Jun 29, above the consensus market guidance of 76 Bcf gain.Moreover, the injection was higher than both the 5-year (2013–2017) average addition of 70 Bcf for the reported week and last year’s build of 62 Bcf.Following the storage report, natural gas prices lost around 2.3% last week to settle at $2.858 per MMBtu on Friday.Despite last week’s larger-than-normal build, at 2.152 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), natural gas inventories are 493 Bcf (18.6%) under the five-year average and 717 Bcf (25%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 86.7 Bcf per day, up by 0.7% on a weekly basis due to increase in production. Meanwhile, daily consumption rose 1.2% to 75.1 Bcf on increase in demand triggered by higher natural gas usage for residential and commercial cooling requirements.Positive Long-Term ThesisNotwithstanding the temporary blips, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow 43% from 2015 to 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.Booming ExportsAnd it is the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which has emerged as one of the key players – competing with Russia and Australia among others – to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at attractive enough prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.New pipelines to Mexico, together with large-scale liquefied gas export facilities like Cheniere Energy, Inc.’s Sabine Pass terminal and Dominion Energy Inc.’s (D  -  Free Report) newly constructed Cove Point export plant, have meant that exports out of the U.S. are set for a quantum leap.As per the Energy Department, gross liquefied natural gas exports are set to average 3 Bcf per day in 2018, increasing nearly 60% from last year. Apart from surging exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report), Gulfport Energy Corporation (GPOR  -  Free Report) and Comstock Resources, Inc.

643,COG,"The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) recently urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to extend the timeline of its long-delayed Constitution pipeline, per Reuters. The project was approved by the regulatory board in December 2014 but the construction process has been facing resistance from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) since April 2016.The pipeline runs from Pennsylvania to New York and can addresses natural gas demand in more than 3 billion homes. The pipeline’s construction faced a blow from the New York environmental regulators who turned down the company’s request for a water quality permit, due to which Williams wants to push the timeline to December 2020. The company has already challenged the environmental regulators’ denial, which awaits another ruling from the FERC.Originally, the pipeline was scheduled to come online in December 2016. Following the water permit denial, the regulatory board agreed to push the date to December 2018. As the permit is yet to come, the company does not expect the project to be finished within the given time. Williams has already withdrawn and resubmitted the pipeline’s application twice so far. After receiving the required permits, the company expects to take around 10 months to a year for the completion of the project.The 125-mile pipeline (201 kilometers) is designed to ship 0.65 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas extracted from the U.S. shales. Apart from providing clean energy, the pipeline is also expected to generate many jobs for the localities. With the project being delayed, the cost is increasing, which is a high concern for the company. In 2013, the cost of the project was estimated at around $683 million, which has now gone up to about $875 million.Apart from Williams, energy companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings, Inc.  also own stakes in the pipeline.Price Performance and Zacks RankTulsa, OK-based Williams has lost 6.8% in the past year compared with 10.9% fall of the industry it belongs to.

645,COG,"On Jan 24, Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently seen upward revision in estimates tend to outperform the market over the next nine to 12 months.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised higher from $2.10 to $2.15. Also, for 2018, estimates were raised from $2.44 to $2.82.Newfield has an impressive earnings surprise history. The upstream player managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 18.6%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings improvement of 110.8% in 2017 and 31.4% in 2018.The business scenario looks profitable as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil is trading above the $60-per-barrel psychological mark, way higher than the historical low touched in February 2016. Also, natural gas crossed the mark of $3 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU). Overall, the favorable commodity pricing scenario could fetch the exploration and production company attractive cashflow.    The healthy commodity prices are especially favorable for Newfield as the company has a premium inventory of drilling wells in prospective oil and gas resources. In the liquid-rich Anadarko Basin, the upstream energy player has 350,000 net acres.Newfield has no current debt and its long-term debt has declined steeply since 2014.

This revised distribution is likely to be paid on Feb 14, 2018, to unitholders of record on Feb 6, 2018.Should You Take Advantage of the Hike?The proposed hike in distribution at Magellan Midstream is in sync with its goal of raising the annual distribution by 8% in 2017 and 2018. The partnership has a proven history of distribution growth with 63 quarterly increases since inception. For the last five years, Magellan Midstream has maintained a steep trend for its distribution hike per unit. The recent move will help it to boost shareholder value. Although the partnership is facing some uncertainty currently with the FERC approval for its marketing arm, the distribution hike will help it to retain unitholders’ confidence. Moreover, Magellan Midstream generates much higher returns than other industryplayers. The partnership’s return on equity (ROE) is 41% compared with the industry’s 8.7%.

648,COG,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Jan 19 — lower than the prior week’s 939. This marked a decrease in rig count for three times in the last four weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 694.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 916, lower than 919. The tally for offshore and inland waters were 19 and 1, in line with the respective counts for the week ended Jan 12. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 slipped from 752 recorded for the week ended Jan 12. This marked a decline after the domestic plays witnessed the addition of 10 rigs through the week ended on Jan 12.However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 551.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 187 for the week ended Jan 12. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 142.   Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units fell from the count of 62 for the week ended Jan 12. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 879.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Jan 12.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil decreased while the count for natural gas increased. Overall, the total tally of rigs in the United States declined, thanks to the removal of the respective four and three rigs from the Utica and Eagle Ford shale plays. In the Utica resources, natural gas rig count fell from 27 to 24, while the tally for oil rig was zero against 1 in the week ended Jan 12. At the Eagle Ford shale, the count of rigs exploring crude fell from 62 to 58.On top of that, two rigs were removed from each of DJ-Niobrara basin, Cana Woodford shale and Barnett shale play.Although the count of oil rigs fell, there has been plenty of room for crude explorers to ramp up drilling, given that the commodity has been trading above the $60-per-barrel mark.  Energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc.

649,COG,"British energy giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government of Iraq regarding production capacity increase in the northern Kirkuk oilfields, one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East.Per the MoU, BP will be able to boost production by more than twice the existing capacity at Kirkuk to 750,000 barrels per day (bpd). To study and develop the oilfields, BP will conduct seismic survey operations in the area. The company estimates 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the region.We would like to remind investors that BP had projected asset sale worth $4.5-$5.5 billion for 2017. This obviously raised concerns with respect to the company’s production in the coming years. The deal with the Iraqi government is expected to benefit its overseas portfolio.We note that Iraq is the second largest producing member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Although the country's production capacity has almost reached 5 million bpd, it is producing 4.4 million bpd as part of an output cut agreement with fellow oil exporters in an attempt to clear a supply glut.By the end of January, the Iraqi government wants to ship crudes from the Kirkuk fields to Iran in trucks. The move is expected to restore output-export capacity of the country.BackgroundIn 1927, BP and France’s TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) found oil in the Kirkuk region. However, years of conflict and under-investment took a toll on the giant prospect.In 2013, BP and the government of Iraq inked a deal to stop the decline in Kirkuk's crude production.  BP provided the Iraqi state-run North Oil Company, which was operating in the region, technical assistance.A year later, Kirkuk was taken over by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government when the government was fighting to resist the advances of Islamic State militants. This was followed by an Iraqi military operation that stalled the export of oil from the fields to Turkey.Iraq Gets Back the FieldIraqi forces reclaimed the prolific oilfields in October 2017 from Kurdish fighters, which helped BP to sign the papers with the state-run company at the Kirkuk office. The Iraqi government and BP were in talks within days of recovering the oilfields from the Kurdish fighters.  At $59.3 per barrel, the country received $6.5 billion selling crudes in 2017.Price PerformanceBP has gained 16.3% in the last year compared with 14.7% growth of its industry.  About BP London-based BP is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. Currently, the company reports mainly through four segments – Upstream, Downstream, Rosneft and Other Businesses and Corporate.The firm has a portfolio of major upstream projects like Clair Ridge, Juniper and Mad Dog Phase 2 developments that are expected to fetch significant cash flows. The company anticipates the projects to add 800 Mboe/d to net production capacity by 2020, once they are online. It is to be noted that 90% of these upstream developments are either under construction or are completed.However, the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP-operated Macondo Prospect is still affecting the company. BP expects to incur additional after-tax charges of $1.7 billion related to the oil spill incident during fourth-quarter 2017. Also, in 2018, the company anticipates cash out flow related to the incident to be $3 billion against the prior projection of slightly more than $2 billion.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderBP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

651,COG,"Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has accomplished a record for its average oil production in Brazil for four years in a row. The state-run company produced 2.15 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in 2017.The production is 0.4% higher than 2016's volumes. Moreover, Petrobras met its projected output for three consecutive years, which increases the reliability of the company's projections. Its natural gas production in 2017 reached 79.6 million cubic meters per day mark. It helped the company's total production in Brazil to attain 2.65 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) level, 0.9% above 2016 levels.In the pre-salt layer, average annual production - including the company's partners' portions - was 1.29 million bpd, representing a 26% year-over-year increase. Per the company, increased production in the Santos Basin’s Lapa and Lula fields has driven the results. In addition, initiation of production at the FPSO Pioneiro de Libra in the Santos Basin’s pre-salt layer boosted the company's output.Production outside Brazil took a hit from divestments like the sale of Petrobras Argentina, which was targeted toward reducing the huge debt burden (more than $100 billion) of the company. Average international oil production in 2017 was recorded at 64,000 bpd, 20% lower than 2016. At 8.3 million cubic meters per day mark, average natural gas output was down 39% year over year.In December 2017 alone, oil equivalent production was 2.72 million Boe/d. Of this, 2.62 million Boe/d was generated in Brazil while 100,000 Boe/d was produced overseas.Price PerformanceThe company has gained 8.5% in the last year compared with 14.7% growth of its industry.About the CompanyHeadquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Petrobras is one of the largest integrated energy firms in Latin America. The company’s activities include exploration, exploitation and production of oil from reservoir wells, shale and other rocks as well as refining, processing, trading and transportation of oil and oil products, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons, besides other energy-related activities.  It mainly operates through six segments — Exploration and Production, Refining, Transportation and Marketing, Distribution, Gas and Power, and Biofuels and International.Petrobras recently released its five-year Business Management Plan with focus on production ramp-up and debt reduction.  The company targets net debt/EBITDA of 2.5 in 2018, as against 5.3 in 2015. Furthermore, Petrobras has plans to reduce its operating expenses to $136.8 billion from $153 billion projected in the five-year plan earlier.

652,COG,"Moving forward with its $30-billion divestment goal, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to offload West Qurna 1 oil field in Iraq to Japan's Itochu Corporation. However, the value of the transaction has been kept under wraps. The company also intends to close the divestment of its interest in the Majnoon oil field in Iraq to the state-run Basra Oil Company by June 2018. Production in the Majnoon oil field started in 2014, with average capacity of 210,000 barrels per day.It is to be noted, Shell has a 45% operating stake in the Majnoon oil field. Malaysian national petroleum company, Petronas and Iraq’s Missan Oil Company have 30% and 25% stakes in the field, respectively.The primary reason behind Shell leaving Majnoon is that the oil department of the country and the company could not agree on the future production plans and investments for the field.The divestment is in line with Shell's strategy to steer clear of debt stemming from its $50-billion acquisition of BG Group. The move will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.Notably, the company has already vended more than $23-billion assets as part of $30-billion 2016-2018 divestment plan. Additionally, Shell intends to divest more than $10 billion worth of assets in the 2019-2020 time period. We remind investors that as of Sep 30, 2017, Shell had around $80-billion long-term debt.  Its debt-to-capital ratio was 25.4%, which the company intends to reduce to 20% with the help of its divestment programs and operational efficiency.Headquartered in Netherlands, Shell is one of the largest integrated energy companies engaged in production, refining, distribution and marketing of oil and natural gas.

653,COG,"Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report), through its subsidiary Cheniere Marketing, LLC, recently inked a deal with a commodity trading company, Trafigura Pte Ltd, spanning 15 years.Per the deal, Cheniere Energy will provide Trafigura around 1 million tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") without shipment charges, starting in 2019. Trafigura’s payment to Cheniere Energy will be based on the monthly Henry Hub price, plus a premium.This long-term deal is crucial for this natural gas exporter and is expected to help Cheniere Energy with its development plans. The company is still at the expansion stage, which means high capital spending and cash outflow in the foreseeable future. As Cheniere Energy looks to conclude building its units at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, the company is saddled with a substantial burden on its leverage and credit metrics. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had a debt of $25 billion with a debt to capitalization ratio of 95.99%, much higher than the industry's 49.43%. About Cheniere EnergyHouston, TX-based Cheniere Energy is primarily engaged in businesses related to liquefied natural gas through its two business segments: LNG terminal, and LNG and natural gas marketing. The company was founded in 1983.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCheniere Energy carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Cheniere Energy's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. The company’s ROE of -57.4% compares unfavorably with 1.49% for the broader industry, reflecting the fact that it is less efficient in using shareholder funds compared to its peers.Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources Inc.

654,COG,"Pipeline operator, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its compression units, CDM Resource Management and CDM Environmental & Technical Services LLC, to natural gas compression services provider, USA Compression Partners, LP (USAC  -  Free Report) for about $1.8 billion.Transaction DetailsPer the deal, USA Compression will pay $1.225 billion in cash along with 19.2 million of its common units and 6.4 million of its Class B units to Energy Transfer Partners. However, there won’t be any quarterly distributions for the Class B units in the first year following the closure of the transaction, which is expected by the first half of 2018.Moreover, the deal will enable Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (ETE  -  Free Report), the parent organization of Energy Transfer Partners, to obtain all equity interests in USA Compression Partners GP, the parent firm of USA Compression. Additionally, Energy Transfer Equity will receive around 12.5 million USA Compression common units for $250 million in cash. The present skilled workers of the divested units are expected to join the acquirer.Benefits for Energy TransferThe deal is expected to strengthen Energy Transfer Partners' balance sheet by lowering its debt burden. As of Sep 30, 2017, the partnership had long-term debt (less current maturities) of $33,630 million. Debt-to-capitalization ratio was about 52.2%. Apart from reducing the debt load, the cash proceeds of $1.225 billion can also be used for funding new projects. The move also reduces the chance of the partnership slashing its distribution – currently yielding an attractive 11.3% – in the coming quarters.What’s in Store for USA Compression?The deal will significantly enhance USA Compression’s access to the U.S. major basins, especially in Eagle Ford Shale, the Gulf Coast and the Rockies. The divested assets will bring 1.6 million horsepower, thereby increasing USA Compression’s horsepower to 3.4 million. Analysts at Simmons & Co. International believe that compression pricing will increase at a fast pace this year, which will benefit USA Compression in the coming quarters.About Energy Transfer PartnersDallas, TX-based Energy Transfer Partners is a master limited partnership (“MLP”) engaged primarily in the gathering, processing, storage and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) through a vast network of pipelines. The partnership has its operations in all the major U.S. production basins.Energy Transfer Partners has been consistently returning value to its unitholders through distributions, making it attractive for those looking for a steady source of income. The partnership reported a 40.2% year-over-year increase in distributable cash flow in the third quarter of 2017. Further, various key projects like Bakken Pipeline, Rover Pipeline and Permian Express 3 pipeline continue to drive growth.However, we are concerned about Energy Transfer Partners' high leverage compared to most of its peers, which provides it with little financial flexibility. Moreover, total costs escalated in the third quarter, which put further pressure on the company's liquidity and financials.We note that Energy Transfer Partners has lost 18.7% in the last year compared with 11.1% decline of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderEnergy Transfer Partners carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the oil and energy sector is Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

655,COG,"Upstream company Premier Oil plc (PMOIY  -  Free Report) recently provided an operational update. The company stated that its 2017 production came in line with the guidance of 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). It increased 5% year over year from 71,400 BOE/d.2017 ExpectationsTotal revenues for 2017 are expected to be around $1.1 billion, higher than $983 million in 2016 on the back of increased output and realized commodity prices.Moreover, capital expenditure of $305 million was lower than its revised capital expenditure guidance of $325 million. Premier Oil generated enough positive free cash flow this year, which helped it to reduce net debt to $2.7 billion from $2.8 billion in 2016.The company faced an obstacle in reaching its production target when its North Sea’s Forties pipeline system was shut down in December to fix a crack in the pipe. Although production was cut by 10,000 BOE/d due to the outage, the company managed to reach the lower end of its target range of 75,000-80,000 BOE/d. The new successful Catcher project came to its rescue with production of 20,000 BOE/d since Dec 23, 2017. It is one of North Sea’s most important new offshore projects, where the company plans to increase production to 60,000 BOE/d within the first six months of 2018. It is expected to accelerate the debt reduction process of the company.2018 GuidancePremier Oil expects 2018 output to be around 80,000-85,000 BOE/d. The year-over-year rise is expected to reflect increased production from the Catcher project. Capital expenditure in development and exploration for the year is expected to be about $300 million including $170 million for Catcher development.

656,COG,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 19, before the opening bell.  Last quarter, the company’s earnings of 42 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4.17% for the last four quarters.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects growth of about almost 63% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,116 million for the quarter, up 14.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.Improvement in crude price will likely be favorable for Schlumberger as oilfield service businesses are positively correlated with crude price. This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for each of the company’s business segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Reservoir Characterization segment’s earnings-before-tax stands at $318 million, higher than $316 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Moreover, for the Drilling unit, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $307 million, up from $234 million in the prior-year quarter.The balance sheet looks solid as Schlumberger’s total current assets of $19.9 billion — as of Sep 30, 2017 — is higher than $13 billion of current liabilities. The long-term debt level is slightly discouraging as $15.9 billion is higher than $10.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2014.  Q4 Price PerformanceIn the fourth quarter, shares of Schlumberger underperformed the industry. The stock lost 3.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.8%.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.01%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 43 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 44 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Meanwhile, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Schlumberger, here are a few firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) primarily explores oil and gas and hence is an upstream energy player. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.45% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: Biggest Ever DrawStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by Bcf for the week ended Jan 5, the largest on record and comfortably above the guidance (of 337 Bcf decline) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider. Considerably colder-than-normal weather across vast swaths of the United States’ heavily populated regions led to soaring demand and was responsible for the huge pull from storage.Moreover, the decrease was more than twice the last year’s drop of 136 Bcf and the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 169 Bcf for the reported week. Following past week’s massive decline – eighth withdrawal of the 2017-2018 winter heating season – the current storage level now stands at 2.767 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 382 Bcf (12.1%) under the five-year average and 415 Bcf (5.3%) below the year-ago figure. In fact, stockpiles are now at their lowest level for the concerned week since 2008.Following EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices jumped around 15% last week to settle at $3.20 per MMBtu on Friday -- the highest since the first half of November. Apart from the higher-than-anticipated draw, investors were also betting on the continuation of the frigid cold snap going into the end of January, leading to the heating fuel’s healthy demand.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy (WPX  -  Free Report), Antero Resources Corporation (AR  -  Free Report) and EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report).Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are looking for a near term natural gas play, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

659,COG,"Pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is planning to restart operations at its Garden Banks gas pipeline in early February. The 1 billion cubic foot per day (Bcf/d) pipeline will begin operations for some producers.The pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico was shut down following a fire outbreak on Nov 8, 2017.  The incident resulted in stalling of operations on most of the platforms in the region, including Enchilada and Salsa platforms, operated by Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and the Baldpate and Conger filed platforms, operated by Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report). Enbridge is separating its pipeline from the damaged platform Enchilada and expects to finish the task by the coming month. Production at the site was disrupted due to the unavailability of pipeline. Both Shell and Hess are yet to provide dates for restarting operations at the site.The Garden Banks pipeline connects Garden Banks block 128 to South Marsh Island block 76 and then interconnects with four existing interstate pipelines, from where it transports gas onshore.Per the forecasts of the Energy Information Administration, oil production level in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be flat in 2018 year over year. From 2019 onward, production in the region is expected to rise as seven new projects will come online.About Enbridge Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta in Canada, Enbridge is a leading energy infrastructure company. One of its businesses is the transportation of energy through the most extensive and advanced crude and liquids pipeline system that spreads across 17,511 miles globally. Through the Mainline and Express pipelines, the company transports 2.8 million barrels of crude every day, which accounts for almost 68% of the Canadian crude oil production that is transported to the United States.We appreciate Enbridge raising its quarterly dividend every year. The new dividend of 67.1 Canadian cents represents a sequential increase of 10%, will likely be paid on Mar 1, 2018, to stockholders of record as of Feb 15, 2018.However, in the recent times, the company’s debt load has increased significantly. Importantly, during the first nine months of 2017, long-term debt rose more than 77% while cash balance declined 59%, reflecting weak financials.In addition, Enbridge has lost 8.2% in the last year against 1.5% gain of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnbridge Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the oil and energy sector is Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

660,COG,"Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to post fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 17.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.1%. Moreover, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.8% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. It reflects growth of about 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,324 million for the impending quarter, down 0.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States, which are rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 91% of its 2017 cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties. The revenues from midstream properties will be reflected in the quarterly results.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of third-quarter 2017, total debt — short and long term — is pegged at $38.3 billion. Debt capital is higher than total equity capital of $36.5 billion which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. If debt continues to grow, the company may face liquidity issues.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion faces threats. Being a part of the legal dispute, the successful appeal is expected to nullify the federal sanction for the C$7.4-billion or $5.9-billion Trans Mountain project and result in long postponement. This will be a major drawback for the company.Price Performance in Q4During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 5.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 3%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -1.16%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Conversely, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Kinder Morgan, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

661,COG,"The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) refused to rescind New York’s denial of a water permit to the project. The ruling has come as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.Williams Companies applied for the water permit in August 2013. However, the company withdrew and resubmitted the application twice, which led to the resetting of the one-year deadline by New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In 2016, the DEC announced its decision not to grant the water permit to Williams Companies.Interestingly, the project had received FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied issuing a water quality permit to the pipeline claiming that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project adequately and the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.The pipeline company filed a petition in October 2017 requesting the FERC to repeal DEC’s decision. The company claimed that New York DEC failed to act on the application within the stipulated time frame. The petition filed by the company stated, “The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed one year, after receipt of such request, the certification requirements shall be waived.”However, the FERC maintained that DEC acted within the necessary time frame, given the constant withdrawal of applications by the company which had deferred the decision.Notably, FERC had revoked New York Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) denial of water quality certification to Millennium Pipeline in September 2017. Williams Companies had been hoping for a similar outcome for Constitution Pipeline, however FERC’s latest verdict crushed the hopes of the company to make its pipeline come online by 2019. Nevertheless, the company is planning to seek a rehearing.Notably, the project has also drawn severe censure from various activists and environmental groups as they are of the opinion that the project will have implications on public health and environment.Constitution Pipeline project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) , WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The $750-million project runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County and has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas each day.Oklahoma-based Williams Companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

662,COG,"Oil prices are heading southward on global supply glut. OPEC countries are planning to raise production levels shortly that could disrupt the supply-demand balance. In fact, concerns about increased output amplified due to Chinese tariffs on energy imports from the United States.Fall in oil prices are a dampener for energy stocks. But why are energy sector insiders buying again? That is because there are several underlying factors that are expected to push oil prices upward in the near term.Before we look at the factors and stocks that insiders are buying, let’s look at what is dragging oil prices down for the time being.OPEC and its Allies Agree to Boost OutputOPEC and its allies including Russia had decided to hold back output by nearly 1.8 million barrels a day beginning in 2017. That agreement is, however, set to expire by the end of this year. In fact, major oil producers will meet on Jun 22 in Vienna to decide the fate of further oil production. Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the OPEC is considering a production boost of 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day. The Saudis have already raised output level last month by 100,000 barrels a day. Russia too is contemplating an increase of about 1.5 million barrels a day, as per commodity analysts led by Eugen Weinberg at Commerzbank.U.S. crude production, in the meantime, is forecast to touch an annual record of 10.79 million barrels a day this year, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Data from oil-field services firm Baker Hughes additionally revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil, better known as the gauge of domestic production activity, rose by 1 to 863 last week, leading to the fourth-straight weekly jump.This oil supply glut has weakened oil prices. The West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, declined by $1.83, or 2.8%, to settle at $65.06 a barrel on Jun 15, while the Brent crude, the global benchmark lost $2.50, or 3.4%, to reach $73.44 a barrel.Trade War Fears Intensify PressureBuilding on Jun 15’s slide, oil prices continue their downward journey, thanks to the trade war between the United States and China. The White House will impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion Chinese imports, which has increased the chances of a confrontation with China over trade. China has accused the United States for ratcheting a trade war. The Chinese government said that it will respond accordingly to U.S. tariffs.Energy-related products have been targeted as China prepares retaliatory tariffs against the United States. This means that China, the world's biggest importer of oil could shun U.S. items at a time when exports of crude, coal and liquefied natural gas to Asia have been steadily increasing (read more: Trade War Fears Grip Wall Street: Buy 5 Ultra-Safe Stocks).Insiders Are BuyingThe drop in oil prices is, no doubt, taking a toll on energy players. But insiders in energy companies have been purchasing a lot of shares. They believe that several underlying factors will drive oil prices in the near term.Supply-demand disparity does remain. But since a recession does not seem to be in the horizon, global demand growth will eventually scale north. Supply growth, on the other hand, could face constraints due to chronic underinvestment in long-term projects by major oil companies in the last three years.By the way, geopolitical risks remain elevated in places like Saudi Arabia, Israel, Iran, Libya and Nigeria to name a few. This in turn can anytime propel oil prices. And if Saudi Arabia’s intention to increase production level is bothersome, then one should remember that there is already a cap on how much it can produce since it is near its limit. Needless to say, global production will automatically tank as wells run dry.All these explain why insiders have bought over $12 million worth of stock at a dozen energy companies. Insider buying may not guarantee an uptick in oil prices, but, it does show that the energy stocks are oversold, ready to bounce back anytime soon.Let us, thus, have a look at three energy companies that are poised to do well from here and the ones that insiders are currently buying.Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) explores for, develops, and produces crude oil and natural gas properties in the north, south, and east regions of the United States.Insider purchase: $8.8 million by CEO Harold Hamm at $65.30 on May 29.In the last 60 days, seventeen earnings estimates moved north, while none moved south for the current year.

663,COG,"Natural gas prices gained after the U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-average increase in supplies.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: In-Line Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 92 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Jun 1, at par with the guidance as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Importantly, the sixth injection of the 2018 refill season was lower than both the 5-year (2013–2017) average addition of 104 Bcf for the reported week and last year’s build of 103 Bcf. At 1.817 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – natural gas inventories are 512 Bcf (22%) under the five-year average and 799 Bcf (30.5%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 85.3 Bcf per day, down by 1.5% on a weekly basis due to slight decrease in production and lower Canadian imports. Meanwhile, daily consumption rose 1.6% to 71.3 Bcf on stronger residential/commercial demand driven by cool temperatures in certain regions.The higher natural gas demand supported prices, which gained 1.2% to settle at $2.93 per MMBtu yesterday.Positive Long-Term ThesisThe fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040.

In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG  -  Free Report). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.New pipelines to Mexico, together with large-scale liquefied gas export facilities like Cheniere Energy, Inc.’s (LNG  -  Free Report) Sabine Pass terminal and Dominion Energy Inc.’s (D  -  Free Report) newly constructed Cove Point export plant, have meant that exports out of the U.S. are set for a quantum leap.In fact, as per the Energy Department, gross liquefied natural gas exports are set to average 2.92 Bcf per day in 2018, increasing more than 50% from last year. Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report) and Comstock Resources, Inc.

As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.New pipelines to Mexico, together with large-scale liquefied gas export facilities like Cheniere Energy, Inc.’s (LNG  -  Free Report) Sabine Pass terminal and Dominion Energy Inc.’s (D  -  Free Report) newly constructed Cove Point export plant, have meant that exports out of the U.S. are set for a quantum leap.In fact, as per the Energy Department, gross liquefied natural gas exports are set to average 2.92 Bcf per day in 2018, increasing more than 50% from last year. Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report) and WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report).Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are looking for a near term natural gas play, Eclipse Resources Corporation (ECR  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

665,COG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is COG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsCabot reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share — adjusted for special items — of 28 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with earnings of 19 cents in the year-earlier quarter. The result was favored by better than expected volumes and lower expenses.The company’s quarterly revenues of $473.2 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $463 million. However, the reported figure was below the prior-year quarter’s revenues of $517.8 million, primarily due to lower gas pricesVolume AnalysisIn the quarter under review, Cabot’s overall production totaled 169.6 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) — 97.1% gas — marginally lower than the prior-year quarter volume of 170.1 Bcfe. Natural gas output was 164.6 Bcf, slightly higher than 163.8 Bcf in the previous year. Liquids production came in at 829.1 thousand barrels (MBbl) lower than year-ago quarter’s 1,044.5 MBbl. Notably, production at all three categories surpassed the company’s first-quarter guidance.Net production from the company’s Marcellus Shale in the first quarter totaled at 1,822 million cubic feet (Mmcf) per day. At present, the company has three rigs and two completion crews operating in the prolific Marcellus Shale.Realized PricesThe average realized natural gas price fell to $2.44 from the year-ago quarter to $2.64 per thousand cubic feet.

666,COG,"UGI Corporation’s (UGI  -  Free Report) subsidiary, UGI Energy Services, LLC recently announced its intention to expand its Auburn Gathering System. The King Of Prussia, PA-based holding company provides midstream energy services through UGI Energy. The Auburn Gathering System is almost a $215 million project located in Pennsylvania. Currently, Auburn Gathering System runs across the Susquehanna, Wyoming, and Luzerne counties, and connects shippers to the interstate pipeline system.UGI Corporation, which distributes, stores, transports and markets energy products and related services, plans to build two new compressor stations that will expand the system’s capacity by 150,000 dekatherms per day. Following the completion of the project, the system will have a total capacity of 620,000 dekatherms per day. The company intends to build these stations in Susquehanna County and Wyoming County, and invest $50 million in the project. The deliveries from the project are anticipated to start this fall and the balance capacity will be available one year from then. The project is expected to support the growing demand for Marcellus gas. The expansion has a long-term commitment backing from the Houston, TX-based exploration and production company, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) that operates in the prolific Marcellus shale. The project will likely enable UGI Energy to transport Marcellus gas, including Cabot Oil & Gas’ products to several new regions.

667,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies. Despite the headline miss, the report pointed to a tightening market dynamic and boosted the fuel’s price, which added around 1.5% for the week.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Larger-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 106 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended May 11, slightly above the guidance (of 104 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Moreover, the third injection of the 2018 refill season was higher than both last year’s build of 64 Bcf and the 5-year (2013–2017) average addition of 87 Bcf for the reported week.Still, the current storage remains well below benchmarks. At 1.538 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – natural gas inventories are 501 Bcf (24.6%) under the five-year average and 821 Bcf (34.8%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 85.6 Bcf per day, essentially flat on a weekly basis due to steady production. Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption rose 4% to 57.5 Bcf. The increase in demand was triggered by higher natural gas usage for power generation.In other words, EIA’s latest commentary points to a tightening supply-demand balance with growing natural gas use for air-conditioning amid flat production. As a result, natural gas prices gained around 1.5% last week to settle at $2.847 per MMBtu on Friday.Positive Long-Term ThesisThe fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world.In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.

(APD  -  Free Report), an industrial gas provider. The financial terms of the deal, which will close in the upcoming months, are yet to be disclosed.The technology being sold is clean, efficient and reliable and is used to convert low-value refinery residues and asphaltenes into synthesis gas or syngas.  Moreover, Shell also established a strategic alliance with Air Products with the target to render solutions to the liquids gasification market. The solution range incorporates engineering, procurement, construction activities, plant operations and technology licensing.As far as Air Products is concerned, the deal will enable it to increase its capacity to generate syngas for the ongoing and future projects in hand. The company has plans to develop a coal-to-syngas production facility of $3.5 billion in Yulin City of Shaanxi Province in China. Moreover, Air Products created a joint venture in September 2017 with a Chinese coal mining company to supply syngas for 20 years.What Led to the Move?The divestment is in line with Shell's strategy to get rid of debt stemming from its $50 billion acquisition of BG Group. The move will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.Notably, the company has already divested more than $23 billion worth of its assets as part of its plan to divest assets worth $30 billion in the 2016-2018 time period. Additionally, Shell intends to divest more than $10 billion worth of assets in the 2019-2020 time period.

674,COG,"NuStar Energy L.P. (NS  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has started the Binding Open Season for the second capacity expansion of its Permian Crude System, operated by its unit NuStar Permian Transportation and Storage LLC.Presently, the Permian Crude System has 625 miles of crude transmission and gathering lines. The need for a second extension arose as the present shipping volume is close to reaching the capacity of the system. The expansion will provide additional shipping capacity to oil producers.The system will use the interconnects located in Colorado City, TX and help producers to access multiple downstream markets out of the Permian Basin. The overall expansion project is divided into three parts namely, Big Spring South Inlet, Colorado City Mainline Expansion and County Line Loop.The completion of the project will increase the pipeline's capacity by 70,000 barrels per day. The open season offers 90% of the extended capacity for volume commitments through Transportation Services Agreement (""TSA""). The open season that began on Jan 9, 2018 will span a month.The majority of NuStar’s business is derived from an attractive set of fee-based storage and transportation assets that support U.S. and international energy infrastructure. Hence, steps like the recent expansion are expected to boost the company's profitability which could lower the partnership’s debt burden. As of Sep 30, 2017, the partnership had total debt of $3.2 billion, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 57.2%.About NuStarSan Antonio, TX-based NuStar is a master limited partnership (“MLP”) that primarily engages in the transportation and storage of crude oil as well as refined products in the United States, the Netherlands Antilles, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The partnership is one of the biggest independent liquids terminal operators in the country. NuStar’s current asset base includes 9,300 miles of pipeline and 81 terminal and crude oil storage tank facilities. The partnership's combined system has approximately 96 million barrels of storage capacity.Through its agreement to purchase Dallas-based private pipeline company, Navigator Energy Services, NuStar has set foot in the lucrative Permian Basin. The region’s extensive pipeline network and abundant labor supplies will enable the partnership to gain greater margins at the current crude prices.However, NuStar's distribution coverage ratio dipped to a dismal 0.66x in the third quarter of 2017, down from 1.02x a year ago. This indicates that the partnership does not have enough cash to cover its distribution. Worryingly, the sub-1.0x coverage is expected to continue through at least late 2018.In addition, NuStar has lost 37.2% of its value in the last year compared with 13.7% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderNuStar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and Denbury Resources Inc.

675,COG,"Shares of Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) fell around 3% to eventually close the day at $44.55 on Jan 9 after the company issued drab production outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017. Houston-based upstream player estimates fourth-quarter production from international operations to miss the prior guidance — provided in October 2017 — owing to weaker-than-expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea. The company currently expects the fourth quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with its prior forecast levels of 150,000-160,000 BOE/d. Unexpected shutdown of Forties Pipeline System and underperformance of wells in the Beryl area have been the primary factors for the lower forecast. Nevertheless, Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes.As it is, the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all the last three reported quarters. From January to September 2017, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 BOE/d, down 13% from the first nine months of 2016.   Meanwhile, despite the international shortfall, the oil producer is expected to meet its fourth-quarter production target on the back of its U.S. operations. The company expects its output in the United States to be at the high end of its guidance range of 218,000- 224,000 BOE/d for the fourth quarter driven by strong performance in the Permian shale play. The company expects to have achieved its production target of 25,000 BOE/d at Alpine High.In fact, Apache has been banking on its Alpine High discovery in West Texas to remain afloat in the market, which could be its major growth driver in 2018. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are expected to drive strong economics and top-tier returns. The company expects to more than double its product portfolio by virtue of its Alpine High shale play in 2018 compared with the last year’s tally as it has initiated drilling operations in more than 5,000 locations. Notably, Apache intends to invest $1 billion in the region in 2018 toward this end.Apache currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Apache have tumbled 33.8% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 15.6%. Investors interested in the same space can consider some better-ranked players like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources, Inc.

676,COG,"It was a week where the price of oil rallied to a three-year high. However, natural gas futures were down sharply.On the news front, energy explorer Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a major oil discovery offshore Guyana, while Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) agreed to shell out $2.95 billion to resolve a U.S. shareholder lawsuit over a graft scandal.Overall, the sector started 2018 on a mixed note. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 1.7% to close at $61.41 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 5.4% to $2.795 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Crude's Bullish Year End, SandRidge's Deal Cancellation & More)Building on its second annual gain in a row, oil prices saw a solid start to the New Year. The first week of 2018 saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw.On a further bullish note, political turmoil in Iran has raised the specter of production disruption in OPEC’s third-biggest producer. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs falling for a second straight week helped cement those gains.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 424.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.4% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2014.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – registered another drop following a below-average decrease in supplies. Forecasts of an end to the harsh cold snap and the resultant dip in heating demand added to the bearish sentiment, bringing prices down sharply.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Hess announced that the sixth oil discovery — Ranger-1 exploration well — since 2015 in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, was a success.The five world class discoveries in the block — Liza, Payara, Snoek, Liza Deep and Turbot —are projected to have total recoverable resources of over 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Further, resources related with the Ranger-1 discovery will raise this estimate.The drilling of the Ranger-1 well was started by partner ExxonMobil Corporation’s associate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd. on Nov 5, 2017. It hit about 230 feet (70 meters) of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. The well was drilled to a total depth of 21,161 feet (6,450 meters) in water depth of 8,973 feet (2,735 meters). ExxonMobil, the operator of Stabroek Block, holds 45%, while Hess and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited hold 30% and 25%, respectively.The discovery further validates the significant potential of Guyana. This is likely to attract other oil giants to boost financial returns and create significant value for shareholders.

The payout marks the biggest such payment in the United States by a foreign entity and one of the largest securities class action settlements in the U.S. history. The settlement seeks to put to rest one of Brazil's most notorious cases of fraud.The Brazilian oil giant was at the heart of the massive corruption scandal -- dubbed ""Operation Carwash"" -- which incriminated other industries like banks, construction firms and shipyards along with high-level politicians. Various lawsuits were filed against Petrobras by shareholders to recoup losses triggered by money laundering and bribery schemes.Many senior executives of the company were accused of taking bribes for inflated contract schemes. Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was also charged with corruption and sentenced to an imprisonment term of nearly 10 years. Charges were also pressed against the current President Michael Temer in May 2017, shaking the nation, following which the Brazilian Real fell hard against the dollar -- its worst since the global financial crisis in 2008.Petrobras' involvement in the multibillion dollar corruption case was a major overhang for the company which scarred its credit metrics and turned it into the world's most indebted oil company. The settlement deal comes days after Brazil's securities regulator indicted eight more executives of Petrobras including the former CEOs, Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli.

Financial details of the transaction have been kept under wraps. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure by March this year.Per the deal, Andeavor will acquire Rangeland II’s assets in Midland and Delaware Basins, which include storage tanks and frac sand terminal along with 110-mile Rio Pipeline with throughput capacity of 145,000 barrels per day.Post the acquisition, Andeavor intends to integrate the crude oil infrastructure with its Conan Crude Oil Gathering System, which is currently under construction. The $225 million Conan pipeline is around 130 miles long with a capacity to transport around 250,000 barrels of oil a day.The integration of two pipeline systems will provide producers access to multiple markets and also support Andeavor's development of additional gathering systems in the area. It will also boost the commercial opportunities by providing direct access to the Midland Basin. Eventually, Andeavor intends to drop down the pipeline assets to its midstream spin-off Andeavor Logistics, LP.

The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company had signed the divestment deal with Dansk Olieselskab AS in September 2016, which included the sale of Shell's Fredericia refinery and local trading and supply activities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The deal was set for closure by the end of 2017, subject to satisfactory conditions. However, the deal was called off as Shell and Dansk Olieselskab could not reach a consensus regarding matters of sales within the stipulated time. As of now, Shell is not looking for other prospective buyers and intends to retain its refinery operations in Denmark.The divestment was part of the company's move to lower its debt arising from the $50 billion mega acquisition of BG Group. It was part of its portfolio optimization strategy and the $30-billion global divestment program set for the 2016-2018 period. The move was also in line with the company's aim to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.However, with Shell already closing more than $23 billion divestment deals, it remains on track to meet its target by 2018. Further, the company announced asset disposals worth around $2 billion and additional $5 billion divestment deals are already in advanced stages of talks for prospective transactions.

(COG  -  Free Report) recently approved a 20% hike in its regular quarterly dividend. The company will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 6 cents per share compared with the previous payout of 5 cents. This translates to a dividend of 24 cents per share on an annualized basis.The increased dividend will be paid to shareholders of record on Feb 7, 2018, as of Jan 24, 2018. The company's dividend hike for the second consecutive year reflects its commitment to create value for its shareholders and underlines its confidence in generating cash. We will like to remind investors that the company’s second-quarter 2017 dividend reflected a 150% quarterly increase.Given a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.Cabot has recently shifted its focus on strengthening its balance sheet. On Dec 20, 2017, the company announced its decision to divest Eagle Ford Shale holdings to a unit of Venado Oil & Gas LLC for $765 million. This will help the company to concentrate on high quality Marcellus Shale assets and achieve better returns.

678,COG,"Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP  -  Free Report) recently reported a leakage in its 12-inch pipeline system that transports fuel from Rosemount, MN to Minneapolis. Leakage of around 500 barrels or 21,000 gallons of gasoline has been confirmed so far although the partnership estimated the initial leakage at 300 barrelsThe leak, resulted from issues related to excavation equipment of third-party, took place in Eagan, MN. The cleanup process is on at the site with environmental specialists monitoring the situation.Following the news of leakage, several roads were temporarily blocked and a minor evacuation carried out. Although the partnership has not provided a time frame for the repair works, it expects supply at Minneapolis facilities to be uninterrupted.  Price PerformanceUnits of Magellan Midstream have lost 4.5% in the last year compared with 15.6% decline of the industry it belongs to. About the PartnershipTulsa, OK-based Magellan Midstream is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns and operates a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets.

679,COG,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report). DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 924 in the week ended Jan 5 — lower than the prior week’s 929. With this, the count fell for two weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 665.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore, offshore and inland operations. The number of onshore rigs were 906, lower than 909. The tally for offshore was 17, down from 18. One rig operated in the inland waters last week against the count of two for the week ended Dec 29. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 742 fell from 747 recorded for the week ended Dec 29. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 529.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 182 was in line with the week ended Dec 29. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 135. Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 62 units decreased from 65. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) declined by two units to 862.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 17 units — 14 of which were oil-directed — down from 18 for the week ended Dec 29.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States remained in line, while the count of rigs looking for oil decreased. Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count fell, primarily due to the removal of five onshore and one offshore rig in Louisiana. Two rigs were also removed from Oklahoma.The crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. The fall in U.S drilling rigs also supported the crude rally.Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that the business scenario has been favorable for exploration and production players.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Approach Resources Inc. (AREX  -  Free Report). Cabot sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Approach Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

680,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a below-average decrease in natural gas supplies. Forecasts of an end to the harsh cold snap and the resultant dip in heating demand added to the bearish sentiment, bringing prices down sharply.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: Smaller-than-Expected DrawStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 206 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Dec. 29, below the guidance (of 219 Bcf decline) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.However, the decrease was significantly higher than both last year’s drop of 76 Bcf and the five-year (2012-2016) average net shrinkage of 99 Bcf for the reported week. Following past week’s decline – seventh withdrawal of the 2017-2018 winter heating season – the current storage level now stands at 3.126 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 192 Bcf (5.8%) under the five-year average and the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 82.4 Bcf per day, down slightly (around 1%) on a weekly basis due to lower production. Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption jumped 23.6% to 137 Bcf.The sharp increase in demand was triggered by a 39.1% surge in residential/commercial consumption on the back of cold temperatures engulfing much of the U.S. Moreover, natural gas consumption for power generation was up by 18.9% from the previous week.Futures Slump Following EIA DataFollowing EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices slumped around 5.4% last week to settle at $2.795 per MMBtu on Friday. Apart from the lower-than-anticipated draw, investors were spooked by forecasts for an end to the frigid cold snap going into the middle of January leading to decrease in the heating fuel’s demand.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corp. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy (WPX  -  Free Report), Antero Resources Corp. (AR  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp.

681,COG,"Penn Virginia Corporation (PVAC  -  Free Report) has decided to boost its acreages in the oil and gas rich Eagle Ford Shale play.About the DealFor the acquisition, the upstream energy player is expected to give roughly $86 million in cash to Hunt Oil Company. The transaction – expected to conclude on or before March 1, 2018 – will likely be financed with debt capital under the credit facility of Penn Virginia.BenefitsThe upstream energy player’s core leasehold resources in Eagle Ford will likely get boosted by roughly 9,700 net acres. Hence, with the closure of the deal, Penn Virginia will be able to operate more than 99% of its resources in the Eagle Ford play. On top of that, net drilling inventory of Penn Virginia is also anticipated to increase 17%.The acquisition will also boost the company’s production by 1,870 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BoE/D). Investors should note that 89% of the increased production will likely be oil.Higher production, especially in the face of partial crude recovery, is highly beneficial for the company. Oil is now trading above the $60 per barrel mark, way higher than multi-year low marks reached during 2016.About the CompanyHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Penn Virginia is primarily involved in the exploration and production of crude resources in domestic plays. The company has no current debt and the long-term debt of $245 million is way lower than $1.1 billion during 2014 — reflecting sound financial positions.However, the pricing chart scenario is not impressive. Over the past year, the stock fell 14.8%, underperforming the industry’s13.2% decline.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksAs a result, Penn Virginia carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Meanwhile, better-ranked stocks in the energy sector are Lonestar Resources US Inc.

682,COG,"On Jan 2, Bonanza Creek Energy Inc. (BCEI  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently seen upward revision in estimates tend to outperform the market over the next nine to 12 months.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised higher from 63 cents to $1.06. Also, for 2018, estimates were raised from 76 cents to $1.99.Bonanza Creek has an impressive earnings surprise history. The upstream player managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 188.7%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings improvement of 100.6% in 2017 and 87.3% in 2018.The business scenario looks profitable as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil recently traded at $62.21 per barrel — last touched before May 2015 — per Reuters. Also, natural gas is hovering around the psychological mark of $3 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU). Overall, the favorable commodity pricing scenario could fetch the exploration and production company attractive cashflow.We also appreciate the company’s constant effort to reduce recurring cash operating expenses amid the volatile business scenario. Looking at the price chart, although Bonanza Creek failed to outperform the Zacks Oil US Exploration industry, we appreciate the company’s strong financials. Bonanza Creek has no current and long-term debt.

683,COG,"The board of directors of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) recently approved a 20% hike in its regular quarterly dividend. The company will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 6 cents per share compared with the previous payout of 5 cents. This translates to a dividend of 24 cents per share on an annualized basis.The increased dividend will be paid to shareholders of record on Feb 7, 2018, as of Jan 24, 2018. The company's dividend hike for the second consecutive year reflects its commitment to create value for its shareholders and underlines its confidence in generating cash. We will like to remind investors that the company’s second-quarter 2017 dividend reflected a 150% quarterly increase.Given a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.Cabot has recently shifted its focus on strengthening its balance sheet. On Dec 20, 2017, the company announced its decision to divest Eagle Ford Shale holdings to a unit of Venado Oil & Gas LLC for $765 million. This will help the company to concentrate on high quality Marcellus Shale assets and achieve better returns.About the CompanyCabot, based in Houston, TX, is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in continental United States. Cabot focuses on high-impact natural gas-focused drilling in the Marcellus Shale and supplements it with Eagle Ford-based liquids program in Texas. At the end of 2016, the company had 8.6 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe) in proved reserves (97% natural gas). Cabot’s output totaled 627.1 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) 2016, of which nearly 96% was natural gas.Driven by its operational efficiencies, Cabot was able to reduce its unit operating costs by around 19% since the beginning of 2017 — an impressive achievement amid the low price scenario. The company has managed to generate positive free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter and is likely to sustain the same in the near-to-medium term.Also, Cabot displays strong financial leverage. Its debt/equity ratio of 48.6% compares favorably with the industry average of 96.3%, indicating a lower debt burden relative to the industry. The company’s ROE of 7.2% is much higher than the industry average of 1.5%. This reflects that it is more efficient in utilizing shareholder funds compared to its peers. Moreover, Cabot has gained 28.2% in the last year against 14.7% fall of its industry.However, there are some risks associated with investing in the stock. Being a relatively small player, Cabot lacks the financial resources of larger industry giants. As such, during the current prolonged credit crunch, the company is forced to spend within its internal cash generation. This may prove detrimental to its growth plans. Additionally, grappling with lawsuits and denied a water permit, we expect Cabot’s new pipeline initiative – the Constitution Pipeline Company – to be delayed substantially or get cancelled.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCabot has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector like Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

686,COG,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas prices experienced noticeable upticks on healthy storage draws.On the news front, supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) has signed an agreement to purchase British energy supplier First Utility, while domestic natural gas producer Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) announced plans to offload its Eagle Ford shale holdings for $765 million.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2% to close at $58.47 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose 2.1% to $2.667 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: MDR-CBI Tie-Up, STO's Oilfield Stake Buy & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded an increase for the first time in three weeks. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs not rising for a second straight week helped cement those gains.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 29 of the last 37 weeks and are down nearly 97 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 10.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015Meanwhile, natural gas futures recovered from last week’s ten-month lows following a larger-than-average decrease in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts (translating into robust heating gas demand) added to the positive sentiment.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to lower its carbon footprint, Royal Dutch Shell recently inked a deal to acquire UK’s energy supplier First Utility. The move will enable Shell to expand its energy supply business from commercial and industrial customers and venture into the residential sector. The purchase price of the transaction has been kept under wraps. Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is set for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2018. (Read more Shell Boosts Power Market Presence With First Utility Buyout)The announcement of the acquisition comes amid a challenging time for UK’s energy firms as the British Prime Minister Theresa May plans to cap electricity and gas bills until 2020 which could dampen competition. Since 2012, new energy suppliers have increased competition in the space, lowering the Big Six’s market share from nearly 100% to about 80%. The latest acquisition deal will further intensify the competition putting more pressure on the Big Six. The move will mark Shell’s entry to Britain's household energy market, enabling the company to develop innovative new services for customers.First Utility will operate as a stand-alone entity and subsidiary of Shell within its New Energies division in which the company will invest approximately $1 billion per year till 2020 to shift its focus on cleaner and renewable energy sources. The new business will serve as a hedge for reduced gasoline and diesel fuel demand.2.    As part of its cost-containment initiatives, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation recently inked a deal to divest Eagle Ford Shale holdings to a unit of Venado Oil & Gas LLC for $765 million. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is set for completion during the first quarter of 2018.The divested assets will include around 74,500 acres which produced 15,656 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2017. The assets accounted for just 5% of the total year-to-date equivalent production and 4% proved reserves. The company will record a one-time charge of around $270-$280 million on the Eagle Ford sale in the fourth quarter. In a separate transaction, the company also offloaded remaining East Texas properties to an undisclosed buyer.Cash proceeds from this transaction will strengthen the balance sheet of the company boosting its free cash flow generation. Cabot’s execution success, disciplined capital allocation and improving well economics will enhance its outlook, driving the shareholder value by share buyback programs and dividend growth. Further, the portfolio streamline is in sync with the company‘s aim to increase its focus on the lucrative Marcellus shale. (Read more Cabot to Offload Eagle Ford Assets for $765 Million)3.    Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently announced its Business and Management Plan (""BMP"") for 2018-2022, which shows marginally higher investments than the 2017-2021 period. The new five-year plan forecasts $74.5 billion in investment compared with $74.1 billion for 2017-2021, projected earlier.Notably, the BMP 2018-2022 focuses on increasing production and supporting company's finances. While around $60.3 billion will be used in exploration and production, nearly $13.1 billion is likely to be spent on refining and natural gas. Petrobras intends to boost average production from an expected 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) in 2018 to 3.55 million Boe/d by 2022. The plan will be supported by the eight platforms going into production in 2018 and 11 more coming online by 2022.Furthermore, Petrobras has plans to reduce its operating expenses to $136.8 billion from $153 billion projected in the five-year plan earlier. Also, operating cash generation is estimated to be around $141.5 billion, after dividends.  The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects these initiatives to help in reducing its debt without drawing new funds.

(CVE  -  Free Report) recently unveiled a leaner capex budget for 2018. The capital discipline is targeted to support the acquisition of oil sands assets worth C$16.8 billion from ConocoPhillips earlier this year. In 2018, Cenovus intends to remain focused on reducing huge debt burden, strengthening balance sheet and optimizing asset portfolio.The company announced a $1.5-$1.7 billion capital program for 2018 with majority of capital allocated toward oil sands operation. Cenovus Energy expects to invest between $1.04 billion and $1.16 billion in the Deep Basin in 2018. Oil sands operating cost and sustaining capital costs have been reduced by 8% and 12%, respectively, compared with the prior guidance. Further, it has allocated $270 million for the construction of the phase G expansion at Christina Lake given the lower costs of operations. The go-forward capital efficiencies for the company’s Christina Lake operations have improved by 21%, compared with the previously provided range.The company plans to decrease workforce by 15%, laying off around 500-700 employees.  As a part of the cost containment efforts adopted during the industry downturn, Cenovus Energy has already retrenched around 1,500 and 400 jobs in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

(E  -  Free Report) announced that it has commenced natural gas production in Zohr field, located off the coast of Egypt. The field has huge gas reserves, estimated at more than 30 trillion cubic feet by the integrated energy firm.The company had discovered the giant field in 2015. Hence, the production of first gas within less than two and a half years has been a big achievement for the company, considering the size of the field. With huge and potential gas resources, the discovery was touted to be the largest in the Mediterranean area.In a separate announcement, Eni revealed that it has diversified its upstream portfolio by broadening its footprint in Morocco.

687,COG,"As part of its cost-containment initiatives, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to divest Eagle Ford Shale holdings to a unit of Venado Oil & Gas LLC for $765 million. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is set for completion during the first quarter of 2018.The divested assets will include around 74,500 acres which produced 15,656 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2017. The assets accounted for just 5% of the total year-to-date equivalent production and 4% proved reserves. The company will record a one-time charge of around $270-$280 million on the Eagle Ford sale in the fourth quarter. In a separate transaction, the company also offloaded remaining East Texas properties to an undisclosed buyer.This year, various energy firms including Carrizo Oil and Gas Inc (CRZO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) and Sanchez Energy Corporation among others have offloaded their non-core assets in Eagle Ford to shore up their financials and focus on promising regions.Amid the industry downturn, Cabot like all other upstream players reduced its spending and adopted various other cost-cut initiatives to improve its financials. Driven by its operational efficiencies, Cabot was able to reduce its year-to-date unit operating costs by around 19% — an impressive achievement amid the low price scenario. The company has managed to generate positive free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter and is likely to achieve more of the same in the near-to-medium term.Cash proceeds from this transaction will further strengthen the balance sheet of the company boosting its free cash flow generation. Cabot’s execution success, disciplined capital allocation and improving well economics will further enhance its outlook, driving the shareholder value by share buyback programs and dividend growth.Further, the streamlining of the portfolio is in sync with the company‘s aim to increase its focus on Marcellus shale which generates solid returns. Though The Eagle Ford and Marcellus Shale assets complement each other, of late decline rate of return from the Eagle Ford holdings prompted the company to divest it.

688,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a below-average decrease in natural gas supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production added to the bearish sentiment, bringing prices down sharply.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Smaller-than-Average DrawStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 69 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Dec 8, above the guidance (of 63 Bcf decline) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.However, the decrease was lower than both last year’s drop of 132 Bcf and the five-year (2012-2016) average net shrinkage of 78 Bcf for the reported week. Following the past week’s decline – the fourth withdrawal of the 2017-2018 winter heating season – the current storage level now stands at 3.626 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) - 27 Bcf (0.7%) under the five-year average and 201 Bcf (5.3%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, total supply of natural gas averaged around 82 Bcf per day, essentially flat on a weekly basis due to steady production. Meanwhile, daily natural gas consumption jumped 25.1% to 106.7 Bcf. The sharp increase in demand was triggered by a 49.6% surge in residential/commercial consumption on the back of cooler temperatures. Moreover, natural gas consumption for power generation was up by 18% from the previous week.Futures Slump Following EIA DataFollowing EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices slumped around 5.8% last week to settle at $2.612 per MMBtu on Friday. Apart from the below-average draw, investors were spooked by expanding dry gas production and forecasts of tepid heating demand from another relatively warm winter.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run, considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia-Pacific region in particular.The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Countries in Asia and in the Middle East – led by China’s transition away from coal – will account for most of this increase.And it will be the world’s largest gas producer U.S., which will step up to meet this soaring demand. With domestic prices struggling to break the $3 per million Btu threshold, U.S. natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U.S. production at higher prices to rest of the world. In fact, more than 50% of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As per Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022.Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports, the replacement of coal-fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above $3.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rex Energy Corp. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report).Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are looking for a near term natural gas play, Rice Midstream Partners L.P. (RMP  -  Free Report) may be a good selection. This company actually has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

690,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies – the season’s first withdrawal. However, unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, resulted in prices dropping.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas.

691,COG,"Production and pipeline major, The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) recently received clearance from a U.S. federal appeals court to move ahead with the construction of Atlantic Sunrise natural gas pipeline worth almost $3 billion. The pipeline, which will connect Pennsylvania to South Carolina, will enable Williams Companies to transport Marcellus shale gas across the eastern region of the United States.Williams Companies expects the construction of the pipeline, which will be an expansion of the Transco system, to be completed by mid-2018. The pipeline will have a transportation capacity of around 1.7 billion cubic feet of gas per day (bcf/d). It will move Marcellus shale gas from Pennsylvania to the rest of the country. The company expects the pipeline to add value to its existing energy infrastructure, which will provide it with a steady flow of revenues in the future. It will also help citizens to receive affordable clean energy source as well as contribute to the economic growth of the country.At the beginning of this week, environmentalists appealed to the court for a stay of construction, which has now been overruled as the opponents of the pipeline could not gather satisfactory facts. The stay of construction could have potentially put 8,000 jobs at risk. The company intends to resume construction of the gas pipeline soon. Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is one of the companies expected to use the pipeline once construction is complete. IT has already secured 1 bcf/d gas transport capacity on the pipeline.About Williams CompaniesTulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams Companies is a premier energy infrastructure provider in North America. The company’s core operations include finding, producing, gathering, processing, and transportation of natural gas. With a widespread pipeline system, Williams Companies is one of the largest domestic transporters of natural gas by volume. Its facilities – gas wells, pipelines, and midstream services – are concentrated in the Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Gulf Coast, and Eastern Seaboard.Williams Companies assets include general partner interests and limited partner interests in Williams Partners, L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report) - an energy master limited partnership. The company derives most of its cash flow from its 74% ownership of Williams Partners. This includes assets that help in the gathering, transportation, treating, and processing of natural gas, in addition to the fractionation and storage of natural gas liquids. However, we remain worried about volatile natural gas prices and Williams Companies' high debt level.Price PerformanceWilliams Companies has lost 8.9% of its value year to date compared with 2.4% decline of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderWilliams Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the oil and energy sector is Braskem S.A. (BAK  -  Free Report). It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Braskem’s 2017 earnings are expected to grow 12.1% year over year.

695,COG,"The third-quarter earnings cycle is in full swing, wherein 164 S&P 500 members have reported their numbers. This accounts for 38.2% of the index’s total market capitalization. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 7% from the same period last year on 4.8% higher revenues, with 72% companies delivering positive earnings surprises and 68.3% beating revenue estimates.We would like to remind investors that the Oil/Energy sector made a comeback in fourth-quarter 2016 after a prolonged period of weakness. The improvement in the sector’s performance drove the aggregate growth for the S&P 500 Index. In fact, the most important feature of this earnings season seems to be the positive revenue momentum, in terms of  growth as well as beats.Third-quarter earnings growth seems dismal compared with the prior two quarters. However, the growth rate is expected to improve, as evident from the current upbeat projection of 8.95% growth for fourth-quarter earnings. The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in the quarter under review.True to the predictions, the sector came out quite a winner. So far, for the sector components enlisted on the S&P 500 Index, total Q3 earnings grew 253.9% on 33.5% higher revenues.Importantly, oil and gas prices during third-quarter supported the growth. Prices of oil at the end of the quarter improved, amid persistent decline in domestic inventories and improvement of supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil price at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices were around $45 per barrel.Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu on Sep 30, 2016.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 27ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of 78 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. The quarterly earnings, however, increased from 41 cents recorded a year ago. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.94%.  Our proven model shows that ExxonMobil is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because ExxonMobil has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

696,COG,"Upstream Energy firm Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 27.Headquartered in Texas, Cabot is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings for the current quarter has been revised downward by 16.7% over the last 30 days. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has also moved south by 3.2% over the last 30 days.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.67% owing to increased costs. However, Cabot delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.02% in the last four quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderBeing an upstream firm, weakness in the commodity prices might lower the company’s exploration and production activities. Natural gas prices dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period, owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages.With natural gas prices trading just around $3 per MMBtu during most part of the third quarter and Cabot being one of the most gas-weighted E&Ps, the company's earnings and revenues are under pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized gas price is pegged at $2.32 per thousand cubic feet, lower than the prior quarter figure of $2.38. Even the crude price realization is estimated at $43.81 per barrel, lower than the $44.03 per barrel recorded in second-quarter 2017.We also note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output stands at 164 billion cubic feet (Bcf) compared with $166 Bcf in second-quarter 2017. This might negatively affect the company’s revenues. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $410 million for the third quarter, down 10.9% from the prior quarter.Further, during 2017, Cabot is likely to spend $845 million which is more than twice of the 2016 spending level of around $375 million. This might lower the company's cash flows. Last quarter, Cabot’s operating expenses were higher by around 27% on increased administrative, general and other costs. If the trend continues, the company’s earnings are expected to get hurt.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cabot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -18.81%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 8 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 10 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: Cabot presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks with Favorable CombinationThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Cabot, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Unit Corporation (UNT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.17% and a Zacks Rank #3.

697,COG,"Energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) is hopeful of its Constitution Pipeline project to begin service by 2019, subject to necessary regulatory approvals.  The pipeline company requested the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to repeal New York's denial of a water permit which was necessary to move ahead with the project.  The company applied for the water permit in August 2013. The state however failed to act on the permit request within the one year of the statutory deadline. In 2016, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) denied the water permit to Williams Companies. The company believes such delays lead to a waiver of the federal Clean Water Act's Section 401 water quality certification requirement.The petition filed by the company states, “The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed one year, after receipt of such request, the certification requirements shall be waived.”The project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) , WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The 121-mile natural gas pipeline, which runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County was to transport natural gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in the North East.The $750-million project has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas per day. The pipeline which has received President Trump’s support aims to address the problems of transportation infrastructure in the Northeast region and speed up shipments from the prolific Marcellus and Utica basins.The project was expected to become operational in 2015, but got delayed due to lengthy review process, pushing the in-service date to late 2016. The project received the FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied to issue a water quality permit to the pipeline due to its possibility of impacting the ecology and climate adversely.  The DEC claimed that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project properly and that the pipeline can possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.If FERC agrees to the company’s request to retract the water permit denial, William Companies will seek a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If it secures all the necessary approvals, the pipeline is likely to come online by the first half of 2019.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

698,COG,"Activist investors are calling for a paradigm shift in compensation methods to leaders in the energy sector. The current model awards shale drillers as per growth in production. This has increased production vastly and hence CEOs' pay has also been excessive.However, the boost in production didn’t help in improving financials. Therefore, investors didn’t gain anything. This fired up investors to demand a change in the pattern of compensating executives. Investors want CEO pays to be linked to returns.Previous Methods V/S New Practice of CompensationPer the earlier norm, the executives received large compensation when they made large investments in new wells. This sparked a new age of shale gas that made the United States a global energy powerhouse and encouraged higher oil and gas drilling. In fact, the current crude output in the country amounts to a robust 9.6 million barrels a day — the highest since July 2015.Per this practice, the 10 biggest U.S. shale producers paid their chief executives $2.2 billion over the past decade despite shareholder returns of 1.7%. These companies include Apache Corp (APA  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN  -  Free Report). Both these companies hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On the other hand, the integrated companies like ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and others paid their executives cumulatively a total of $600 million during the same period and achieved a stronger 3.5% return.The performance of the broader oil industry can also be gauged by the returns it has delivered in comparison to the S&P 500 index. The industry’s performance did not reach any closer to the index’s return of 7.4% in the last 10 years. The difference became more prominent this year, with shares of shale producers down over 20% and the index gained about 14%.Companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corp (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) are an exception. These companies have more investor-friendly policies. Even executive compensation is calculated in a manner keeping in mind long-term benefits. Shares for executives are to be vested after three years rather than immediately. These companies also benefited due to their practices as their shares have outperformed peers. Since 2012, EOG Resources’ share price increased 96%.Gradually, other companies have started or are planning to follow suit. One such company having transformed its practice is Range Resources plc (RRC  -  Free Report). The company decided to switch policies after its shares dropped about 70% since 2012, per Reuters analysis.This comparison of prices between companies following different policies is evidence enough to establish the rationality of the more relevant strategy.On the other hand, companies not agreeing to follow suit are facing the heat. EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is one such company, which is being asked to explain the logic behind the payment of $130 million to its executive. In September, the company has agreed to eliminate that bonus and focus on efficiency and cost, not production.Even as investors get more aware, they are allocating their money to companies that compensate leaders for returns.Change is Not EasyDespite low returns, the companies will continue to increase production as they would need cash flow to pay debt and other expenses. Executives will continue with their old habits till they are paid per the production increase. Shale executives receive higher pay. For example, Noble Energy Inc’s (NBL) executive was paid $10.1 million in 2016, up 40% from 2015. SandRidge Energy Inc CEO was also awarded $18.8 million in the year the company exited bankruptcy protection.Winners & LosersIf the change is implicated, it would put an end to spending on new wells, disturbing a shale boom that has placed U.S. motorists and consumers advantageously. However, it will benefit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers who are aggressively trying to control global crude surplus. Flourishing U.S. shale production has mainly upset OPEC output cuts expected at lifting prices. Consecutively, low oil prices have damaged shareholder returns.ConclusionIf more companies changed policies, production will decline,leading to increase in shareholder returns. These will have widespread impacts on the shale sector as well as international oil markets.If there is a change in the payment structure, shareholders will benefit from higher cash flows and less funds would be directed to drilling. The surplus funds would be distributed in the form of dividends rather than financing new shale wells. This is likely to result in higher share prices and better return on capital. But that would also mean more reserved oil production.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

699,COG,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is COG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fourth-Quarter 2017 ResultsCabot reported fourth quarter earnings per share – adjusted for special items – of 13 cents, slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents and in line with the year-ago quarter profit.The exploration and production firm’s results were buoyed by higher production and realized prices.  Houston, TX-based Cabot’s quarterly revenue improved 26.5% year-over-year to $400.5 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $426 million.Volume AnalysisCabot’s overall production during the quarter totaled 172.6 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) – 95% gas – up 5.1% from the prior year quarter volume of 164.2 Bcfe. Natural gas output was 164.4 Bcf, while liquids production came in at 1,369.5 thousand barrels (MBbl).Realized PricesThe average realized natural gas price increased 12.4% from the year-ago quarter to $2.18 per thousand cubic feet, while average crude/condensate price realization rose 27% to $54.54 per barrel. Meanwhile, natural gas liquids fetched $23.51 per barrel as against $13.84 a year back.Costs & ExpensesTotal operating expenses were 1.5% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, declining to $744.7 million. While transportation and gathering costs were up 5.2% year-over-year to $119.5 million, oil and gas property write-offs fell 4.9% to $414.3 million. Meanwhile, Cabot’s depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses edged up 1.4% from the year-ago period to $143.1 million.Drilling Statistics, Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetCabot drilled 20 net wells and completed 24 during the quarter. Operating cash flows were $179.1 million for the quarter (up 28.2% year over year), while capital expenditures totaled $177.7 million (up 36.6%). As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had $1,521.9 million in long-term debt (excluding current portion), with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 37.6%.Proved ReservesAs of year-end 2017, Cabot had 9.7 trillion cubic feet equivalent in proved reserves (96% natural gas).How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter.Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and Consensus Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and Consensus | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, COG has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise COG has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

700,COG,"We issued an updated research report on Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) on Feb 27.The upstream energy player’s portfolio is spread between low-risk/long reserve-life properties and large-volume/rapid-payout assets, with further variety from large prospect inventories that have a broad mix of production and payout profiles.The company's recent deal to offload its non-core Eagle Ford assets bode well. Cash proceeds from this transaction will strengthen the balance sheet of the company, boosting its free cash flow. Further, the streamlining of the portfolio is in sync with the company‘s aim to increase its focus on Marcellus shale, which generates solid returns. Increased focus on the Marcellus shale will help the company deliver double-digit growth per debt-adjusted share from the region.Cabot’s Marcellus program continues to garner exceptional results. As of now, the company has around 200,000 net acres in the prime Marcellus acreage with an estimated 3,000 remaining undrilled locations. Cabot's high-quality assets in the region helped it drive its overall third-quarter production volumes by 5% year over year.However, with natural gas prices trading below $3 per MMBtu and Cabot being one of the most gas-weighted exploration and production player, the company's earnings and revenues are under pressure. Other companies exposed to volatility in natural gas price are Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report) and QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report).Also, Cabot is set to spend $950 million in 2018, higher than the 2017 spending level of around $765 million. This might lower the company's cash flow.Moreover, grappling with lawsuits and denied a water permit, we expect Cabot’s new pipeline initiative — the Constitution Pipeline Company — to be delayed substantially or get cancelled. This is set to impact the company's earnings outlook.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  ENI S.p.A. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ENI S.p.A. QuoteOperational PerformanceTotal liquids and gas production in the fourth quarter was 1,892 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), up 2% year over year. Notably, it was the highest quarterly production for the company in the last seven years. The increase in production can be attributed to project start-ups mainly in Angola, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia and Kazakhstan. Moreover, production restart at some Libyan fields, where safety conditions improved, added to the positive result. However, the positives were partly offset by decreased output from mature fields, OPEC production cuts, and lower production due to planned and unplanned shutdowns in Norway, the United Kingdom and the Gulf of Mexico.Liquids production was 861 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d), down 5% from the year-ago level of 906 MBbl/d. Natural gas production increased 8.2% year over year to 5,625 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d).  Realized price of oil was $57.64 per barrel, up 29.4% from the year-ago realized price of $44.56 per barrel. Realized natural gas price was $3.89 per thousand cubic feet (kcf), up 10.9% from $3.50 in the year-ago quarter.Gas sales were 21.48 billion cubic meters (Bcm), down 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.

703,COG,"Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 23.Headquartered in Texas, Cabot is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental United States. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 12.50% amid high costs, weaker-than-expected production and lower-than-expected natural gas price realizations. Coming to earnings surprise history, Cabot displays a dismal performance, delivering average negative earnings surprise of 0.11% in the trailing four quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 12 cents has been revised upward by a penny in the last seven days. It reflects massive growth from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of a penny.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $426 million for the quarter, up 34.8% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayThe upstream player is poised to benefit from recovering energy landscape. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized gas price is pegged at $2.46 per thousand cubic feet, higher than the prior-quarter figure of $1.94. Cabot being one of the most gas-weighted E&Ps is likely to gain from the recovering natural gas prices. Even the crude price realization is estimated at $48.61 per barrel, higher than $42.94 per barrel recorded in fourth-quarter 2016.Further, the company is focused on streamlining its portfolio to increase focus toward high income-generating core assets. Cabot's exposure to the high quality Marcellus assets will help it to achieve industry leading rates of return. The low-risk and high margin inventories of the company boost its production prospects and revenues in the coming quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly natural gas output stands at 166 billion cubic feet (Bcf) compared with $159 Bcf in fourth-quarter 2016. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from natural gas production stands at $408 million against $312 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Further, operating revenues from crude production is also estimated at $62 million, higher than $36.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter.While Cabot is bearing the brunt of increased total expenses since past two quarters, we believe that pricing and production gains will offset the effect of high costs, enabling the company to deliver stronger results this quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model too shows that Cabot is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.44%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 13 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 12 cents.

704,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies that took inventories below their five-year average. However, unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, induced a big drop in prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Smaller-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 42 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Sep 29, 2017, below the guidance (of 47 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Moreover, the increase was lower than both last year’s addition of 76 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 91 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.508 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – fall below the five-year average for the first time since January. Stocks are now 8 Bcf (0.2%) under the five-year average, while dropping 161 Bcf (4.4%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, supply remained essentially unchanged on a weekly basis at 79.7 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption decreased 13.3% to 64.7 Bcf. The flattish supply could be attributed to stagnant dry natural gas production.On the demand side, the fall was triggered by sharply lower power consumption that tumbled 24.2% week over week on the back of cooler temperatures. A more than 12% dip in residential/commercial consumption further dented demand.Futures End Down Despite Bullish EIA DataShrugging off EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices went down 4.8% last week to settle at $2.863 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to concentrate on mild temperature predictions (translating into easing cooling gas demand) over the next few days. Prices were further dented by the continued strength in dry gas production, which are hovering near record levels.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming LNG and Mexican exports, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output.The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on. Over time, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report).As of now, we expect the fuel to continue to be range bound around $3 with little chance of any drastic increase.Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are looking for a near term natural gas play, PetroQuest Energy Inc.  may be a good selection.

705,COG,"It was a week where oil prices extended the streak of gains but natural gas futures slipped again.On the news front, U.S. behemoth ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) was toppled by Russia’s Gazprom as the world’s top energy company, while smaller rival Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) elected Michael Wirth to succeed john Watson as its next Chairman and CEO. Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2% to close at $51.67 per barrel, natural gas prices edged down 0.5% to $3.007 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP Project Start-Up, PSXP Asset Buyout, RIG's Floater Retirement.)The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid a surprise decline in US inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. But data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for the first time in four weeks kept gains in check.The federal government’s Energy Information Administration (‘EIA’) report revealed that crude inventories decreased by 1.85 million barrels for the week ending Sep 22. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 1.3 million barrels.Meanwhile, energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year. Also, supply from the 14-member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months, helping to tighten the market significantly. Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.However, the commodity gave up some of its gains after the number of active rigs drilling for crude in the U.S. – an indicator of oil industry activity – rose by six to 750, as per data from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes Inc.On the other hand, natural gas futures finished slightly lower despite a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, induced the minor drop in prices.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per the S&P Global Platts ranking of the top financial performers of the year, U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil Corporation was pushed down to the ninth spot from its top position. In fact, only two domestic companies could sustain their position in the Top 10 lists of the biggest financial performers. Valero Energy Corporation, an independent refiner in the United States secured the No.8 position, down from the No. 3 spot held last year. Another U.S. company that had a massive rank fall was Chevron Corporation, down to No.121 from No.17 last year.Russian energy company Gazprom dethroned ExxonMobil from theNo.1 spot in the 2017 S&P Global Platts Top 250 Global Energy Company Rankings.  Last year, Gazprom had secured theNo.3 slot.An energy economist explains that government support might have been a big factor that has led to the change in the rankings. The Russian government owns majority in Gazprom. Also, Gazprom’s No. 1 spot is significant of management's endeavor to combat low oil and gas prices, bans from low interest rate credit in Europe and its position as the EUs leading foreign supplier of natural gas, a market where the United States is seeking expansion opportunities.2.    U.S. energy giant Chevron Corporation recently announced plans to appoint Michael K. Wirth as the CEO and chairman as the company seeks managerial changes to deal with the volatile dynamics of the oil industry. Wirth, who is currently the vice chairman of the company, will take over as the CEO from Feb 1, 2018. He will be replacing John Watson who has served the company as the CEO for the last eight years.Persistent weakness and volatility in oil prices pose challenge to the upstream operations of the company as it is not being able to sell crude at viable prices and is unable to generate significant cash flows for shareholders. Chevron being an integrated player, is thus trying to increase its focus on downstream business which can be profitable in the current environment.In our opinion, Wirth’s appointment is a sound choice, given his substantial knowledge and experience regarding refining and petrochemicals.  With the election of Wirth as the CEO, Chevron will follow the footsteps of energy majors like ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc and TOTAL S.A., all of whose CEO’s are refining specialists.Wirth joined Chevron in 1982 and became the vice chairman earlier this year. He has spent around 10 years as the executive vice president of Chevron's downstream and chemicals business. To exit non-competitive projects, Chevron divested downstream assets in Canada to Parkland as part of Wirth's strategy. It also lowered the company’s operating and capital costs. Apart from providing a leaner business model, it helped Chevron to progress toward its $5-$10 billion divestment goals for 2016-2017. (Read more Can Chevron Flourish With Michael Wirth at the Helm?)3.    Energy explorer Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (LPI  -  Free Report) recently entered into a deal to divest stake in Medallion Gathering & Processing, LLC which is a pipeline unit located in Permian Basin. Laredo holds a 49% stake in the pipeline while the remaining interest is owned by private investment firm The Energy & Minerals Group. Private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners will acquire the Medallion pipeline for $1.825 million along with additional cash consideration. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Laredo will receive $825 million from the transaction. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Laredo made its initial investment in the Medallion-Midland Basin crude oil pipeline system in 2013. The Medallion unit comprises more than 800 miles of pipelines spread over 325,000 net acres.  In around four years, the value of the pipeline has increased by $1 billion. The sale proceeds which will be received by Laredo reflect three times the invested capital and equivalent to an IRR of more than 65%.Laredo will use the sale proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing its $1.4 billion debt as on July 30. Interest savings arising from debt reduction along with favorable expected market conditions and production growth is likely to make the firm well positioned to become cash flow neutral by the end of 2019. The deal will also provide the firm with enough financial flexibility to focus on core operations and accelerate drilling activities in the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations.

In-field lines will be used to connect the new fixed platform with the existing platform. Apart from the EPCI obligation, TechnipFMC will assume the manufacturing and pre-commissioning works of the rigid and flexible lines and provide required subsea equipment.The project is located in Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. TechnipFMC has existing operations in Brazil and plans to use its local expertise as well as the global state of the art pipelay fleet for the project. The company previously worked on the surface trees package in this project. The offshore campaign is expected to start in 2019.5.    Domestic energy explorer Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) finally settled a lawsuit filed by two families in Dimock, Pennsylvania.  Cabot Oil & Gas was accused of contaminating groundwater in the Pennsylvania town.Cabot Oil & Gas ramped up drilling activities in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale in 2008. In 2009, 15 Dimock families moved court against the company claiming that the drilling operations were responsible for polluting drinking water. However, all the residents made an out-of-court settlement except the families of Ely and Hubert.In March 2016, a jury of 10 issued a ruling holding the company guilty of groundwater contamination. The jury directed the company to pay $2.75 million to Elys and $1.49 million to Huberts. However, in March 2017, the U.S. Magistrate Judge Martin C. Carlson, overruled the jury’s $4.2 million award for the Dimock plaintiffs on account of weakness and irregularities in their testimony and arguments as well as missteps by their attorney. Carlson also turned down Cabot Oil & Gas’s request to pass a judgment in favor of the company and ordered a fresh trial.However, the oil and gas producer and the Dimock families have finally managed to reach a settlement, though the terms of the settlement remain undisclosed. This brings the decade long controversy to a close.

709,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed an above-average increase in natural gas supplies. However, bullish weather forecasts and lower-than-expected power loss from Hurricane Irma propped up prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Larger-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 91 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Sep 8, 2017, marginally above the guidance (of 88 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Worse, the increase was higher than both last year’s addition of 58 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 63 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.311 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – to widen its surplus to the five-year average to 43 Bcf (1.3%), while stocks are still 179 Bcf (5.1%) below the year-ago figure.Fundamentally speaking, supply remained unchanged on a weekly basis at 79.2 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption declined 4.1% to 63.8 Bcf. The flattish supply could be attributed to stagnant dry natural gas production. On the demand side, the fall was triggered by sharply lower power consumption in Florida on the back of cool weather and demand loss associated with Hurricane Irma. This was partly offset by elevated residential/commercial demand due to high temperatures in parts of the Northeast and Midwest.Futures End Up Despite Bearish EIA DataShrugging off EIA’s latest commentary, natural gas prices rose 4.6% last week to settle at $3.024 per MMBtu on Friday as investors chose to concentrate on warmer-than-normal weather predictions (translating into higher cooling gas demand) toward the end of September. Prices were further supported by suggestions that the demand destruction from Irma was less than expected.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances.

710,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed an above-average increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded down. Worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of Hurricane Irma-related power outages further pushed down natural gas prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: In-Line Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 65 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Sep 1, 2017, at par with the guidance as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.However, the increase was higher than both last year’s addition of 38 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 58 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.220 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – to slightly widen its surplus to the five-year average to 15 Bcf (0.5%), while stocks are still 212 Bcf (6.2%) below the year-ago figure.The largely unsupportive data prompted natural gas prices to fall 1.9 cents (or 0.6%) to $2.981 per MMBtu on Thursday.Fundamentally speaking, supply rose 2.3% on a weekly basis to 79 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption declined 1.5% to 66.5 Bcf. The increase in supply could be attributed to higher dry natural gas production. On the demand side, the fall was triggered by sharply lower residential and commercial consumption. Meanwhile, Mexican gas exports were up some 5.1% to inch up closer to pre-Hurricane Harvey levels.Prices Suffer From Irma Impact The aftermath of Hurricane Irma also weighed on natural gas prices.With the storm cutting off electricity to at least 4.5 million customers in Florida, power and manufacturing sector consumption will be depressed for the next several days. The big storm has also brought cool temperatures to the region, limiting air conditioning demand. This prompted natural gas to end down 5.9% for the week to $2.89 per MMBtu.Further, Irma-induced demand losses – following on the heels of Hurricane Harvey’s disruptions – are set to translate into big storage builds over the coming weeks, extending the two-year old supply glut and pressurizing prices.The perceived short-term price weakness from the above factors might negatively impact natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report). Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming LNG and Mexican exports, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output. The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the five-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on. Over time, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now?If you are still looking for a near term natural gas play, Range Resources Corp.

711,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a below-average increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded up. However, worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of Tropical Storm Harvey-related power outages are expected to keep natural gas prices in check.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: Below Average Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 30 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Aug 25, 2017, slightly above the guidance (of 29 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.However, the increase was lower than both last year’s addition of 46 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 67 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.155 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – narrow its surplus to the five-year average to just 8 Bcf (0.3%), while stocks have now fallen 239 Bcf (7%) below the year-ago figure.The largely supportive data prompted natural gas prices to climb 10.1 cents (or 3.4%) to $3.04 per MMBtu on Thursday.Fundamentally speaking, supply fell 1.9% on a weekly basis to 77.2 Bcf per day, while daily natural gas consumption declined 10.4% to 67.4 Bcf. The steep decrease in demand was triggered by sharply lower power burn. Meanwhile, Mexican gas exports were down some 11.4% as Hurricane Harvey hampered pipeline shipments.Prices to Suffer Temporarily from Harvey Impact Despite yesterday’s rise in natural gas prices, the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey is expected to weigh on the commodity in the near-to-medium term due to the following reasons.Depressed power and manufacturing sector demands due to temporary electricity outages for the next several days. The big storm has also brought cool temperatures to the region, limiting air conditioning demand.  Harvey has disrupted piped U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico by shutting down/damaging infrastructure.  Finally, Hurricane Harvey-induced demand losses would translate into big storage builds over the coming weeks, extending the two-year old supply glut.The perceived short-term price weakness from the above factors might negatively impact natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp.

However, there are apprehensions that the peak summer demand will begin to recede within the next few weeks. In any case, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances.

712,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed an in-line increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded up. However, worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and Tropical Storm Harvey-related power outages offset the gains and pushed down natural gas prices to week-ago levels.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: In-Line Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 43 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Aug 18, 2017, within the guided range (of 39–50 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.While the increase was higher than last year’s addition of 12 Bcf, it was well under the 5-year (2012-2016) average injection of 53 Bcf for the reported week. This caused the current storage level – at 3.125 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – narrow its surplus to the five-year average to 45 Bcf (1.5%). Meanwhile, total stocks are 223 Bcf (6.7%) lower than last year’s levels at this time. The supportive data prompted natural gas prices to climb 2.1 cents (or 0.7%) to $2.949 per MMBtu on Thursday.  Prices Suffer from Harvey ImpactEventually, the commodity ended the week at $2.892 per MMBtu, essentially unchanged for the period as the initial optimism over a modest storage addition was offset by weather and Tropical Storm Harvey-related worries.Firstly, the electricity generation fuel sold off as investors took note of cooler weather predictions (translating into tepid heating gas demand) for the week ahead. Natural gas was also down on concerns of depressed power and manufacturing sector demands due to temporary electricity outages for the next several days caused by Tropical Storm Harvey. However, with the big storm playing havoc with around 23% of total Gulf natural gas output and half of the nation’s gas processing plant capacity, the commodity’s price is set for a spike on supply disruptions.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the natural gas demand situation looks promising with warmer-than-average conditions set to prevail in most U.S. pockets over the next few days and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand.

713,COG,"Energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reiterated New York Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) decision to stall the pipeline. The court’s ruling came as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.The project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The 121 mile natural gas pipeline, which runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County, had been planned to transport natural gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in the North East. The $750 million project has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas each day. The pipeline aimed to address the problems of transportation infrastructure in the Northeast region and speed up shipments from the prolific Marcellus and Utica basins.The project was expected to become operational in 2015, but got delayed due to lengthy review process, pushing the in-service date to late 2016. The project received the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) approval in early 2016. However, DEC had rejected water quality permit to the pipeline in 2016 owing to its possibility of impacting the ecology and climate adversely.  DEC claimed that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project properly and that the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams.Concurrently, the pipeline owners filed a lawsuit challenging DEC’s decision. FERC granted the developers additional two years for a thorough review and completion. The $750 million pipeline project had also drawn much censure from various activists and environmental groups as they were of the opinion that the project will have negative impact on public health and environment.Nevertheless, the owners of the pipeline still were optimistic about their five-year project that received President Trump’s support and challenged DEC’s decision. However, the court dismissed the lawsuit.The decision reverses FERC’s approval received by the project. Also the company has been directed to reassess the environmental impacts of the pipeline.Oklahoma-based Williams Companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

714,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the build outpaced the five-year average for the first time in six weeks.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Larger-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 53 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Aug 11, 2017, above the guidance (of 47 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Worse, the increase was higher than both last year’s build of 23 Bcf and the five-year (2012–2016) average addition of 50 Bcf for the reported week. Following past week’s climb, the current storage level – at 3.082 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – is now 55 Bcf (1.8%) above the five-year average although stocks are 254 Bcf (7.6%) lower than the year-ago figure.The above-average build in natural gas inventories – first in six weeks – initially instilled pessimism and prompted spurts of selling.Storage Revision Comes to the Rescue However, natural gas futures actually rose later that day to finish Thursday at $2.929 per MMBtu, up 3.9 cents (or 1.4%) from Wednesday’s close. The trigger to the rally was EIA’s bullish stocks data revisions for the weeks ending Jun 30 through Aug 4 associated with the reclassification from working gas to base gas. More than offsetting the effects of the bearish inventory report on prices, the revisions cut stocks for the week ended Aug 4 by 9 Bcf from EIA’s previous estimates.Still, Prices Fell for the Week Notwithstanding the positive revisions by the EIA, natural gas slumped around 3% for the week to end Friday at $2.8933 per MMBtu as investors were keen to book profits after surges over the prior two weeks.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the natural gas demand situation looks promising with warmer-than-average conditions set to prevail in most U.S. pockets over the next few days and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand.

717,COG,"Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) intends to expedite its divestment program for 2018, per Reuters. The company plans to divest C$8 billion ($6.4 billion) worth of assets. The number is more than double of its previous divestment goal.BackgroundIn November last year, the company stated that it has figured out C$10 billion worth of non-core assets. Of the total, the company expected to monetize at least C$3 billion in 2018 through the divestment of some unregulated midstream natural gas assets and onshore renewable operations.Divestment RationaleWith growing pressure from the investors and rating firms, the company recently decided to boost the divestment program. Credit rating agencies Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) & Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) rated the company’s debt as BBB+ and Baa3 — among the lower investment grade ratings. Any downgrade by the rating agencies will make the company’s bond non investment grade. Hence, it is a serious matter of concern as Enbridge will not be able to raise debt capital in favorable terms for financing growth projects if there is a downgrade in credit ratings.In the last few years, the company's debt increased strongly. Importantly, during the first nine months of 2017, long-term debt has risen more than 75% while cash balance declined 59%, reflecting weak financials. It has a long-term debt of C$61.4 billion and debt to capitalization ratio of 50.1%.The company expects the divestment program to strengthen its balance sheet by fast debt reduction. The sale is also expected to increase its free cash flow and support its dividend hike program. Notably, the company has increased its annual dividend payout for more than 10 years.Price PerformanceEnbridge has lost 18.2% in the last year compared with 9.7% decline of its industry.About Enbridge Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta in Canada, Enbridge is a leading energy infrastructure company. One of its businesses is the transportation of energy through the most extensive and advanced crude and liquids pipeline system that spreads globally.

720,COG,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its 50% stake in the Scarborough gas field offshore Western Australia to Woodside Petroleum Ltd for $744 million. The gas field is located in the Carnarvon Basin.Divestment RationaleThe divestment can shrink ExxonMobil's risky asset portfolio and give an opportunity to focus on comparatively cheaper offshore liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) prospects in Papua New Guinea, Mozambique and others.Moreover, the company was of the opinion that the economic development of the gas field involved a few challenges like water depth, resource characteristics and execution complexities. With production unlikely to start before 2025, short-run payoff from the field is not available.Additionally, offshore drilling is excessively expensive that might dent the company’s cash flow. The Scarborough project’s overall estimated cost was $9.7 billion. ExxonMobil’s move is likely to enable the company to improve its cash flow situation.About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas firm. The company has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base, both in terms of business mix and geographical footprint. It has three operating segments: Upstream, Downstream and Chemical.Following the shale revolution, the area along the Gulf Coast boasts plentiful supply of oil and gas. ExxonMobil is expected to capitalize on the availability of cheap natural gas to manufacture chemicals as well as energy efficient plastics for export. In other words, the company will cater to growing demand for chemicals and refined fuels, by taking advantage of the shale revolution. Hence, the company is expected to generate significant cash flows from its downstream operations in the long run.ExxonMobil has lost 7.9% of its value in the last year, against 5% rise witnessed by the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Suncor Energy Inc.

721,COG,"Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) recently announced two acquisitions: one at Syncrude oil sands project and the other at Fenja Development, an offshore project.Syncrude DealSuncor has agreed to buy 5% interest in the Syncrude project from its partner Mocal Energy and increase its share in the joint venture. Per Suncor, the deal, which is valued at $730 million, is expected to close by March. The effective date of the transaction is Jan 1, 2018. The deal increases Suncor's interest in the project to 58.74%. We note that Suncor’s share of production from the Syncrude operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 174,400 barrels per day (Bbl/d) compared with 187,000 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter.Deal RationaleThe transaction is expected to add a capacity of 17,500 barrels a day of light sweet synthetic crude to the company's portfolio. The move is in line with the company's strategy to invest in projects that would help grow shareholder value in the coming years, apart from a vote of confidence in the long-term future of oil sands.In a similar move, Suncor increased 2.26% working interest in the Fort Hills project, which it bought from Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) last month.Fenja DevelopmentLocated in the Norwegian Sea, the Fenja field is supposed to start production in 2021. Suncor Energy Norge AS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Suncor, acquired 17.5% interest in the Fenja Development from Faroe Petroleum. The deal — valued at $54.5 million — is anticipated to be over by the second quarter of this year.Suncor has VNG Norge, Point Resources and Faroe Petroleum as partners in the project with 30%, 45% and 7.5% interests, respectively. Suncor is expected to invest C$280 million as its share of go-forward capital in the project.Deal RationaleThe transaction is expected to add a lesser risked asset to Suncor's offshore portfolio. The move is anticipated to assure profitable growth for the company in the long term. Price PerformanceSuncor has gained 4.6% in the last year against 12.6% decline of its industry. About Suncor Energy Calgary, Alberta-based Suncor Energy is Canada’s premier integrated energy company. Suncor's operations include oil sands development and upgrade, conventional and offshore crude oil and gas production, petroleum refining, and product marketing under the Petro-Canada brand. It is one of the largest owners of oil sands in the world. The company has gained new oil sands properties to supplement its existing operations in northern Alberta, making it the dominant producer in the region where reserves are second only to Saudi Arabia. Suncor’s business can be divided into three main segments: Oil Sands, Exploration and Production, and Refining and Marketing.Through its aggressive expense management, Suncor has been able to lower its cash costs amid the industry downturn. This has helped the company take advantage of the rebound in oil prices. Moreover, Suncor's healthy financial profile allows it to pay an attractive dividend while pursuing an aggressive share repurchase program. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSuncor Energy has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

722,COG,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its oil and gas reserves grew 19% in 2017 owing to growth in several places like the U.S. shale, the United Arab Emirates and Guyana. ExxonMobil reported its reserve update following its fourth-quarter earnings, which failed to meet expectations. In 2017, the company added 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to its reserves, which marks 183% production replacement. It brings the company's total proved reserves to 21.2 billion BOE. ExxonMobil believes that the proved reserves hold significant development opportunities, which can grow shareholder value in the coming years. Of the total proved reserves, 57% was liquids, which increased by 4% from 53% in 2016. At the current production rate of the company, its reserves are expected to last for 14 years. The company, with higher profitability ratios and lower leverage than the industry, is poised to yield higher values in the long run. ExxonMobil spent more than $6 billion in 2017 to increase its presence in the Permian Basin. The company added more than 800 million BOE to its reserves in the basin. The Upper Zakum field in the United Arab Emirates contributed another 800 million BOE. The company's Guyana assets provided proved reserves of 3.2 billion BOE, where it is partnering with Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) and others.We note that ExxonMobil had reduced its proved reserves in 2016 by 3.3 billion BOE, most of which was due to the writedowns of the Canadian oil sands assets' value in the low crude-price environment. The current rebound in oil prices has made some of those devalued assets profitable for the company. It provided ExxonMobil 900 million BOE of proved reserves. The company's press release stated, ""ExxonMobil’s resource base totaled approximately 97 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2017, taking into account field revisions, production and asset sales.""About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas firm.

723,COG,"Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) recently announced that the company has agreed to sell liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") to China National Petroleum Corporation (“CNPC”) through two sale and purchase agreements. The deal marks China's first ever long-term contract targeted to import U.S. LNG. Following the news of the deal, Cheniere Energy stock jumped 4.6% last Friday.Cheniere Energy and CNPC signed a memorandum of understanding during President Trump’s visit to China last November, which resulted in this deal.Deal DetailsPer the deal, Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC and Cheniere Marketing International LLP, two of Cheniere Energy’s units will sell around 1.2 million tons of LNG per year to PetroChina International Company Limited, which is wholly owned by PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report).  State-run CNPC is the owner of PetroChina Company. The deal requires Cheniere Energy to start part of the supply this year while the rest is slated for 2023. Both parts of the deal are expected to continue through 2043. Cheniere Energy and CNPC have agreed keep LNG price indexed to the Henry Hub price. The LNG price will also assume a fixed component.Deal RationaleThis long-term deal is crucial for the natural gas exporter and is expected to help Cheniere Energy with its development plans. The company is still at the expansion stage, which means high capital spending and cash outflow in the foreseeable future. Cheniere Energy expects the deal to support its Corpus Christi Train 3 development in Texas, which saddled the company with a substantial leverage and credit burden. The company has a long-term debt to capital ratio of 95.8%, much higher than the industry's 49.3%.Moreover, the deal enables Cheniere Energy to meet the rising demand for LNG in China and strengthens its hold in Asia. Per China's pollution control measures, the use of coal for heating purposes is expected to go down. It will give a boost to LNG demand in the country in the coming years. By 2030, China is believed to become the largest LNG importer.Price PerformanceCheniere Energy has gained 15.5% in the last year versus the 22.9% fall of its industry.About Cheniere EnergyHouston, TX-based Cheniere Energy - founded in 1983 - is primarily engaged in businesses related to liquefied natural gas through its two business segments: LNG terminal, and LNG and natural gas marketing. The company boasts of low-cost gas resources.Being the first company to receive Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in Cameron Parish, LA, Cheniere Energy enjoys a distinct competitive advantage over other players to ship overseas. However, exporting natural gas – by setting up large liquefication plants – is a very capital-intensive undertaking, with each unit running up multi-billion dollar bills. This has translated into a huge debt load for Cheniere Energy - currently nearly $25 billion.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCheniere Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report)and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).  Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

724,COG,"Italian oil giant Eni S.p.A. (E  -  Free Report) recently reported the discovery of a potential natural gas field at the Calypso prospect, located in Block 6 offshore Cyprus. The company has partnered with France's Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) for the development of the field. With both the companies having 50% stake, Eni is the operator in the field. The government officials of Cyprus believe this is the second significant discovery in the Cypriot exclusive economic zone, since the discovery of around 5 trillion cubic feet in 2011. The company drilled a well, Calypso 1 NFW, in 2,074 meters of water depth. The rocks in the well are from the Miocene and Cretaceous age. Per Eni, the geology of the new finding is similar to its Zohr prospect in offshore Egypt, whose reserves were estimated at more than 30 trillion cubic feet by the company. Eni commenced natural gas production in the field in December 2017. The newfound prospect is 80 kilometers away from the Zohr field.Although the company is yet to announce the gas volume of the Calypso prospect - which requires further analysis to determine options – an Israel-based news website, Globes reported that the new prospect might hold 170-230 billion cubic meters of natural gas.Notably, the new finding poses a risk of geopolitical rivalry between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, where the latter is internationally recognized and has its neighbors' support.Price PerformanceEni has gained 8.2% in the last year compared with 6.2% growth of its industry.About Eni Based in Rome, Italy, Eni is an integrated energy player. The company has operations in 73 countries. The company explores for oil and gas and trades oil, gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and electricity. The company was founded in 1953.We believe that Eni’s constant efforts to expand its upstream operations in Cyprus, Egypt, Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan and Kenya will go a long way in generating profitable growth in the future. Moreover, new upstream projects in Ghana and Angola, Indonesia, Mexico will support Eni's oil production growth.Zacks Rank and Key PicksEni carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

725,COG,"Canadian energy giant Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of 63 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Strong refined product sales, reduced total expenses and higher crude price realizations drove the company’s earnings. In the year-ago quarter, the company posted earnings of 29 cents a share. Quarterly operating earnings came in at C$1,310 million compared with C$636 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase of 106%. Meanwhile, quarterly revenues of C$3,941 million increased from C$3,352 million in the year-ago quarter.Suncor Energy Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Suncor Energy Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Suncor Energy Inc. QuoteProductionTotal upstream production in the reported quarter was 736,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), which decreased marginally from the prior-year level of 738,500 BOE/d. The decline in production was due to a drop in output from the Syncrude operations and the Exploration and Production segment.Oil Sands operations volume was 446,800 barrels per day (Bbl/d) compared with 433,400 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter. The increase can be attributed to improved mining and extraction reliability and record Firebag production, partially offset by the lower production at MacKay River.Production from Syncrude operations was 174,400 Bbl/d compared with 187,000 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was due to the lower upgrader reliability. In the quarter under review, the Syncrude upgrader reliability was 94% lower than year-ago quarter’s 102%.Suncor’s Exploration and Production segment (consisting of International and Offshore and Natural Gas segments) produced 115,200 BOE/d compared with 118,100 BOE/d in the prior-year quarter. Lower offshore production drove the company’s results, partially offset by the increased output in Libya.Notably, Suncor’s newly commissioned Hebron asset started production in this quarter, ahead of its schedule.Also, refinery utilization came in at 94% compared with 93% in the year-ago quarter.Product SalesThe company’s refined product sales of 526,800 Bbl/d increased from the prior-year quarter level of 514,800 Bbl/d owing to strong reliability at most of Suncor’s refineries. It was partially offset by the impact of Montreal refinery’s third-party power outage.ExpensesTotal expenses in the reported quarter declined to C$7,156 million from C$7,415 million in the year-ago quarter. The company’s financing expenses decreased C$225 million compared with C$532 million incurred in the year-ago quarter.  Lower exploration, depreciation and transportation expenses also lowered expenses. The results were partly offset by increased costs related to purchase of crude oil and products.Balance Sheet & Capital ExpendituresAs of Dec 31, 2017, Suncor had cash and cash equivalents of C$2,672 million and total long-term debt of C$13,372 million. The total debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 25.6%. The company incurred capital expenditures of C$1,444 million in the quarter under review.Dividend and Share RepurchaseSuncor returned C$526 million to shareholders through dividends and bought back C$835 million of outstanding shares in fourth-quarter 2017.Dividend HikeThe company’s board members have approved a 12.5% hike in its quarterly dividend. Suncor will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 36 cents per share. This translates to an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 26, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Mar 5.GuidanceThe full-year outlook range for E&P production is envisioned to lie within 105,000-115,000 Boe/d.  The same for Syncrude production is projected between 150,000 Bbls/d and165,000 Bbls/d.  Furthermore, the full-year outlook range for Syncrude cash operating costs anticipated to lie in the $32.50-$35.50/bbl band.For 2018, the estimated capex came in at $4.5-$5 billion.Q4 Price PerformanceIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Suncor has gained 4.8% compared with 2.3% rise of its industry.About the CompanyCalgary, Alberta-based Suncor is Canada’s premier integrated energy company.

726,COG,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) posted lower-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017, thanks to lower refinery throughput. This was partially offset by higher liquid price realizations.The company reported adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. Also, the bottom line fell from the year-ago quarter level of 90 cents.Total revenues in the quarter increased to $66,515 million from $56,399 million a year ago. However, the top line failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74,444 million.     Operational PerformanceUpstream: Quarterly earnings — excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments —  were $2.5 billion, reflecting an improvement of $1 billion from the year-ago quarter. Increased price realizations from liquids drove the upside.Production averaged 3.991 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), lower than 4.121 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter.Liquid production fell year over year to 2.251 million barrels per day.

However, it compares favorably with the year-ago quarter’s adjusted loss of 7 cents.Results were driven by improvement in the commodity pricing environment which in turn led to higher realized natural gas prices.Houston, TX-based Cabot’s quarterly revenues improved 86.5% year over year to $460.5 million and was marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $459 million.Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteVolume AnalysisCabot’s overall production during the quarter totaled 173.1 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) – 96% gas – up 14% from the prior-year quarter volume of 151.8 Bcfe.

735,COG,"The second-quarter earnings season is picking up pace with several companies reporting financial results this week. In fact, as many as 117 S&P 500 members are set to release their quarterly results this week.So far, 171 S&P 500 members – 34.2% of the index’s total market capitalization – have reported second-quarter results. Per the Earnings Trends report, dated Jul 26, total earnings for these companies increased 8.8% on 3.4% growth in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. While 78.9% companies beat earnings estimates, 70.8% posted better-than-expected revenues.We are in the thick of this earnings season, with more than 44% S&P 500 members expected to release numbers by the end of this week.At this stage, we don’t have too many results from the Energy sector.Energy Sector’s PerformanceLast year, Energy was the strongest S&P sector performer with a solid return of 24%. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal managed to alleviate a supply glut to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement and the encouraging outlook for oil stocks.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017, while the oil industry is pinning hopes on a turnaround. True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest in 19 months.However, the situation is strikingly different now, with the commodity floundering in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had shed more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices declined 14.3% for the first half of the year,  registering the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared with the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to scale a massive 271.4% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top line is likely to show growth of 15.1% from second-quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 28Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with June quarter numbers on Jul 28.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 95 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. The quarterly earnings also increased from 43 cents recorded a year ago. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.46%.  Our proven model does not conclusively show that ExxonMobil will beat estimates this quarter. This is because ExxonMobil has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Exxon Mobil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Exxon Mobil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Exxon Mobil Corporation QuoteContract drilling services provider Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell. It was formerly known as Baker Hughes and is based in Houston, U.S.Baker Hughes has a mixed history, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four reports. For the quarter to be reported, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Baker Hughes Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Baker Hughes Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Baker Hughes Incorporated QuoteAn independent energy exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental U.S., Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report), is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this Houston, TX-headquartered upstream player recorded earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The results were hamstrung by higher costs but received a boost from higher production.Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an unenviable record. It missed estimates in one of the last four quarters, was in line in two quarters and beat estimates in one.An earnings beat looks unlikely for Cabot. For the quarter to be reported, Cabot has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #4. Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteSan Ramon, CA-based Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) is a leading integrated energy player in the world.  The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive as it delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 32.36% over the last four quarters.Our proven model does not conclusively show that an earnings beat is likely for Chevron in Q2, This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Chevron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Chevron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Chevron Corporation QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

736,COG,"Upstream Energy firm Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 28.Headquartered in Texas, Cabot is independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental U.S. Cabot has a dismal earnings surprise history. The company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 0.89% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayBeing an upstream firm, weakness in the commodity prices might lower exploration and production activities. During the second quarter, the price of oil and natural gas declined by 8.4% and 5%, respectively. With natural gas prices trading barely above $3 per MMBtu during most part of the second quarter and Cabot being one of the most gas-weighted E&Ps, the company's earnings and revenues are under pressure.High capital spending and project delays are also major causes for concern. Cabot is likely to spend $845 million in 2017 more than twice of the 2016 spending level of around $375 million. This might lower the company's cash flows. Further, the company’s much criticized Constitution Pipeline project is grappling with lawsuits and is expected to get substantially delayed or even cancelled. This also accounts for our bleak earnings outlook for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cabot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -6.25%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 16 cents.Zacks Rank: Cabot currently carries a Zacks Rank #4. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.StocksWith Favorable Combination While an earnings beat looks uncertain for Cabot, here are some firms in the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12.5% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release earnings on Jul 31.

737,COG,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies following which the commodity traded up. Moreover, optimism over the fuel’s strong demand on the back of bullish weather predictions further spurred natural gas prices.About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report – brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 – includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays.Analysis of the Data: A Smaller-than-Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 57 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended July 7, 2017, below the guidance (of 59 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider. Moreover, the increase was lower than both last year’s addition of 61 Bcf and the 5-year (2012-2016) average net injection of 72 Bcf for the reported week.This caused the current storage level – at 2.945 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – narrow its surplus to the five-year average to 172 Bcf (6.2%), while stocks have now fallen 289 Bcf (8.9%) below the year-ago figure.The bullish build in natural gas inventories instilled optimism and prompted spurts of buying. As a result, the commodity spiked 4.1% for the week to end Friday at $2.98 per MMBtu. Apart from the EIA data, the electricity generation fuel also got a lift from investors who took note of hot weather predictions (translating into strong heating gas demand) for the week ahead.Positive Long-Term ThesisDespite occasional hiccups, the natural gas demand situation looks promising with hot conditions set to prevail in most U.S. pockets in the later part of July and power generators burning more gas to meet intensifying cooling demand.In any case, long-term fundamentals for the commodity continue to be supportive on the back of structural imbalances. While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year, the growing use of liquefied natural gas (or LNG), booming exports to Mexico, replacing coal-fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output. The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the 5-year average in the near future, with deficits piling up later on.Over the summer, these secular tailwinds are likely to support natural gas sentiment and price.Which Stocks to Bet OnThe perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas-heavy upstream companies like Rice Energy Inc. , Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report).However, each of these firms has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which means that investors should preferably wait for a better entry point before buying shares in them.In case you are looking for natural gas names for your portfolio, one could opt for Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report). It has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With domestic prices remaining constrained on the back of abundant supplies, the company sees a big opportunity in selling U.S. natural gas production at higher prices overseas. Houston, TX-based Cheniere Energy is the only liquefied natural gas exporter of the U.S. and plans to turn the commodity’s glut into export revolution, currently exporting to over 20 countries.The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this company is for a loss of 13 cents, representing some 93.1% earnings per share growth over 2016. Next year’s average forecast is 56 cents, pointing to another 514.8% growth.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
