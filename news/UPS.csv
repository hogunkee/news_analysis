To do so, the web retailer is encouraging people to start their own delivery businesses.XFor those in the U.S. willing to strike out on their own in the service of the e-commerce giant, the Amazon delivery program will offer financial and operational support, the company says. Startup costs can be as low as $10,000.

The screen also includes China names Baozun (BZUN) and Alibaba (BABA).ZTO Express is an express delivery firm with a market capitalization of around $12.8 billion. It's very liquid with an average daily volume of 2.7 million shares.It was an inauspicious debut for ZTO Express when it went public in October 2016 at 19.50 a share. The good news at the time was that it priced above the proposed range of 16.50 to 18.50 a share. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the underwriters. The bad news is that the stock headed lower after its first week of trading. Shares fell about 35% over the next four months.Fast forward to today, however, and a booming e-commerce market in China is fueling growth at ZTO Express. Just like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) deliver packages for Amazon.com (AMZN), ZTO Express does the same for Alibaba.Earlier this month, the company reported adjusted profit of 17 cents a share, up 70% from the year-ago quarter. The results marked the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Sales growth, meanwhile, accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, rising 48% to $563.4 million.Parcel volume in the fourth quarter totaled 2.015 billion, up 35.8% from the year-ago period.

Both held steady for the week.The White House in June imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imported to the U.S. from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said in a June 3 Fox News interview that those initial tariffs closed loopholes that had led to ""several decades of abuse.""A month later, Canada retaliated. On July 1 it hoisted in-kind trade penalties against U.S. steel and aluminum.

8,UPS,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

12,UPS,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

13,UPS,"Last week's rally, led by the Nasdaq composite, signaled the stock market is looking healthier. But which stocks and sectors are likely to lead?The FANG+ stocks of Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) generally have been performing well. Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% above fair value. Keep in mind that Dow Jones futures and other overnight action doesn't always translate into actual trading in the next regular session.China's Shanghai composite roared 2.5% higher on Monday, after tumbling into a bear market in recent weeks. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3%. and Japan's Nikkei 1.2%. European markets showed modest gains intraday.During last week's holiday-shortened week, the stock market averages were volatile but ultimately rallied. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.4%, the S&P 500 1.5% and the Dow Jones 0.8%. Friday's post-jobs, post-China tariffs rally was particularly significant. If you haven't already, you should read the latest Big Picture column.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength. Mastercard (MA) and Dow Jones component Visa (V) have been consolidating near record highs for a few weeks, finding support around their 50-day or 10-week lines. Square (SQ) has also been acting well.

14,UPS,"Magna International (MGA) plans to engineer and build electric vehicles in China, marking the first time North America's largest auto parts supplier is expanding its car manufacturing capabilities beyond its 20-year-old Steyr venture.XThe Aurora, Ontario-based company is forming two joint ventures with China's largest EV maker, Beijing Electric Vehicle Co., known as BJEV. The engineering and manufacturing ventures are set to take over an existing factory in Zhenjiang with the intention of producing vehicles by 2020, Magna said in a statement Monday. Bloomberg News reported in February that Magna was in talks with BJEV's parent for an EV pact.China surpassed the U.S. in 2015 as the largest market for EVs, helped by government subsidies and stringent emissions rules. A local facility in China helps Magna enter the fast-growing market while potentially helping it to lessen the impact of any increases in export costs resulting from the intensifying trade spat between the U.S. and China.Owned by Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co., the parent of BJEV, the Zhenjiang plant has the capacity to build 180,000 vehicles a year and it will also offer engineering and complete vehicle manufacturing services to other customers.

15,UPS,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year. GE stock rebounded after falling to multiyear lows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

North America sales rose 3%, bucking three straight quarters of year-over-year declines. The world's largest athletic apparel brand also announced a $15 billion share buyback program. Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%. The largest IPO was BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ), which raised $637.5 million, as shares rose 29% on the first day. Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS. Shares retreated.Lennar (LEN) stock popped after it demolished earnings estimates on Tuesday, though the largest U.S. homebuilder fell back later in the week. Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents.

16,UPS,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) keeps on shining. Lead manager Thomas Galvin has been at the helm almost 15 years. And over the past 15 years this growth fund has outpaced 86% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar.com, with an average annual return of 11.44% vs. 9.65% for its peers, going into Thursday.That outperformance has been fueled by focusing on stocks with superior earnings growth opportunities and attractive valuations. The ""select"" part of the $4 billion fund's name refers to the managers' concentrated approach, focusing on just their highest conviction ideas such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM) and Nvidia (NVDA).And the managers apply quantitative tools to manage risk. In a nutshell, a key step is to limit holdings' correlations, so their stocks are not vulnerable to the same risks.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseManagers Thomas Galvin, Richard Carter and Todd Herget each focus on different sectors, looking for companies that sustain above-average earning growth. They look for companies driven by secular opportunities rather than cyclical ups and downs.""We try to find companies that will grow their sales and earnings two times over the broader market,"" Carter said.On average, companies in the S&P 500 Index grew earnings about 6% annually from 1960 through 2017, Carter says. He and his teammates look for companies that are growing earnings more than 12% a year. On average, they end up picking companies posting earnings growth closer to 18% to 20%.""If we can find companies that are growing faster than the broader market, while improving and maintaining margins and returns on invested capital, we think that's a high-growth opportunity,"" Carter said.It's a best-ideas growth fund that holds 25 to 35 stocks. Carter says they're not trying to benefit from easy earnings comparisons year-over-year or quick spikes in energy prices or interest rates that are more cyclical in nature.Instead, this growth fund seeks firms benefiting from secular themes involving demographics, innovation, productivity and low costs. They want companies gaining market share, generating returns on equity above the market and balance sheets with little or no debt.Carter says 50% of the portfolio consists of established growth companies. The other 50% consists of emerging growth companies.Established growth companies are familiar names with stable profits, growing earnings by about 10% to 15%. This includes names such as Visa (V) and Nike (NKE).Emerging growth companies are raising earnings much faster, typically between about 20% and 30%, such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA).With only a $15 billion market cap, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, which is stealing market share from both department stores and drugstores. Its sales growth is four times the entire retail sector, Carter says.One of this growth fund's long-term plays is Booking Holdings (BKNG), which includes online travel agencies Booking.com and Priceline. The fund originally bought the stock in 2009 at 100 per share. Now it's trading around 2,122.""In 2009, it was growing earnings north of 30%,"" Carter said. ""Today it's closer to 15% to 20%. We've owned it the entire time. It's gone from an emerging growth name to a more established growth name. It had high returns on equity when we bought it and it still does.""PayPal (PYPL) benefits as e-commerce grows as a share of U.S. GDP. It's the largest market share payments platform in the online world. It's growing quarterly sales north of 20% and earnings around 30%. It has strong ROE.

17,UPS,"A trade war. Rising interest rates. Anti-EU sentiment in Europe. A nuclear showdown with North Korea. After a series of worries — or even shocks — to start the year, what jolts await in the stock market forecast for the next six months?After an unusually calm and productive 2017 for the major stock indexes, 2018 has been like a ride over sand dunes. The S&P 500 ended a 10-month winning streak in February. The market that seemed unflappable in 2017 became sensitive to headlines and faced new risks.The first tremors came Feb. 5. Stocks plunged as new inflation signs sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to a four-year high of 2.88%. The Nasdaq went on to slide nearly 12% in February, its worst decline in two years. For the first time since June 2016, IBD's market outlook was downgraded to ""correction.""The market recovered, but the volatility remains with the recent gyrations over the tit-for-tat trade drama.""We're in the late stages of one of the longest bull markets in U.S. history, and this year's volatility comes as investors wonder when and how it could end. Every potential threat is magnified,"" Christopher M. Hyzy, chief investment officer for Bank of America Global Wealth & Investment Management, said in a midyear review.Yet for all its mood swings, the stock market made progress in the first half comparable to the six-month mark of 2017. The Nasdaq is still the leader, up 8.8%, with the S&P 500 up just 1.7%. At the end of June 2017, the Nasdaq was up 14.1% and the S&P 500 8.2%. The Dow has lagged more. It's down 1.8% compared with a year-ago gain of 8%.Growth investors who have navigated the ups and down have found plenty of opportunities. Dozens of breakouts have resulted in sizable gains. Heart implant maker Abiomed (ABMD) soared as much as 125% from a breakout in early January. Adobe Systems (ADBE) climbed nearly 40% from a January breakout. Leaderboard, one of two IBD stock-picking products, is up about 18% in the first six months.But the current stock market faces big hurdles. Trade disputes with China, Canada and other nations threaten to raise costs for many industries and consumers. Some fear President Trump's tariffs may trigger a full-blown trade war and a recession. The Federal Reserve has signaled four interest-rate increases for this year, one more than was forecast at the end of last year. Foreign markets are much weaker than a year ago. Will these risks derail the market?Right now the IBD's Market Pulse puts the rally under pressure. Think of it as a caution flag in the wake of heavy selling in the latest week. But if the Nasdaq and S&P 500 can regain their footing yet again and push higher for the rest of year, the credit will likely go to four themes driving the current stock market.By asset class, small-cap stocks have been a big driver of the 2018 market. The Russell 2000 is up 7%. That's nearly as much as the Nasdaq, which has been dominated by major gains from Amazon (AMZN) (45%) and Netflix (NFLX) (105%). President Trump's push for import tariffs and retaliatory moves have made small caps relatively more attractive because of their domestic focus. In other words, small-cap stocks have less exposure to foreign markets.There are other reasons. Last year's tax cut reduced the effective tax rate of Russell 2000 companies from 33% to 21%, says Scott Hood, CEO and Portfolio Manager for First Wilshire Securities, a Los Angeles firm that specializes in small caps.By sector, technology, health care and financials have contributed the most to small caps' performance. This year's outperformance in small-cap stocks reflects a shift from a period that saw big caps dominate, Hood says.""Small cap returns are similar to large caps for the trailing five, four and three years, but small caps begin to pull ahead in periods of two years or shorter,"" Hood said.But value stocks have lagged among small-cap stocks. It's been the growth camp of small caps that shouldered the increase. The Russell 2000 growth index is up about 15% this year, vs. 8% for the Russell 2000 value index.Larger stocks show a similar trend. The S&P 500 Value index declined 3.5%, while the S&P 500 Growth index was more than 6% higher over the same period.Big earnings gains typically drive the best stocks higher. The same generally is true for the overall stock market. S&P 500 earnings growth in the first quarter topped 20% for the first since 2010, extending a sharp recovery in profits. S&P earnings rose 25% in Q1 as nine of 11 S&P sector posted double-digit gains, according to FactSet. Q1 also had a record number of profit surprises, with 77% of companies beating EPS estimates. That ties for the highest since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. Technology had the highest percentage of beats: 90% of companies exceeded earnings forecasts.But the excellent earnings didn't necessarily translate to big rewards for shareholders. Stocks often had a muted response to strong results, and data show it's getting harder to impress investors.S&P 500 companies that beat expectations in Q1 saw their share prices rise a modest 0.2% on average in the two days before and the two days after the earnings report, FactSet found. That's way below the five-year average increase of 1.1% for earnings beaters. That's the fifth consecutive quarter that profit winners lag the five-year average. In Q2 and Q4 of last year, the price reaction to positive profits was negative, on average.As profits expand, comparisons will become harder to beat. Some moderation in profit growth is expected. FactSet estimates that for the second quarter, companies are expected to report earnings growth of 19% and revenue gains of 8.7%. For Q3, earnings are expected to grow 21.4% and revenue 7.5%. For Q4, profits are seen rising 17.2% and revenue 5.8%. For the whole of 2018, earnings are estimated to rise 19.8% and sales 7.6%. Upward revisions to these numbers would push the market higher, while lowered expectations could become a serious drag.Among 67 stocks in IBD's database that went public this year, the average gain from the IPO price is more than 30%. That includes winners such as Huya (HUYA), DocuSign (DOCU) and iQiyi (IQ), which have given back big chunks of their advances.The IPOX index, which tracks stocks that have gone public in a trailing four-year period, is up 7.5% this year. That's in line with the Jan. 1-June 22 average for the past five years of 8.3%, according to Chicago-based IPOX Schuster. From a year-ago level, the index was up 21.7%.Pay special attention to new companies that are profitable and growing, or at least expect to turn profitable. Take Huya, which analysts expect will grow earnings in the triple digits the next two years.In 2017, foreign stocks and ETFs generally performed about as well as Wall Street. Many experts expected them to outperform in 2018 partly due to high U.S. stock valuations. But in fact, the U.S. is nearly alone, far outperforming major global indexes and emerging markets.Each region and country seems to have its own reason for flopping this year, whether it was corruption, trade squabbles, a populist wave or a commodity shock. But if there was a single factor that touched foreign markets, it's been the strength of the U.S. dollar, says Dina Ting, Head of Global Index Portfolio Management at Franklin Templeton's LibertyShares ETF family.In Asia, for example, Japan is a bedrock of good valuations, low unemployment and solid fundamentals, Ting says. Brazil, where the Bovespa's 20% drop this year, would qualify as a bear market, and Templeton sees an attractive market. The firm offers exposure to Brazil with its Franklin FTSE Brazil ETF (FLBR). Brazil's sell-off, Ting adds, ""has been priced into the markets already.""IBD's 2018 market outlook on Jan. 1 noted that since 1963, the S&P 500 averages a 7.5% gain in the years following a 15% or higher annual gain. So far this year, the S&P lags that average, but is still higher.The question is: Will this continue? The return of market volatility makes forecasting the second half of 2018 more difficult. Three factors loom large.Companies facing new tariffs were punished twice: first by the risk of higher costs and then by investors who sold off shares. On June 21, for example, Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) warned that Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made cars will likely hurt profits. Daimler's U.S. shares fell 4.5% on the news; Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) skidded 5.9%. Many Chinese stocks were bludgeoned in June as tariff issues intensified.Each headline on tariffs also shook the broad stock market. But with no clear direction on tariff policy, U.S. indexes often battled back from tariff-related selling. For example, on June 20, when the European Commission approved a 25% duty on $3.2 billion of imports on U.S. products, the Nasdaq made a new high.The looming trade war is the biggest uncertainty on Wall Street. While all-out conflict has yet to materialize, some economists sense a growing danger. President Trump's mercurial views on the subject only add to the uncertainty.""A decline in confidence and supply chain disruptions could amplify the trade shock, leading to an outright recession,"" Michelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist, warned in a research note. ""We continue to believe that the probability of a full blown trade war is low, but the risks are rising and it remains a key uncertainty to our outlook.""As the Federal Reserve has grown hawkish, the yield curve has flattened. Some analysts wonder if the Fed will overshoot its target, the type of policy error that has marred the central bank in the past. Just like it was in February when the stock market crumpled, monetary risk remains an issue with broad implications.Whenever the yield on the 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, it's a pretty good signal that a recession looms. The U.S. is not there yet, but the trend is headed in that direction. The spread between the two yields was 100 basis points a year ago. Today, it is around 35 basis points.""We are actually concerned about the shape of the yield curve because market worries of a 'Fed mistake' are gaining real traction,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a June 18 note. ""The yield curve seems destined to go to zero in the next 3 to 6 months. After that, the recession fuse is lit and stocks can still rise but they are living on borrowed time.""Polls continue to show the Republican Party losing control of the House of Representatives in November, although the margin is narrowing. But with Senate control and Trump in office, the GOP would still wield considerable power in Washington.""We think it is fair to say that markets have embraced the business-friendly aspects of a Trump White House and Republican-controlled Congress. At the margin, they would therefore prefer this status quo over a shift in House control to Democrats,"" Colas said on June 21.""The cross currents of sector/market cap returns year to date do not indicate a strong market view on midterm elections. ... Regional bank stocks — one group with clear exposure to Republican-led deregulation — have done well this year. While a Democrat-led House could not reverse recent bank-friendly moves, they could certainly stop any future initiatives. This is certainly one group to watch going into midterms.""It's impossible to predict the stock market one month out, let alone to the end of the year. But so far the 2018 stock market shows scant signs of a major breakdown. The IBD/TIPP Poll in June saw its Economic Optimism Index at 53.9, well above the 50 neutral level. Americans' view of their personal finances strengthened. The six-month economic outlook was at 51.2, below 55-plus readings in the two months after President Trump signed the tax cuts into law in December.The unemployment rate in June was close to a 50-year low. The Conference Board forecasts GDP will accelerated in the second quarter to 3.3% (from a 2% rise in Q1) and increase a bit more to 3.5% in Q3 and Q4.The IBD 50 list of the market's best growth stocks is up more than 16% this year, outpacing even the hot Nasdaq and Russell 2000. The leading sectors include software, apparel, retail, health care and consumer stocks — hardly a picture of despair.To be sure, growth stocks are relatively pricey. Value stocks are at the cheapest levels since at least 2005, while growth stocks are at the highest relative valuation since 2005.""All this suggests that it might be viewed as a good time to rotate into value and out of growth. We don't necessarily agree,"" wrote CFRA Research Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell. ""While valuation is important, we can't ignore that technology accounts for at least 40% of the Growth indices (and only 7% of the Value index). Because of that, we believe the growth rally can continue over the next several months, if not through the end of this year.""While cautioning that the U.S. economic expansion is in the late innings, Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2800 to 2900, up 4.8% to 8.5%.""Our favorable outlook for most U.S. equities is based on a broadening economic recovery, driven by household and business spending,"" strategists Sameer Samana and Scott Wren wrote in the bank's 2018 Midyear Outlook. ""Faster economic growth and modest inflation should drive corporate sales growth."" The corporate tax cut should result in ""significant margin expansion.""Other institutions echo those sentiments. Wells Fargo's main picks for the remainder of 2018 are financials, industrials and consumer discretionary — cyclical sectors that tend to benefit the most from rising interest rates.A choppy market makes it harder for investors to hold for sizable profits.

The Nasdaq was just below recent highs and the S&P 500 was eyeing the 2,800 mark.(For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Currencies were central to Wednesday's early action across global markets, after the People's Central Bank of China hoisted its reference rate above the high end of economist expectations. The bank set the rate, which links the yuan to the dollar, at 6.4586. The surprise move halted the yuan's steep, two-day slide. It also eased global concerns that China might devalue the yuan and allow its stock markets to suffer the consequences in response to the country's trade standoff with the U.S.China's stock markets responded by kicking up out of mixed trade to a solid finish. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 0.8%, but remained down 2% for the week.Global currencies reacted to the PBOC move with an uptick in confidence. The euro rose against the dollar, while the dollar gained vs. the yen. Government bond run-ups in Germany and the U.S. paused. That led investors in Japan to send Tokyo's Nikkei 225 up 1.2% in a volatile session that included an early selloff, followed by a rush of investors snapping up devalued stocks.Europe's markets picked up on the positive tone, but were off highs in afternoon trade. London's FTSE defended a 1% gain in afternoon trade. Miner Glencore and home grocery delivery leader Ocado topped the FTSE 100.

19,UPS,"Dow Jones futures were little changed late Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. President Donald Trump has approved a revised China tariffs list, according to multiple reports. Adobe Systems (ADBE) topped earnings views and guided higher, but its stock fell. AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) rose late as the Justice Department won't seek to stay Tuesday's court ruling blessing their merger. Meanwhile, red-hot Chinese livestreaming IPOs iQiyi (IQ), Huya (HUYA) and Bilibili (BILI) extended big gains from the regular session.During the regular session, the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly to a new high, fueled by strong gains in FANG stocks such as Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB), with software and internet IPOs (including iQiyi, Huay and Bilibili) continuing to shine. The S&P 500 index rose slightly, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped as energy and retail stocks slumped.Dow Jones futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. So were S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed a fraction.President Donald Trump reportedly has approved tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with a revised list affected products. The official announcement will come Friday, though it's not clear when the tariffs will go into effect.

The IBD 50 stock also guided higher for the current Q3.Despite the seemingly positive news, Adobe stock fell 3.4% in late trade. That action offers three lessons for investors.Don't buy an extended stock: Adobe has run up 38.5% since its January breakout. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has consistently hit new highs. While Adobe could keep running, it would not be surprising to see Adobe pull back for a short period or consolidate over a period of weeks or months.Be cautious about buying a stock into earnings: Earnings reports are high risk, high reward. A strong report can send a stock soaring, but huge losses are also possible. Adobe's after-hours action is relatively muted give the stock's recent run. But investors should consider buying call options to minimize the downside risk while reaping any upside gains.Don't trust after-hours action: Whether it's Adobe stock or Dow Jones futures, overnight action doesn't always translate into trading in the next regular session. Perhaps Adobe will pull back modestly on Friday. But the stock could show a sharper loss or close with a gain.The Justice Department won't seek a stay to Tuesday night's federal court ruling. That would let the AT&T-Time Warner merger close, though the DOJ later could appeal the ruling itself. Time Warner stock rose 2% after hours. AT&T stock edged higher.During the regular session, Baidu (BIDU) spinoff iQiyi ran up nearly 17%, YY (YY) spinoff Huya jumped 13%, and Bilibili climbed 2.1%.

20,UPS,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months. Another 25% of consumers, or 30.1 million households, said they would consider trying one in the next six months.I am now one of the 9%. In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon. Even New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady is jumping in the game by partnering with a veggie-oriented service called Purple Carrot.Meal-kit discounts are getting more plentiful, so the margins are bound to get tighter for them all. You wonder why any company would make the effort, particularly if the cost curve is getting steeper.So far, only one pure-play meal kit provider in the U.S. has gone public, Blue Apron, and its stock is trading near 3, down 72% from its 11 IPO price in June 2017. Blue Apron has yet to turn a profit, and its sales have declined in the past two quarters.HelloFresh is traded on public markets, but only on its home court in Germany. After some ups and downs, the stock has a 2018 gain of 9%. Sales growth is strong, but like Blue Apron, the company is not yet profitable.At first blush, shelling out money for the privilege of slaving over a hot stove seemed unappealing when I could pay just a little more for someone else to do that for me at a restaurant. Not only do they place a meal before me, they do so while I'm sipping a cocktail.I also don't do that much cooking at my house. I do a lot of eating, as evidenced by my formidable girth. And don't get me wrong, I can cook. I grew up in a family that did a lot of work in restaurants. I just don't cook much anymore. It's one of many reasons my wife should be considered for sainthood.Third, my local grocery store — Ralphs, a California chain owned by Kroger (KR) — is less than one block away from my house. Ordering something online and having it delivered seems supremely lazy given my geographical situation, and waistline. But should I get even cheaper and lazier, my local store says it may soon be among the Ralphs stores offering prepackaged meal kits from Home Chef. And I hear the prices may be more inviting.That said, there's plenty to like about meal kits. It's not just the smells. The tastes were quite good, too. There wasn't a bad meal, even though I fumbled the cooking chores a couple of times.The aim of meal kits is to make cooking simple. If you can read, you can cook using this method. You just have to follow directions, which shouldn't be that hard.One plus is you're introduced to cuisine you normally wouldn't cook. Instead of Tuesday's rubber chicken, you can have the elegant-sounding Steak Moutarde with roasted sweet potato wedges. Still insist on poultry? They can dress that up, too. There's the aforementioned chicken Marsala with Linguine and roasted broccoli with goat cheese on the side. No rubber included.You also might encounter a wealth of new ingredients and tastes you never knew existed. Ever heard of Gochujang red pepper sauce? How about shredded Chihuahua cheese? I discovered those, plus Tumari sauce, Fregola Sarda Pasta and a cooking wine known as Verjus Blanc. What's great is if you find you don't like any of these, you're only allotted what you need for that meal. No waste.Further, you get a certain satisfaction from cooking the meal yourself. People who never thought they could cook probably will discover they can.Guys can fool their girlfriends into thinking they're debonair, at least for an evening. Busy people can do it in relatively short order, though probably not in the compressed time frame the makers of meal kits claim. And lazy husbands can help out their soon-to-be-canonized wives.Here are some of the highlights I personally encountered on my prepackaged culinary adventure. In order, we used Blue Apron, HelloFresh, Walmart, Chef'D via Amazon, Freshly and Home Chef.

So, IBD readers will likely not be surprised to see as many as four of the 16 individual stocks that hit the Sector Leaders screen come from this key section of the economy.With unemployment near record lows and consumer spending revving up, medical care firms stand to benefit. Americans are more willing to spend on improving their health. In IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups (please see Page B7 in IBD Weekly), the medical products group ranks No. 1 in six-month progress, up from 11th six weeks ago.

A true market leader will storm out of bases throughout its run. Bases are nothing more than periods of time when a stock peaks, corrects in price, bottoms out, rises back near the old highs, and breaks out to new highs.For Abiomed, a five-week flat base with a 200.38 correct buy point produced a breakout on Jan. 5. In April it broke out of another flat base at 304.38.If a good stock has broken out, look for rebounds off the 10-week moving average. The first two instances offer a secondary opportunity to establish a position or add a small amount of shares to an existing one. Abiomed bounced off its 10-week line near 290 during the week ended April 27. Volume increased above the 10-week average. Then the next week, turnover really shot up as the large-cap medical device firm rallied 16% and hit new highs.Align Technology (ALGN), HealthEquity (HQY) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) have also gone on steep run-ups after their breakouts.Notice on a weekly chart how Align, developer of the Invisalign orthodontic braces, has staged a seven-week winning streak. Along the way, the stock cleared a 280.33 entry within a base that showed the essential elements of a cup with handle.

30,UPS,"The corporate-gymnastics maneuver known as the reverse takeover has become the marijuana industry's preferred path to going public in Canada. That deal, in which a private company absorbs most of a public one, gives smaller Canadian producers access to capital. For U.S. businesses, it offers an avenue to a fully legal market.XThere's just one problem: As cannabis and blockchain businesses race for cash in Canada, observers see signs of a thinning supply of public companies, free of legal baggage and liabilities, that could be used easily as vehicles for prospective owners.""The cannabis companies are competing with crypto for those shell companies,"" said Alex Coleman, CEO of cannabis company TILT Holdings, which announced a four-way merger last week.Many of Canada's so-called shell companies are mining stocks in name only but are dormant operationally. Some shell companies were swept up and dropped during acquisitions past, and now linger on as stock market leftovers.Or, they exist solely to be lapped up via a reverse takeover. Industry players talk about the difficulty of finding so-called ""clean shells,"" or companies not saddled with liability.But amid the rush of blockchain and marijuana companies to scoop them up, the remaining ""clean"" shell companies find themselves with greater influence.""There's certainly been more leverage being put into the hands of some of these shell companies, particularly for U.S. cannabis businesses,"" said Jonathan Sherman, an associate at Cassels Brock, a law firm that advises on the marijuana industry.Cassels Brock, in a recent report, said frequent use of shell companies for reverse takeovers had led to a ""shortage."" Demand, it said, has spiked. The available shell companies thus have greater ability to negotiate better, higher-priced deals for themselves.Those deals are increasingly important to marijuana companies in the U.S., which still prohibits pot on a federal level.U.S.-based marijuana cultivator and retailer MedMen plans to go public in Canada via such a deal. That expansion will be aided by its joint-venture agreement with Canadian pot producer Cronos Group (CRON). Green Thumb Industries, based in Chicago, announced plans to go public in Canada via a reverse takeover.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTo be sure, marijuana companies still have the option of going public via an initial public offering.But more cannabis companies are using reverse takeovers with the hopes of drawing less heat from regulators. However, experts debate whether those deals are faster than traditional IPOs.In an RTO, a private company's shareholders receive enough shares of a public company to become majority owners of the public company. The public company often takes on the name and operations of the private one doing the acquiring.But financial disclosures can get complicated with a reverse takeover, the Cassels Brock report said. Investors generally regard IPOs as being more upfront.A marijuana company seeking to go public also has to appease shareholders of the public company it's acquiring. Increasingly, that means the private company's shareholders get a smaller piece of the pie once the deal closes.""Because the shell company generally has existing shareholders which become shareholders of the post-RTO public company, the existing shareholders of the operating company acquiring the shell have their overall stake in the company reduced to accommodate the shareholders of the shell,"" Cam Mingay, a securities lawyer at Cassels Brock, said in an email.The firm says shareholders of the company acquiring the shell have had their ownership into the post-RTO company reduced by as much as 13% in some recent deals. That figure compares to 3% historically, the firm said.The marijuana industry's scramble to reverse-takeover its way onto Canadian exchanges has resulted in some unlikely tie-ups — particularly with idled mining companies that are still publicly listed.""Resuscitated junior mining companies have inherent value for cannabis investment because they are already publicly listed, and do not have to undergo a full securities commission review or file a prospectus in order to access public money,"" Canna Law Group, a law firm that supports marijuana businesses, said in a blog post in March.""They are perfect vehicles to raise money quickly,"" the post continued. ""As such, many new entrants go public via a reverse takeover and use the old mining company (or oil and gas company) shell as the listing vehicle.""Coleman, of TILT Holdings, said it's ""very challenging"" today to find a shell company without a lot of baggage.The four-way merger set to become TILT is made up of three U.S. companies and one in Canada. The one in Canada, Sante Veritas Holdings was formerly known as Marchwell Ventures, once an online marketing company.Marchwell changed its name to Sante Veritas Holdings after it agreed to a reverse takeover by a company called Sante Veritas Therapeutics, a move intended to create a marijuana company. The closing of that deal was announced on April 25.Marchwell and Sante Veritas Therapeutics first announced that they wanted to combine late last year. But Coleman said finding the right shell company wasn't as difficult in the run-up to the deal.""To find a clean shell company that you could successfully merge into was much easier when Sante Veritas got involved,"" he said.More Canadian cannabis companies could go public via a more traditional IPO when recreational legalization takes hold this year. But whether IPOs become more popular depends on whether Canada's chartered banks get more involved, Sherman said.""Real IPOs are quite rare in the cannabis space in Canada (or the U.S.),"" Alan Brochstein, a partner at New Cannabis Ventures, a cannabis news and information site focused on the industry, said over email. He said there were more than a dozen Canadian-listed companies focused on the U.S.For U.S. marijuana companies, Sherman said, reverse takeovers will likely remain the preferred route to public trading.

40,UPS,"Coming soon to a cinema near you — you can make this happen; read on — is a bite-your-nails true-story thriller featuring heroes, villains and a history-making struggle over ... the Constitution's Takings Clause. Next Feb. 24, ""Little Pink House"" will win the Oscar for best picture if Hollywood's political preening contains even a scintilla of sincerity about speaking truth to power.In 1997, New London, Connecticut, was experiencing hard times. Its government decided, as governments always do, that it wanted more revenues. A private entity, the New London Development Corp. (NLDC), wanted to entice the Pfizer pharmaceutical corporation, which was about to introduce a popular blue pill, to locate a research facility on land adjacent to a blue-collar residential neighborhood. The city empowered the NLDC to wield the awesome, potentially life-shattering power of eminent domain if, as happened, it failed to persuade all the homeowners to sell for an upscale private development to ""complement"" Pfizer's facility. Some, led by Susette Kelo (played by Catherine Keener, two-time Oscar nominee), refused.Kelo's tormentor is an oily NLDC operative (played by Emmy-nominee Jeanne Tripplehorn) who is fluent in the pitter-patter of crony capitalism: The NLDC will make New London ""vital and hip"" using a public-private ""collaboration"" wherein uprooted homeowners will be ""part of our team"" because ""social justice and economic development go hand in hand"" as the NLDC integrates ""the infrastructure of large corporations to the brass-tacks needs of our city's most ...""Kelo's plight got the attention of the Institute for Justice (IJ), aka the fourth branch of government, nonprofit libertarian litigators who prod the third branch (the judiciary) to police the excesses of the other two. IJ lost, but won.Kelo lost 4-3 in Connecticut's Supreme Court and 5-4 in the U.S. Supreme Court, which accepted New London's sophistical argument that virtually erased the Constitution's circumscription of government's eminent domain power. This used to be limited by the notably explicit Fifth Amendment, which says ""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation"" (emphasis added).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Constitution's Framers intended the adjective ""public"" to do what the rest of the Bill of Rights does: limit government's power. Government could take private property only for the purpose of creating things — roads, bridges, tunnels, public buildings — directly owned by government or primarily used by the general public. In 1954, however, to facilitate slum clearance in the District of Columbia, the concept of ""public use"" was stretched to encompass eradicating ""blight,"" an expansion exploited nationwide by corporations in cahoots with city governments that found blight in cracked sidewalks or loose awning supports.To seize Kelo's pink house, New London did not assert blight. Instead, it argued that ""public use"" is synonymous with ""public benefit,"" and that the public would benefit from Pfizer paying more taxes than would Kelo and her neighbors. During oral arguments, Justice Antonin Scalia distilled New London's argument: ""You can take from A to give to B if B pays more taxes."" In a dissent joined by William Rehnquist, Clarence Thomas and Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor warned that the decision's consequences ""will not be random"": Factions whose affluence makes them desirable taxpayers and whose political influence makes them politically potent will join governments in seizing the property of low-income citizens who are not as lucrative for local governments.By getting the U.S. Supreme Court's attention, and eliciting strong dissents that highlight the horribleness of the majority's decision, Kelo and IJ ignited national revulsion that has produced new state limitations on eminent domain, limitations that re-establish the Framers' intentions.The movie, representing the vanishingly small category of ""Movies for Grown-ups,"" has just debuted in New London, where government economic planning ended predictably badly: Pfizer came, exhausted its subsidies, then departed, leaving a vacant lot where the pink house once stood.

But on Tuesday, the count rose to the most in five weeks, according to preliminary data. This would be another sign that the market uptrend is real.Bullishness, though, isn't shared everywhere. The banks have had trouble getting credit for any earnings report.Goldman Sachs became the latest big bank to report strong quarterly results and then shrug off the performance. Goldman's earnings came in well above estimates. But the stock reversed to a 1.8% loss in heavy volume.Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) reported a 51% increase in earnings, above the consensus estimate. The narrow beat earned a slap in the face as the superregional stock fell 3.5%.The banks recently have shown that the most dangerous thing for them is to beat earnings estimates.Besides topping earnings expectations by about 25%, Goldman boosted its dividend by 5 cents to 80 cents a share.Other big banks did just fine Tuesday. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) rose 0.4%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was flat. Bank of America (BAC) added 0.4%.Why the trouble among banks and their earnings beats? Uncertainty surrounds the proposed changes to the Dodd-Frank law. Banks don't like the Dodd-Frank regulations, but the Republicans have not been able to unite on a plan to either repeal or amend the law.The selling in bank stocks could be profit-taking, given the run-ups many banks enjoyed in 2017.Meanwhile, Apple is showing that no news can be good news. Apple rose 1.4% as it notched its ninth gain in 11 sessions. This was accomplished without an earnings report.Apple will report quarterly results May 1 after the close. The stock is only 3% off its high, forming a base with a 183.60 buy point.Analysts expect Apple's quarterly earnings to jump 29% to $2.70 a share. A 29% gain would be Apple's best in 10 quarters.The 50-day line had been a problem since mid- to late March for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. The indexes broke above the 50-day line Tuesday morning and closed above the line with no trouble along the way.A close above the line helps validate the market's uptrend.If the 50-day line has been converted from resistance into support, the next resistance area would be at the 7500 price level for the Nasdaq and the 2800 area for the S&P 500.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The stock surged 5.7% to clear a 79.50 buy point in a flat base. The pattern, though, is a late-stage one.Chemical products maker Celanese (CE) gapped up about 4%. The stock broke above a 109.35 buy point in a double-bottom base. A double-bottom base is shaped like the letter W. The middle peak is the buy point.Meanwhile, the FANG stocks were up without exception midday Tuesday. Facebook (FB) added 2%, Amazon.com (AMZN) rose about 4%, Netfix (NFLX) jumped 9%, and Alphabet (GOOGL) picked up 3%.Netflix's gain came after reporting results and strong subscriber growth late Monday.Some stocks made new highs, but strong volume was missing. For example, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) rose 2% to clear a 236.10 buy point in a base-on-base pattern.

42,UPS,"Stock market futures rose strongly Tuesday morning after blowout subscriber growth and bullish guidance from Netflix (NFLX) late Monday, with the major market averages likely to test or surpass a key support level.Fellow FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) showed fractional gains, while Netflix's China partner, iQiyi (IQ), continued to add to its recent breakout. But Lam Research's (LRCX) earnings on Tuesday may be more important for the stock market rally.During Monday's session, the Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.9% gain but was unable to close above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index advanced 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7%.Stock market futures jumped. Nasdaq 100 futures, boosted by Netflix, advanced 0.9% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.7%. Dow Jones futures were up 0.75%, helped as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) edged higher after topping views early Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt those gains, the Dow Jones would clear the 50-day line at the open, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 coming to that level.Leaderboard stock Netflix earned 64 cents a share in the first quarter, up 60% vs. a year earlier, meeting or just beating views depending on what consensus forecast is used. The internet TV giant added 7.41 million streaming subscribers, above its target for 6.35 million. Netflix jumped nearly 7% in premarket trading.Netflix may not have huge coattails, though. Amazon (Amazon Prime Video), Alphabet (Google YouTube) and Facebook (Facebook Watch) all have competing video products, but those aren't their primary revenue and profit drivers. All three FANG stocks rose less than 1% in the premarket.Baidu (BIDU)-unit iQiyi, which came public at 18 in late March, rose 1.3% in the premarket. The so-called ""Netflix of China"" actually licenses Netflix content for its streaming service. The stock cleared a very short IPO-base buy point at 18.30 last week and is now extended, rising 2.1% to 19.74 on Monday.Keep in mind that overnight trading in individual stocks or Dow Jones futures often doesn't translate into how the stock market will trade in the next regular session.Lam Research reports earnings after Tuesday's market close. Analysts expect a 56% earnings gain to $4.36 a share, with revenue soaring 32% to $2.85 billion. Lam has topped EPS targets in each of the past six quarters.Lam shares fell 0.1% to 203.55 in the stock market today, holding above its 50-day line. The stock is working on a new consolidation, but does not yet have a proper buy point.It's a top-rated big-cap tech stock, but why is it so important?Lam Research kicks off earnings for the semiconductor sector, which typically is a leader or contributor in tech rallies. Chips account for a big share of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index. Chips also are in just about every tech product. So if chip stock stocks are faring well, there's a good bet that chip demand is strong, and thus demand for a variety of tech gear is also strong.And yet, chip stocks have been lagging the S&P 500 index since the market peaked just over a month ago. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or Philly Sox, is finding resistance at its 50-day moving average, like the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq.Not all semiconductors are struggling. Chip giant Intel (INTC) has formed a flat base with a 53.88 buy point. Intel rose 1% to 52.40 on Monday.Lam Research also has some notable exposure to the memory-chip market. Memory-chip makers, including giant Micron Technology (MU) and recent IPO Smart Global Holdings (SGH), were screaming higher until the recent market correction.

Revenue is also derived from advertising.Spotify reported revenue of $4.99 billion in 2017, up 38% from the prior year, and an operating loss of $461 million, up from a loss of $426 million in 2016.In addition to Apple Music and Amazon Music, Spotify says its competitors include Google Play Music owned by Alphabet (GOOGL), as well as Pandora (P).Spotify says it has 159 million monthly active users and 71 million premium subscribers as of Dec. 31, and believes it is nearly double the scale of its closest competitor, Apple.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest stock market winners typically make their major price moves within a few months or years of their initial public offering.

45,UPS,"Danger lurks for hospital patients in a place they'd least expect it — the bed. Hospitals claim to disinfect beds in between patients. Don't believe it. Data from four New York hospitals prove beds are full of germs. Patients are nearly six times as likely to come down with staph, strep or another dangerous infection if the patient who used the bed before them had it.Columbia University researchers found being in a bed previously used by a patient with an infection ups your own risk of infection by 583%, according to the current issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology. The researchers conclude that ""enhanced cleaning measures"" are needed.No kidding. Adequate cleaning is more vital now than ever, because germs are getting deadlier. On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that ""nightmare bacteria"" — causing infections that cannot be cured with most antibiotics — are spreading throughout U.S. hospitals. Fifty percent of patients who get these infections die.Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, said she was shocked by the extent of the spread. ""These genes are lurking in American patients and they are spreading in hospitals,"" warns Dr. Amesh Adalja, of Johns Hopkins University. The CDC is urging more ""aggressive"" infection control measures.They should start by cleaning mattresses better and inspecting for leaks in mattress covers. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration warned hospitals for the second time about the toxic brew that can build up inside a mattress. Covers should be routinely removed, so the contents can be inspected. ""If blood or body fluids from one patient penetrate and get absorbed in a mattress, the fluids can leak out the next time the mattress is used,"" harming the next patient.Research in the American Journal of Infection Control shows that half of hospital mattresses have drug-resistant bacteria on them. They're literal hotbeds of germs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYour hospital bed has an enormous impact on how well you survive your stay. ""Patients are exposed to the mattress; they're lying on it for hours,"" says Xavier University health professor Edmond Hooker.And it's the history of who was in the bed that matters most. If the patient occupying the bed before you was given antibiotics, your risk of getting C. diff, the most prevalent hospital infection, goes up by 22%. That's a serious threat. At least 29,000 patients are killed by C. diff each year.How does it happen? Antibiotics cause patients who have C. diff germs in their gastrointestinal tract to shed those germs on the mattress, bedframe, bedside table and other nearby surfaces. These germs lie in wait to sicken the next patient placed in the bed. Kevin Brown, at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, explains that about half of hospital patients take antibiotics. That's a huge number of beds potentially contaminated with C. diff.Hospitals ignore the risk because they're rushed to turn over rooms, Hooker explains. The hospital ""has patients coming out of the operating room, patients in the emergency room.""The remedy, say Columbia researchers, is for hospitals to adopt high-tech cleaning methods that disinfect an entire room, including the bed, in a few minutes.That would also protect patients from another big risk researchers identified — having a hospital roommate who is infected or unknowingly carrying an organism such as strep, staph, Enterococci or Pseudomonas. That situation quadruples your risk of becoming infected yourself. Doctors and nurses pick up bacteria off one patient's bed and surroundings, and then carry the germs on their hands, gloves and lab coats to the next patient's bed.According to the CDC, drug-resistant bacteria are spreading through hospitals ""like a wildfire."" The Columbia investigators made it clear what has to be done — more thorough cleaning. ""Current standards for cleaning and disinfection"" are insufficient, raising the risk of infection 5 to 6 fold. Hospitals had better pay attention.Other columns by Betsy McCaughey

It called the technology ""ground-breaking"" at the time and said Thursday it remains the Tesla Semi's largest pre-order to date. Earlier in 2017, UPS said it would start using three medium-duty electric trucks from Daimler (DDAIF) Trucks Fuso brand, called the eCanter.The Workhorse-designed electric trucks are said to improve fuel efficiency by 400% and deliver a range of roughly 100 miles between charges, to meet the needs of urban deliveries.UPS did not specify a cost for the Workhorse electric trucks nor when they would start to be built. However, it said they would be tested in Atlanta, Dallas and Los Angeles, ahead of deployment of ""a larger fleet in 2019 and beyond."" The Semi, which Tesla is said to produce in 2019, is slated to sell for a base price of $150,000 with a 300-mile range.""The all-electric trucks will deliver by day and re-charge overnight,"" said Carlton Rose, UPS president of global fleet maintenance, while making note of rapid improvements in battery technology, charging time and smart grid networks.The UPS move comes as countries around the world, led by China, gear to eventually phase out vehicles powered by conventional fossil fuels. Automakers from the U.S. and across the globe have announced bold EV production targets in response. General Motors[ticker symb=GM] plans to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. Ford Motor[ticker symb=F] plans to invest $11 billion in electric vehicles and produce 40 electrified vehicles by 2022.

Both have invested heavily to expand their networks to handle e-commerce shipments. Even so, UPS suffered high costs in the fourth quarter due to high holiday shipping volumes.Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications, said that the WSJ headline ""demonstrates a lack of basic understanding of the full scale of the global transportation industry.""  FedEx pointed to a video stressing its vast global infrastructure.

They are more likely to attract and retain clients if they know how to build rapport, speak clearly and listen well.Sterling Neblett, a certified financial planner in McLean, Va., cites two self-help classics as his favorite books: ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie and ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill.""They go together,"" Neblett said. ""Carnegie helped me with my communication skills and being more empathetic in understanding where people are coming from and taking their perspective. Hill talks about having a positive attitude — a mental state of how to think about money and make it work for you, rather than you work for it.""Advisors spend countless hours talking about money. They calm nervous investors during volatile markets, coach savers to stay the course and recommend investment vehicles.With all this emphasis on tracking cash flow and attaining financial security, it's no wonder that some advisors rave about books that transcend the world of dollars and cents in favor of loftier concepts.In 2006, Neal Van Zutphen came across ""Authentic Happiness"" at a bookstore. The author, Martin Seligman, presents groundbreaking research in the field of positive psychology.""I was skeptical at first,"" said Van Zutphen, a certified financial planner in Tempe, Ariz. ""But I found the book has self-actualizing exercises to explore how we can create a happier and more fulfilling life. Money is necessary for life, but it's not the primary driver of happiness.""He sometimes gives the book to clients to encourage them to savor their life.

But there are shorter works that attract a loyal following.Tony D'Amico, a certified financial planner in Strongsville, Ohio, enjoys Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) annual shareholder letter. Written by legendary investor and Berkshire Chief Executive Warren Buffett, the letter conveys a spirit of optimism that D'Amico finds reassuring.""He believes that the economy will do well over time and that people shouldn't bet against America,"" he said.

52,UPS,"Subsidies: Amazon's stock price took a hit after news that President Trump wants to ""take on"" the company for a host of alleged abuses. Most of Trump's complaints are misguided or plain wrong. Except for the part where he says that taxpayers are subsidizing Amazon's shipping costs.The news site Axios — founded by establishment journalists Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei — reported last Wednesday that Trump is ""obsessed with Amazon (AMZN)"" and has ""wondered if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.""Trump, the story says, complains that the company ""is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers,"" which is no doubt upsetting to someone who made a fortune in the building trade.""He's an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores,"" Axios reports.The story had an immediate impact on Amazon's stock price, which at one point was down more than 7%.Given the unreliability of the mainstream press to cover Trump accurately, it's not unreasonable to question whether Axios has this story right.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the White House didn't exactly challenge the article, saying only that the Trump administration doesn't have any specific policy changes in mind right now.And Trump has regularly put Amazon in his cross hairs.During the Republican primaries in early 2016, Trump complained that ""Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise"" and that CEO Jeff Bezos has ""huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much.""Last June, Trump complained again that it is ""not paying internet taxes (which they should).""In August, he said that the company ""is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!""And in December he tweeted: ""Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!""O Saturday, Trump was at it again, taking to Twitter to restate these complaints and say ""This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!""Let's take these complaints in order.First, Trump is simply wrong to say that Amazon isn't paying ""internet taxes."" When he sent that tweet out last year, Amazon was collecting and remitting state sales taxes for every state that imposes them, even though federal law only requires companies to collect sales taxes in states where they have a physical presence.The second claim — that many jobs are being lost because Amazon is hurting brick and mortar retail outlets — is both wrong and misguided.There are 2.4 million more people working in the retail industry today than when Bezos founded the company in his garage 24 years ago. And the overall jobless rate, which was 6.1% in July 1994, is now down to 4.1%.There's no question that Amazon is disrupting the retail business. Just look at the recent announcement that Toys 'R' Us was closing all its stores. This is just the latest in an ever-growing list of traditional retailers who are struggling.But this isn't a bad thing. It is precisely what should happen in a free-market economy. Newer, better, more efficient ways of doing business are constantly supplanting old ways. It's what economist Joseph Schumpeter aptly called the ""gale of creative destruction.""The internet would be disrupting traditional business, with or without Bezos. Complaining about it is like saying that Apple was doing ""great damage"" in the early 1980s by hurting IBM's mainframe business, or that Henry Ford should be attacked for putting buggy makers out of business.The pace of change can be unsettling, but it's far better than the alternative — which would be a stagnant economy.Trump does have a point, however, about the Postal Service, which is unfairly subsidizing Amazon's deliveries.The reason stems from a congressional mandate that the Postal Service allocate 5.5% of its fixed costs to package delivery. This was supposed to prevent the government-run USPS from unfairly competing with private sector delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. But it backfired.Today, more than 25% of the Postal Service's revenue is package delivery. That means the USPS can effectively shift much of the cost of its package delivery onto its first-class mail service.An analysis by Citigroup last year found that, as a result, Amazon is getting a subsidy of $1.46 for every package the USPS delivers on its behalf.""It is as if every Amazon box comes with a dollar or two stapled to the packing slip — a gift card from Uncle Sam,"" explained Josh Sandbulte, co-president of money management firm Greenhaven Associates.But this isn't Amazon's fault. It's the fault of Congress and the fact that the Postal Service remains a government-run monopoly that gets $18 billion in taxpayer subsidies each year. Bashing Amazon does nothing to change this.If Trump wants to fix this subsidy problem, he needs to push Congress to finally do what many other countries have already done — privatize the Postal Service.That would not only spare taxpayers from subsidizing Amazon, it would free Trump up to tweet about real problems the country faces.Note: This editorial has been updated since it was first published on March 28.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Amazon Stock Dives As 'Obsessed' Trump Considers Regulations, Tax ActionForget About Antitrust: Wal-Mart Is Punching Back At AmazonTrump's Attacks On Amazon Should Worry Everyone

57,UPS,"It's lonely at the top. And the more power you wield, the less honest feedback you tend to get from those around you.Some organizations provide structured programs, such as 360-degree feedback, to assure that leaders collect input on their behavior and performance. But it's even better to gather informal feedback from trusted colleagues.To extract valuable input from your peers:Seek specifics. Many leaders refrain from asking peers for blunt feedback. Why? They don't want to appear vulnerable, they may compete with their colleagues rather than view them as supportive allies, or they may not welcome criticism.""But your peers are often in the best position to help you improve,"" said Karin Hurt, chief executive of Let's Grow Leaders, a Baltimore-based consultancy.She suggests asking a peer, ""My intent is to make a greater contribution to the team. Would you tell me one thing I can do to be more effective on this team?"" That's better than a vague inquiry such as, ""Do you have any feedback for me?""Or you can ask, ""I'm seeking to improve my communication skills. What's one thing I can do to communicate better?""""The first sentence grounds it in positive intent,"" said Hurt, co-author of ""Winning Well."" That ups the odds you'll get more substantive input.Ask now, not later. You're more apt to get meaningful input if you ask for it in a timely manner. Seek feedback as soon as possible after the event in question.""If you wait too long and say, 'Remember last week at that meeting? …' it's not going to be as fresh in their mind,"" Hurt said.Withhold judgment. You need not render an instant verdict on the validity of the feedback. Instead, confirm your understanding — and then say something neutral and express your gratitude.""If you disagree with it, just say 'that's interesting' and 'thank you,' "" she said.Watch your mood. If you fish for feedback when you're feeling anxious or angry, you invite trouble. It's smarter to solicit input when you're ready to listen with an open mind.""You want to ask for it when you're calm and in a position to hear it objectively,"" Hurt said.Model what you want. Make a habit of offering constructive feedback to your peers. If you're generous with input, especially positive observations, you set an example for them to emulate.""Otherwise, they may think why should they do it for you if you don't do it for them,"" Hurt said.Frame your question positively. Beware of asking, ""What am I doing wrong?"" or ""I'm unhappy with my performance. Can you help me get back on track?""Lacing your request with negativity can impair the quality of feedback you receive, warns Bill Hoberecht, vice president of operations at OnPoint Medical Group in Denver. Asking for ways that you can be more effective works better because it encourages peers to offer helpful input.Follow through. Once you hear sensible feedback, act on it.As a manager at a telecom firm in the 1990s, Hoberecht recalls a colleague telling him, ""Bill, here's what I've observed about your performance."" But Hoberecht didn't listen.""I was arrogant and figured I knew what I was doing,"" Hoberecht admitted. ""I did not recognize the value of what he said, so I ignored it. Months later, my boss nearly disciplined me for that area of my performance.""In retrospect, Hoberecht wishes he had treated his peer's input more seriously instead of disregarding it. But he says the incident served as ""a wake-up call"" to follow through when colleagues offer constructive feedback.MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:9 Steps To Take From Failure To Greater SuccessGood Lessons From Bad Bosses6 Strategies For Staging Goal-Driven Meetings5 Genius Ways To Sharpen Your Mental Acuity

65,UPS,"Major stock indexes were listless in late-afternoon trading Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average showing a small gain of less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both fell modestly, off 0.2%.XIn the stock market today, several earnings reports sparked bullish gaps up in price. Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) vaulted over a 64.72 entry but pulled back a bit. Shares still soared 19% to 64.41. The telecom-infrastructure firm reported its fifth straight quarter of 20%-plus sales growth.IBD 50 component Stamps.com (STMP), meanwhile, gapped up and rose 31% to 198.60. After a breakout over a 136.10 buy point, the do-it-yourself postage firm was holding above the 50-day moving average ahead of earnings, but the stock is extended in price now. According to Nasdaq.com, about 4 million shares were held short as of July 14, or about 27% of the total float, so it's a good bet that part of today's surge is due to short covering.Tesla (TSLA) gapped above its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 7% to 347.46. Second-quarter sales more than doubled to $2.79 billion, above the consensus estimate of around $2.5 billion. By the end of this year, Tesla hopes to be building 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week and 10,000 by the end of 2018.Video game maker Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) surged past an 80.64 buy point after earnings and sales blew past analysts' estimates.

66,UPS,"FedEx Corp. (FDX) squared off against rival United Parcel Service (UPS) Thursday, announcing that it will skip additional charges for most residential deliveries this holiday season. The package delivery services are locked in a duel as Americans increasingly make their purchases at Amazon.com (AMZN) and other online retailers.XFedEx will, however, slap a fee for packages that are oversized or unauthorized, or require additional handling, the shipping giant said. It noted in a statement that the volume of oversized packages during the holidays has increased by approximately 240% over the past 10 years, and larger, heavier packages now account for 10% of all ground volumes.""To support our millions of loyal small business customers and consumers shipping holiday gifts at FedEx Office and FedEx Onsite locations, FedEx will not apply holiday season surcharges except for packages that are oversized, unauthorized or require additional handling,"" Patrick Fitzgerald, a senior vice president, said. The extra levies, in effect from Nov. 20 to Dec. 24, amount to $3 per package for additional handling, $25 per package for oversized packages, and $300 per package for unauthorized shipments.UPS said in June that it will charge retailers an extra fee for deliveries around Black Friday and Christmas. That surcharge is expected to offset additional costs as the delivery services shell out more for extra planes, trucks and employees during peak holiday season.Both FedEx and UPS have been investing heavily to handle more e-commerce shipments.While rising volumes and the need for ever-faster deliveries are straining the shipping services, especially around the holidays, a longer-term challenge looms in the form of one of their biggest customers, Amazon. The online behemoth has expanded its airfreight fleet via Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW).Shares of FedEx dipped 0.1% to 209.38 on the stock market today. Shares are back in buy range following two down weeks. But FedEx has been finding resistance at its 50-day moving average.UPS added 0.2% to 111.49. UPS has recently retaken its 50-day line, but is well off a potential buy point at 120.54.IBD Leaderboard stock Amazon lost 0.9% to 986.92, falling further below its 50-day moving average.Atlas Air shed 2.4% to 65.20.

67,UPS,"Almost every advisor has a website. That makes it tough to stand out.XAdvisors usually want a website that reinforces their brand identity. Whether through easy navigation, snazzy design or captivating content, they seek to introduce themselves to potential clients by presenting their best side.Because many advisors lack the desire and technical skills to build their own websites, they may enlist outsiders such as digital marketing firms to help. Web design and development consultants construct and maintain sites — and some specialize in working with financial planners.""There are web designers who focus on advisors, but I wanted to hire someone who had a broader client mix,"" said Kay Dee Cole, a certified financial planner in Corvallis, Ore. ""Designers who focus on advisors tend to use the same format with a photo, a menu of services and a mission statement"" on the home page.Cole did not want her firm's website (www.claritywealthdevelopment.com) to look like all the rest. To set herself apart, she wanted to offer engaging video content.She wound up retaining a web designer who crafted websites for a wide range of businesses. She also hired a videographer who interviewed her on camera and then used the footage to create Cole's personal greeting on her website's homepage.Prospects who watched the video were often predisposed to like Cole, she says. It also eased the onboarding process.""People came in for the first time saying they felt more comfortable knowing me already from the video,"" Cole said. ""Being in a trust business, it can take awhile to establish trust. Seeing the video speeds up them getting to know me.""Some advisors embrace the challenge of developing their own website. Even if they lack tech savvy, the appeal of controlling every aspect of the content — and being able to make changes and updates on their own — can outweigh the considerable learning curve and time commitment.Tyler Reeves, a certified financial planner in Birmingham, Ala., used Squarespace as a starting point. The Web-based platform offers design templates to help do-it-yourselfers get up and running.To add a distinctive visual element, Reeves laced his website (www.plimsollfp.com) with drawings by Carl Richards, a certified financial planner who created the ""Sketch Guy"" column for the New York Times. Reeves pounced on a now-expired offer on Richards' website (www.behaviorgap.com) letting others use a limited number of sketches for free.""The sketches blend in well with the simple, plain design I'm looking for,"" Reeves said.When launching his firm in March 2017, Reeves paid special attention to one aspect of his website: the fee summary.Rather than just list fees for different service levels, Reeves went a step further and cited four specific examples of how much each client would pay. He also invites visitors to send fee questions with one click.""Clients appreciate that I'm transparent with fees,"" he said. ""But even when you're transparent, fees can still be confusing to some people. So that's why I added those four scenarios.""The goal for many advisors in creating their website is to present a clear, consistent image and interface. If prospects feel overwhelmed by clutter — or face too many options — they can give up and abandon the site for good.Noah Schwartz, a certified financial planner in Fairfield County, Conn., developed his own website (www.blueprintplanning.org) when he launched his firm in late 2016. From the outset, he knew that he would favor evidence-based, academic strategies — and he wanted his website to reflect that.""You want to profess your philosophy quickly,"" Schwartz said. ""Applied academic investing differentiates us, so we wanted to build around that with our web design.""After people visit his website for the first time, he likes to ask, ""What's the first thing you noticed?"" He incorporates their feedback into design tweaks.Over the past year, Schwartz says he has revamped the website six times and he's ""always making improvements."" He estimates that only one-third of the original content remains on the current iteration of the site.""We'd post market updates, academic research and lots of other stuff,"" he said. ""But people told me they didn't know where to go or what to click on. So we ended up with six icons to click.""To encourage prospects to request a meeting, Schwartz inserted a ""Schedule time with us"" option on the lower right corner of every page. The blue button is unobtrusive but hard to miss.""I wanted to avoid those annoying 'chat now' pop-ups that appear as soon as you start browsing an e-commerce website,"" he said. ""That's not how I wanted to engage people.""RELATED:Jack O'Neill's Innovations Turned The Tide For SurfingQuotes Of The Week: Jeff Bezos, Jawaharlal Nehru And Others 9 Principles To Promote Perseverance Without Being Stubborn About It

68,UPS,"Jack Dorsey's latest bet is positively old-school.Square (SQ), the mobile payments processor run by Dorsey, unveiled its first physical store on Thursday to offer hands-on support for merchants using its technology and showcase some of their wares.To most passers-by, the cozy space looks like any other boutique store in Manhattan's Nolita neighborhood, with eclectic merchandise for sale like handmade jewelry, candles and bags. The difference is the iconic white Square design outside the store and the point-of-sale hardware products on display inside.""We're (within) walking distance from hundreds of Square sellers,"" said Jesse Dorogusker, the company's hardware lead. ""We want to develop the idea that you can merge sales, support, merchant showcase, and a retail store. That scales with more brick-and-mortar locations, or pop-ups, or something more mobile over time.""There's a support desk where sellers can make appointments with Square employees to get help with its software — akin to an Apple Genius Bar for retailers and other merchants. Dorogusker isn't expecting the store to be a big driver of hardware products, which are already on sale at numerous national retailers like Best Buy. Rather, the goal is to improve the customer experience, boost sales for Square's merchants, and introduce shoppers to the Square brand.IBD'S TAKE: Square's numbers look solid for IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processing Group. It holds a 96 Composite Rating out of a possible 99 and its Relative Strength rating is 98. But it's not the top stock in the group, ranking eighth. The top stock is PayPal (PYPL), which holds a Composite Rating of 99.Square started by selling smartphone plug-ins that let food truck vendors and other small businesses accept credit cards. The company has since attracted larger merchants by offering a suite of services and software that make running a business easier. Those more profitable services, including loans, food delivery and inventory management software, have boosted the company's financial performance and its stock.Less than 5% of Square's revenue comes from hardware, which includes a variety of credit card readers and a stand that turns an iPad into a point-of-sale terminal. Square sells its hardware cheaply, or gives it away, to attract merchants onto its platform, where it profits from selling software services.
"
69,UPS,"Cal Ripken's business is baseball. He powered through 21 years as a Baltimore Oriole. Now he empowers young players with the Ripken Experience, one of his fields of dreams.As a major leaguer, Ripken played in 2,632 straight games, a streak through 17 seasons that landed him a tag for the ages: Iron Man.Now he runs a minor league team in his hometown of Aberdeen, Md., that links his nickname to that of his old club: the IronBirds.Plenty of Ripken's other honors come in metal: two American League Most Valuable Player trophies, including one from the world champion 1983 season; two Gold Gloves for top fielding at shortstop; and a plaque in Cooperstown, N.Y., after entering the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.""I really break my career moments into two categories: personal moments and baseball moments,"" Ripken, 57, told IBD. ""My favorite baseball moment, for sure, was catching the final out of the 1983 World Series. It was a simple little humpback line drive, but it represented the culmination of an incredible season for the team and was a wonderful celebration.""My favorite personal moment was (game No. 2,131, setting the consecutive-game record). It was such a buildup during the season, but when the actual night came, it became very personal with friends, family and so many familiar faces in the crowd.""Jeff Idelson got to know Ripken while working in public relations with the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees before becoming president of the Hall of Fame. ""For Cal, the streak was about perseverance,"" he said. ""He didn't play baseball with a thought of the streak. It was about going to work every day without taking time off.""You go back to Rick Sutcliffe's comment while pitching for the Orioles: 'When I'm pitching I need the best shortstop behind me.' Cal wanted to be there for him and his other teammates. He was great at being prepared with his job. Like anyone who stands out in an organization, he was laser-focused, about being the best in the field.""At 6-foot-4, Ripken towers among all-time shortstops, a position name that fits, since so many have been of shorter stature — for agility. He's ranked second among shortstops only to Honus Wagner by AXS, Athlon Sports, CBS Sports and Bleacher Report. ""He may have had the strongest arm ever at the position,"" says CBS Sports, while Bleacher Report comments: ""Because (the streak) is so utterly incomprehensible, it actually overshadows Ripken's performance exploits. That's a difficult thing to do, especially given that he smacked 3,184 hits and smashed 431 home runs to go with 1,647 runs and 1,695 runs batted in. Among shortstops, Ripken ranks first or second in all four of those categories.""Said Idelson: ""When you look at defense, offense, leadership, longevity, Cal is probably in a class of his own at shortstop.""Ripken's streak is all the more stunning considering Major League Baseball's injury epidemic. The Los Angeles Dodgers led all teams with 7,169 games missed, from 2010 to 2016, due to hurt players. And this season alone, the New York Mets have been dragged down by 20 wounded warriors on the disabled list, from fireballer Noah Syndergaard to slugger Yoenis Cespedes.That's now. During Ripken's streak, other players made 5,045 trips to the disabled list.""I had good genes, that's for sure,"" Ripken said. ""I always recovered really well from the day-to-day grind of the season and, in several cases, from more significant injuries. The streak was really born out of a very simple and honest approach. Dad always taught me to show up at the ballpark each and every day ready to play, and if the manager believes you are one of the nine guys who can help the team win that day, he knows he can count on you and will put you in the lineup. That's simply how the streak started and grew over the years.""Maybe a game on May 30, 1982, didn't seem so crucial. But after sitting one out, he played that day — and wouldn't miss another one until Sept. 20, 1998.He stayed on course despite playing in the middle infield, home to serious foot traffic. Take the 444th game of the streak. It came on April 10, 1985, and while covering on a pickoff play, Ripken turned his ankle when his spikes caught on the bag. The ankle ballooned and pained him, but couldn't bench him.A few years later, Ripken charged into a fight on the mound and twisted his knee. This almost killed the streak at 1,790 games, but he bounced back the next day.""He had to overcome game injuries that he managed to work through,"" Idelson said. ""He managed the pain, had some luck and stayed on top of a position where he had to see the base runner coming at him.""Cal played through a hospital ward's worth of other wounds: slipped disk, hyperextended elbows, dislocated fingers, head-jarring from bean balls.That toughness came from his dad, Cal Ripken Sr., a minor league catcher who wouldn't let wounds like a bloody finger sideline him. ""Nothing could get him out of there,"" recalled Earl Weaver, the Orioles' Hall of Fame manager. ""He was like the hardest piece of stone on the planet.""Noted Cal Jr. in his book ""Get in the Game"": ""You'd think that, by playing all out all the time, I would have increased my chances of sustaining a serious injury. In fact, the opposite was true. That approach actually helped me persevere through every moment, every game, every season.""Injuries weren't all that tested Cal Ripken Jr. Just five years after winning it all, the Orioles sank to the depths. They started a record-low 0-21, amid which Cal Sr. got the ax as manager. And yet ""I never missed a game in 1988,"" wrote his son, ""even though it would have been easy to ask for a day off. We lost 107 games that year and finished dead last. But you know what? I was still playing baseball. And I loved it.""Ripken grew up in Maryland and in the early 1970s sped on and off the field beside Cal Sr., manager of the minor league team in Asheville, N.C.When summers ended, Cal Jr. would return to school in Aberdeen. Then in 1978 the Orioles drafted him. Off to Bluefield, W.Va., he went to play in the rookie-level Appalachian League.Now he's back in the minors as a major player. He bought the IronBirds, an Orioles affiliate of the Class A New York-Penn League, for $3 million and moved it from Utica, N.Y., to Aberdeen's new Ripken Stadium in time for the 2002 season.That's just part of the business lineup for the man who's built a fortune of $75 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com.His Ripken Baseball is a privately held company, the revenue of which he declines to broadcast, although he points to 575 seasonal and 75 full-time employees. The firm runs complexes for weekend kids' tournaments and longer baseball camps.With his emphasis on youth, it's no wonder that the baseball loop named for another Maryland giant — the Babe Ruth League — honors him with a Cal Ripken Division, for kids 4 to 12.""We are very interested in growing in the youth baseball space,"" Ripken said. ""The three tournament destination sites that we call the Ripken Experience are in our hometown of Aberdeen; Myrtle Beach, S.C.; and Pigeon Forge, Tenn. This is where our passion is and where the future of the company is, and we are actively looking for investment partners and other locations for these significant complexes across the country.""As for minor league baseball, we began to divest from that business several years ago. Today the only team we own is the IronBirds. We are looking for a partner there as well to take over the majority interest in the club. We will maintain a minority interest because Aberdeen is our home and it is important we stay involved.""Such maneuvers keep Ripken on a more mental path than when he ran out grounders. ""There are ups and downs in business,"" he said, ""and you need to keep plugging away and learning in order to improve and get it right. Also, being a good teammate and building a good team around you are essential in business and baseball.""I was a novice in the business world, and literally the day after I played my last game in 2001 I had to put on a suit and find a team to play at Ripken Stadium. Over the years I have gotten much more comfortable as a business owner and I really enjoy the role. I try to surround myself with smart people who I can trust.""It seems like you never stop learning or facing challenges in business, and I find that energizing.""Idelson is impressed with Ripken's grasp of business: ""He strikes me as special, with a unique ability to listen. He's more intent on listening than speaking. When you think of the great businessmen or women and their top traits, listening is one of them. As Bill Veeck, the old baseball owner who is one of my heroes, said, 'You can learn a lot from listening.'""Cal has the makeup of someone who can run an organization, whether as a manager or executive, like Joe Torre, Tony La Russa, Earl Weaver, John Schuerholz. Cal led on the ball field and translates that into the business world — much like Joe Morgan and Bob Feller, both pretty good at business.""In 1987, five years into the streak, Ripken married Kelly Greer on the way to having two children, Rachel and Ryan, before divorcing in 2016.In 1992, Ripken was honored — for helping Baltimore's community — with awards named for Roberto Clemente and Lou Gehrig. ""Being a real part of my hometown, as opposed to being an outsider, pulled my personal and business aspects of my life together in a way that made them virtually indistinguishable,"" Ripken wrote.He cracked the ""Iron Man"" mark on Sept. 6, 1995, in full drama. With 50,000 fans at Camden Yards and a national TV crowd looking on, he blasted a home run in fourth inning. The next inning made the game official, giving Cal the streak record at 2,131. Right after the Orioles finished off the California Angels 4-2, the party shifted into high gear, with Joe DiMaggio taking the microphone: ""Wherever my former teammate Lou Gehrig is today, I'm sure he's tipping his cap to you, Cal Ripken.""Amid the celebration, the Major League Baseball Players Association awarded Ripken $75,000 for setting the record. ""I looked at it as an opportunity to go back to Aberdeen and parlay the gift into a small baseball complex that my hometown and I could be proud of.""Over the next decade, his field of Aberdreams turned into Cal Sr.'s Yard, a top youth-baseball facility funded by the Cal Sr. Foundation for disadvantaged kids, and Ripken Stadium.Played in 2,632 straight games from 1982 to 1998, amassed 3,184 hits and swatted 431 home runs on the way to entering the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.Overcame: Injuries that threatened the streak.Lesson: Keep swinging.""If people believe you have strong principles, are sound in mind and body and are incorruptible, they'll chose to work with you over others.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Casey Stengel Managed To Win Eight World Series Titles In 12 YearsBranch Rickey Revolutionized Baseball In More Ways Than OneEwing Kauffman Applied His Winning Formula To Sales, Education, BaseballVin Scully Prepared To Become Baseball's Master Storyteller

73,UPS,"Psychologists counsel patients on their mental baggage. Advisors sometimes do the same, especially when it comes to money.XClients of all ages can bring long-held yet misguided beliefs into their financial planning conversations. While some advisors might look past an individual's hang-ups, others dig deep to try to reset their attitudes, expectations and perceptions.Indulging a client's distorted views about money might make sense in the short run. After all, most advisors aren't trained as psychologists and lack the specialized skills to address potentially self-destructive behavior.At the same time, advisors may conclude that doing nothing — and allowing clients to cling to false or irrational thoughts about money — can stymie their ability to save and spend in a fulfilling, productive manner.""It's about what stresses them out and what keeps them up at night,"" said Rachel Gottlieb, a certified financial planner in New York City.Separating real concerns about, say, budgeting and investment returns from rampant fears can test an advisor's mettle. Listening without judgment, probing gently and providing a reliably calm, steady hand can help stabilize a client's misplaced anxiety and emotions.Seasoned advisors confront many psychological challenges that can afflict their clients. Examples include people who dread any kind of investing (""I'll lose all my money!""), feel they don't deserve so much money (""It's just not right!"") or equate their net worth with their self-worth (""I've got to keep getting richer or else I'm a loser."").To free clients from such self-imposed chokeholds, advisors must exercise patience. Like therapists, they launch a voyage of self-discovery in the hope that clients will eventually decide to uproot their deeply held assumptions.Our life experience influences how we treat money. Those who experienced hard times in their youth may find those early hardships lodge themselves in their psyche for decades.""Some clients who grew up in the Depression (in the 1930s) feel that they will never have enough wealth,"" Gottlieb said. ""So they spend well below their means.""She cites an example of a wealthy widow in her 80s who, despite her substantial holdings, constantly fears running out of money and not being able to pay her bills.Bringing in the widow's three adult children for a heart-to-heart meeting helped. They repeatedly assured her, ""Mom, you're going to have enough money.""Younger investors are not immune from a Depression-era mindset. They may harbor such a strong aversion to the markets that they refuse to engage.""Some of my millennial clients are scarred from the (2007-08) financial crisis,"" said Brad Bernstein, a certified financial planner in Philadelphia, Pa. ""They just have this short, disastrous experience"" that undermined their faith in investing.Bernstein, who studied psychology in college, seeks to educate young professionals by discussing historical returns over time. He finds that they often overcome their investing phobia once they understand long-term market trends.In some cases, Bernstein accepts an individual's baggage and works around it. He recalls meeting a couple in which the wife had ""some kind of horrible experience with an advisor.""As a result, she refused to be in the same room with him. So Bernstein wound up advising her husband — and he remains a client seven years later.In order for advisors to double as therapists, they need to listen well. That can prove difficult because of their eagerness to solve clients' problems.""It takes discipline not to interrupt a client,"" said Nick Strain, a certified financial planner in Long Beach, Calif. Instead of jumping in to recommend an action or give his opinion, he prefers to keep quiet and let people direct the conversation.When he senses that clients have covered everything on their mind, Strain replies, ""Is there anything else you're thinking about?""If they say no, Strain still resists shifting into advice-giving mode. First, he reviews each of the main points they made and says, ""Tell me more about that.""By giving clients ample opportunities to open up, Strain positions himself as an attentive, nonjudgmental listener. He takes notes and stays silent.""It works so well,"" he said. ""If you interrupt and dive into the first point you hear them make, you can miss the five or six other topics they're thinking about.""He has also learned to ask permission before he proposes a solution or dishes out advice. Even if he's certain that he can provide constructive input or a practical tip to help a client overcome a money-related psychological barrier, he withholds his comment until he receives an affirmative response to his question, ""Would you like some help in solving that problem?""RELATED:How Harley-Davidson's Founders Hogged The Motorcycle MarketQuotes Of The Week: From Barbara Corcoran, David Olgilvy And More7 Positive Paths To Pushing Past Mental Barriers

74,UPS,"Mylan (MYL) hit a four-year low, taking generic drug stocks with it after reporting second-quarter metrics that lagged Wall Street and cutting guidance for the next two years, but then recovered to post a slight gain Wednesday.XOn the stock market today, Mylan ended the trading day up 0.9% to 32.08 after earlier falling as much as 7%, hitting a low last seen in June 2013. This is the sixth consecutive day Mylan has spent in the red following a disappointing report from fellow generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).The crash initially sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group down as much as 2.4%, but the sector recovered in recent trades, rising nearly 1% at the close. Still, Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO), Collegium Pharmaceutical (COLL) and Perrigo (PRGO) remained down 7.3%, 5.4% and 0.3%, respectively.For its second quarter ended June 30, Mylan reported $2.96 billion in sales, up 16% year over year, but that missed the consensus for $3 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share lagged by 9 cents and fell 5%.Revenue in North America was hit hardest, down 9%, as sales in Europe and the rest of the world grew 59% and 29%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier period. Sales of its EpiPen injection for allergic reactions declined due to increased competition.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 46, meaning it performs in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get a look at better-rated stocks via IBD Stock Checkup.Mylan also cut its guidance for 2017 to $11.5 billion-$12.5 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $4.30-$4.70 a share. For 2018, it now sees adjusted earnings of ""at least $5.40,"" down from earlier views for $6. The new target would be 20% above 2017 expectations, at the midpoint.""Given the region's ongoing challenges and uncertain U.S. regulatory environment, we have elected to defer all major U.S. launches from our full-year 2017 financial guidance to 2018, including generic Advair and Copaxone,"" Mylan said in a news release.Advair is used to prevent asthma attacks and flare-ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It's branded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), but Mylan and others are working on generic versions of it. In May, the Food and Drug Administration delayed Mylan's application for the drug.Mylan and others are also working on a generic version of Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, which lost four key patents earlier in the year.The Medicines Company (MDCO) popped despite lagging second-quarter revenue, on losses that beat expectations and promising clinical updates, including an LDL cholesterol-lowering drug that could rival Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Medicines Co. noted during the second quarter that it came to agreements with regulators in the U.S. and Europe over its drug, inclisiran, as a cholesterol-buster. In total, it expects to enroll 3,400 patients in a Phase 3 trial designed to support the submission of applications for its approval.Inclisiran is what's known as a PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor, which has a slightly different mechanism than PSCK9 inhibitors from Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi. Medicines Co. is also working on a study of 14,000 patients to determine whether there's a cardiovascular benefit from inclisiran.For its second quarter ended June 30, Medicines Co. reported $18.7 million in sales, down 66%. That missed the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $31 million in revenue.Adjusted losses of $1.02 per share widened from a 69-cent loss in the year-earlier period. But that topped the consensus' view for an adjusted loss of $1.29 per share.Medicines Co. lifted 3.9%, to close at 37.71.RELATED:Tesaro Beats Sales Views But Losses Up; Nektar Misses On EarnsHow Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersMylan In FDA Limbo On Generic Multiple Sclerosis Drug

76,UPS,"United Parcel Service (UPS) reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and revenue early Thursday, but unexpectedly high holiday volume resulted in additional costs.X Estimates: EPS to rise 1% to $1.65, as revenue grows 7.4% to $18.19 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: UPS earned $1.67 a share with revenue up 11% to $18.83 billion. U.S. domestic package revenue grew 8.4% to $11.84 billion. But holiday shipping volume of 762 million packages, more than the 750 million it had forecast, resulted in an extra $125 million in operating costs.Outlook: UPS sees adjusted 2018 EPS of $7.03 to $7.37. Analysts expect $7.06. UPS plans capital spending of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, primarily for new technology, aircraft and automation.Stock: Shares fell 6.1% to 119.51 on the stock market today, erasing UPS' gains in 2018. The stock has sold off since hitting a record high of 135.53 on Jan. 18. Rival FedEx (FDX) was down 0.25%.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for high-quality stocks such as Amazon with the potential for big gains? Leaderboard, IBD's curated list of top growth stocks, has a two-week free trial.While UPS tried a novel pricing strategy in 2017, adding delivery surcharges around Black Friday and Christmas for the first time ever, FedEx took a different tack.UPS also acquired a pharmacy license for a new business venture late last year. The move comes as key customer Amazon (AMZN) plans to launch a health care joint venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings.After tax reform passed, UPS said it plans to boost spending on workers, fleets and technology. FedEx announced a $3.2 billion spending package last week, including bonuses and wage increases to workers, citing the legislation.UPS's tech spending could take many forms. The company works with suppliers of emerging vehicle technologies to develop solutions for complex driving situations. It also runs an extensive alternative-fuel fleet, preordering 125 of Tesla's (TSLA) new electric Semi tractors.UPS pays a quarterly dividend of 83 cents a share.

78,UPS,"Sure, you're jittery. Worries about tariffs and a global trade war fueled a stock market sell off most days so far this month. The market dived even deeper in the first half of February. Now, very likely, you're wondering whether to go to cash from your mutual funds or stay the course.Especially with your diversified stock mutual funds, the answer is stay the course, based on history and strategic thinking. That doesn't mean any fear factor you're feeling is not real. So are the scary memories of past downturns like the financial crisis of 2008-09. Nor does it mean your funds and retirement accounts didn't painfully lose value this month.And going to cash can be wise with your individual stocks, based on the rules of a time-tested strategy that tells you when to get in and out of securities. But it's anything but wise with the diversified portion of your portfolio — your mutual funds — for the average investor, especially one with a long time horizon. If you're in retirement or close to it, cashing out whatever amount you need for an upcoming bill can be prudent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOne reason it's risky to go to cash from diversified, long-term stock mutual funds is that studies repeatedly show how individual mutual fund investors are prone to two pitfalls. They rarely if ever get out of the market near its top. And they rarely if ever get back into the market at a good time. ""People don't have crystal balls,"" said John Gagliardi, a regional brokerage consultant for Fidelity Investments. ""They can't predict the future.""Instead of selling high and buying back in at the low, time and again they end up selling low — then buying high because they miss the often explosive start to a rally. And, remember, the market has always rallied ... despite depressions, recessions and world wars.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.Why do investors buy high? Even after a rally begins, jittery investors who went to cash after the start of market woes are still waiting on the sidelines for the market to look safe. Meanwhile, the market is piling up some of its sweetest gains.The price for missing some of those best days of the market is that your total returns suffer.Sure, going to cash felt like the safe strategy. But it ends up cannibalizing your returns.Look what happened if you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 between Dec. 31, 2002 and last Dec. 31. If you stayed put, remaining fully invested through the market's ups and downs, your total return was 9.92%. Your nest egg would have ballooned into $41,333.But if you got cold feet and pulled out, what then? If you didn't get back in soon enough to benefit from rallies after various pullbacks, and you missed just the 10 best market days during that 15-year period, your return got slashed nearly in half to just 5.03%, Putnam Investments calculates. Your end balance would have been a far more modest $20,873.If you missed the 40 best market days, your return would have shrunk to a 2.62% loss. Your $10,000 would have shriveled to $6,716.Another reason not to go to cash is that you miss out on opportunities to buy more shares at a discount in funds you like. ""I see pullbacks as buying opportunities,"" Gagliardi said.After all, you've put the work into deciding which mutual funds suit your risk tolerance, your investment goals, your time horizon and the mix of stocks and bonds that you want.""Market fundamentals haven't changed,"" said Mark Giambrone, a manager of $1.9 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX). Giambrone blames recent market volatility on program-trading by index funds. Fundamentals are still sound, in his view. ""We have a positive economic backdrop for corporate earnings and cash flows and consumer confidence and spending,"" he said.In a healthy market and economy such as today's, investors should look past short-term volatility, he says. ""Look through the noise,"" he said.

Indeed, such ad copy is supposed to state that it is ""sponsored,"" or in some way, ""from our advertisers.""But it's still advertising, observers note. Imparted information could be limited in scope or skewed. Indeed, shady boasts, such as 'you could have made a 10,000% investment return over the last five years,' could even prove harmful, especially if they entice the needy or unschooled, says Eric Tyson, author of ""Personal Finance in Your 20s and 30s For Dummies."" Tyson feels such content-style ads, like all marketing, should be viewed skeptically.In the case of ""affiliate"" or ""performance"" marketing, a blogger or other content producer may create some kind of informative piece — perhaps highlighting the 10 best credit cards for getting rewards.

(In this case, the affiliate is supposed to mention in the copy, and near the name of the product, his or her financial arrangement with the advertiser.)For audiences, forms of content marketing seem to draw mixed reviews. Consider this survey by Statista, titled U.S. Consumer Opinion on Sponsored Content as of May 2017.

Experts offer some tips for avoiding problems with online ads:Financial web sites that author Tyson does recommend for their ""quality services"" and information: those of T.

82,UPS,"Going to school after the regular school day is over doesn't sound like a lot of fun for students, but it's a booming market for China's private-education providers.XThanks to a ""dramatic"" increase in disposable income in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the continued competitive state of China's education system and a decade-old population boom that is now translating to a recent influx of primary-school-age students, the state of the nation's after-school tutoring sector is ""very robust,"" 86Research analyst Yuzhong Gao told Investor's Business Daily.And that points to continued growth for China's largest private education provider, New Oriental Education (EDU) — as well as its peers. Both New Oriental and its main rival, TAL Education (TAL) are gaining market share from smaller competitors.""Currently, because (New Oriental) and TAL have very good teacher quality, and they have very high teaching standards, they provide better teaching quality,"" said Gao.Founded in 1993 with just one school in Beijing, New Oriental now has 855 learning centers, including 77 schools, and in fiscal 2017 raked in nearly $1.8 billion in revenue.Its 4.86 million students are enrolled a wide range of classes. The littlest ones, aged 5 through 12, learn English, music and other subjects in what it calls the POP Kids program, though the company's website says that it can enroll children as young as 3 years old. Meanwhile, high schoolers plow through history or physics lessons after school, and grown-ups who have returned from overseas utilize New Oriental's job placement services.Reporting fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on July 25, New Oriental came out ahead of Street forecasts as earnings grew 40.5% to 41 cents in American depositary receipts on 23% sales growth to $486.4 million, according to the company. Analysts had expected 38 cents earnings per share on $478.8 million in revenue.During the quarter, total student enrollment rose 36.9% from the prior year as the total number of schools and learning centers grew by 107. CCB International analyst Eric Qiu, who has an outperform rating on the company, noted New Oriental's center growth is a result of ""strong student demand.""""In light of New Oriental's target of 17-21% revenue growth in (fiscal 2018's first quarter) — seasonally the weakest quarter for growth — and the rapid pace of new learning center openings, we expect revenue growth to fully ramp up in (the second to fourth quarters) and continue well into (fiscal 2019) provided openings stay on track,"" he wrote on July 26, upping his price target to 96 from 76.Shares briefly entered a buy zone the day after earnings, clearing a 82.72 entry point from a cup-with-handle base, but have failed to properly break out in the ensuing sessions.Still, New Oriental's heft as a single company is but a drop in the ocean. The industry is fragmented, with ""tens of thousands"" of other private-education companies across China, according to Gao. And analysts say that collectively, New Oriental and TAL Education together account for a mere 4%-5% or so of the entire after-school market in the country.The bulk of New Oriental's learning centers are located in Beijing, which has 97, and in Shanghai with 52, as the company expands into smaller ""tier 3"" and ""tier 4"" cities. ""Smaller"" in China is a relative term, of course: 86Research's Gao says a tier-3 city is about 3-4 million people big; the populace of a tier 4 town is about 1-2 million, bigger than most U.S. cities.New Oriental's origins were in test prep for Chinese students looking to move abroad. But as that revenue stream has plateaued over the last few years, analysts say the company has turned its eye toward growing its K-12 business.IBD'S TAKE: China is entering a ""golden age"" of education, said Deloitte last year, and the country's versions of Kaplan and The Princeton Review are poised to flourish. Read this Snapshot from November for more.Calling its K-12 after-school programs a ""key revenue driver,"" Chief Financial Officer Stephen Yang said in the most recent earnings call that there are plans to add 10% to 15% new K-12 learning centers in existing cities. The company will also enter two to four new cities in the fiscal year, and is continuing its expansion into more rural areas.Gao noted on July 26 that in tandem with a rise in enrollment, students at New Oriental are also studying an increasing number of subjects at a time.""This shows (New Oriental) is well on track to transform itself from an English- focused after-school tutoring institution to an all-subject tutoring service provider,"" he wrote.But that doesn't mean New Oriental has not been without issues, and Gao said that in recent years the company has tightened control over its many branches, replacing local headmasters ""who did not answer to (the headquarters at) Beijing.""""By doing that it's been very successful,"" he said, later adding that ""a more centralized control by (New Oriental) over its local schools brings management efficiency, which translates into improvements in every aspects.""Separately, New Oriental and other Chinese tutoring schools have been under scrutiny Stateside. A Reuters investigation in late 2016 detailed allegations of college application fraud, and the American International Recruitment Council said in December that it would investigate the claims, sending shares of New Oriental tumbling over 14% in one session.The stock has more than recovered since then, climbing 85.5% since the start of the calendar year.Despite the fragmented market, neither Gao nor Qiu sees New Oriental getting an acquisitive itch anytime soon. Growth is likely to come from opening more centers and enrolling more students than engaging in M&A.RELATED:IBD 50's TAL Education Aces Earnings, But Stock Drops OutIBD 50 Chinese School Stock Recovers After Q4 Beat

87,UPS,"The Dow Jones industrial average and, briefly, the S&P 500 index undercut their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq composite pulled back from a record high. Fears that President Donald Trump will impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese tech and telecom products worried investors and slammed Boeing stock. Trump also blocked Broadcom (AVGO) from buying Qualcomm (QCOM), though chip stocks still outperformed. United Airlines raised forecasts and faced yet another public relations fiasco. Adobe Systems (ADBE) rallied on earnings and guidance. General Electric (GE) dove on dividend fears.Stocks ran into turbulence amid concerns that President Trump will soon levy stiff tariffs on Chinese goods over their trade and investment practices. Trump also nixed a possible Broadcom (AVGO) takeover of Qualcomm (QCOM). Boeing (BA), which sells a lot of planes to China, tumbled through its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average, which reclaimed its 50-day line on Monday, fell back below that level, led by Boeing. The S&P 500 index undercut its 50-day line on Thursday, but moved back above that area on Friday. The Nasdaq composite hit a record high Tuesday intraday, but reversed to close lower that day and in the next two sessions.Broadcom (AVGO) withdrew its $117 billion bid for rival chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) after President Trump signed an executive order blocking the deal on national security grounds. Broadcom is shifting its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cited concerns about its ties to China, including firms like Huawei. The interagency body also was worried that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm was acquired by the notoriously low-R&D Broadcom. Analysts say Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms.

93,UPS,"Among Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund's (UMBMX) holdings, such stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Arista Networks (ANET) and Comerica (CMA) are providing enough lift to keep the fund ahead of its midcap blend fund peers and within shouting distance of the S&P 500.X The fund is down 0.37% this year as of Feb. 28 vs. a 0.87% decline by its midcap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and a 1.83% gain by the S&P 500.But it's the fund's longer-term performance that catches the eye. It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

94,UPS,"LOS ANGELES — It was dicey being Jewish in a Russia that was tolerant of pogroms, and then came the threat of conscription into the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese War, so one of Mayor Eric Garcetti's great-grandfathers headed West to America. Another Garcetti great-grandfather married a Mexican woman who, fleeing revolutionary ferment there, headed north to America. Which is why Garcetti, a fourth-generation resident of the world's most polyglot city, is as American as a kosher burrito, a delicacy available at Mexikosher on Pico Boulevard.XTrim, natty — colorful socks are, alas, fashionable — and with the polish of one born to public attention (his father Gil was LA's district attorney who prosecuted O.J. Simpson), Garcetti, like dozens of Democrats who have noticed recent presidential history, is asking: Why not me?Good question. Although presidents Andrew Johnson, Grover Cleveland and Calvin Coolidge had been mayors of Greeneville, Tennessee, Buffalo and Northampton, Massachusetts, respectively, no mayor has gone directly from a city hall to the White House. But the 44th president came from eight years in the nation's most docile and least admirable state legislature (Barack Obama effectively began running for president as soon as he escaped to Washington from Springfield, Illinois). The 45th came from six bankruptcies and an excruciating television show. So, it is not eccentric to think that a two-term mayor of one of the world's most complicated cities might be as qualified to be president as was, say, the governor of one of the 23 states (Arkansas) with a population smaller than this city's. And less challenging: LA's schools teach children whose parents speak Tagalog and 91 other languages.Recent history does not suggest that America has such a surplus of presidential talent that it can afford to spurn an audition by a mayor who governs where over 40% of waterborne imports enter the country — through the LA and Long Beach ports. Where more than 50% of residents are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Where immigrants from more than 30 nations form those nations' largest overseas communities.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveHis immersion in immigration realities gives him standing to warn his party, which is addicted to identity politics, that ""people do want a national identity."" We are ""not an ethnic nation but a civic nation,"" and Democrats must speak to ""identity"" rather than ""identities."" Also, he brings practicality to the ideological argument about ""sanctuary cities"": When a Korean immigrant who became a citizen and then an LA cop was shot, not fatally, witnesses and others in the neighborhood, many of them likely illegal immigrants, came forward with information that enabled the police to capture her assailant within hours. Such police-community cooperation is, Garcetti says, jeopardized when local police are viewed as closely allied with federal immigration enforcement.Garcetti, 47, is a generation younger than some progressives' pin-ups (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden). And living far from Washington, he is positioned to deplore the Beltway, within which his party has been concentrating power for a century. He suggests a rule for those who are perpetually enraged about the president: ""You only get five minutes a day to yell at your TV."" Democrats, he says, sometimes are ""the smarty-pants party"" that does not ""speak plain English."" He seems, however, to be tiptoeing on egg shells when trying to avoid offending his party's easily offended keepers of litmus tests. When, last September, an interviewer asked him if gun manufacturers should be liable for the misuse of their products, he said, ""I think you have to be open to that."" Such mush (should we be ""open to"" distillers' liability for drunken driving?) does not move nominating electorates.New York's mayor (1933-1945) Fiorello La Guardia, a Republican in a Democratic city, famously said, ""There is no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage."" And mayors have what Garcetti considers ""the luxury of doing."" But LA mayors are not powerful — the schools are run by others — and he must get along with the mayors of 87 other cities in LA county. This is, however, training for the presidency, which is less powerful than those who seek it think it is until, in office, they must deal with Washington's rival power centers.California's presidential primary, which usually has been a June irrelevancy, will occur in March 2020. This might benefit Kamala Harris, the state's freshman U.S. senator, too. Anyway, Garcetti deserves a hearing. America could do worse, it usually does and in 33 months it probably will.You might also like ...Taxifornia Does It AgainMinimum-Wage Is A Job-KillerOther columns by George F. Will

FedEx Express revenue grew 7% on increased package volume and higher base rates. FedEx Ground revenue rose 9%, also on higher volumes and rates. FedEx Freight revenue grew 6% on higher rates but average daily shipments were flat.Outlook: Adjusted full-year EPS of $13.20-$14.00, with the midpoint above consensus views for $13.55. Full-year capital spending of $5.9 billion, which includes an increase in planned aircraft deliveries as well as investments in FedEx Ground automation and capacity expansion.""Investments to modernize our aircraft fleet and expand our FedEx Ground capacity are supporting our strong earnings growth,"" said CFO Alan Graf in a statement. ""We are very optimistic about fiscal 2018 as evidenced by our earnings outlook.""Stock: FedEx rallied 1.6% late. Shares closed down 0.7% at 208.95 amid a broad decline on the stock market today but are still in buy range from an early-June breakout. Rival UPS (UPS), which reports on July 27, finished down 1.1% at 109.61 but rose 1.3% late.FedEx's Q4 report follows a Monday announcement from UPS that it will charge retailers an extra fee for deliveries around Black Friday and Christmas.This surcharge will offset added costs as the delivery services shell out more for extra planes, trucks and employees during peak holiday season.

""Volvo Cars has stated that it plans to have sold a total of 1 million electrified cars by 2025.

100,UPS,"Imagine being told you have cancer, and have six months to live.The usual steps are taken — one or two rounds of chemotherapy, perhaps a stem-cell transplant — but all of it could be to no avail. Half of all patients diagnosed with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of blood cancer, will die within six months, says Christine Cassiano, spokeswoman for Kite Pharma (KITE), a developer of cancer treatments.XBut say your doctor has access to an experimental treatment that can be custom-tailored to your immune system. He removes a vial of blood and sends it off to a lab where your immune system cells will be reprogrammed to fight cancer. Days or weeks later, the cells are reintroduced to your body.It's called CAR-T therapy. And what once sounded like a concoction straight out of a Mary Shelley novel is rapidly coming to fruition. In three-month follow-ups, Kite Pharma and Novartis (NVS) have seen strong results in patients with a specific type of blood cancer. This could mean a major payout of around a half-million dollars per patient treated by these companies. It could also go so far as to put cancer into remission for select patients.""When Kite Pharma was founded in 2009, most people actually felt the idea of CAR-T therapy used in the commercial setting was science fiction,"" Cassiano told Investor's Business Daily. ""But it was something our CEO believed in firmly.""Novartis looks likely to cross the CAR-T finish line first with its CTL019 set to go before the Food and Drug Administration in July. If Novartis' drug gains approval, it could pave the way for Kite's KTE-C19 later this year. In 2018 and beyond, Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are likely to follow with their own CAR-T drugs.That possibility of success has sent Kite, Bluebird and Juno stocks rocketing over the past month. Bluebird stock was up more than 45% during June as Kite shares jumped more than 40%. Juno soared 36%. Novartis stock was up 3% in June after rising 10% over the prior two months.Israeli immunologist Zelig Eshhar and American immunologist Steven Rosenberg theorized in the 1980s and 1990s that one could harness the immune system to seek and destroy cancer. The challenge? Cancer cells are good at camouflaging themselves.Eshhar and Rosenberg, who heads up the National Cancer Institute's tumor immunology section, developed the first CAR-T therapies in the 1990s. They first looked to treat melanoma, but scientists have since found that CAR-T drugs work particularly well in blood cancers.""CAR-T is the best form of immuno-oncology,"" according to Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay. Immuno-oncology drugs harness the immune system to treat cancer.To create the drug, researchers extract the immune system cells from a patient's blood. Using an ""empty"" virus, they affix what are known as chimeric antigen receptors to immune system T-cells, Chattopadhyay told IBD.Chimeric antigen receptors, also known as CAR, are proteins that can recognize proteins that cancer cells use to hide in the body. When the immune system's T-cells are reintroduced to the body, they are directed to seek out and destroy cells carrying those specific proteins.Because the process is so complex and individualized, CAR-T drugs cannot be mass produced.""So there are multiple steps involved in all of this,"" Chattopadhyay said. ""But the bigger challenge really is: You can't just put everything into a mixture and have something come out of the other side, because every patient is different.""Adding to the challenge, most patients who undergo CAR-T therapy are doing so as a last resort. In a study of patients with the blood cancer multiple myeloma, presented in June by Bluebird and its CAR-T drug development partner, biotech giant Celgene (CELG), 15 patients had received three to 14 prior therapies.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T drugmakers could help the biotech sector recover from several years of sideways performance, analysts say. Head on to the Industry Snapshot for a deeper dive into which stocks look strong for 2017.Harvesting enough healthy immune system cells from those patients can be tricky, Chattopadhyay said. And in some lymphomas, Kite and Novartis have discovered the cancer mutates. Once that happens, the initial protein target will no longer work, rendering the CAR-T therapy moot.Still, Rosenberg theorized in 2013 that CAR-T therapy could become ""a standard therapy for some B-cell malignancies"" which include a number of blood cancers. CAR-T hasn't yet shown promise in solid tumors, Chattopadhyay said.Whether it can in the future is ""the million-dollar question,"" he said. Drugmakers also are looking at what's called T-cell receptor technology, or TCR. Finding the right protein targets is a struggle. Often the protein shows up in other tissues, meaning the immune system could attack the organs.Novartis is leading the CAR-T market, Chattopadhyay says. The No. 3 drugmaker by market cap has a meeting with the FDA in July to discuss approval for CTL019 in young adult and pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a bone marrow cancer common in children.Four months later, Kite is set to discuss its application for its drug, currently designated KTE-C19, in the blood cancer known as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Kite will have first-mover advantage in that setting, spokeswoman Cassiano said.""That sets the precedence for pricing — what the companies want to price the drug at and what the payers want to pay for it,"" Chattopadhyay said. ""It's going to be an interesting time for CAR-T because it's the first of its kind, it is complex to make and it will be expensive initially.""He imagines CAR-T therapies could eventually replace some stem-cell transplants and will likely be priced along those lines. Initial adoption will likely take place at transplant centers where a lot of the infrastructure is already in place. He sees price tags around $300,000 to $700,000 per therapy.Cassiano wouldn't discuss pricing. She emphasized the strong results Kite saw in a recent trial of patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At 8.7 months, 82% of patients saw their tumors shrink, with 39% in complete remission and responses still ongoing in 44% of patients.""It's a really dramatic rate of response when you look at this patient population,"" she said. ""What normally happens when they reach this point in their diagnosis, they have roughly a 50% chance of dying within six months.""Juno also is working on a CAR-T drug to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Comparing their trials at three months, Juno's JCAR017 showed a 66% overall response rate vs. 45% and 39% for Novartis' and Kite's drugs, respectively, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a June 7 note.""JCAR017 looks very competitive to both Novartis' and Kite's data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma when compared apples-to-apples,"" he wrote. ""The jury is still out on how durability of response compares at six or 12 months, but we think it's too early to declare these products differentiated.""Bluebird may lag Novartis and Kite in terms of commercialization, but its CAR-T drug has had arguably the strongest trial results, Janney's Chattopadhyay and Leerink's Schmidt said following the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference this month in Chicago.There, Bluebird and Celgene said the drug now known as bb2121 while in testing resulted in a 100% overall response rate in patients with multiple myeloma, a cancer that forms in a white blood cell called a plasma cell, according to the Mayo Clinic. Of 15 patients evaluated, all signs of cancer disappeared in 27% of them.Data from Bluebird and Celgene were ""among the most impressive early data sets we have seen in the CAR-T space to date,"" Schmidt wrote in a June 6 note to clients. The duo set a ""high bar"" for rivals Novartis, Kite and Juno, which are all a year ahead.""Responses occurred fast and were durable and all 15 patients were still in remission with up to one year follow-up while CAR-T cells persisted over the same time frame,"" Schmidt wrote. Only two of the 15 patients experienced serious side effects.Unlike in Kite and Novartis' cases, the cancer hasn't mutated, Chattopadhyay said. So, if the patient relapses, it's possible the patient could undergo a second CAR-T treatment. A Chinese company also working on a multiple myeloma CAR-T drug had a similar result, he said.""The Bluebird/Celgene program looked quite remarkable,"" he said. ""There's something different about that program. It might not be the program, it might just be the disease. We'll have a better picture by the end of the year after a Phase 1 study.""RELATED:This Small Biotech Soared On Its Celgene-Partnered TrialPuma Leads Massive Biotech Surge As Esperion Hits 15-Month HighSmall Biotech Pops As Rival Novartis Struggles To Keep Pace

102,UPS,"Did the recent stock market volatility put you on edge?X It's understandable, of course. But that doesn't mean you should panic and unload your ETFs and/or mutual funds when the market falls. In fact, it could be an opportune time to add to your positions.First, consider your holdings. Are they diversified or sector plays? Sector funds can be a bit trickier, since they are more concentrated and can thus be prone to a steeper drop. A diversified ETF will tend to fare better during a market pullback, since it is spread across various sectors.Next, review your objective. If you are in the funds for the long haul, you should think twice before selling shares.IBD Survey: What New ETFs Would You Like To See Created?The market itself carries risk. Interest rates, corporate earnings, economic cycles and news events can affect the market as a whole, and diversification only offers you some cushion. When the market takes a hit, whether you have 10 stocks or a thousand, you will most likely see losses. Diversification doesn't protect you from taking losses, it just means your losses might not be as bad.However, if you sell when you just can't take the pain anymore, you also lose your opportunity to participate in the recovery. All too frequently, investors in diversified funds sell at the absolute wrong times. That can degrade your long-term performance significantly.For longer-term mutual fund and ETF shareholders, a buy-and-hold mentality makes sense. Consider dollar-cost averaging. This strategy will help you avoid missteps in trying to time the market. By investing a fixed amount on a regular schedule instead of a lump sum, investors can build a stake gradually while smoothing out any big ups and downs in share prices.So let's say you buy shares of an ETF or mutual fund each quarter over a one-year period. You'll get more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when prices are higher. In a falling market, the average cost you pay for shares gets lower and lower. That often works out to your advantage over time. Now in a rising market, your average cost will go up. But if you have a long-term horizon, it still makes sense to add shares at regular intervals instead of trying to time your purchases.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market has been very volatile lately. Read our cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.Another strategy to lower your overall cost, particularly with ETFs, is by adding shares when they pull back to the 50-day or 10-week moving average. ETFs often stage bigger moves on rebounds off support lines than out of breakouts from bases. So you could increase your stake by buying on the dips as long as the fund is in an overall uptrend.Individual stocks should be handled differently, because in addition to market risk, they have company-specific risks. For instance, an earnings miss, an acquisition or FDA rejection are just a few reasons a stock could tank. Whereas the market as a whole has always recovered over time and gone to new highs, many individual stocks never come back. One IBD study showed that only one of eight former market leaders go on to lead a future market cycle after a major correction.""A well-selected, diversified domestic growth-stock fund run by an established management organization will, in time, always recover from the steep corrections that naturally occur during bear markets,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil said in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""The reason mutual funds come back is that they are broadly diversified and generally participate in each recovery cycle in the U.S. economy.""Here are the five most common mistakes fund investors make, according to O'Neil:1. Failing to sit tight.

107,UPS,"Whenever anyone suggested that officials at the FBI and Justice Department might have had a political bias that severely tainted both the investigation into the Trump-Russia and Hillary Clinton email scandals, they were called conspiracy-mongers or worse.XBut if the FBI and Justice are so squeaky clean of political bias, what accounts for the growing pile of top officials deeply involved in those supposedly aboveboard investigations who've been reassigned, demoted or have suddenly quit their jobs? There have been nearly half a dozen in just the past few weeks. Thankfully, reporter Sharyl Attkisson has been keeping a running tally.Here's a rundown.Laufman was Deputy Assistant Attorney General in charge of counterintelligence, cybersecurity, counterespionage and export controls. As the Washington Post put it, Laufman ""had a key role in the Justice Department's investigations of Hillary Clinton and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.""  He was one of the Justice officials who interviewed Hillary Clinton about her email use. Laufman suddenly quit his job last Wednesday, citing ""personal reasons.""His resignation came one day after the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee issued a scathing interim report on the FBI's handling of the Clinton email scandal, in which it said that ""a number of actions by high-level FBI officials"" have called the bureau's integrity and impartiality ""into question.""McCabe, the No. 2 at the FBI, had been planning to leave later this year, but unexpectedly resigned on Jan. 29. McCabe was one of the officials who signed off on the controversial FISA warrants for Carter Page, a warrant based largely on the tainted, Clinton-financed Trump dossier.It turns out that McCabe has been the focus of the Justice Department Inspector General's investigation into how the FBI handled the Clinton email scandal. In late January it came to light that for three weeks he'd apparently sat on information about piles of Hillary Clinton's emails showing up on the laptop of Anthony Weiner — the disgraced former congressman who was married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.Check Out IBD's Complete Coverage Of The Hillary Clinton Email ScandalAccording to the Washington Post, ""the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been asking witnesses why FBI leadership seemed unwilling to move forward on the examination of emails found on the laptop of former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) until late October.""The FBI's general counsel was reassigned in late December amid an investigation by House Republicans into whether he was in contact with David Corn, a reporter for the leftist Mother Jones magazine, about the Trump dossier.Politico quoted sources as saying that documents showed Baker had been in contact with Corn, who was the first to report on the politically motivated dossier.Strzok, the No. 2 official in the FBI's counterintelligence division who had been instrumental in both the Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations, was kicked off the staff of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and sent packing to the FBI's human-resources division, after a series of explosive texts with FBI lawyer and paramour Lisa Page — in which he expressed his utter disdain of Trump.Among other things, Strzok was responsible for watering down how the FBI described Clinton's actions, from ""grossly negligent"" to ""extremely careless."" Page had also been on Mueller's team, but had moved off that before the texts came to light, according to Mueller's office.Ohr had been associate deputy attorney general at Justice, a top-level position, and was director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces. In early December, after a House investigation turned up evidence that Ohr had met with Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and later with the founder of Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele — meetings Ohr failed to disclose— he was demoted. It also turned out that Ohr's wife had worked for Fusion GPSRybicki had been chief of staff to FBI Director James Comey; he resigned in late January to ""accept an opportunity in the corporate sector."" Republican lawmakers had been looking into Rybicki's role in the FBI's handling of the Clinton email scandal.Curiously, the mainstream press appears to be completely uninterested in the implications of these staff shake-ups, and the questions they raise about what it was exactly that the FBI and Justice were doing in the run-up to the November 2016 elections.Why would they? The Trump-hating press are entirely wedded to the idea that the Russia story will someday pay off. Whatever doesn't fit that narrative just gets ignored.RELATED:Russia-Trump Investigation: How Did Hillary Clinton Get FBI, FISA To Do Her Political Dirty Work?Most Think Obama White House Spied On Trump Campaign, Want Special Counsel: IBD/TIPP PollFBI Used Tainted Steele Dossier, Paid For By Hillary Clinton, To Spy On TrumpWant to make more money in the stock market?

108,UPS,"Defense contractors hanging tough in the stock market correction are your stocks to watch this week. Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and L3 Technologies (LLL) have relative strength lines that are at or near highs. Our spotlight on military contractors comes as President Trump on Friday signed a two-year budget bill that will provide the military an additional $165 billion in defense spending.X It's important to stress that in the current stock market correction, these are names to watch for future set-ups, not to buy right now. Stocks that hold up well during a downturn may form new bases and be among the first to break out in a new market uptrend.But if the technicals begin to falter, investors should drop them from their watch lists.The relative strength line is the blue line on the charts below, separate from price action. The RS line shows a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Measuring a stock's relative strength is helpful when separating strong stocks from weak ones. An RS line at an all-time high is especially positive.Boeing is primarily a civilian aircraft maker, but it's still a major defense contractor as well. Shares have hit some turbulence amid the broad selloff, but the Dow Jones industrial average stalwart is holding somewhat near its recent peak. The RS  line hit a new all-time high on Feb. 7, even though the major indexes reversed to close the session lower.Boeing shares rose 3.3% as the major averages rose more than 1%.IBD'S TAKE: With the stock market in a correction, this is not time to start making new buys. But rather than step away completely, it's more important than ever for investors to stay in step with the market. For our latest market analysis, be sure to read The Big Picture.Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defense contractor, was able to find support at the 50-day line early this past week. The RS line is holding at a high, even with shares reversing lower for a second trading session.Lockheed shares advanced 1.3%.Military contractors Raytheon and Northrop Grumman have relative strength lines that are continuing to hit new highs as well, and they too were able to find support at the 50-day line this past week.Raytheon and Northrup shares climbed 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively, on Monday.L3 Technologies is the only defense contractor stock here that is currently testing support at its 50-day line. With the S&P 500 index rebounding from its 200-day line on Friday, leading a broad stock market bounce, L3 closed the week just above its 50-day.

109,UPS,"U.S. stock indexes slouched in early afternoon trading, reversing from early gains of 1% or now to session lows.The market pullback that began after Jan. 26's peak, and turned more aggressive this week, has damaged the bulls' confidence.X The Nasdaq fell 1.2%, while the S&P 500 lost 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average subtracted 1.3%.Volume in the stock market today was up vs. the previous session's pace.If individual investors are looking for a stock that is defying the market's pullback, they might settle on chicken restaurant chain Wingstop (WING). The stock's relative strength line — which measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 — is at a new high. Wingstop is about 3% off its high and has moved sideways during the market's dive, in tight trading that may result in a new pattern.The small-cap company's pretax margin was 29.5% in 2016, the highest in five years. After-tax margin has been running at 19% to 25% in the past three quarters.Wingstop will report Q4 and full-year 2017 results after the close Feb. 22.The Street expects earnings to grow 7% in Q4 and 26% for the full year.

The small-cap stock surged 8% in the first 25 minutes of trade and then pulled back to a near-6%% gain. Ensign was just above a 24.88 buy point, but a poor market makes any stock purchases extra risky.Ensign is thinly traded, but Wasatch Core Growth Fund (WGROX), which is A-rated by IBD, owns the stock.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's winners were a mixed bunch. Chip designers and apparel manufacturers rose. But defensive issues also attracted buying, including food, tobacco and electric utility stocks.The electric utilities group is about 15% off its early December high. Southern Company (SO) is 17% off its high, a decline that has boosted its annualized dividend yield to 5.3%. PPL Corp. (PPL) is 25% off its high, lifting the yield to 5.4%.Losers for the day included travel bookers and automakers.Meanwhile, Congress ended a brief government shutdown and President Trump signed legislation that approved a two-year spending plan.

111,UPS,"That $320 billion, two-year budget deal signed by President Trump on Friday will speed up economic growth and push the jobless rate to 3.2% by the end of 2019, an updated forecast from JPMorgan estimates. That's the kind of fiscal jolt that could keep stock markets jittery for an extended period.X By the end of next year, JPMorgan Chase economists expect the Federal Reserve to hike its key interest rate a whopping eight times — three more than Fed policymakers projected in December. As far as unemployment, Fed projections see it stabilizing at 3.9% next year vs. the current 4.1%JPMorgan's Fed forecast is an outlier, at least for now, but it highlights why stock markets have entered a new phase that may not quickly be left in the rearview mirror.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off sharply on Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high. That triggered a move to a stock market correction. On Friday, the major averages tumbled on the stock market today until the S&P 500 briefly undercut its 200-day moving average. That trigger a sharp rebound, with the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closing up 1.4%-1.5%.Bond and stock markets are suddenly concerned that interest rates will vault higher as the Fed gradually reverses government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis, Treasury issuance balloons to fund the return of trillion-dollar deficits, and the economy shifts into overdrive. It's no help that the deficit outlook will continue to worsen, with $2 trillion annual deficits on their way within a decade.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our weekly cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.On Friday, Moody's said that the ""pre-eminent"" financial and economic position of the U.S. will preserve its triple-A credit. But Moody hinted that its deteriorating fiscal position could jeopardize the U.S. rating amid evidence of ""declining growth potential, coupled with emerging aversion to open trade and foreign labor.""One interesting aspect of JPMorgan's forecast is that even after the bank's economists boosted their forecast of GDP growth by 0.4 percentage point this year to reflect the budget deal, they're still expecting less-than-stellar 2.6% growth this year. In 2019, they see the budget deal lifting growth by 0.3 percentage point above their earlier forecast, but still only to 2.2%.In other words, they suspect that the economy may not have to grow all that fast to generate the kind of wage and inflationary pressures which haven't been seen since before the last recession and which most financial market participants seemed to think were history.It's possible that JPMorgan will be proved wrong by faster productivity growth and labor force growth than it expects. Yet the bank's forecast highlights why Wall Street may no longer be comfortable counting on benign economic outcomes.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the latest budget deal, the balance of economic risks has pretty clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon.com (AMZN) to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.Yet now the risk of investors being caught flat-footed by a rise in inflation is growing as Washington prepares to unleash a second dose of fiscal firepower.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Did Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Market Outlook Changes AgainAmazon Ready To Move On UPS And FedEx

Paycom, a leader in cloud-based human resources management tools, also presented first-quarter revenue guidance in-line with the consensus estimate.General Motors (GM) posted record profits for 2017 and topped fourth-quarter estimates, helped in part by booming crossover sales.

Fellow auto giant Toyota Motor (TM) saw operating profit grow 54% in its fiscal third quarter and lifted its full-year profit forecast.Gilead Sciences (GILD) topped fourth-quarter expectations with adjusted profit of $1.78 per share on $5.95 billion in sales.

114,UPS,"With a portfolio featuring leading stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as of Dec. 31, $1.9 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is going strong after having outperformed both its Morningstar large-cap blend category and the S&P 500 in four of the six most recent full quarters.Its 0.79% gain so far this year going into Thursday — after the market's recent volatility — is also ahead of the big-cap bogey and its peer group.X The fund owes its portfolio firepower to a double-barreled management approach. The fund is run by two groups of managers, who work independently of each other. That doubles their opportunities to generate investment ideas. One group consists of subadvisors Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, who focus on value-oriented stocks for the fund. The second team works for USAA Asset Management, and they focus on growth stocks.""Using two managers with different approaches can potentially provide more consistent returns over the long term,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves.Currently, Barrow Hanley runs about 40% of fund assets, with the balance run by the USAA team. Parent firm USAA maintains that ratio by allocating new inflows.Although the Barrow Hanley team's mandate is to focus on value stocks, their portfolio sleeve still includes leaders like E-Trade and UnitedHealth, which happen to have several traits of top-notch growth names, such as IBD Composite Ratings of 99 and 94 as well as SMR Ratings of A and B respectively.Amazon and Schwab are in the fund's growth sleeve. Amazon sports a red-hot 99% three-year annual earnings per share growth rate. Its three-year sales growth rate is 26%.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with news and analysis of Amazon at IBD's web page devoted to the e-commerce and cloud-computing colossus.Schwab's three-year annual EPS growth rate is 22%. Its EPS is expected to grow 45% this year.And if ups and downs in the stock market today presage additional volatility in the near term, the fund's blended approach should serve it well, says Mark Giambrone, head of the Barrow Hanley team. The value sleeve has ""traditionally outperformed (the overall market) during weaker periods in the market,"" Giambrone said.Still, Giambrone blames recent market volatility on program-trading by index funds. Fundamentals are still sound, in his view. ""We have a positive economic backdrop for corporate earnings and cash flows and consumer confidence and spending,"" he said.E-Trade shares are up 46% in the past 12 months. Giambrone's sleeve has owned E-Trade for several years. As a value investor, he seeks to buy stocks when temporary ills have dropped their share prices. He bought his current E-Trade stake when it was trading below book value due to investors' concerns about its portfolio of home-equity loans, he says.Those loan woes have been cleared up, he says. ""They're garnering market share,"" he said. ""They're benefiting from rising rates (which allows its net interest margin to expand on clients' cash in its custody). And we expect consolidation among online brokerage firms.""Dow Jones industrial giant UnitedHealth is the Giambrone sleeve's largest nonbank position. He sees the firm as a health care technology and services provider. Half of its earnings, he says, come from its Optum unit, which provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services and also runs clinics and doctors' offices.Optum's data cache enables UnitedHealth to lower its own costs and its charges to customers. ""Optum is an incredible growth engine and differentiator for UNH,"" Giambrone said. ""It helps current healthcare clients and non-healthcare clients lower cost trends through technological advances. It is a key driver of the investment thesis.""Overall, UnitedHealth has great cash flow and a reasonable valuation. ""It's mostly a U.S. business, so it's helped by recent tax law changes, which can help raise its earnings,"" Giambrone said.Giambrone also likes Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL). Shares in the multi-cruiseline operator are up about 35% in the past 12 months.Royal Caribbean should benefit from expansion of destinations and markets in China and Cuba, Giambrone says. At the same time, industrywide supply of ships shows only modest growth. Giambrone says earnings should grow for years.He added, ""The company has not benefited from tax reform. But once the market settles and focuses on long-term benefits (of tax reform) rather than short-term reform, the company will benefit meaningfully.""Giambrone says regional bank KeyCorp (KEY) benefits from healthy loan growth. ""Credit (risk) is fairly stable, and tax reform will have a big positive impact on the bank,"" he added. KeyCorp's 2016 acquisition of First Niagara should provide economies of scale, he says.He added, ""We think the regulatory environment should get better for banks.

Should be charging MUCH MORE!"" Trump tweeted Friday morning.Amazon uses the U.S. Postal Service for completing last-mile deliveries, with postal carriers dropping off packages at about 150 million residences and businesses daily.Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, have been frequent targets of Trump over taxes and jobs. Bezos owns the Washington Post, which has written many stories critical of the Trump administration.In August, Trump attacked Amazon over taxes and accused it of causing job losses during a time when Amazon was aggressively hiring, as were businesses across the nation.""Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!,"" Trump said in his Twitter postIn June, Trump attacked Amazon in a tweet, accusing it of ""not paying internet taxes.""

117,UPS,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views.

AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share.

Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

Information technology service firm NIC (EGOV) posted one the session's most perilous early declines, down 17%.PayPal fell 8% at the open. EBay announced during its earnings report late Wednesday that it would curtail its use of PayPal in 2020, and switch to digital payments provider Ayden. The loss sent shares back below the buy point of a flat base they had cleared in early January, but stopped short before cutting the stock's 10-week moving average.Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) gave up almost 6% after a mixed fiscal third-quarter report. The China-based e-commerce leader also announced it had retaken a 33% share in ANT Financial, the unit it had spun off in 2011.

122,UPS,"KB Home (KBH) topped fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates after the close Tuesday. That could trigger breakouts from four rival homebuilders: Lennar (LEN), MDC Holdings (MDC), D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH).Estimates: EPS to jump 53% to 26 cents, with sales up 13.7% to $922 million.Reported: EPS of 33 cents on revenue of $1 billion. Deliveries rose 11% to 2,580 homes.

123,UPS,"Flying drones drop Chipotle (CMG) burritos, 7-Eleven Slurpees and Amazon.com (AMZN) sundries on doorsteps while robots scoot down sidewalks to deliver Domino's (DPZ) pizzas and other meals to homes.These images might conjure thoughts that we've finally entered the age of mechanical gofers, or that we'll soon farm out a slew of summer jobs to robots. But hold on to your transformers for a bit.While companies such as Amazon are pushing the idea of delivery bots — the e-commerce giant now says it wants to start using them for commercial deliveries by the end of 2017 — widespread use of robotic couriers could be years away.Consumers in a few regions and limited test markets are the only ones seeing the benefits, and possible drawbacks, of machines that carry food, drinks and everyday goods to their door. And the tests are raising more questions than they're answering.For one, are these deliveries just publicity stunts designed to show consumer brands are on the cutting edge of technology? Or do they show a future where it might be practical for robots to routinely make home deliveries?""Is there a legitimate business model here? Is there a real need for this? Can I measure ROI (return on investment)? Those are the questions that need to be answered,"" ABI Research analyst Dan Kara told Investor's Business Daily.It's not clear right now that a robot can handle deliveries as fast or better than a human. Further, the long-term costs of developing and deploying bot couriers is unclear. Plus, companies have yet to figure out how to protect that mechanical merchandise.In other words, it could be some time before you'll see robot-delivered pizza on a grand scale. For now, delivery bots are very much an experiment, with companies and consumers in a dot-com-esque honeymoon phase. Some companies are dreaming big, and harsh reality has yet to set in.Amazon got the public excited about the idea of aerial delivery drones when it announced its Prime Air initiative in December 2013. It wasn't until this past March that it conducted its first drone delivery in the U.S., transporting a bottle of sunscreen to a resort in Palm Springs, Calif., during a tech conference.Still, Amazon is sticking to its vision, and hopes to deliver small packages of up to 5 pounds in 30 minutes or less by drones that can fly up to 50 miles per hour.Retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) has expressed interest in making drone deliveries as has Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Google has a drone delivery initiative called Project Wing that is looking to develop automated aircraft to deliver everything from consumer goods to emergency medicine. Last September, Project Wing conducted a test on the Virginia Tech campus, delivering Chipotle burritos by air to students and employees.The movement has prompted delivery specialists, such as FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), to evaluate their options. Self-driving trucks eventually are expected to deploy small robots to deliver packages to your door. But aerial drones are considered a better solution for greater distances, especially in rural and hard-to-reach places.Gartner analyst Gerald Van Hoy believes that commercial drone deliveries in the U.S. are a few years away, but within sight. Business-to-business drone deliveries might help pave the way for consumer deliveries, Van Hoy told IBD. It is easy to calculate the payback of sending a drone to deliver a tool to a worker in the field vs. sending a human driver, he said.By the same token, business uses of wheeled delivery robots could lead to consumer applications as the technology improves and the value proposition becomes clear, ABI's Kara said.Venture capital firms and corporations are funding robotic delivery initiatives on the chance that they could become a huge deal. But that might not happen, Kara said, noting that many millions of dollars were invested in corporate telepresence robots — sort of interoffice gofers — before that market fizzled.Analysts point out robotic delivery systems could help restaurants that struggle to find enough delivery workers. They also could be a hedge against rising employee costs, especially with the Fight For $15 political movement to raise the minimum wage.Ultimately, there will be questions on regulatory restrictions and finding the right business model. Tech companies and government regulators are working out how best to allow delivery robots in the public air space and on streets and walkways. The biggest questions are business-related, and whether delivery bots are economically feasible, Kara said.A raft of companies have developed robotics, including Google, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Roomba maker iRobot (IRBT). A few private companies, however, have come to the forefront when it comes to delivery bots.They include two startups, Marble and Starship Technologies, two private robotic firms. In April, Yelp's (YELP) Eat24 food delivery service partnered with Marble to test robotic deliveries with a handful of restaurants in a couple San Francisco neighborhoods.The Eat24-branded robots are the size of a shopping cart. They navigate city sidewalks with artificial intelligence, cameras, ultrasonic sensors and light detection, or lidar, sensors. Typical deliveries are within a mile. Customers are sent a four-digit code to open the four-wheeled robot's storage compartment.Rival delivery robot firm Starship started making food deliveries in Silicon Valley in March. Starship also has conducted trials in Austin, Texas; Portland, Ore.; and Washington, D.C., as well as a dozen European countries.Starship robots are roughly the size of large picnic coolers and have six wheels. In March, Starship announced a deal with Domino's to deliver pizzas by robot within a one-mile radius around its outlets in select German and Dutch cities.While sidewalk robots are seen as the best solution for short-distance deliveries in cities, some politicians don't like the idea.In May, San Francisco Supervisor Norman Yee introduced legislation that would ban autonomous delivery robots from city sidewalks, largely for safety concerns. Those concerns range from machines getting in the way of cars and pedestrians to lawbreakers stealing or vandalizing them.On the other side of the coin, humanitarian concerns are a consideration.Last September, UPS partnered with drone maker CyPhy Works to test the use of drones to make commercial deliveries of packages to remote locations. The companies staged a mock delivery of urgently needed medicine from Beverly, Mass., to Children's Island, about three miles off the Atlantic coast. In the mock scenario, the drone successfully carried an asthma inhaler to a child at a camp on the island.Zipline International is using fixed-wing drones to deliver medical products, such as blood products and rabies treatments, to remote locations. It currently is serving 21 hospitals in Rwanda. Its drones can deliver to any site within about 47 miles, or 93 miles round-trip. As of November, Zipline had raised $43 million in funding.""The humanitarian side of drone deliveries is starting to be talked about a lot more,"" Gretchen West, co-executive director of the Commercial Drone Alliance, told IBD. ""It's delivering medicine, aid and supplies after a catastrophe or to remote locations where roads could be washed out. We're starting to see a lot more of that, not just consumer delivery.""Already, several companies are making headway deploying robots to deliver items in structured environments like hospitals and hotels, he said. Pittsburgh-based Aethon makes delivery robots for hospitals to ferry food, medicine, towels and other items. San Jose, Calif.-based Savioke makes robots for delivering items to consumers in hotels and high-rise buildings.West says drone deliveries to consumers will happen, but will take longer for the puzzle pieces to come together. Right now, commercial drones in the U.S. face strict limitations.For instance, they can't fly over people, must be operated within visual line of sight, and can't fly at night. Many of these problems will be solved by an unmanned aircraft system traffic management system under development by NASA, she said.""It will take several years,"" West said. ""None of this moves very quickly.""

125,UPS,"Word on the Street is that Nike (NKE) will start selling its wares directly on Amazon (AMZN). That means shares of sports stores Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) are taking their turn at having an Amazon-induced anxiety attack Wednesday.X ""Our channel checks indicate that NKE could be close to finalizing an agreement to sell directly on Amazon.com as a wholesaler,"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann in an early Wednesday note to clients.By midday, Bloomberg had reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, that Nike would sell footwear directly on Amazon through a brand-registry program in a bid to combat knockoff Nikes from appearing on the site.Nike, Adidas (ADDYY), Hanes (owned by Hanesbrands (HBI)) and Under Armour (UAA) are the most frequently bought brands on the site, per an April report from Morgan Stanley, which means Amazon is already a hot destination for customers looking for athleticwear.For Nike specifically, that could bring in an extra $300 million to $500 million in wholesale revenue from Amazon alone, estimated Goldman Sachs, which also said that such a partnership could allow Nike better control over its brand and inventory on the site, as well as access to coveted millennial shoppers.But that could mean fewer ring-ups at the cash register for sports apparel and equipment retailers. Foot Locker shares sank 5% to close at 47.82 in the stock market today, hitting a three-year low. Foot Locker is down more than 20% so far in June after crashing 23% in May.Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled fell 3.8% to the lowest in more than a year. Finish Line (FINL) lost 4% and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) shed 4%, with both falling to their worst levels since 2010.Nike did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Its shares finished 2% higher. Under Armour fell 0.8%, and Amazon rose 1%.It is worth pointing out that if such a deal were indeed to happen, it is not clear whether that would open Nike's entire arsenal of popular apparel and footwear brands to Amazon's reach — an important distinction when it comes to discussing the impact of a potential team-up on Nike's brand image and on sporting goods retailers.We do not know the scope here— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) June 21, 2017Morgan Stanley, in a separate note from earlier this month, had already surmised that athletic apparel brands would sell directly to Amazon (instead of avoiding it altogether, like some retailers), but that they would have an ""appropriate-sized presence there,"" with products and price points that ""won't compromise the integrity of the offering elsewhere.""Nike is notably building out its own direct-to-consumer shops and online platform — so much so that it has muted the importance of its retailer-based ""futures"" metric —  and all the major athletic brands are developing their supply chain and manufacturing technology to increase speed to market.""The big athleticwear brands will offer much better product on non-Amazon channels,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts on June 6. ""If consumers want the hot fashion or the personalized products, they won't be able to get it on Amazon.""Notably, however, smaller rival Under Armour already sells direct on Amazon and through licensed dealers on Amazon Marketplace, said Goldman Sachs, an aspect which gives the Baltimore-based brand ""a clear edge over (Nike) in how fresh product was presented on Amazon.com.""Some worry about what Nike sales on Amazon would mean for the e-commerce giant's development of its own private apparel labels.Would signal Nike's death as Amazon is launching private labels and Nike would supply them with the data needed to build their athleisure.— Chris Burns (@archbyccb) June 21, 2017But Morgan Stanley's analysts said — at least, prior to Wednesday's chatter — that ""no private label maker will likely have a supply chain as fast that can deliver as much fashion newness, and this would be a major roadblock for Amazon because it too aims to move to a fast fashion model.""RELATED:Nike To Shrink Workforce As Stores Seen 'Canceling' Under ArmourNike, Adidas Have This 'Major Roadblock' Against Amazon

Sales climbed to more than a $1 billion despite what CEO Kevin Plank described as sluggish sales of Curry basketball shoes.Meanwhile, a resurgent Adidas (ADDYY) has been gaining market share in the U.S. and has seen revenue surge in the key North American market. That contrasts with Nike, which has lost momentum in its home market. On Tuesday, retailer Foot Locker (FL), which relies on Nike for two-thirds of its sales, was downgraded on expectations of slowing sales.From a longer-term perspective, the athletic brands and their retail partners are under pressure from internet juggernaut Amazon (AMZN), but Nike and Under Armour have been streamlining supply-chain operations to protect against that threat by getting new products to market faster.RELATED:Under Armour Loss Less Than Feared; Stock Clears Key HurdleNike, Adidas Have This 'Major Roadblock' Against Amazon

130,UPS,"Many negative consequences flow reliably from a financial crisis, including unemployment, political turmoil, and piles of sovereign debt. Since the 2008 financial meltdown, however, we've seen none of the good consequences — and there are supposed to be good ones.XCrashes and severe recessions often are followed by bursts of innovation that lay the groundwork for several decades of future growth and productivity increases. Severe economic downturns can perform a vital cleansing for the economy, toppling unchallengeable market positions and clearing a path for newcomers with disruptive ideas. The economic transformations that followed major worldwide crashes prior to 2008 — in 1873, 1929, and 1973—were breathtaking.Yet here we are, nearly a decade after the worst financial crisis in modern memory, and we've seen few of these kinds of benefits. Don't let heady stock prices, record corporate profits, and low unemployment fool you. America is only now emerging from a lost decade. Instead of renewal, the last ten years were blighted by slow growth, stagnant productivity, limited social mobility, long-term unemployment and underemployment, and despair.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe economic legacy of the last decade is excessive corporate consolidation, a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% from the middle class, the creation of even more asset bubbles, and rising social tensions. America is incredibly resilient. We are not Japan. We are recovering.But the Federal Reserve Board, the government body charged with establishing the monetary conditions for economic recovery, has hampered it at every stage. The Fed is not solely responsible for America's lost decade — the impact of its misguided policies was compounded by other factors, including regulatory and congressional capture and crony capitalism.Yet the central bank did play a central role. There is little evidence to suggest that it recognizes this fact, or that recent appointments will challenge the status quo.Economic historians will debate the causes of the 2007-08 financial crisis for years, but it's clear that a flood of cheap money and a breakdown of oversight had inflated a gigantic asset bubble, the bursting of which triggered the crisis. During the boom years, no one noticed the growing problem.But things began going bad in 2007; and 2008, of course, brought catastrophe. Insisting initially that the economy had entered a normal postwar recession, the Fed acted with uncertainty, helping some big banks but allowing Lehman Brothers to fail — which brought the financial system to the brink of collapse. Ben Bernanke's Federal Reserve, along with Hank Paulson's Treasury, then acted fast to prop up the system, hoping to avoid a total meltdown.Averting a crisis was necessary. But the Fed and the Treasury did not stop there. They wound up bailing out huge Wall Street banks that contribute little to the productive ""real"" economy, along with insurers (AIG) and huge and inefficient industrial companies.Embarking on a new policy of ""quantitative easing"" to bolster the lending market, the Fed blew up its balance sheet by purchasing debt to keep interest rates down, certain that productive borrowing would ensue. Before the crash, at the end of July 2008, the Fed's assets were $0.9 trillion. By July 2017, they had ballooned to $4.5 trillion.These measures yielded little. Near-zero rates did not spur an expansion of jobs or of productivity-enhancing research. Instead, the easy money went to other uses, including the funding of mergers and acquisitions among giant companies and private-equity-sponsored, highly leveraged buyouts.It is community and regional banks, along with private credit companies and lenders, that drive growth by lending money to smaller enterprises to build out productive capacity.But the Fed and the Treasury concentrated on helping the institutions that they knew best — the mega-banks that, by 2008, had largely exited the business of lending to smaller companies and were focused on securities trading, proprietary investing, and serving large enterprises, governments, and financial institutions. The mega-banks' market share has relentlessly increased.After eight years of Fed support, plus increased concentration and wide regulatory moats, the profitability of the huge banks has more than recovered — but with what results? The overall economy saw no obvious benefit. Meantime, the community and regional banking system atrophied.In the past, the resulting loss in lending would have been filled by new, locally focused banks. This time, ultralow interest rates and expensive new regulations made starting new banks almost impossible. The number of new banks plummeted from an average of 200 each year prior to 2008 to fewer than one a year since the crash. Lending to small businesses shrank.At the same time, cheap credit helped large companies create monopolies and oligopolies across many industry segments, resulting in a level of concentration and monopoly profits in the American economy not seen in over 100 years.This, again, was not just the Federal Reserve's fault. The decline of American antitrust enforcement, going back to the 1990s — permitting levels of consolidation and anti-competitive practices that wouldn't have been tolerated 30 years ago — added to the problem, as did the smothering tangle of laws and regulations that descended on American business from every level of government, which disproportionately affected smaller, innovative firms while benefiting incumbents.In retrospect, everything that the Fed did in response to the crisis entrenched the status quo. Though the mega-banks were insolvent, the government chose not to restructure them directly and instead provided them with a ""too big to fail"" guarantee, letting them borrow at almost no cost and rebuild their capital without imposing obligations.For their part, the regional and community banks and credit companies that actually financed job creation faced substantially increased regulatory burdens and pressure to reduce their loan exposures.Further, the central bank failed to grasp the critical role of credit pipelines, which enable smaller institutions to resell loans, thereby freeing up balance-sheet capacity to make more loans. These collapsed. As well, lending between banks ground to a halt, drying up a market that provided these smaller institutions with access to liquidity, without which they had to keep more short-term assets on hand, thus further reducing their loan portfolios.Given the severity of the Great Recession, we might have expected far better. The historical pattern has been that the most severe downturns heralded the most robust recoveries. And those robust rebounds normally happened fast.  In a 2017 paper, ""Deep Recessions, Fast Recoveries, and Financial Crises: Evidence from the American Record,"" economists Michael Bordo and Joseph Haubrich write that ""recessions associated with financial crises are generally followed by rapid recoveries.""Not this time. In 2014, economist John B. Taylor, an influential scholar of monetary policy who was considered to succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chief, said that the U.S. recovery ""remains an outlier, as one of the few cases where output did not return to the level of the previous peak after the duration of the recession."" In fact, the post-2008 recovery may be the weakest that America has ever had — even compared with the post-1929 recovery.A main culprit was all that cheap money. Economist Sébastien E. J. Walker and I studied the impact of ultralow interest rates on economic growth, publishing our findings in 2012. Despite an almost religious faith among economists and central bankers in the benefits of near-zero rates, an extensive search of the literature failed to turn up any previous empirical studies showing that ultralow rates were beneficial.The conventional and unchallenged economic wisdom — the lower the rate, the greater the subsequent growth — was wrong, at least at recent rate levels. It's true that, when adjusted for other variables, lower real interest rates were associated with faster economic growth in subsequent periods — but only up to a point.Contrary to expectations, rates below the normal rate actually retarded subsequent growth. The relationship between real interest rates and subsequent economic growth is defined by a curve, not an upward sloping line.Ultralow rates ease the pressure on enterprises to adopt productivity-enhancing innovations, restructure inefficient operations, and dispose of unproductive assets. That's a major reason that productivity growth has been so poor.Ultralow rates also distort capital allocation. Governments overborrow, and large corporations favor debt over equity in their capital mix. Speculation abounds. Yet because of the bifurcation of the credit markets caused by the withdrawal of smaller lending institutions, interest rates are far from zero for small and medium-size businesses, which, through this entire period, have paid relatively high rates.Job growth historically has come from innovative new enterprises. The number of new firms has fallen substantially since the crash. The percentage of employment in start-ups has dropped dramatically.Limited access to credit by smaller enterprises is a factor in this decline, as are the intertwined constraints of low growth prospects, high costs of regulation and health care, and difficulties penetrating markets against entrenched players and limited incentives for many customers to change.Yet positive change seems to be arriving at last. In Washington, the Trump administration is pushing to dismantle costly regulations that affect business. The ideological tide regarding antitrust interventions is shifting, even at the University of Chicago. Corporate taxes have been slashed, perhaps leading to repatriation of offshore funds. The state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which largely benefits the rich (and public employees) in places like New York, is being reduced or eliminated.Despite the effects of counterproductive policies, the U.S. economy looks poised once again to embark on an innovation surge of historic proportions, one that will disrupt established players, generate substantial returns for investors, and improve the lives of working Americans.The technological foundation for historic change is already in place. The adaptability of on-demand Internet services, for example, which has already reshaped the taxi industry, will soon have similar effects on many other industries.The Internet has penetrated almost every sector of society, and rapid advances in miniaturization have driven staggering increases in the computing power, bandwidth, and cloud storage that a dollar will buy.Global bandwidth, storage, and processing capabilities increase a thousandfold each decade. That is a millionfold increase in capability since the last great wave of innovation, in the late 1990s.  Data storage is now virtually free, enabling a vast range of cloud and hybrid applications. Artificial intelligence is evolving rapidly.Perhaps the most far-reaching innovations will occur in medicine, with the cheap digitization of genetics, and in business services, where enterprise-scale information technology, still operating in large part on legacy systems, will soon be replaced by advanced frameworks that can help corporations put their data to productive use, reduce expenses, and improve overall efficiency. These systems are likely to be more secure and far cheaper and easier to operate.There was hope that President Trump would nominate a new Fed leader (to replace outgoing chair Yellen) who would depart from the policies of the past decade. Unfortunately, Trump's choice of current Fed governor Jerome Powell as the central bank's new chairman is not likely to result in fundamental policy change.As the Washington Post reports, ""Powell is widely expected to keep Yellen's tactics largely in place, albeit with a bit more of a Wall Street touch."" More of a ""Wall Street touch"" is precisely what we don't need. The next chair would best serve the American people by bringing a missing Main Street touch to the Fed and working with other agencies to rebuild the lending infrastructure for growing smaller businesses.One way or another, though, the Fed's protracted experiment with ultralow rates is going to end. Fed or no Fed, the next big boom seems about to burst forth. Americans remain the world's best creative destructionists.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

133,UPS,"Netflix (NFLX) shares raced into record high territory in early trading Tuesday after the internet television network posted a huge beat in subscriber additions in the fourth quarter, despite enacting a price increase.X Netflix late Monday said it added 8.33 million new subscribers worldwide in the fourth quarter, soundly beating its target of 6.3 million. It ended the December quarter with 117.58 million streaming subscribers worldwide, including 54.75 million in the U.S. and 62.83 million in foreign markets.Netflix stock soared 10% higher to hit a new closing high at 250.29 on the stock market today. It hit a regular-session record high of 257.71 intraday.The stock earned a slew of price-target increases from Wall Street analysts. The most bullish of the bunch is Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger, who upped his target to 302 from 230 and kept his outperform rating.Here are five key takeaways from Netflix's fourth-quarter earnings report:Netflix was conservative with its fourth-quarter guidance because of the price increases announced to its service plans in early October, Netflix Chief Financial Officer David Wells said on an investor webcast Monday.In the U.S., it raised the price of its midrange plan, which allows high-definition video streaming on two devices at a time, to $10.99 a month from $9.99. It upped the price of its top-tier plan, which allows ultra-high-definition video streaming on up to four screens at the same time, to $13.99 a month from $11.99. Netflix kept its basic plan, which allows standard-definition video streaming on one device at a time, at $7.99 a month. It also hiked its prices in Europe.Despite the price increases, Netflix had a ""great"" quarter for subscriber additions, thanks to the strength of its content offering, Wells said.The company credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period.""We saw very little effect on sign-ups and growth"" from the price increases, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the webcast. ""Our content is making us a primary focus for consumers' entertainment. And so our responsibility is then to take that increased revenue and turn that into even better content. That's the fundamental deal. And consumers are tolerant as long as something's improving.""Netflix added nearly 2 million U.S. streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter, beating its target for 1.25 million.Hastings noted that the company predicted five years ago it could grow to 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the U.S. alone. At 55 million U.S. streaming subscribers today, it hasn't even hit the low end of that projection, he said.Netflix expects to get late adopters to its service through deals with cable and other pay-TV services. Those arrangements are designed to make it easy for consumers to sign up for Netflix through their current pay-TV provider, Netflix Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said on the webcast.Netflix management believes the internet television market will be able to support many successful streaming services.It cited Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) as two rivals to watch in the year ahead, with Walt Disney (DIS) joining the fray in 2019.""Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with
"
134,UPS,"Apple Music or with iOS,"" Netflix executives said in a letter to shareholders.Hastings said he's looking forward to Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming video offering and expects to be a subscriber himself.""We think (it) will be very successful because Disney has super strong brands,"" Hastings said. ""We don't see it as a threat to us any more than Hulu has been.""Netflix's big-budget fantasy action movie ""Bright"" was savaged by critics, but Netflix subscribers loved it.""The consumer response, the viewer response, to the film has been great,"" Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on the webcast. ""It's one of our most watched pieces of original content, meaning TV show or film, that we've ever had on Netflix.""A better indicator than critics' reviews are user reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and user ratings on IMDb, Sarandos said.""The critics are pretty disconnected from the mass appeal,"" Hastings said.""Bright"" received just 26% positive reviews from critics, according to aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, but the audience score for the movie is 86% positive.""Bright"" reportedly cost $90 million to make and stars Will Smith and Joel Edgerton as cop partners in an alternate present-day where humans, orcs, elves and fairies coexist.Netflix said it expects to spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content in 2018, but that spending has grown along with Netflix's subscriber base, Wells said.However, Netflix is seeing the factors influencing its working capital needs on content starting to moderate, he said.Wall Street has been waiting for Netflix to take its foot off the accelerator when it comes to content spending and focus more on profitability and monetizing its huge user base.Netflix earned 41 cents a share, up 173% year over year, on sales of $3.29 billion, up 33%, for the December quarter.For the March quarter, Netflix expects to earn 63 cents a share, up 58%, on sales of $3.69 billion, up 40%.RELATED:Netflix Stock Jumps On Big Increase In New Subscribers

136,UPS,"Has Bitcoin's sharp pullback created a buying opportunity? Or is Bitcoin just a shell game that preys on gullible suckers? One way to distill an answer is to look at how some of Wall Street's sharpest money managers play the cryptocurrency — at least, the ones who are willing to get involved with Bitcoin at all.X Even shrewd investors disagree about the wisdom of Bitcoin bets. Legendary investor Warren Buffett recently repeated that he will never invest in Bitcoin. Yet just one day earlier JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said he regrets calling Bitcoin a fraud.So with experts divided, how should you proceed? Invest? Or not? Volatility is part of the controversy. As of early Monday afternoon, the price of Bitcoin was around $10,470. That was a stomach-churning 46% below its Dec. 16 peak of $19,343.If you do invest in Bitcoin, are direct investments the best way to go? Some professional investors, including 11 mutual funds, use indirect investments instead. Among their mutual funds, hedge funds and private accounts, Kinetics Asset Management holds Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies that were worth about $200 million as of Dec. 31, says Peter Doyle, co-manager of $171 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX).IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with news about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at IBD's special section devoted to news and trends about digital currencies.Doyle and his colleagues' performance kicked butt in 2017, helped by their Bitcoin exposure. Among their mutual funds, Kinetics Internet's 57.43% gain made it the second-best performing U.S. diversified stock mutual fund with at least $100 million in assets that year. The $15.6 million Kinetics Global (KGLAX) jumped 50.29%, topping 97% of its world small-/midcap peers, according to Morningstar Direct.Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities (KSCOX), with $197.1 million in assets, gained 26.23%. That made it the fourth-best performing small-cap blend fund. And $829 million Kinetics Paradigm's (WWNPX) 28.41% return was better than 80% of its midcap growth peers.Bitcoin itself soared 1,204% in calendar 2017, according to Coindesk.com.Kinetics mutual funds had Bitcoin exposure through Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rather than Bitcoin itself. Weightings in GBTC ranged from 12.10% by Internet to 1.32% for Small Cap Opportunities as of Sept. 30.Why do Kinetics funds own the digital currency indirectly rather than directly? ""The Securities and Exchange Commission won't let us self-custody Bitcoin itself, so owning it through Bitcoin Investment Trust is how we avoid that issue,"" Doyle said. GBTC is run by Grayscale Investments. ""Grayscale provides custodianship.""Five Kinetics funds are among 11 mutual funds that held 4.4% of GBTC shares as of Dec. 31, according to IBD data. The $554 million Emerald Banking & Finance (HSSAX) had 1.39% of its shareholders' money at work in GBTC as of Nov. 30.GBTC is publicly traded on the OTCQX, which is run by OTC Markets Group (OTCMKTS). Publicly traded companies' financial statements are audited. GBTC's financial statements are audited by Friedman LLP.GBTC's share price is set once daily like a mutual fund, although GBTC is neither a mutual fund nor an ETF and thus is not regulated under the auspices of the Securities Act of 1940.Like most publicly traded securities, you can own GBTC shares in your own name. You can leave GBTC shares to beneficiaries. You can even own them in certain IRAs.According to Grayscale, Bitcoin Investment Trust assets are stored with Xapo Inc.,  a third-party custodian. Access requires ""multisignature addresses, the private keys for which are protected by intense cryptographic, physical and process security.""Tight security is necessary because hackers have attacked various Bitcoin deposit sites. Hackers have stolen more than 14% of the total supply of Bitcoin and Ether, another digital currency, Bloomberg quoted security expert Lex Sokolin as saying last week. Last month, Youbit, a South Korean Bitcoin exchange, was forced to shut after hackers stole 17% of its assets.Assuming industrywide security issues can be solved and the price of Bitcoin can rally, why wouldn't everyone trade Bitcoin through GBTC rather than the cryptocurrency itself?One reason is that, like many hedge funds, Grayscale limits access to shares to accredited investors.That means only a person whose earned income exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year. Alternatively, you must have a net worth of more than $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse, excluding the value of your primary residence.A second reason is that GBTC shares trade at a steep premium to the value of Bitcoin itself. Each GBTC share represented 0.09181239 Bitcoin as of Dec. 31. At Friday's Bitcoin price of $10,470, each GBTC share represents about $961 of Bitcoin.But GBTC shares traded for 1688 each as of Monday afternoon. That's a whopping 76% premium to the value of the Bitcoins held by GBTC.Some premium might be justifiable if it's easier to buy and sell shares of this trust than to trade in Bitcoin itself. You also don't have to store and guard GBTC shares as zealously as Bitcoin. But is a 76% premium your idea of reasonable?James Davolos, a manager of Kinetics Internet, said, ""For the average investor now, the complexity of setting up a digital wallet and buying tokens on exchanges and linking them to a bank account is laborious and complicated. For a lot of individual investors, there is a high utility value in owning Bitcoin through a trust, which contributes to the premium.""Doyle adds that the trust also adds value by enabling an investor to lend and borrow shares. ""People pay 25% to 30% just for that,"" he said. ""So while there is a premium to GBTC, it is not as great as people think.""In addition, the Kinetics team is not fazed by the volatility shown by Bitcoin or the trust. ""Our overall cost basis is probably no more than $20 million, probably closer to $15 million, so even with these ups and down we've still made a lot of money and are not alarmed,"" Doyle said.Kinetics first got interested in Bitcoin and its proxies because of the interest in cryptography held by Murray Stahl, CEO of parent company Horizon Kinetics. Stahl also felt consumers and investors would gravitate to a currency that provides an alternative to ""the flawed global banking system and governments' (excess) printing of money. In fact, demand would outstrip supply, and that would be reflected in cryptocurrency's rising price,"" Doyle said.In any case, Grayscale plans an action to make GBTC's share price more affordable, at least psychologically. GBTC says it will split its shares 91-for-1. Shareholders of record as of Jan. 22's market close will get the split, which is slated for completion on Jan. 26. Shares trading for 1768, for example, would then cost about 19.43.""That split will make GBTC much more liquid,"" said Bradford Pine, president of Bradford Pine Wealth Group, a financial advisory firm in Garden City, N.Y. ""That may draw more sophisticated money into this (GBTC).""Overall, Doyle is bullish. ""Ultimately, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become more routine in our economy,"" he said. ""Then you won't make an extra rate of return on them. That's probably five or six years from now. In the meantime, as a potential form of new currency, in the foreseeable future, you can make an extraordinary rate of return for maybe three or five years.""If that outlook is wrong? ""I can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end,"" Warren Buffett recently told CNBC.On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission told the Investment Company Institute (ICI), a trade group representing mutual funds and ETFs, that before it green-lights Bitcoin investments by mutual funds, funds must satisfy SEC questions concerning valuation, liquidity and security.The SEC wrote, ""(We) are not aware of a custodian currently providing fund custodial services for cryptocurrencies. In addition, how would a fund intend to validate existence, exclusive ownership and software functionality of private cryptocurrency keys and other ownership records? To what extent would cybersecurity threats or the potential for hacks on digital wallets impact the safekeeping of fund assets under the 1940 Act?""RELATED:How To Decide If Bitcoin Is Safe For You To Trade

138,UPS,"Driven to help solve their clients' problems, advisors tend to derive great satisfaction from their work. But sometimes, mundane aspects of the job get in the way.Dealing with administrative hassles, compliance issues, and squabbles among staffers can lead to burnout. Conducting daily client reviews can turn what was once a stimulating experience into boring, repetitive drudgery.Ensnared in a workaday routine, advisors may not notice their eroding enthusiasm until it's too late. As their listlessness deepens into a more serious funk, they can lose their spark and might dread coming into the office.The most attentive advisors ward off burnout before it intensifies. They take proactive steps — such as taking time off or at least not overloading their schedule — so that they stay fresh and committed to providing excellent service.""Years of ups and downs in the market can wear on you,"" said Tony Perrone, an advisor in Orlando, Fla. ""And then there's what I call 'compliance burnout' with all the changes in compliance that can seem overwhelming.""For Perrone, 47, the solution is adopting a four-day workweek as much as possible. For the last four years, he has taken off most Fridays.""It's a good remedy that lets the staff catch up with you not there,"" he said. ""You give them that time to breathe, and that makes them happier. When they're in a better mood, I'm in a better mood the other four days.""Perrone acknowledges that he has the option to take one day off a week because he's paid his dues. He launched his career 24 years ago, and he says that for the first 20 years ""you've got to run full speed.""He cites two side benefits from skipping most Fridays. For starters, Perrone feels less compelled to take extended vacations. He says that the longest he's been away from the office is five business days.""And I probably took 10 client calls that week,"" he added.Second, his three employees enjoy operating autonomously when he's not around. His absence gives them a chance to take more responsibility and build stronger relationships with clients.Other advisors view sabbaticals as a welcome option to combat a midcareer lull. Taking a month or more to step away from the business can reignite an advisor's passion.A handful of larger firms offer sabbaticals, and some implement programs to encourage advisors to recharge periodically. A few firms go further, requiring advisors to take extended leave.At BKD Wealth Advisors, every advisor takes a one-month paid sabbatical every five years. It's a non-negotiable condition of employment.""The firm asks a lot from you for the other four years and 11 months,"" said Jack Thurman, managing partner at the Springfield, Mo.-based company. ""Everyone loves the sabbatical.""Over the 17 years that BKD's program has been in place, Thurman has qualified for three sabbaticals. He's enjoyed leisure travel, including fly fishing, and spent the last week at home to smooth the transition back to the office.Part of the rationale for mandatory sabbaticals is that it forces advisors to provide extensive professional development to employees. They must train their team to handle myriad tasks while they're away for a month.""We believe that you have to be replaceable and set up duplicative processes,"" Thurman said. ""You have to teach people to be better than you. A sabbatical won't be successful for those who don't like to delegate.""To minimize disruption, BKD advisors commit to their month off a year in advance. This enables colleagues to plan for their absence.During their month away, they cannot access their work email or voice mail. Co-workers provide client service and manage other duties so that the advisor can relax without worrying about paperwork piling up.""You turn it off for one full month and you turn it off hard,"" Thurman said. ""When you get back, you should have no email, so there's no need to play catch-up.""The forced vacation allows some midcareer advisors to reassess their careers. Thurman says that while some partners in their 50s return with renewed verve, others decide to take early retirement. The sabbatical thus affords them a chance to reflect on their personal and professional priorities.Thurman, 55, returned from his last sabbatical two years ago with a clearer picture of how he intends to harness his energy. To pave the way for his retirement, he seeks to create a lasting system of excellence.""I want to leave a legacy at this firm,"" he said. ""I'm focusing on a good risk structure and building operational efficiencies so that when I leave, I've laid the groundwork for a successful transition.""RELATED:Top Advisors Discuss Their Most Valuable LessonsStarting Over: Setbacks Vanquished And Lessons Learned

Women's apparel retailer J. Jill (JILL) shot up on its strong results. Vera Bradley (VRA) delivered mixed results while highly rated closeout retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) topped quarterly estimates after the close.Michael Kors lost 17 cents a share, but earned 73 cents excluding big impairment charges. That beat estimates for 70 cents according to Zacks Investment Research, but was down from 74 cents a year earlier. Revenue tumbled 11% to $1.06 billion, though that narrowly exceeded views for $1.048 billion. Same-store sales sank 14.1%.Kors sees fiscal Q1 EPS of 60-64 cents with sales of $910 million to $930 million, and a comps decline in the high-single digit range. Analysts expect EPS of 75 cents on revenue of $950 million.""Fiscal 2017 was a challenging year, as we continued to operate in a difficult retail environment with elevated promotional levels,"" CEO John Idol said in Kors' earnings statement. ""In addition, our product and store experience did not sufficiently engage and excite consumers. We acknowledge that we need to take further steps to elevate the level of fashion innovation in our accessories assortments and enhance our store experience.""Kors' weak results and guidance come after rival Coach (COH) recently agreed to buy handbag rival Kate Spade (KATE).

The premium handset is rumored to feature a borderless OLED display, glass-sandwich design, wireless charging and augmented-reality features.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich on Monday reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock and raised his price target to 170 from 165.The potential increase in iPhone average selling prices is not reflected in Wall Street's current consensus estimates, Milunovich said. He estimates that iPhone ASP could be as much as $783 during the iPhone 8 cycle. His current ASP target is $730.RELATED:What iPhone 8 Delay?

143,UPS,"It seems Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) no longer needs Eric Schmidt's adult supervision.X After 17 years in senior management, Schmidt is relinquishing his executive chairman role. He was recruited from Novell when Google had just 200 employees; now it's a dominant global force in search, online advertising and video.The founders — in their 20s when Schmidt came aboard — know how to build it from here. And they have help from newer leaders like Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, Chief Financial Offer Ruth Porat and cloud chief Diane Greene.Schmidt, 62, will become a technical adviser to Alphabet while continuing to serve as a director, the company said in a prepared statement Thursday. Alphabet expects the board to appoint a non-executive chairman.Schmidt served as Google's chief executive officer for 10 years until 2011, when he handed the reins to co-founder Larry Page. He was initially brought in to add more seasoned leadership to the fast-growing startup, as the ""adult supervision"" for the founders overwhelmed by the company's rapid growth.Schmidt presided over successes such as Google's initial public offering in 2004; the launch of Gmail, Maps and the Chrome browser; the acquisition of YouTube in 2006; and the rise of Android into the world's largest mobile operating system. When he joined as CEO in 2001, Google had fewer than 15 million unique monthly visitors online. A decade later, when he changed roles, that number topped a billion.Google shares were priced at 85 for its August 2004 initial public offering and now are approaching 1,100 a share. Shares ended regular trading Friday down marginally to 1,068.86Schmidt also navigated more challenging issues. He argued in Google's corner when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched an antitrust probe into its search service, and negotiated for the company in overseas jurisdictions that are more critical of the company's practices than the U.S.""They've been acting like a more mature, long-term thinking company for a while now, and that's what he was brought in to do,"" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. ""They've got a more mature team in the leadership office, they've brought some good names.""Schmidt's public image — speaking out on regulatory issues, mingling with world leaders at Davos and becoming a fixture at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert — contrasted with the Google co-founder's preference to be more private. Schmidt became an ambassador for the company to other governments and corporate leaders, allowing Page and fellow founder Sergey Brin to focus on inventing.Outside Google, Schmidt led a sometimes controversial life. He was deeply involved in financing and strategy for Democratic presidential candidates in the U.S., including Hillary Clinton — and was even seen wearing a ""staff"" badge at one of her campaign parties in November 2016. That's made him less of a policy asset under the Trump administration and with Republicans in power.Schmidt's private life may also be more of a liability these days. He is said to have pursued romantic relationships with several women while maintaining his marriage, according to the New York Post, Vanity Fair and other publications. This year, the male-dominated tech industry has been hit by several scandals over harassment and other mistreatment of women. Google had to deal with internal complaints about gender inequality after it fired a male engineer who wrote a memo saying women are biologically less suited than men to be engineers.""It does raise other questions as to why,"" O'Donnell said, ""and in this time and era there have to be other questions.""Alphabet didn't provide a specific reason for his departure at this time. In the statement, Schmidt said that he, Brin, Page and Pichai ""all believe the time is right in Alphabet's evolution for this transition."" He added that he's been spending a lot of time in recent years on science and technology issues as well as philanthropy and plans to expand that work. Alphabet's shares were little changed in early trading Friday in New York.One former Google executive said it was surprising Schmidt hadn't relinquished the chairman role sooner, noting that Page and Brin are firmly in command and have been for at least a couple of years. The person asked not to be identified talking about private company matters.In 2015, Google re-organized into the broader Alphabet holding company, a change that Schmidt helped oversee. As part of that shift, Page took over as CEO of the parent company while naming Pichai head of the Google division. In July, Pichai joined the board of directors.Schmidt also spent more time working on his philanthropic endeavors. He owns about 1.3% of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company, and is worth about $13.6 billion, ranking him 96th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

146,UPS,"Oil prices have started the new year at the highest levels since 2015, raising hopes for a sustained rally after more than three years of ups and downs that saw drastic role reversals among the industry's top players.X As investors sort out how much the industry will return to business as usual and how much a new normal will take root, here are five issues to watch:After prices crashed in 2014, oil giants took the unusual step of cutting dividends or halting buybacks to conserve cash. But they appear to have turned a corner last year after reining in investments and selling some assets. U.S. tax cuts will also free up more capital that could be returned to shareholders.In November, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) announced it would pay its first full dividend since 2015 and said that it would buy back at least $25 billion. In October, BP (BP) said it would buy back shares for the first time in three years. Look to Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to see what they will do on dividends and buybacks.Collectively, oil companies aren't expected to dump cash into oil fields even if prices rebound. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said investment in exploration will fall 7% this year to $37 billion vs. 2016 and will be down 60% from a peak in 2014. Spending by oil majors is expected to fall 4% but drilling is expected to rise slightly.Shale producers could make or break oil's rally after their emergence as market disrupters prompted OPEC in 2014 to step back from its swing producer role by allowing prices to sink.This past fall, U.S. exploration and production companies signaled that they are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline rather than increasing spending to chase rising oil prices.""Investment community wants to start seeing a bit more upside. They are interested in profits rather than production. I would expect that to continue,"" said Jim Krane, an energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.But Tom O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat, doesn't think shale will remain disciplined for long, despite assurances from Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm.""When it looks like OPEC is getting control of the market that's when the other guys come back and the spotlight will be on them,"" O'Donnell said.Either way, output will keep rising, testing OPEC's plans to curb its own production to prop up crude. The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. production to hit 10 million barrels per day by the second-half of the year as companies like EOG Resources (EOG), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Apache (APA) cut costs and improve well output.The world's top oil exporter is preparing for an IPO of its state-run oil giant and changed Saudi Aramco's status to a joint stock company at the start of the year to get it ready for a listing.The company's $2 trillion valuation would make it the world's largest publicly traded company and a 5% offering would make the IPO the biggest ever in proceeds generated. While exchanges in London and New York are jockeying to get a piece of the action, watch for a private placement of Aramco shares with China playing a major role.A private placement is easier than jumping through all the hoops the SEC would demand from a U.S. listing and it will also save the kingdom a lot of embarrassment if the company doesn't fetch it's lofty IPO price, said the Baker Institute's Krane.""It also links them up, creates a mutual dependence between Saudi Arabia and China, which is exactly what Aramco needs if it wants to stay in the game as oil demand starts to slip in the developed world,"" he added.Also be on the lookout for additional moves in U.S. shale. Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking at natural-gas assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale formations and is in talks with Tellurian (TELL), a U.S. liquefied natgas producer, as it looks to break into U.S. shale, according to the Wall Street Journal.Investing in shale would give Saudi Arabia access to the U.S. industry's ability to quickly start and stop production projects and use that knowledge back at home.""Saudi Arabia has a lot of shale, a lot of tight gas,"" Krane said. ""Aramco needs to get to the gas because Saudi Arabia is very short on natural gas. The only way to get to it without imports is to tap into shale.""The oil group will have a tricky balancing act this year as it tries to keep U.S. shale at bay, its own members in line and oil prices in a sweet spot.At OPEC's November meeting, Saudi Energy Minster Khalid Al-Falih said that ""the contribution of shale is going to be very much manageable"" next year.But the International Energy Agency has said 2018 ""might not be quite so happy for OPEC producers"" as U.S. output increases.Still, OPEC sees markets rebalancing late this year after agreeing in November to extend its production-cut deal to the end of 2018.OPEC's resolve will be tested if crude prices rise enough to trigger more shale growth and increasing calls from its own members to lift production cuts. In December, Kuwait's oil minister suggested that members will discuss an exit strategy at the biannual meeting in June.The Trump administration is making moves to roll back energy regulations. The Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement wants to remove regulations that were enacted after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill that killed 11 people and released 4.9 million barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico.And on Thursday, the Interior Department issued a draft proposal to open about 90% of the U.S. outer continental shelf to offshore drilling leases between 2019 and 2024, in what would be the largest lease sale ever.Whether companies would actually boost offshore drilling is another story, as such ventures are typically costlier and require higher crude prices to be attractive.Despite the Trump administration's moves, the ending of the U.S. oil-export ban while Barack Obama was president will likely remain a bigger factor for U.S. energy producers.""The biggest energy steps were taken by Obama, the natural gas and oil exports, those were the big steps and now the opening of drilling and cutting some regulations on emissions is probably going to be small potatoes to legalizing exports,"" Krane said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

147,UPS,"Health Reform: The number of uninsured shot up by 3.2 million last year. Naturally, Republicans are getting blamed, even though the causes were in place well before President Trump won the election.X According to the quarterly Gallup survey, 12.2% of adult Americans were uninsured in Q4 2017. That's up significantly from the year before, when the uninsured rate was 10.9% — the biggest jump since Gallup started tracking this in 2008. This comes despite a steady decline in unemployment and predictions from the Congressional Budget Office that the number of uninsured would drop by 1 million in 2017.Gallup isn't the only survey to find the uninsured rate climbing. The Centers for Disease Control found that it was higher in the first half of 2017 than in the first six months of 2016. Both Gallup and the CDC also show a big jump in the ranks of uninsured among young workers in 2017.So clearly, Trump and the Republicans are at fault, right?That's what Gallup and others want you to believe. Efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare ""may have caused some consumers to question whether the government would enforce the penalty for not having insurance,"" Gallup says, adding that ""during 2017, the Trump administration reduced the advertising budget that promoted sign-ups on the ACA exchanges by 90% and also cut the sign-up period for the health care exchanges in half.""Only one problem: The ranks of the uninsured started to grow in 2016, well before the November election even took place.The CDC reported that as of March 2016 the uninsured rate in March was 10.2%. By September, that number had climbed to 10.4%, with the uninsured rate climbing in almost every age group.The continuation of this trend in 2017 had nothing to do with what was happening in Washington. But it had plenty to do with the massive increase in premiums and the defection of multiple insurers from the ObamaCare markets — all of which took place before Trump was elected.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveDouble-digit premium hikes — which have been the norm since ObamaCare went into effect — have made insurance increasingly unaffordable for millions of middle class families who need to buy coverage on their own, but aren't eligible for ObamaCare subsidies. And consumers had fewer and fewer choices as insurance companies started ditching ObamaCare in 2015.That's why there's been an explosion in things like skimpy ""short-term"" insurance plans or religious-based ""cost sharing ministries"" — as many of these families scramble for whatever coverage that they can afford.As we noted in this space earlier, even the ObamaCare-supporting Commonwealth Fund has found that the ranks of the uninsured jumped in 2017 among those ineligible for ObamaCare subsidies.Whatever benefits ObamaCare is providing to those who get its insurance subsidies or those newly eligible for Medicaid, it has been a massive failure for middle-class families who were repeatedly promised by Democrats that ObamaCare would lower their insurance premiums, too.Trump is trying to make more affordable options available by relaxing the rules on short-term plans and allowing small businesses to join multistate association health plans.But the only solution that will work for the beleaguered middle class is for the GOP to do what it promised voters it would do and repeal ObamaCare.RELATED:Trump Pushes For More Affordable Health Insurance Choices, And Dems Freak?Did ObamaCare Contribute To The Shocking Drop In Life Expectancy?ObamaCare's Individual Mandate Is Unfair And Doesn't WorkClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

148,UPS,"The great yield curve steepening of 2018 barely lasted a day.After the spread between two- and 10-year Treasury yields suffered its biggest daily widening since 2016 on Jan. 9, it's gone on a flattening binge. Meanwhile, the curve from five to 30 years touched a 10-year low of 47.2 basis points Tuesday, breaking the mark of 50 basis points that BMO Capital Markets strategists see as a ""battleground"" on the way to their call for an inverted curve in 2018.The notion of a bond bear market faded last week almost as quickly as it started, as the benchmark 10-year yield failed to reach its peak since the start of 2017, 2.63%. Also last week, signs of inflation drove two-year yields above 2% for the first time since September 2008, as traders bet the Federal Reserve would have scope to raise rates at policymakers' projected pace.The two-year yield ""offers solace for our call that 2018 will be the year the curve flattens to inversion,"" BMO's Ian Lyngen and Aaron Kohli wrote in a report Tuesday. The Fed will continue ""with its tightening campaign as long as there isn't a material breakdown in the real data, regardless of whether or not we ever see the return of term premium.""The shape of the curve has implications beyond the fixed-income universe. Inversion has tended to be a reliable indicator of impending recessions over the past several decades. When the spread between short- and long-term debt shrinks, it tends to hurt bank earnings and the real economy.Last week's ups and downs back up the flattening call, BMO said. Signs of economic strength — including inflation, usually the bane of long-end investors — are now disproportionately negative for shorter-dated securities because they boost expectations for more Fed tightening. Indeed, the 10-year yield rose less than a basis point on Jan. 12, about half the increase on the two-year maturity, after consumer-price figures showed the underlying pace of inflation was accelerating.The eurodollars market, which is even more sensitive to Fed policy expectations, also shows how traders are concentrating on the front-end.Demand is climbing for put options on June 2018 eurodollar futures that stand to profit if the market bakes in two quarter-point hikes by midyear. As it stands, overnight index swaps are pricing in 85% odds of an increase in March, and about 1.5 moves through the Fed's June meeting.A net 11% of investors in a Bank of America (BAC) global fund manager survey expect the U.S. curve to flatten this year, the most since 2015, according to a report dated Tuesday. Traders and strategists cited that bias as a reason why yields surged last week. However, speculators reduced their positions across the curve in the week ended Jan. 9, suggesting a shakeout to a more balanced market.And on the idea of balance, core CPI rising about 0.3% month-over-month in December hits ""the sweet spot"" for continued curve flattening, Lyngen and Kohli wrote.It ""justifies continued Fed tightening but does little to convince investors that broader price pressures are truly materializing,"" they wrote. ""We'll keep our bias to a flattening and look to set longs at important technical levels.""

149,UPS,"Shipping company UPS (UPS) announced Tuesday that it placed a reservation order for 125 Tesla (TSLA) tractor-trailer trucks, the largest order received for the all-electric vehicle since it was introduced one month ago.X It follows soda giant PepsiCo (PEP), which placed reservation orders last week for the Tesla big-rig truck named Semi, though the planned vehicle won't start shipping until 2019. Sysco (SYY) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) also placed orders for the company's electric tractor-trailer trucks earlier this month, totaling 90.Food distribution company Sysco placed reservations for 50 of Tesla's new fully-electric trucks, while Anheuser-Busch placed orders for 40 Tesla trucks, ""to reduce the environmental impact and increase the efficiency of its operations.""UPS, which operates one of the largest commercial trucking fleets in the world, said the new Semi big-rig trucks will join its ""extensive alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle fleet.""""These groundbreaking electric tractors are poised to usher in a new era in improved safety, reduced environmental impact, and reduced cost of ownership."" said Juan Perez, UPS chief information and engineering officer, in prepared remarks.The trucks have an estimated range between 300 miles and 500 miles on a single charge, depending on the model.Tesla shares dropped 2.3% to close at 331.10 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla shares last week surged above its 50-day moving average, though a breakout from a 370.10 buy point failed. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 40 out of best-possible 99.Tesla introduced its futuristic big-rig truck and a sports car with a splashy debut last month, at a time when the company is burning cash and hasn't met delivery schedules for its new Model 3.Each reservation requires a $20,000 deposit. The truck has a price range starting at $150,000 for the low-end model and $180,000 for the high-end version.Tesla previously received orders for 15 trucks from Wal-Mart (WMT). Trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHY) has also placed reservations for ""multiple"" Tesla Semi trucks, though it has not said how many.The new Tesla vehicles come at a time when the company is struggling to get its new Model 3 out the door, during what Musk has called ""production hell."" Tesla twice delayed the launch of its semi-truck to give it more time to work through production bottlenecks on its Model 3 sedan, planned as a mass-market vehicle.UPS' preorder of Tesla vehicles complements and advances the company's overall commitment ""to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions from global ground operations 12% by 2025,"" it said.UPS pays a quarterly dividend of 83 cents a share. That works out to an annualized yield of 2.8%. Since 2000, the company has raised the dividend every year except in 2009, following the financial crisis.RELATED:Robotrucks Hit The Road In the Name Of Safety, Efficiency And ProfitThis Is Ford's Plan For The Market That's Driving EV, SUV Growth

150,UPS,"So far this year, cyclical industries such as oil suppliers, fertilizer, transport and steelmakers are leading IBD's 197 industry stock groups. That reflects confidence in the U.S. and global economy as well as benefits from the Trump tax cuts. The corporate tax cuts are likely to benefit energy and other old-economy sectors more than tech giants that can more easily avoid taxes.X While 2018 has barely gotten started, most of these groups have been top performers over the past several weeks. Investors need to be watching for sector rotations so they are always focusing on the leading groups and stocks.Many of the stocks in these groups are either extended from breakouts (FedEx (FDX), U.S. Steel (X)) or still recovering from long downtrends (Schlumberger (SLB)). But a few, including steelmaker Nucor (NUE) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM), are in or near buy range.S&P 500 futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.3%. Dow futures advanced 0.2%.The Chemicals-Agriculture group has soared 13% so far in 2018. This includes fertilizer makers such as CF Industries (CF).But Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, which makes specialty fertilizers, is also now seen as a lithium play. Sociedad Química y Minera has a 63.90 buy point, closing Wednesday at 61.81. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is lagging somewhat after a strong three-month uptrend to late September.Mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) reportedly has dropped out of the bidding for a 32% SQM stake owned by Nutrien (NTR), Bloomberg reported late Wednesday, citing sources. Fertilizer giant Nutrien, formed from the merger of Potash Corp. and Agrium, agreed to sell the SQM holdings to win regulatory approval.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) is now viewed as an indirect legal marijuana play.This group is up 8.7% this year. Group giants include Schlumberger and Halliburton (HAL). Crude oil prices have risen to three-year highs above $63 a barrel in the U.S. But oil services stocks were slower to rebound than many shale producers as customers remained reluctant to step up spending. Both Schlumberger  and Halliburton on working on the right side of long, deep consolidations.This related energy group has climbed 8% in 2018. Notable members include Baker Hughes, a General Electric Co. (BHGE).This small group, dominated by FedEx and UPS (UPS), has rallied 8% as well. FedEx and UPS stocks are extended.Steelmakers have climbed 7.9% this year. Steel stocks were among the big immediate winners after President Trump's election, but then made little headway for most of 2017 before moving higher in Q4. U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are extended, but Nucor is just in range from a 66.10 entry in a consolidation going back nearly 10 months. Nucor's relative strength line, though improving, is still well off its December 2016 peak.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Shrug Off Bearish HeadlinesRobot Surgeon Breaks Out; Two Top Financials Hit New HighsThese Five Top Stocks Hit Buys; Why This One Stands OutThe Most Powerful Rocket Since Apollo Program Is About To Be TestedThis Amazon Partner And Cisco Rival May Ring In New Breakout

151,UPS,"The proliferation of semiconductors in electric vehicles is creating a big market opportunity for numerous suppliers, a Wall Street analyst said Thursday.X The report by Nomura analyst Romit Shah says the average semiconductor content per electric vehicle is about $924, more than triple what is in standard internal combustion gas-powered automobiles, based on data from STMicroelectronics (STM).Shah projects the category of alternative electric vehicles will grow to 53 million units by 2030, up from 3.4 million units in 2017, implying a compound annual growth rate of 23%.""This is significantly higher than the overall automotive compound annual growth rate, which our Nomura colleagues estimate to be 2.2% over the same time frame,"" Shah wrote. ""We believe that there are a number of major shifts in transportation technology that will expand the demand for automotive semiconductors by orders of magnitude.""Some of the companies set to benefit from the growth in auto electronics include NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as STMicroelectronics and Analog Devices (ADI).Among recent events about these companies, NXP on Friday announced new chip products for radar applications in automated driving. Analog Devices received at least six price-target increases to its stock after delivering a beat-and-raise quarterly report on Nov. 22.In addition, Texas Instruments is currently trading near a record high, while STMicroelectronics is forming a base with a 24.90 buy point as it gets set to report quarterly earnings on Jan. 24.Shah said he spent his summer at electric-car company Tesla (TSLA), where he also spent significant time analyzing the supply chain for alternative energy vehicles. The category includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, such as Tesla, which is in the process of rolling out its mass-market Model 3.He expects advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous driving, and powertrain electrification to be the biggest drivers of chip content. His report focused on the electrification of the powertrain, which is the primary piece of an electric vehicle, housing the batteries and other technologies that provide the power for vehicle performance.IBD'S TAKE: Never has the chip sector been more competitive, with more than 750 companies vying globally to build the insides of the next hot device or power future megacomputers.

That's expected to fall to about 58% of the overall automotive market by 2030, as alternative electric vehicles drive ahead, Shaw wrote.Shares of Tesla added 0.9% to close at 337.95 on the stock market today. Texas Instruments added 0.9% to 110.67, just below the record high of 110.98 it reached on Tuesday.

Hollywood isn't doing anything to materially change its culture; it's simply operating out of fear of public scrutiny.When the spotlight moves on, people in Hollywood will go right back to doing what they've been doing for years: exploiting people less powerful than them.Winfrey had nothing to say about sexual misconduct in Hollywood for 30 years, even though she was the Queen of All Media; treating her as some sort of beacon of light now is simply ridiculous.America knows posturing when it sees it.

Still, fund managers certainly have not abandoned U.S. equities totally, having 2018 bets on stocks like First Solar (FSLR), part of the S&P 500; Amazon (AMZN), a key piece of the Nasdaq Composite; and Boeing (BA), the best performing Dow Jones industrial average stock in 2017.One reason fund managers and strategists expect to search further afield overall for big returns in 2018: history. Since 1963, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 15% annually in 19 years. And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

154,UPS,"X Apple's (AAPL) price target was raised Monday while chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), athletic gear retailer Finish Line (FINL) and networking equipment maker Ciena (CIEN) were upgraded.RBC Capital raised the Dow Jones industrial average component's price target to 168 from 157 and kept an outperform rating on the stock. The analysts expect Apple's market cap to hit or exceed a $1 trillion in the next 12-18 months.""Longer-term, we think there is potential for Apple to continue growing Services revenue by double digits year-over-year given the company's expanding installed base [of devices], increasing App Store sales within the current installed base, demand for cloud storage/compute services, and further adoption of Apple Pay,"" analyst Amit Daryanani wrote.Apple shares edged up 0.6% to 153.99 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Qualcomm was upgraded to overweight from neutral at JPMorgan on its deal to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). The deal is expected to close soon. Analyst Rod Hall has a 68 price target on the stock.Hall still expects some bad news about Qualcomm's contract dispute with Apple. Last week, the company announced lawsuits against four manufacturers of Apple iPhones and iPads over breach of contract.But overall he's bullish on the stock.""Though volatility in the shares could remain high through the summer we see the valuation gap as too large to continue to ignore with the [NXP Semiconductors] closure approaching,"" Hall wrote in a note. ""We advise investors to add to positions at current levels.""Qualcomm shares climbed 2.8% to 59.28.Ciena was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel Nicolaus on improving market trends and recent contract awards. The company will announce second-quarter results on June 1.Ciena shares jumped 6.4% to 24.41.Finish line was upgraded to buy from neural at Monness Crespi & Hardt with a 17 price target.Last week, Foot Locker (FL) shares plunged after missing Q1 earnings and sales forecasts. On Thursday, Hibbett Sports (HIBB) topped earnings forecasts though same-store sales sank 4.9%.

155,UPS,"X Incyte (INCY) stock popped to a month-high Thursday after its immuno-oncology drug proved effective in matchups with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo — removing ""a small overhang on Incyte stock.""Roche (RHHBY) and NewLink Genetics (NLNK) stocks, on the other hand, toppled after their combination proved less effective than Merck and Incyte's.At the close on the stock market today, Incyte stock ended trading up 6.9% to 128.80, after earlier rising as high as 131.75, nearing its 50-day moving average. Shares of Dow component Merck jumped 1.4% to 63.89. But Bristol stock sank 1.2% to 53.78.The team-ups feature Incyte's epacadostat, which is known as an IDO inhibitor. The drug works to block the interaction between the IDO enzyme and the immune system to help the immune system identify hiding cancer cells.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo are PD-1 inhibitors which work to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and a PD-L1 protein hiding a cancer cell. Doing so helps the immune system see the cancer cell for what it is and destroy it.Coupling immuno-oncology drugs with varying targets is thought to be especially potent. But these are among the first trials to prove the concept using an IDO inhibitor. Bristol's Yervoy is a CTLA-4 inhibitor and has been paired effectively with Opdivo in melanoma patients.In trials, Merck's Keytruda and Incyte's epacadostat achieved an overall response rate of 35% in all patients regardless their specific biomarkers. In patients who carry a lot of the PD-L1 protein, the combination saw an overall response rate of 43%.For Bristol-Myers, the data released before the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June was a ""nonevent"" as the most interesting efficacy data will be released during the actual conference, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.IBD'S TAKE: The immuno-oncology market could be worth $25 billion by 2025 just looking at known inhibitors. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of the emerging sector.Preliminarily, Bristol's Opdivo and Incyte's epacadostat achieved a 75% overall response rate in its 100-milligram dose. That's consistent with early data from Merck and Incyte's combo ""suggesting that both PD-1s perform similarly in combination with epacadostat,"" he said.During the conference, Bristol also plans to unveil further data from its combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in advanced lung cancer. It's further planning to release initial data on an array of inhibitors still in development.Shares of Roche fell 0.7% to 33.80. NewLink stock plunged 9.1% to 14.64. Roche licensed NewLink's IDO inhibitor for a combination with its drug Tecentriq, a PD-L1 inhibitor.The data is very immature, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note to clients. Initially, it appears NewLink's IDO inhibitor, known as GDC-919, is less potent than epacadostat across six tumor types. The combo achieved a partial response in 9% of patients.RELATED:Will Incyte Shine Under Oncology Spotlight With Dow's Merck, Bristol?AstraZeneca Has Opportunity In Lung Cancer Treatment Vs.

156,UPS,"In a monologue considered witty by teenagers, teenagers in adult bodies and those who hate President Trump, CBS ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert said about President Trump, ""The only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's c--- holster.""Witty?Not to many of us.And not just not witty but obscene, which is particularly disturbing because it was broadcast on network television, not cable television.But more than anything, it exemplified a trend in American life that one could identify without any exaggeration as the unraveling of civil society. To anyone — liberal or conservative — who grew up watching Johnny Carson on late-night TV, the descent from Carson to Colbert is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking.Along with virtually every other American, I never knew Johnny Carson's politics. I would not have been surprised if he was a liberal or a conservative, a Democrat or a Republican. In his 30 years as host of ""The Tonight Show"" on NBC, he never so much as hinted as to how he identified politically. He poked fun at whoever was in power.The reason he didn't let on where he stood politically is he believed that he had a much greater responsibility: to offer Americans of all political persuasions an island of good-natured fun, a place where all Americans could laugh together every night.And, of course, it is inconceivable that he would have used the language Colbert used. Kids could watch ""The Tonight Show"" because he — and we — lived in a pre-left age, when grown-ups thought they had a responsibility to be good models to young people — in other words, a responsibility to be adults. But the left has never been comfortable with growing up.Those who mock the Trump motto, ""Make America Great Again,"" who claim they don't understand how anyone could think America was ever great, might begin to understand what many of us mean, in at least this one way: Prior to the Age of the Left, during which we have lived since the mid-1960s, there were places in America where Americans could enjoy life and one another without politics intruding, not to mention hate-filled politics like Colbert's.Americans could watch sports events without athletes showing contempt for the American flag and the national anthem; without sportscasters and sports writers labeling as racist anyone who used the team name ""Redskins""; without sports shows injecting politics into their programing, as ESPN does now so often that many sports fans no longer watch it.It was an America where elementary teachers referred to their students as ""boys and girls."" Today, teachers in more and more states are directed not to use those terms, as some 6-year-old may not identify as a boy or a girl.It was an America where kids were proud of the American flag. Today, in the Age of the Left, students on a growing number of American campuses vote to have the flag removed from their campus because in their view, it symbolizes not freedom and sacrifice but slavery, oppression and imperialism — ideas put into their heads by leftist high school teachers and college professors.And it was an America in which Superman's self-proclaimed mission was ""truth, justice and the American way."" A few years ago, however, Superman announced that he was renouncing his American citizenship to become a ""world citizen.""One could list a hundred ways America was indeed great (without ever ignoring serious moral flaws). Now, one can list a hundred ways in which America has lost that greatness. The descent from Johnny Carson to Stephen Colbert is just one example.But it is a powerful one.And it is but one more result of perhaps the most important rule of life of the past 100 years in America and around the world: Whatever the left touches, it ruins.The universities, the news media, the entertainment media, the fine arts, the courts, the high schools and the elementary schools (and soon, the preschools — once they're government-funded and universal) — all ruined wherever leftism has achieved dominance.Now it is the turn of late-night TV as embodied by Stephen Colbert. Or, as he himself put it on election night on Showtime, ""I'm your host, Stephen f------ Colbert.""

157,UPS,"Dow Jones industrial average component Wal-Mart (WMT) has begun offering discounts to online shoppers who pick up their orders, leveraging the discount giant's thousands of physical stores, something Amazon (AMZN) lacks. But the price cuts are light, unless the items are heavy.Wal-Mart aims to reduce shipping costs and pass those savings onto customers. The ""last mile"" of shipping goods to customers is very expensive for traditional retailers, while Amazon gets bigger discounts from UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) due to its massive shipping volumes.Wal-Mart is offering varying discounts on some 10,000 items to start, with plans to expand that to 1 million. (The discounts are not available in Alaska and Hawaii.)It's using technology developed by Jet.com, sold to Wal-Mart last year for $3.3 billion. Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts.And that's what's clear from walmart.com.Discounts are slim for electronics.But if you're willing to load up heavy or bulky goods in and out of your car, there are bigger incentives.Wal-Mart shares rose 0.2% to 74.07 in the stock market today, hitting an eight-month high intraday. The stock is in range from a 72.90 buy point. Amazon edged down 0.5% to 899.20, just in range from an 860.96 follow-on entry.UPS rose 0.35% intraday while FedEx dipped 3 cents. Both stocks tumbled last week on news of Wal-Mart's in-store discount plans on concerns that will reduce shipping volumes just as they invest heavily for increased e-commerce activity.RELATED:Wal-Mart Will Pay You To Pick Up Your Online Orders; Your Move, AmazonRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchWal-Mart's 4th E-Commerce Deal In 4 Months May Cost $300 Million

158,UPS,"Shares of Match Group (MTCH) fell after hours Tuesday as the company reported first-quarter earnings that were in line with analyst projections, but said enrollment in a critical mobile dating app is slowing.Match, a spinoff of IAC/InterActive (IAC), said late Tuesday that adjusted earnings were 12 cents a share, on revenue of $299 million, up 15% from the year-earlier period, for the quarter ended March 31. A year earlier, the company's earnings were 11 cents a share on sales of $285 million.Analysts expected the company to report earnings of 12 cents on revenue of $294 million.Match Group's biggest growth engine has been mobile dating app Tinder, but numbers show that sign-ups there have been slowing there of late. Tinder added 227,000 paid users in the March quarter, which includes Valentine's Day, vs. 245,000 in the December quarter and 265,000 in the September quarter.Shares in the online dating service provider were unchanged at 19.13 on the stock market today.

159,UPS,"A federal judge late Wednesday ordered pilots for cargo carrier ABX Air, which has Amazon.com (AMZN) and DHL as major customers, to go back to work, easing fears of shipping delays for a deluge of holiday packages.Judge Timothy Black upheld a temporary restraining order requested by ABX,  a unit of Air Transport Services Group. The pilots, part of the Teamsters union, walked off the job on Tuesday morning. DHL had said that the stoppage would delay some deliveries through Thanksgiving.Amazon said it was not yet affected by the ABX pilots action. Amazon also ships via United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). This is the first holiday season that it has used ABX and Atlas Air to handle some of its cargo, reducing its dependence on UPS and FedEx.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for Black Friday investing deals? Here's why you should pay attention to Amazon, Apple, e.l.f. Beauty and UPS shares right now.ABX expected flights to resume immediately. The pilots said they will comply with the order, which lasts for five days, and consider their next move.Amazon shares dipped 0.7% on the stock market today to 780.12. That followed six straight gains, nearing the 50-day moving average.UPS rose 0.9% to 115.68 still in range from a 111.93 buy point cleared two weeks ago. FedEx climbed 1.1% to 190.12, further extended from a 177.46 entry point.

160,UPS,"Each month, the IBD/TIPP poll, a collaboration between Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, produces an exclusive Presidential Leadership Index. This index combines results from several questions in the monthly IBD/TIPP poll to gauge how well the president is viewed when it comes to leading the country, both domestically and internationally.The index includes questions on presidential approval, favorability measures on the president's handling of domestic and foreign policy issues, as well as whether the president is providing strong or weak leadership.In addition, IBD/TIPP each month asks questions focused on the public's outlook overall. These questions include satisfaction with the direction of the country, a forecast about people's quality of life, and an index of the U.S. standing in the world.IBD/TIPP also produces the Economic Optimism Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.The IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index dates back to January 2001, when it stood at 64.6 for the newly inaugurated President Bush. After 9/11, Bush's Leadership Index skyrocketed to 83.3. By the end of his first term, it was down to 53.3, and was 33.5 in his last month in office.The Leadership Index jumped to 71 in President Obama's first full month in office, but was never anywhere near that level for the rest of his two terms. In his last year in office, it averaged 51.This is a more common measure used by several polls. As with the leadership index, this index has seen its ups and downs over the past 16 years. The highest it ever got since January 2001 was 88.7 under President Bush. The lowest was 27.8, also for President Bush. For most of Obama's presidency, his approval rating was below 50. But it climbed in his last year in office, driving in large part by increased support among Democrats.The long term trend for this question has been downward. In January 2001, this index hit 60.9, meaning more than half were satisfied with the direction of the country. It remained above 50 for most of Bush's first term. Since then, it has never once been above 50. The average for Obama's presidency is a dismal 36.9. This index edged up in December, despite a sharp decline among dispirited Democrats.Unlike other measures, this has been relatively steady for the past 16 years. It peaked at 63.1 in January 2004. It's lowest level was 43.5 in June 2008. The overall average for the past 16 years has been 55.7. This measure dropped slightly in December to 55.9.Another measure included in the monthly IBD/TIPP poll tracks the public's view of the U.S. standing in the world. This measure peaked in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, reaching 74.9. It jumped again after President Obama won the election in November 2008, hitting 65.3 that month. It reached its nadir in Nov. 2013, in the wake of the debt ceiling crisis and the two-week government shutdown in October. The index slipped after the November election, as Democrats worried about the impact of Trump's victory.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollMedia ContactTerry Jones

169,UPS,"To identify a good stock, look for superior fundamentals. To identify its buy point, look at its chart. Actually, it helps to look at not simply one chart, but three — daily, weekly and monthly. Each has a different purpose.Daily and weekly charts are generally best in helping to identify buy points and sell signals.For big winners, the monthly chart can help you put a stock's run into perspective and maximize gains.The daily chart zeros in on the stock's immediate movement. It's a good place to observe price and volume action as a stock passes its buy point. If volume on the day of a stock's breakout is less than 40% above normal, it may not be a good time to buy. Best to wait to see if volume picks up in subsequent days.But paying too much attention to a stock's daily ups and downs could prompt you to sell a healthy stock too soon. So it's a good idea to consult the weekly chart, which helps to put the stock's action in a broader perspective.Weekly charts are usually best at showing the development of a stock's base and in helping to identify a potential buy point. They're also perhaps best at showing whether a new base is in the late stages of a stock's run-up.Paying attention to a stock's weekly price and volume trends is also key to understanding its health, because they indicate whether institutional investors are buying or selling in force.Finally, monthly charts are used mainly to track the long-term uptrend of a market leader that has kept chugging along through several corrections. In some cases, it's easy to count bases and spot a clear change in trend. But it can be hard to spot new highs in low volume, bearish reversals and volume trends that show up more readily on a daily or weekly chart.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) formed a double-bottom base starting in June 2010 (1). It reached its first bottom in early July, recovered some ground, then hit its second bottom on Aug. 31 (2). Both the daily and weekly charts show it clearly.The retailer of workout clothing had a buy point of 43.47 using the middle peak of the pattern. But the daily chart shows that breakout came in volume that was slightly below the 40% increase you prefer to see.So, prudent investors might have chosen to pass on buying the stock. Soon, though, the stock was shaping a five-day handle with a new buy point of 44.97 (3). Volume was much more convincing, more than double its norm.The daily chart shows the stock cleared the buy point following an upside reversal in heavy volume. It also ended the day near the top of its intraday trading range. These are bullish signs not evident on the weekly chart. The daily chart also shows a healthy shakeout in the handle.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Jan. 9, 2013, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Why Learning How To Use Stock Charts Is A Must For Successful InvestorsThe I In CAN SLIM: Make Sure Fund Managers Are Big Buyers In Your Stock

170,UPS,"Oil futures rose Monday after Iran, Iraq and Russia indicated they were backing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' output deal and Goldman Sachs (GS) raised its short term oil price outlook.Iraq and Iran have been major stumbling blocks in prior output deals, with Iraq saying it shouldn't have to cut production as it needs money to fight the Islamic State and Iran doesn't want to curb output until it reaches presanction levels. But now the two rivals are now more willing to entertain output cuts.Iraq's oil minister Jabbar al-Luaibi told the Wall Street Journal late Sunday that he would bring three new proposals to OPEC's official meeting on Nov. 30 in Vienna.""Our alternatives are based on other variables and will make it easier for OPEC members to make a decision,"" he said. ""All of the options will be logical and in line with OPEC policy.""Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said ""it is highly probable that OPEC members will reach a consensus in the November meeting"" after meeting OPEC's secretary-general, Mohammed Barkindo on Saturday, according to the oil ministry's Shana news service.Russia is also bullish on the meeting.Speaking after an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima, Peru, Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said freezing its crude production ""is not an issue for us,"" and that he sees a ""high probability"" that OPEC can agree to its production cut at the meeting later this month, according to Reuters.In September, OPEC agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels a day in October, to help rebalance oil markets. OPEC will hold its official meeting Nov. 30, when quotas for individual members are supposed to be determined.IBD'S TAKE: Algeria's energy minister told Bloomberg last week that the proposed output deal would last six months or maybe up to a year. Analysts believe that even a short six-month cut is better for markets than no reduction at all.U.S. crude surged 3.9% to settle at $47.49 a barrel. Brent jumped 4.4% to $48.90 per barrel.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 1.4% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 0.9%. BP (BP) climbed 2.3%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) was up 2.7%.Among U.S. shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) shot up 5.1% while EOG Resources (EOG) advanced 2.7%.Goldman raised it short term price forecast for oil to average $55 a barrel in first half 2017, up from up from previous estimates of $45 and $50 for the first and second quarters.Earlier, the bank warned that oil could hit the low $40s per barrel if the cartel didn't reach an agreement.RELATED: Oil Rigs See Biggest Jump Since July 2015 On Permian Activity

172,UPS,"More than 1 million people selected insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act in the first two weeks of sign-ups, outpacing last year, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a report Wednesday.From Nov. 1, when the sign-up markets opened, to Nov. 12, about 246,433 new consumers chose an ObamaCare plan for next year, and 761,785 renewed their existing coverage. That amounts to about 53,000 more plans than were selected during the first 12 days of open enrollment last year, the government said.This year's sign-up process opened in the waning days of the U.S. presidential race and the surprise election of Donald Trump, who has promised to repeal and replace or amend the law.""The American people are demonstrating how much they continue to want and need the coverage the marketplace offers,"" Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a prepared statement. Enrollment figures will be released every two weeks up until Dec. 15, the deadline to sign up for coverage that starts on Jan. 1, the U.S. said.The sign-up figures are only for the 39 states where the federal government runs enrollment, and doesn't include states that have opted to build their own enrollment systems. Enrollment can vary week to week, and in past years there has typically been a surge of sign-ups near the deadline.

174,UPS,"Crude futures nearly gave up this week's gains, as hopes withered that top oil producers will reach an agreement next week to trim production and prop up prices.U.S. crude dropped 4% to settle at $46.06 a barrel, more than double the loss earlier Friday but still 0.8% higher than a week ago. Brent fell 3.6% to $47.24.Top OPEC oil producer Saudi Arabia is pushing for total cartel production of 32.5 million barrels, at the deep end of an earlier proposal, which would help take 2% of the world's oil supply off the market, Wall Street Journal sources said Thursday. In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels a day in October, to help rebalance oil markets.But Saudi Arabia won't be attending an informal meeting Monday in Vienna between the cartel and non-OPEC producers, according to Reuters sources Friday, and a Reuters reporter later tweeted that the Monday meeting will only include OPEC members. Non-members Russia, Azerbaijan and Mexico had planned to attend. Azerbaijan's oil minister said Thursday that OPEC was pushing oil producers outside the cartel to also make cuts.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed up 0.2% on the stock market today. BP (BP) fell 0.4%. Chevron (CVX) ended flat and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) lost 0.2%.Meanwhile, Russia only plans to freeze production, not trim it. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Thursday that a freeze would be ""quite a difficult and harsh situation for us as our plans envisioned an output growth next year,"" according to Bloomberg.Speaking after an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima, Peru, earlier this month Russian President Vladimir Putin said freezing its crude production ""is not an issue for us,"" and that he sees a ""high probability"" that OPEC can agree to its production cut at the meeting later this month, according to Reuters.But Russia is pumping out 11.2 million barrels of oil a day, a post-Soviet Union record, so even a cap would do little to help the oil glut on markets.Even if OPEC and non-OPEC nations agreed on significant cuts next week, that's no guarantee that they will actually stick to their individual quotas. And any increase in oil prices that result from an agreement would encourage U.S. shale companies pump more oil and add to global supplies.IBD'S TAKE: Algeria's energy minister told Bloomberg earlier that the proposed output deal would last six months or maybe up to a year. Analysts believe that even a short six-month cut is better for markets than no reduction at all.On Wednesday, Baker Hughes (BHI) said U.S. oil rig counts rose by 3 to 474 with rigs in Colorado's DJ Niobrara up 2 to 20. But rig counts were flat at 32 in the Eagle Ford and fell by one to 228 in the Permian basin after rising 11 in the week ended Nov. 18.The total U.S. rig count for oil and natural gas climbed up five to 593.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) shares tumbled 2.9% to 51.83, falling away from its 54.97 buy point. EOG Resources (EOG) fell 1% to 95.98, consolidating in a flat base, but falling further from its 98.42 buy point.

177,UPS,"Oil futures reversed Tuesday after OPEC officials deferred a decision to exempt Iran and Iraq from the output cut, according to a Bloomberg report, citing two delegates.After surging Monday and gaining ground last week, crude futures reversed sharply lower later but then pared losses on reports that an OPEC panel concluded an initial round of talks ""successfully"" with a consensus on output. U.S. oil settled down 0.4% at $48.03 a barrel. Brent crude finished up up 0.45% at $49.12. Futures changed little after reports said the American Petroleum Institute tallied a drop of 1.3 million barrels in U.S. crude inventories vs. expectations for an increase of less than 1 million.Earlier, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' panel known as the High-Level Committee recommended Nigeria and Libya be exempt from output cuts. But Iraq argued it was a special case because it is fighting the Islamic State.""We think we should increase output. Iraq is in a special situation ... we are at war,"" Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari said, according to Reuters. ""It would not be fair for us to cut oil output.""Iran and Iraq have been stumbling blocks to prior deals as Iran argued it needs to boost production to pre-sanction levels following the nuclear agreement between Tehran and the West.The committee members recommended a 4% to 4.5% cut per country, including Iran and Iraq, according to a Reuters report, as the cartel tries to work out output cut details ahead of its official meeting next week.Exxon Mobil (XOM) closed up 0.2% at 86.68 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) and BP (BP) added 0.4%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 0.5%. Continental Resources (CLR), a major U.S. shale producer, dipped 0.3%.The reports came after the second day of talks by the High-Level Committee, formed by OPEC governors and other representatives. The committee will give its recommendations for cuts at the official OPEC meeting on Nov. 30.IBD'S TAKE: The OPEC output cut would last for at least six months but possibly up to a year according to reports. Even a deal as short as that would have some benefits for oil markets, according to analysts. In September, OPEC agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels a day in October, to help rebalance oil markets.RELATED: Iran, Iraq, Russia Buoy OPEC Cut Hopes; Goldman Ups Oil Price OutlookOil Rigs See Biggest Jump Since July 2015 On Permian Activity

178,UPS,"A little more than 10 years ago, Amazon.com (AMZN) unveiled a service that business customers embraced because it saved them money, letting them pay only for the computing power and storage capacity they actually used, hosted on computers they didn't own but accessed via the internet.This early experiment in cloud computing is now called Amazon Web Services. With more than 1 million users per month, AWS is expected to surpass $13 billion in 2016 sales. That puts it in a similar league in size and growth to all of Amazon in its first 11 years.And its parent company? This year, revenue will likely come in near $145 billion, and Amazon is reaching into new businesses of all kinds to keep its sales and share price growing.In his letter to shareholders in April, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote that Amazon — which originally billed itself merely as ""the world's biggest bookstore"" — wants to be ""an invention machine."" And so it's full throttle in such fields as delivery services (including deliveries via drones), computerized warehouses, online video and music services, tablets, personal digital assistants, and no doubt more arenas besides e-commerce and cloud services. Even physical stores are now part of the plan.""Amazon is doing a marvelous job at becoming a bigger and bigger part of daily lives,"" Trip Miller, managing partner of hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, which holds a position in Amazon, told IBD. ""They want to be a one-stop shop for consumers. (They are) making it less likely customers will switch to another service.""Winning big new markets is by no means assured, and Amazon's spending on its far-flung initiatives is immense, which already has created earnings disappointments.  But Amazon's growth record so far speaks for itself. As Bezos put it, 20 years ago he was driving some boxes to the post office and thinking about forklifts. In a letter to shareholders a year later, Bezos wrote that online bookselling, and e-commerce in general, ""should prove to be a very large market."" It did.The No. 1 online seller posted revenue of $107 billion last year, 22 years after its founding, hitting the $100 billion mark quicker than any company. Its stock has surged roughly 330% over the past five years — and nearly 200% in the last 10 years vs. just over 60% for the S&P 500.IBD'S TAKE: With a big jump over the past two years, Amazon.com shares took up residence on IBD Leaderboard, an exclusive list of the very top stocks near or at buy points. But the stock Leaders can change fast. Amazon fell 16% from Oct. 6, its all-time high, though Nov. 14, and it's off the board, at least for now. Investors should keep daily track of Leaderboard.Bezos has said that both Amazon and AWS ""were planted as tiny seeds."" Not every seedling will grow into a redwood, but Bezos says the goal for each seedling is annual sales of at least $1 billion.AWS leads its field though it faces a horde of big-name rivals that quickly caught on to Amazon's move, led by Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM) and Alphabet (GOOGL). ""Amazon Web Services is a major reason to own the stock,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which holds a position in Amazon.While Amazon shows a willingness to boldly experiment, some efforts have flopped. The biggest flop might be the Amazon Fire smartphone, now off the market.Other efforts produced unexpected hits, like the Echo — an in-home, voice-activated digital butler that plays music, reads books and provides traffic and weather, among other things. Teamed with Alexa, its voice and brains, the Echo smart speaker has grabbed a post position in the race to give the world the best and smartest digital assistant, another battle that pits tech's giants.Amazon won't say, but analysts estimate it's already sold some 4 million Echo speakers, at prices ranging from about $100 to $200. It's a product that further cements a user's attachment to Amazon.""Amazon is not a simple company; there's a lot of moving parts,"" Synovus Trust's Morgan said. ""I still feel strong about what they are doing.""Those parts include retail. Amazon reportedly plans to open dozens of small retail storefronts in shopping malls over the next year to showcase its hardware such as the Kindle and Echo.The first Amazon physical bookstore opened last year in Seattle. Amazon has since opened bookstores in San Diego and Portland, Ore., with another one coming in Chicago. The bookstores also sell its hardware, reflecting Amazon's ongoing drive to reach consumers through a variety of channels.It's also pushing deeper into the grocery business, which it entered in 2007 with the launch of the grocery delivery service Amazon Fresh.""Groceries are a key part of our offerings to customers and we're playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs,"" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said during the company's Q3 earnings conference call.Amazon plans to develop convenience stores as well as curbside pickup locations, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Amazon apparently will let customers order groceries online and pick them up at a company facility, which could add billions in revenue, says Pacific Crest Securities, posing an increasing threat to No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart (WMT).Analysts also expect Amazon to become a force in the shipping business, competing with the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). The company has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between its fulfillment centers. And Amazon has an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) to expedite delivery of goods.""They're not afraid to invest and go outside the box,"" said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify Investments, which holds Amazon stock. ""And almost all of their initiatives have been very supportive of its core online retail focus.""Of its many ventures, Amazon Prime might be its biggest success. Launched in 2005, for $79 a year the loyalty program gave users free two-day shipping. The perks have steadily risen. The price, too, has risen, but just once, to $99 in 2014.Amazon Prime perks now include free access to Amazon streaming videos and commercial free music, free photo storage, free same-day shipping in 27 metro areas, exclusives on select offerings and more. Prime members spend on average about $2,500 a year on Amazon, vs. $550 for non-Prime members, according to Morgan Stanley data.Amazon won't say how many Prime members it has, but the figure is near 65 million members in the U.S., according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.""Amazon loves to connect with customers in as many ways as possible,"" said Amplify's Magoon, ""and in that process they are creating a protective moat.""These investments come with a cost. Amazon has been far from a profit-making machine. In 2014, in fact, it lost 52 cents a share despite revenue of nearly $89 billion.For the recent Q3, EPS tripled from the year-earlier quarter to 52 cents, but that missed Wall Street expectations by 26 cents. Amazon shares fell 5% the next day. Its EPS outlook for the current quarter also missed analyst expectations.In Q3 operating expenses jumped 28% to $32.14 billion, with fulfillment and shipping costs jumping 34% to $4.34 billion as the company focused on improving its shipping times.It opened 18 product fulfillment centers in the third quarter and will add a total of 26 fulfillment centers this year. The expansion is its biggest in four years, growing warehouse square footage by 30%, vs. a 20% increase in 2015.Moreover, Amazon says its investments in video content and related marketing expenses will nearly double in the second half of 2016 vs. the year-earlier period.""So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment,"" said Olsavsky in the conference call. He said Amazon is also adding a lot of resources to Echo, as well as to expansion in India and in AWS.The investments, says the company, will attract and retain more customers. Analysts at times grumble, but they generally agree.""Seeing the large opportunities ahead, Amazon has decided to enter another large investment cycle, and strong investment is expected to continue in Q4,"" wrote Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, in a research note. ""We believe that this will better enable the company to produce strong top-line growth.""Seyrafi rates Amazon stock outperform and has a price target of 875. Some analyst price targets go as high as 1000. Amazon stock rose 2.6% in the stock market today to 780.""We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience,"" Olsavsky said on the Oct. 27 earnings call. ""We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient (and) as profitable as possible, while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line.""RELATED:How Amazon, Microsoft, Google Crushed AT&T, Verizon In Cloud ServicesAmazon Seen Dominating As E-Com Rises WorldwideAmazon Hits Record High As Prime Continues To Add SubscribersAmazon Takes Its Netflix Rivalry Global With 'Grand Tour'

182,UPS,"The stock market loves to do the unexpected. Veterans on Wall Street call it a contrarian streak.Did you see the latest example of the market's psychological mischief? On the night of the Nov. 8 presidential election, fear consumed traders. At one point futures on the Dow Jones industrials index plunged 800 points. Yet by Friday, the index finished the week up 959 points, more than 5%.This past week, the popular blue-chip gauge refused to give back any of last week's rally. The Russell 2000, meanwhile, started the week with an upward surge of nearly 1.3%, after catapulting more than 10% higher last week. With less than an hour to go in Friday's trade, the popular small cap index was poised to gain another 2.4%.The S&P 500 closed down less than 1 point on Monday, but also looks to finish higher for the week. That's bullish action, considering that the large-cap benchmark climbed an astonishing 79 points, or 3.8%, last week.The NYSE composite also looks set to gain some additional ground for the week, following a 3.5% gain last week.Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) all struggled on Monday with losses of 2% to 3% each, yet the market cap-weighted Nasdaq composite finished down only 0.4% on Monday. Why? The Nasdaq is certainly dominated by large tech and consumer-oriented companies, but don't forget the thousands of other smaller firms in the fields of banking, retailing, manufacturing, biotechnology and commodities.Did you see solid gains in heavy volume by Airgain (AIRG) (now up 35% past 17.04 IPO base buy point), Cognex (CGNX) (extended 10% past a 53.55 flat base proper entry) and WingStop (WING) (building a new base since Aug. 15)? All of these Nasdaq-listed names rallied big for the week in rapid turnover.Such action is a hint that equity trading desks and large funds aren't finished buying yet, even after last week's big stock market bounce.Looking ahead, will the market do something even more unexpected?To be more specific, will four years of Donald Trump in the White House be just what the doctor ordered to keep the aging stock market rally going even with 7-1/2 years of gains already behind it? And could the rise in U.S. equities even accelerate?America and the world are still pondering the latest sea change in U.S. politics and governing. But the accompanying chart suggests that good times for long-suffering equity investors may be closer around the corner.Why? The market action since 2000 has been showing similar action to an earlier period: 1968 to 1987.For 14 long years from 1968 to 1982, the S&P 500 struggled to break free from a grinding trading range. Slow growth and high inflation kept it trapped in a series of bear markets, the worst of which cut the market in half in 1973-74.That all changed in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes and unleashed an 18-year super bull market.Jump to 2000. After extraordinary stock gains that ultimately ended in extreme excesses, it was time for another long period of consolidation. It took 13 years for the S&P 500 to completely break through to new high ground. But for the past two years, the stock market has been stuck in neutral.History doesn't precisely repeat itself, but as the late writer Mark Twain was once quoted as saying, it does rhyme. Today, if you overlay the current market with the earlier period on the chart, an interesting parallel emerges.

183,UPS,"Nissan (NSANY) Rogue. ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."" Given their monikers, the matchup almost seemed inevitable.At the Los Angeles Auto Show on Wednesday, the automaker announced a limited edition 2017 Nissan Rogue: Rogue One Star Wars model in conjunction with Lucasfilm's Dec. 16 release of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.""This is far from the first product integration for Walt Disney (DIS), which owns Lucasfilm. The media and entertainment giant has a slew of consumer product tie-ups with Hasbro (HAS) and other merchandise heavyweights.Nissan's U.S.-listed shares closed 1.2% higher at 18.77 on the stock market today. Disney rose 1.45% to 99.12, helped by an analyst upgrade on improving ESPN subscription prospects.IBD'S TAKE: As auto sales plateau in the U.S., automakers may be looking for other incentives to lure potential car buyers. The ""Star Wars""-related features available on the limited edition 2017 Nissan Rogue include a rear bumper protector with the ""Star Wars"" logo, Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire decals for the exterior, illuminated kickplates with the ""Star Wars"" logo, and Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire cupholder inserts.Also available with purchase is a Death Trooper replica helmet made by Gentle Giant, a 3D Systems (DDD) company.The Empire's Death Troopers are an elite unit of Stormtroopers who will make their first appearance in the upcoming ""Rogue One"" movie. RELATED:L.A.

184,UPS,"Higher-ups from Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Boeing (BA), Nike (NKE), Fitbit (FIT) and Gigamon (GIMO) were among those who made notable insider trades disclosed this week.Directors Timothy Haley and Richard Barton sold 23,728 shares and 2,800 shares, respectively, this week. Chief Financial Officer David Wells sold 500 shares.The Internet TV service last month reported third-quarter subscriber gains that far exceeded Street expectations, helped by such shows as ""Stranger Things."" The results revived its stock, for now, and eased investor concerns about the company's ability to attract new viewers. However, questions remained about its spending on new programming.Shares dropped 3.6% in the stock market this week.Director Kimbal Musk, Chief Executive Elon Musk's brother, has sold 2,779 shares of the electric auto maker.The company said this week that its intended acquisition of SolarCity (SCTY) will reap upward of $150 million in savings within the first full year after the deal's closing. Tesla has faced concerns that such a merger is essentially a bailout for the maker of solar-power systems.Shares lost 4.7% this week.CEO Mark Parker this week sold 150,000 shares of the athletic apparel maker for a value of $7.5 million.The company in September reported first-quarter results that beat expectations, despite softer-than-anticipated future  orders and the sense that the threat from rivals like Under Armour (UA) and Adidas is growing.Shares fell 4% this week.CEO Dennis Muilenburg sold 51,024 shares of the aerospace giant this week, while CFO Greg Smith sold 20,000 shares.Boeing last week said that it may debut a new midsize jet and a longer 737 Max in attempt to compete more aggressively with Airbus (EADSY).Boeing slipped 2.4% this week; Airbus gave back more than 4.7%.Director Jon Callaghan sold 15,000 shares this week.

185,UPS,"Cloud software maker HubSpot (HUBS) saw its shares approach a buy point, and an all-time high, before reversing, as analysts said its analyst day Wednesday was spot-on, giving the company good reviews.HubSpot stock rose as much as 2.2% in early trading in the stock market today, but shares then fell more than 1% before ending the day up 1.4%, at 57.55. The shares have a possible buy point of 60.07, and HubSpot stock peaked at 60.11 last December.""We continue to view HUBS as a core cloud holding, and believe its full suite approach will allow it to continue taking share in the competitively open SMB front-office software space,"" UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a research report, maintaining a buy rating and 65 price target on HubSpot stock.The Cambridge, Mass.-based company provides marketing software designed to help mostly small and midsize businesses (SMB) better use social media, blogs and search engines to attract and retain customers.IBD'S TAKE: HubSpot went public in October 2014, pricing shares at $25. It's proved to be a good IPO, but which have been the best? IBD's IPO Leaders gives investors the rundown on top IPOs, crucial because many of the biggest stocks run-ups come from companies that have gone public within the past three years.  HubSpot's main theme, said Thill, is that it's making ""its first real distribution push to sell its sales products in combination with core marketing, where it will allow both its inside sales forces and its agency partner channel to sell the full suit — we believe that this will be a tailwind to help sustain strong top-line growth rates for the foreseeable future.""A new partnership with Facebook (FB) includes integration with Facebook ads expected to roll out early next year is a big plus, Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin said in a research note late Wednesday. And he says the same about HubSpot's integration with LinkedIn (LNKD), which Microsoft (MSFT) is in the process of acquiring.""HubSpot is evolving into the modern front office for SMBs,"" wrote Bracelin, who has an overweight rating and 67 price target on HubSpot stock.HubSpot stock has more than doubled since early February, when the overall market hit an early-2016 downturn. One catalyst, though, is that HubSpot occasionally pops up in M&A speculation, with possible buyers mentioned including No. 1 cloud business software vendor Salesforce.com (CRM).In a recent report, Goldman Sachs analyst Jesse Hulsing said ""we expect M&A to remain a major factor in the sector,"" speaking of growing software companies.RELATED:Goldman Initiates On HubSpot With Buy RatingPacCrest Positive On SaaS Market, Hikes PT On HubSpot

186,UPS,"The anti-immigration stance of President-elect Donald Trump is potentially the most obvious issue for tech companies in dealing with the incoming administration, says Edison Investment Research analyst Dan Ridsdale.But while Trump has stated his opposition to the H-1B specialty-occupation non-immigrant visas — a key tool of U.S. tech companies looking outside the U.S. to fill key skilled tech jobs that they say are otherwise tough to fill — he also has stated support for immigration of highly skilled individuals.Shares of the largest tech companies were all over the board early Wednesday afternoon, some up and some down.""Trump has offered few detailed positions on technology policy, and there will inevitably be major differences between what Trump has said he will do and what he does do or what he can do,"" Ridsdale wrote in an emailed research note. ""Nevertheless, his electoral thrust has been on rejuvenating the traditional manufacturing sector ahead of supporting its thriving technology community.""IBD'S TAKE: The big techs have all had big stock run-ups at times, but which are doing the best right now? IBD Leaderboard is the first place to check. The few companies on the current top-performers list include Facebook and chipmaker Broadcom.Trade relations, especially with China, a major source of goods manufactured for U.S. tech companies, is another issue for tech companies and Trump""Trump's rhetoric on the trade relationship with China has been bombastic,"" Ridsdale wrote. ""Pledges to take action against currency manipulation, export subsidies and intellectual-property theft are aimed at supporting U.S. businesses, but companies such as Apple (AAPL), for whom China is an important export market, may well suffer from the backlash.""Apple was mentioned specifically by Trump during his campaign regarding the production of iPhones overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook campaigned for Hillary Clinton, who was supported by the great majority of top tech executives.Apple stock was down 0.2%, at 110.88, on the stock market today.But Ridsdale added that Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes, if implemented, could clearly lift earnings of companies across the board. And Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas.The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Shares of Cisco climbed 1.2% to 31.36 while Oracle added 1.1% to 39.55. Meanwhile, Microsoft stock slipped half a percent to 60.17 and Alphabet was down a fraction to 805.59.Amazon (AMZN) stock was down 2% to 771.88, but it reportedly faces a possible tax crackdown in Europe.

187,UPS,"PayPal (PYPL) expects to grow its consumer accounts by making its sign-up process easier and expanding its partnerships with technology companies such as Facebook (FB), says Nomura Securities.Nomura analyst Bill Carcache says PayPal is taking steps to clinch consumer sign-ups that have slipped away. Having announced a mobile payments deal with Facebook in October, PayPal is in talks with other tech companies, though Amazon.com (AMZN) is not a candidate for a partnership, says Carcache, who has a buy rating and price target of 54 on PayPal stock.""There's an increased willingness to consider partnering with PYPL because of its consumer choice stance,"" said the Nomura analyst in his research report Tuesday.Carcache says he recently met with PayPal management, including CFO John Rainey.IBD'S TAKE: Cardtronics, the world's biggest nonbank automated teller machine operator, MasterCard and PayPal are the top-rated stocks in IBD's Finance-Credit Card Payment processors group. Learn more about these and other companies at IBD Stock Checkup.PayPal has nearly 180 million active consumer accounts.""Roughly 1 million customers go to PayPal to sign up each month and enter their card information but never activate their accounts due to friction in the sign-up process (for example, requiring users to input bank account information when they prefer to use payment cards),"" Carcache said. ""By enabling customer choice and streamlining the sign-up process, (CFO Rainey) believes PayPal will be able to activate these customers.""By our math, adding 1 million active accounts per month (12 million annually) could translate into 8% to 10% EPS upside (although we note that incremental customer service and support costs could dampen the upside).""PayPal recently announced partnerships with credit card networks Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA).The payment processor in October posted Q3 earnings and revenue that edged Wall Street views and raised its revenue growth forecast for a three-year period to 16%-17% from its previous guidance of 15%.PayPal stock is up 15% in 2016 but has slipped from its all-time high of 44.52, touched on Oct. 24, and is near its 50-day moving average.

188,UPS,"Leading tech stocks tumbled last week as mutual funds sold shares in the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google. But the manager of $3 billion Franklin DynaTech Fund, an IBD Best Mutual Fund 2016 Award winner, isn't panicking.Judging by DynaTech's (FKDNX) lowly portfolio turnover rate of 31% and comments by lead manager Matthew Moberg on the power driving growth in several key holdings, the fund remains hitched in a big way to the market's leading stocks.DynaTech has an outsized bet on technology, with a 48% weighting as of June 30, according to Franklin Templeton.That sort of megabet on a single sector could make a fund volatile. But this fund's performance is consistent as well as strong. The fund was up 3.15% so far this year as of Oct. 31. The S&P 500 was up 5.87%. DynaTech's return topped 78% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 0.91% gain.The fund generated average annual returns of 8.42%, 13.2% and 9.26% the past three, five and 10 years.The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard. It was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all large caps and all growth funds.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersMoberg, 45 years old, has been shepherding DynaTech since 2004. He talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in San Mateo, Calif.IBD: Matthew, why does the fund have such a large technology weighting?Moberg: The fund focuses on innovation and growth.Our name, ""DynaTech,"" stands for dynamic technologies. We define dynamic as a force that stimulates change or progress. Innovation is where the bulk of wealth creation occurs. But we view this as a broad mandate. We're able to look for innovation anywhere.And we believe you need active management to invest in innovation. It's a part of the market that is often misunderstood. Some people believe it is too expensive, or too unknown. So that's an area we look through because those misunderstandings mean opportunities get overlooked.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: Is your current tech weighting typical for the fund?Moberg: It's been as high as 50%. But sector classifications change. Amazon (AMZN) is now classified as a consumer discretionary stock. Early on, it was tech.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are holdings. They're still considered information technology companies. But one could argue that they are financials.We look for innovation, which can be found in a lot of places.IBD: Health care was your second largest sector, with a 27% weighting. That's another hotbed of innovation, right?Moberg: It's not a great year for health care because of the election (and some candidates talking about price controls). But, yes, there's a lot of innovation there. You see it in possibly emerging treatments for diseases like hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, even cancer.IBD: What are some names you like in that space?Moberg: Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY).Click Here To See A List Of Biggest Mutual Funds Ranked By PerformanceIBD: Is the fund's performance consistent because it is diversified? Because it's exposed to other sectors, not just tech and health care? Why else?Moberg: Yes, we are diversified. And consistency is also due to our fundamental research. Sometimes we find stocks that the market doesn't appreciate how quickly they will come to market. The best example is Facebook (FB). They launched their mobile ads in Q2 2012. In the first quarter they only did $13 million in revenue. That was 1.3% of their total revenue. Two years and three months later, mobile was doing $1.659 billion. That's more advertising revenue than CBS' $1.63 billion in the similar quarter.Technology adoption is accelerating. The world is more global. Investors often don't appreciate how fast a new technology rises. So we try to think long-term. Our short-term performance is just a byproduct of how we think long-term.IBD'S TAKE: See how near Facebook and other highly rated stocks are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.IBD: What part of Facebook's story do you like the most now?Moberg: First, mobile usage. Mobile ads will be more effective than other ads, one could argue. Facebook probably has the best set of mobile applications. And there's a runway for growth there.Second, they're starting to monetize Instagram, where people share pictures. The next step is to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. Usage on them has been explosive. And there's a good chance that this goes into commerce (rather than remain solely a social activity).Finally, when you're thinking about what they could monetize five or 10 years out, Oculus (which makes a virtual reality headset) is another interesting acquisition. Facebook didn't pay much for it. And they can probably monetize it in five to 10 years. It has a long runway, like Messenger and WhatsApp.IBD: Edwards Lifesciences (EW) seems to be benefiting from a new management fiscal discipline and from a key new product, their transcatheter aortic value replacement (TAVR).Moberg: Yes, right now they're going through a very nice product cycle with TAVR. It had a rough start. But now TAVR is an example of a sensational innovation. It enables patients to avoid the need for open-heart surgery, cracking open your rib cage, making a giant incision. Instead, they put the TAVR in through an artery with a small incision. Patients spend less time in the hospital, go through less pain. And with each iteration, the valve gets smaller and easier to insert.That product cycle will last another five-plus years.They're also working on something for mitral valves, which are harder to reach. We hope and expect them to be the leader in that field as well. If they can do it, it would double their addressable market.IBD: Edwards had disappointing sales in Q3 and its stock plummeted. How has this changed your outlook for the company and stock?Moberg: We remain positive on Edwards Lifesciences. Edwards is still in the early stages of capturing the transcatheter aortic valve replacement opportunity (65% share of a $2.5 billion or so market that is only about one-third penetrated).  Its stock also fails to account for any potential for the transcatheter mitral valve replacement opportunity, and mitral valve disease is twice as prevalent as aortic valve disease.  It has faced missteps in new products before — again the world doesn't work as linearly as we would like — but we believe this is an excellent business.IBD: I'll make a wild guess that you are not one of those investors who finds Amazon's product experiments wasteful.Moberg: They're incredibly innovative. They're continually investing in new things. They've had three big successes. The first was Prime. They get money upfront (from consumers). And it drove up usage of Amazon significantly. The second was letting third parties sell on the website, with fulfillment by Amazon. It required no investment in inventory, and generated higher margins.In addition, they have Amazon Web Services, which is increasingly important. It's one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service companies ever.Amazon continues to invest, find new ideas. They've had quite a few failures along the way, but I understand you need to take risk to succeed. That attitude gives us confidence in their continued growth.IBD: Any concerns about Amazon's miss on Q3 results? Any sign of more weakness to come?Moberg: They have gone through many investment cycles in the past. Step-ups in investments don't always, in fact rarely, work within a quarterly reporting cycle. We understand that.  Over the long term Amazon has had very good returns on invested capital, prefers to grow organically and has a culture of innovation.  We didn't see anything in the quarter that suggests that is no longer the case.IBD: Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) is somewhat new to the portfolio. But it has seven straight quarters of slowing earnings. What's your thesis?Moberg: We like to invest in small positions, see how they do and try to hold on for the long-term. If anything fundamental changes and it's right, we add to it.Pioneer is one of the best positions in oil services. They are one of the lowest priced producers. We think oil will stabilize in the 50 to 60 per barrel range.IBD: Why do you like Chinese online gaming company NetEase (NTES)?Moberg: We believe the gaming space is a secular winner. NetEase has some games that have done well. And the secular trends on gaming are better in China than in the U.S., and it is very strong in the U.S. We will see more virtual reality and different kinds of games and ways for people to spend leisure time playing games.IBD: Do you still like Broadcom (AVGO) as much as you used to?Moberg: We don't believe it is as innovative as it used to be. Most of their accelerating earnings per share is due to consolidation. We prefer companies with innovation, which this was at first.Still, they are doing a great job buying companies, rationalizing costs, raising prices. Their CEO is incredibly well thought of in the (chipmaking) industry. He's executing on strategy extremely well. We're pleased that someone is taking the lead and starting consolidation in that industry.IBD: Nvidia (NVDA) is another relative newcomer to your portfolio. What do you like about their chipmaking?Moberg: They were viewed as a provider of graphics chips inside PCs. Then they expanded, making chips inside game consoles. Now they're broken free of that prison and making central processing units for virtual reality. They're also needed in cars, for autonomous driving. Also in hyperscale servers, they're used as co-processors. CAD-CAM, artificial intelligence — their total addressable market is exploding.We think there's a lot of sustainability to the company and a long trajectory for earnings growth.IBD: You have exposure to the pet care industry. What do you like there?Moberg: It's shocking how well we treat animals now vs. 20 or 30 years ago. Cancer treatment, CT scans — they were unavailable years ago. So we like the secular trend. The company we like most and have owned longer and have the largest position in is Idexx Labs (IDXX). Idexx is a particularly well-positioned business competitively, given its unique ability to single-handedly bundle both outsourced diagnostics and in-practice diagnostic instruments.  Idexx also offers superior information management capabilities regarding animal diagnostic reporting and record-keeping relative to competitors.IBD: What's special about Aspen Technology (AZPN), the software firm?Moberg: They do supply-chain management for process industries. This software is so important that even when companies go bankrupt, they pay their Aspen bill. It is the backbone for many companies.They have tremendous operating margin and profitability. There's some competition, but if you are a serious and large company, you need their technology. And customers are incredibly sticky.IBD: Tell me about your co-manager.Moberg: I am lead manager. The fund was founded in 1968. Rupert Johnson, my co-manager, was the fund's first manager. And as you may know he is also vice chairman of Franklin Resources.IBD: Matthew, people often wonder what portfolio managers do in their off hours. How about you?Moberg: I used to run 25 miles a week. I used to have hobbies. Now I have a 7-, 5- and a 1-year-old. They're my hobbies.And I forgot to mention that I'm an avid reader of history. I was a history major in college. I find that useful in looking at micro trends, adoption rates, periods of major and minor innovation, and pattern recognition of new technologies, as well as macro trends like low interest rates, Federal Reserve actions, periods and government responses.RELATED:Top Mutual Fund Manager Captures Solid Returns Without Messy EmotionsThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With GiddyapHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The Downturn

189,UPS,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton remained tied at 44% with the election just four days away, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll.Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson continues to get 4%, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein has 2%.On an unrounded basis, Trump has 44.1% and Clinton 44%, with Johnson at 3.9% and Stein at 1.9%. In a two-way race, Clinton gets 44.3% and Trump 44%.The latest survey of 867 likely voters from Oct. 29-Nov. 2 has a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points. On a weighted basis, the poll has 329 Democrats, 291 Republicans and 234 independents.Just five days ago, Clinton's lead over Trump was 4 points. That was right after FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that he was reopening the bureau's probe into Clinton's private email server while she was secretary of state.Other national polls also continue to tighten. The Real Clear Politics average of seven presidential tracking polls has Clinton leading Trump by just 1.9 points in a four-way race. That's down from 7.1 points as recently as Oct. 17.State polls also show a closer race. RCP sees Clinton's lead among lean/likely states down to just 46 electoral votes vs. 146 on Oct. 29. With no toss-ups, RCP sees Clinton with 273 electoral votes and Trump 265, with 270 necessary for a majority.Still, most political analysts say that while the contest is closer, Clinton is likely to come out victorious over her populist rival.Sound familiar? In the final week before Britons voted on whether to leave the European Union, seven out of nine polls said ""remain"" would win, with one survey showing a 10-point lead. But ultimately ""leave"" won, 52%-48%.Trump, for his part, has vowed to pull off ""Brexit times five."" And he's riding a similar populist wave.""In both the Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential campaign, a surge in populist sentiment has occurred within each electorate,"" said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which runs the IBD/TIPP poll.On both sides of the Atlantic, a large and growing share of voters has felt ignored by the political establishment and views immigration and globalization with suspicion.Brexit pollsters failed to realize how strongly working class voters would turn out to vote against staying in the EU.Trump poses similar challenges because he attracts and repels different groups than a typical Republican nominee. He's going to win the white working class by huge margins, but will that offset weakness among college graduates and other groups?For daily updates until the election and full details, including demographic breakdowns of results, follow the IBD/TIPP Presidential Tracking Poll.Less than a week ago, Clinton seemed to be cruising to victory, with substantial leads in the IBD/TIPP tracking poll and the RCP average. But the FBI email bombshell has revived voters' long-standing unease with Clinton and put the Democratic nominee and her surrogates on the defensive.President Obama, who on Monday declined to criticize his FBI director, on Wednesday appeared to chide Comey for his 11th-hour disclosure.""When there are investigations, we don't operate on innuendo,"" Obama said. ""We don't operate on incomplete information. We don't operate on leaks.""Meanwhile, Trump has been disciplined. He's kept the attention on Clinton and taken aim at ObamaCare, which is slated to see premiums skyrocket by an average 25% in 2017.That's helped the GOP rally behind Trump. Now 88.9% of Republicans support him, up from 83.7% five days earlier. Clinton attracts 88.1% of Democrats, up 2.2 points over that span.Trump's lead among independents has widened to 10 points, 45%-35% vs. 41%-34% five days earlier. That's better than Mitt Romney in 2012. In the final IBD/TIPP tracking poll reading of the 2012 election, Romney topped Obama among independents 52%-46%.But the Republican nominee may need to do even better with swing voters to carry him to victory. Trump's recent rise among independents seems to have come at the expense of Johnson. The Libertarian nominee's support within this key group has eroded from 12% to a still-significant 8% over the last five days. Also, 7% of independents are undecided.Just 43% of independents view Trump favorably vs. 55% who have an unfavorable view. But Clinton is viewed unfavorably with middle-of-the-road voters, 69%-30%.Both campaigns, however, focused on turning out core supporters Wednesday. Obama, appearing in the battleground state of North Carolina, said Trump has ""vilified minorities, vilified people with disabilities.""Trump made several stops in Florida, a must-win state for him. ""We don't want to blow this,"" he told a Miami crowd.Clinton has more money and a bigger organization than Trump to get her voters to the polls. But Trump supporters may not need as much prodding to turn out. Sixty-eighty percent of Trump backers strongly support him, vs. 63% for Clinton backers.RELATED:Hillary Clinton Email Scandal ExplainedTrump Opens Big Lead Over Clinton On Character, Economy: IBD/TIPP PollCould Trump Pull A Brexit-Style Surprise In November?IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll: Latest Results'Never Trump' Fails — GOP Support For Donald Is Strong, And Growing, IBD/TIPP Poll ShowsIBD/TIPP Tracking Poll: The Most Accurate Presidential Poll In America

190,UPS,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — In 1936, President Franklin Roosevelt defeated Kansas' Gov. Alfred Landon in 46 of the 48 states, thereby creating the jest, ""As Maine goes, so goes Vermont."" Eight decades later, New England has gone from the Republicans' last redoubt in a bad year to their least receptive region in any year. Its six states have made 36 decisions in the last six presidential elections and the score is Democrats 35, Republicans 1 — New Hampshire supported George W. Bush in 2000. Republicans hold just two of New England's 21 congressional seats, and two of 12 Senate seats, those of Maine's Susan Collins and New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte.Just nine months ago — time flies when you're having fun — Donald Trump won his first victory in this state's primary. Ayotte could become an especially regrettable part of the collateral damage his campaign is doing to the party with which he is temporarily identified. But she probably will survive his undertow and win a second term, partly because she is almost everything people say they want in politics: She is neither old nor rich nor angry.She is 48 and often finds life amusing, as she recently did concerning former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh's problem. He is trying to convince Indiana to return him as a senator to Washington, where he has lived and prospered since voluntarily leaving the Senate in 2011. When he was recently asked the address of his Indiana condominium, he was stumped. Ayotte, laughing, says, ""I probably couldn't tell you my address in Washington."" There she lives in a basement apartment, returning on weekends to New Hampshire, where her husband runs a small landscaping and snow removal business.This year, New Hampshire has what has become an American rarity, a choice between two grown-ups. Ayotte is the state's former attorney general. Her opponent, Maggie Hassan, 58, is ending her second term as governor. Both women have approximately 100% name recognition and benefit from what an Ayotte aide calls ""three degrees of separation"": Almost everyone in this small state has, or knows someone who has, met or otherwise had contact with the two.Which works to Ayotte's advantage. She is running by running 5K races, bagging groceries, riding all-terrain vehicles in the woods and generally smothering the state with retail politics. Hassan, whose challenge is to give voters a reason to fire Ayotte, is relying heavily on negative ads, especially ones criticizing Ayotte's path to her current position of refusing to vote for Trump.But paid ads often do not dent ""three degrees of separation"" knowledge. Sixty-four percent of voters say Ayotte's path to separation from Trump ""makes no difference"" to them. Last week, UMass Amherst/WBZ released a poll of likely voters, including those ""leaning toward"" a candidate, showed Ayotte with a 4-point lead. Which must reflect the fact that, in a survey of eight swing states, New Hampshire had the largest portion of voters (9.7%) intending to vote both for Clinton and for a Republican Senate candidate.New Hampshire campaigning is costly because candidates must advertise on Boston television, which is watched by almost 85% of New Hampshire voters. Of the state's 1.3 million residents, the 720,000 who will vote for senator are the targets of the $125 million -- $173.61 per vote — that will be spent on the Senate contest by Nov. 8. Ayotte will be outspent on television by $20 million — by $10 million in the last two weeks — but in this politics-saturated state, broadcast political ads may be the equivalent of wallpaper — semi-seen but not really noticed.For 36 years, the Senate seat Ayotte occupies has been held by representatives of a distinctive New Hampshire Republicanism. Warren Rudman for two terms and Judd Gregg for three brought flinty fiscal Puritanism to bear on the federal government's mismanagement of its fisc. New Hampshire currently has a Democratic senator, a member of Congress from each party, and a close contest for governor, so were Ayotte to lose, the state could be entirely blue, which does not suit the prickly (""Live Free or Die"") and purple spirit of a state where 40% of voters are registered independents.In this year's crowded New Hampshire Republican primary, Ohio's Gov. John Kasich finished second to Trump. Today, only 17% of those who supported Kasich support Trump. The center-right of the Granite State seems likely to decide this race, giving rise to the saying, ""As New Hampshire goes, so goes the Senate.""

191,UPS,"Amazon (AMZN) on Thursday announced that it will hire more than 120,000 seasonal holiday workers this year, up 20% from a year earlier, as the e-commerce giant continues to deliver blistering growth. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar retailers plan flat to lower holiday staffing.Amazon's second-quarter revenue rose 31% vs. a year earlier, the best gain in more than four years. Part of that is due to its booming Amazon Web Services cloud-service unit, but the company's core business of selling goods is still robust.As for traditional retailers, Target (TGT) has said it will hire 70,000 in-store staffers this holiday season, unchanged from 2015. Kohl's (KSS) will add 69,000 temporary workers for a fourth straight year. Macy's (M), which is closing many stores, is adding 89,000, down 2%. Target, Kohl's and Macy's have reported multiple quarters of declining sales.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon continues to expands into groceries, reportedly planning to set up convenience stores as well as curbside pickup locations. That could boost Amazon revenue by billions of dollars and pose a bigger threat to Wal-Mart, Target and other big grocery sellers.Meanwhile, FedEx is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers, down slightly vs. last year. UPS says it will hire 95,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year. UPS cited efficiencies that will allow it to ship more with less.FedEx and UPS have been big winners from e-commerce shipments, but Amazon is building up its own fleet of planes for shipping.Some 14,000 seasonal workers were brought on full-time after the 2015 holidays, Amazon said, predicting even more permanent hires this time.Amazon shares fell 0.6% to 829.28 on the stock market today, but are still close to record highs set last week.Macy's fell 2% and Kohl's lost 1.85%, while Target nudged a few pennies higher. All three are well off highs. UPS stock dipped 0.4% while FedEx slid 1.5%, both still relatively close to 52-week highs.RELATED:Retail Sales Report To Show Apple iPhone Launch EffectHoliday Sales Growth Seen Accelerating On Stronger Wage Gains

193,UPS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon indicated he was willing to give the Trump administration more time to carry out its economic agenda, while top executives at the largest U.S. bank by assets and at Citigroup (C) grappled with the potential revival of Depression-era regulations.The remarks come after the failure by the White House and GOP-controlled Congress to replace the Affordable Care Act raised questions about when the administration could execute on tax reform and deregulation.""You all should expect, as a given, that when you have a new president, and they get going, that the nine months after the 100 days is gonna be a sausage-making period,"" Dimon told analysts on JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings call. ""There will be ups and downs, wins and losses, stuff like that.""But he said Trump's plans for tax cuts, looser regulations and infrastructure spending could help all Americans if enacted. CFO Marianne Lake said a business-friendly agenda would eventually translate into loan growth, which she said has turned quieter recently.Some analysts had expressed concern that commercial borrowers could be more cautious as policy goals risk getting mangled in Congress.Dimon said not to ""overreact"" to issues surrounding loan growth, saying companies had other options for expansion. He noted JPMorgan's credit-card segment looked ""OK,""  while mortgages saw obvious effects from higher rates and that auto loans are getting hit by auto sales, which flagged in March.Overall, Dimon remained upbeat on the economy.""U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve,"" he said in a statement.Meanwhile, despite hopes for bank deregulation under Trump, White House economic advisor Gary Cohn reportedly expressed support for something akin to a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1930s law that separated commercial and investment banking that was repealed in 1999.In response, Lake said JPMorgan's diversified business model was ""a source of strength"" for the company and financial markets during the financial crisis. She also said separating the bank's businesses doesn't feel ""consistent with a level playing field and pro-growth agenda in the U.S.""Meanwhile, Citigroup's CFO, John Gerspach, also said he wanted more clarity about where the administration stood on Glass-Steagall, whose repeal, many argue, contributed to the gutting banks experienced during the crisis.Shares of JPMorgan reversed lower as falling Treasury yields squeezed the yield curve, sending the bank's stock down 1.2% on the stock market today. Citigroup dipped 0.8%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) tumbled 3.3%. Goldman Sachs (GS), which reports next week, lost 1.1%. Bank of America (BAC), also reporting next week, fell 1.4%.JPMorgan's Q1 earnings per share jumped 22% to $1.65, above estimates for $1.52. Revenue rose 6% to $25.59 billion, topping views for $24.876 billion. Investment banking revenue jumped 34%, helped by strong IPO activity. Markets revenue rose 13%, with equities up 2% and fixed-income revenue up 17%.March ended up being better than expected, reflecting ""some recovery in volatility,"" Lake said, with market activity picking up in response to European elections and the stronger interest-rate outlook in the U.S.Meanwhile, Citigroup said EPS jumped 23% to $1.35, beating estimates for $1.23. Revenue rose 3% to $18.1 billion, above forecasts for $17.757 billion. Investment banking revenue surged 39% to $1.21 billion. Markets revenue grew 18%, with equities up 10% and fixed income climbing 19% to $3.62 billion.Wells Fargo's EPS rose 1% to $1, beating views for 97 cents, while revenue of $22 billion missed views for $22.315 billion. Auto loan originations sank 29% to $5.5 billion on tighter underwriting standards. Home loan originations plunged to $44 billion from $72 billion in prior quarter.Bank stocks have slipped from their postelection highs, and Trump's comments Wednesday about the dollar being ""too strong"" could weigh on Treasury rates.However, JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said banks could hit a ""sweet spot"" as the Federal Reserve gets more bullish on raising interest rates.""What I mean by that is, with the potential for rates to rise … and the historically low rates we're still in the middle of, they may start to see even more demand for loans as people want to lock in the rates for a longer period of time,"" he said. The better trends in equities could also bode well for the market overall, he said.Still, he cautioned that JPMorgan's decision to set aside more reserves for consumer credit was something to keep an eye on. Wells Fargo's weaker results in its large mortgage business in Q1 could also be a concern as it tries to repair its reputation following a massive sham-account scandal.If nothing else, he noted, the bank still managed to beat EPS estimates.""In a turbulent internal environment, they've still delivered overall,"" Kinahan said.

194,UPS,"X Wal-Mart (WMT) next week will begin offering price discounts for 10,000 goods picked up at a store location, expanding to one million items by the end of June. It's the latest evidence that the Dow Jones industrial average component is driving e-commerce innovation under new online chief Marc Lore, leveraging its brick-and-mortar locations vs. Amazon.com (AMZN).Wal-Mart will offer varying discounts, using technology developed by Jet.com, which Lore sold to Wal-Mart last year for $3.3 billion. Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts.Online shipping costs, especially the ""last mile"" of delivery to customers, are incredibly expensive. Wal-Mart and other traditional retailers have encouraged in-store pickup, waiving shipping fees. But many customers have preferred to wait for online delivery, with Amazon investing heavily to speed up deliveries and giving Amazon Prime members free two-day shipping. Amazon, with its massive size, gets huge discounts from UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) over even large brick-and-mortar retailers.Now Wal-Mart is giving shoppers a clear incentive to make in-store pickups, turning their brick-and-mortar locations into a virtue.Amazon isn't oblivious to the multichannel threat. It's opened a handful of physical bookstores. It's also testing a grocery store in Seattle that features automated checkout.Amazon reportedly mulled buying Whole Foods Stores (WFM) last year, Bloomberg reported.Wal-Mart shares rose 1 cent to 73.44 in the stock market today. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart rose 0.5% to 73.43, in range from a 72.90 buy point taken on Friday.Amazon slid 0.7% to 896.23 after dipping 0.5% to 902.36 on Tuesday. Amazon is still in range from an 860.96 four-weeks-tight buy point.Wal-Mart's holiday quarter U.S. online sales surged 29%, but the retailer has been even more aggressive in 2017.Earlier this year, Wal-Mart dropped its ShippingPass subscription alternative to Amazon Prime, announcing free two-day shipping for online orders of at $35 or more. Amazon, which had raised its non-Prime free-shipping threshold to $50, brought that back to $35, but with a longer delivery span.Walmart.com shoppers can now set a pickup time to have their groceries loaded into the cars, helping to explain why Amazon is testing its own grocery stores and considering a Whole Foods takeover.Wal-Mart also has continued to make online acquisitions, including niche retailers ModCloth, Moosejaw and Shoebuy. It's also opened an online innovation center.Wal-Mart's in-store pickup discounts could show a path for Target (TGT), Macy's (M) and other traditional retailers to make an omnichannel strategy work. But it's also a threat. Target and others seeking to turn physical locations into giant online lockers may find they have to pass on the shipping savings to customers.Target and many other retailers already are being squeezed by Wal-Mart's renewed push to lower prices generally.Wal-Mart has been a reliable dividend stock, having raised the payout every year since 1974. The company just raised the quarterly payment to 51 cents a share. The annualized dividend yield is nearly 3%.

195,UPS,"XParcel-delivery service FedEx (FDX) reported fiscal third-quarter earnings unexpectedly fell vs. a year earlier for the time in four years.Estimates: Earnings per share of $2.62, up 4%. That would be its fourth straight quarter of decelerating EPS growth and the smallest gain in three years. Revenue should climb 18% to $14.986 billion. The quarter began on Dec. 1, which means it includes much of FedEx's increasingly frantic holiday shopping season.Results: Adjusted EPS of $2.35, down 6%. Revenue rose 18% to $15 billion.Outlook: FedEx sees full-year EPS of $10.80-$11.30 excluding pension accounting adjustments. It's not clear if that figure compares to the consensus for $12 but if so would suggests a big Q4 miss, even accounting for Q3's shortfall.Stock: Shares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading, but then rebounded to trade up 2% to 195.71.FedEx closed down 0.2% to 191.85, giving up intraday gains shortly before the close amid a heavy overall sell-off in the stock market today. The stock has held onto its 50-day line, trading tightly in recent days, and is making its way through a flat base with a potential buy point of 201.67.FedEx's operating profit margin was 7.5%, down from 9.2% a year earlier. Operating margin for its Ground segment slid to 11% from a year-earlier 12.6%.Analysts in recent months have zeroed in on FedEx's margins, particularly in its ground delivery segment, as more customers shop online at Amazon.com (AMZN) and others, and come to expect prompt — and more frequent — delivery.FedEx has poured money into automating its delivery infrastructure to hasten the flow of packages through delivery hubs to their destinations. Those efforts could dent margins short-term but cut costs and help profits further out.""We are confident our strategic investments to expand our global scope and portfolio of solutions position FedEx for greater long-term profitable growth as we adapt to meet the evolving needs of our customers,"" said FedEx CEO Fred Smith.However, Barclays said Monday that margins in FedEx's Ground segment ""are likely near a trough."" Cowen said margins ""likely bottomed"" in the second quarter of the company's fiscal year, but that the strain would likely continue.Cowen analyst Helane Becker also expressed concern about how well FedEx did over the holidays.""Several customers overpromised and underdelivered in the peak shipping season and this resulted in lower volumes at FedEx,"" she wrote in a research note dated Friday. ""We believe this will result in muted volume growth in the Ground segment.""FedEx and rival UPS (UPS) also face a potential challenge from the ever-embattled U.S. Postal Service, which has more than doubled its ""competitive"" — that is, cheaper — package volumes since 2012, Barclays said recently.""Pricing has clearly been under pressure from the USPS ... which likely negatively impacted results for FedEx and UPS,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note on Monday.Amazon also has begun its own shipping, taking a piece of business that traditionally went to FedEx and UPS.However, FedEx's international prospects remain solid, and Oglenski said ""global trade expansion in 2017 is shaping up to be the strongest witnessed this cycle, signaling supply chain tightness and a potential for shippers to 'trade up' for premium services.""UPS closed down 0.6%, trading below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. UPS rose slightly late after initially edging lower.Amazon hit an all-time high in morning trade but reversed to slide 1.6% as the major market averages skidded.RELATED:UPS Dives On Q4 Miss, Outlook; Amazon Plans Kentucky Air HubFedEx Q2 Earnings Miss As Margins Shrink; Shares Drop Late 
"
196,UPS," For all the obsession in Washington and in college faculty lounges over income inequality, why isn't there more outrage over government policies that exacerbate the problem?   There are hundreds of programs that make the poor, poorer and increase poverty in America. Many of them were exposed last week by my colleagues at the Heritage Foundation forum on this very topic.Economist  ‎Don Boudreaux of George Mason University unmasked two such policies.  One is trade protectionism. Trade barriers raise prices and ""act as a regressive tax"" on Americans, Boudreaux explains.   They also stunt the very innovation process that makes goods and services widely available to people at affordable prices to begin with.  Think about who the consumers are that shop for those everyday low prices at Walmart. It's not Hillary Clinton.Minimum wage clearly fits into this category as well. In every other industry, Boudreaux notes, when something is more expensive we buy less of it. Why do some economists think that isn't so when it comes to buying labor.Especially for the young and the lowest skilled, minimum wage becomes a toll that prevents many from entering the work force and gaining the skills that can make a low income or  middle class worker a high income worker. This is so obvious that one wonders why liberals keep championing the minimum wage cause.Marlo Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute points out that the fuel economy standards promoted by the leftist environmentalists add thousands of dollars to the cost of a new car. He estimates that these ""green"" policies could mean that 5 million fewer Americans each year can't afford a new car. And, again, those 5 million victims are surely not people like AL Gore or the board members of the Sierra Club.Another green policy that hurts the poor is the anti-fracking crusade of the environmentalists. In my book with Kathleen Hartnett White, ""Fueling Freedom,"" we point out that the lower cost of electricity due to cheap shale natural gas has benefited low income households to the tune of well over $4 billion a year.This is four times the benefit of the low income home energy assistance program. So if liberals really care about the poor, why not get rid of LIHEAP and promote fracking instead?Social Security is the greatest swindle of the poor ever. A new study by Peter Ferrara for the Committee to Unleash Prosperity shows that the average poor person who works 40 hours a week during his or her working life would retire with a larger monthly benefit and would have $1 million or more in an estate that could be left to a spouse or children at death if they could simply put their payroll tax dollars into a personal 401k retirement account and tap into the power of compound interest.Under Social Security poor (and middle class) households leave next to nothing for their kids at death.   So Social Security robs nearly every low and middle income family with a full time worker of at least $1 million over their lifetime.  What a deal!Occupational licensing laws — in trades like moving companies, realtors, hair dressers, limousine services, beauticians, physical therapy and on and on — ‎stunt small business start ups, destroy jobs, and raise prices for lower income consumers. What about the right to make a living?Big government advocates defend these statist occupational barriers to entry by arguing that they are needed to uphold progessional service quality. Professor Boudreaux shows evidence that to the contrary, licensing requirements reduce service quality by shrinking competition in the industry.Arguably the program that has set back upward income mobility ‎for the poor the most is the government school system in inner cities. Every study finds abysmal educational outcomes and even unsafe environments for school children despite cities spending upward of $20,000 per child. In Catholic inner-city schools, these same kids could and should be receiving a better education at half the cost.Yet liberals who champion the poor oppose school choice programs that would raise educational achievement and future earnings.   (Look at the disgraceful treatment of Trump's education chief Betsy Devos).These examples merely scratch the surface of scores of governmental polices that are regressive. Could it be that the gridlock and polarization in Washington could be ended by a bipartisan reform movement to scout out and remove laws and rules that hurt those at the bottom of the income scale the most?One universal goal that we should all agree on and aspire to is equality of opportunity — which these laws squelch.Where are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi and the class warfare warriors on reversing government policies that are stealing money and opportunities for low income and minority families?  Do they care more about protecting the poor or big government? It's time to really find out.

197,UPS,"Steven Spielberg has made a new movie glorifying the Washington Post and how it rallied against then-President Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War in the Pentagon Papers court fight of 1971. It's simply called ""The Post."" Everyone inside and outside this movie is drawing the comparison between Nixon's difficult relationship with the press and President Donald Trump's.XSpielberg told the Hollywood Reporter: ""The relevance is up to everybody to strike their own balance between the news today and the news then. But obviously, sometimes, bad things happen twice. History is certainly repeating itself.""This movie became more urgent to Spielberg & Co. because Trump surprised the liberal elites and beat Hillary Clinton. The first script for this movie was set to glorify the rise of then-Washington Post owner Katharine Graham as a pioneer for women's power in the nation's capital, a theme that would resonate under the first female president. Meryl Streep said the movie is now relevant because the ""press is under siege"" in the Trump era.Liberal Hollywood naturally sees the liberal media as an ally. No one in the movie business wants to produce a movie that makes the Washington Post or other media outlets look irresponsible. Imagine the movie recounting how in 1981, the Post rushed to print Janet Cooke's utterly preposterous — and Pulitzer Prize-winning — story about an 8-year-old cocaine addict. Imagine a movie about The New York Times letting Jayson Blair invent stories out of whole cloth in 2003. Those newspaper movies will never be made, although they would certainly be based on real events.The media, of course, were guaranteed to gush over this movie that polishes their historical apple. The New York Times played with the Post's new Trump-era motto, titling its review ""In 'The Post,' Democracy Survives the Darkness."" Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine called it ""a superhero movie for real grown-ups."" The Post ""critique"" by Ann Hornaday is headlined ""In 'The Post,"" Streep and Hanks Lead a Stirring Homage to the Pursuit of Truth.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveBut is the media's goal always simply the ""truth""? Or are they motivated by an ideological agenda? Didn't the Post (and pretty much everyone who worked there) want Nixon to lose to Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern, just like they wanted Trump to lose to Clinton?If conservatives ever see this propaganda, what might surprise them is that the film's lead characters chide each other for being too close to power. Graham would rush to spend a weekend at the ranch in Texas with ""Lyndon"" Johnson, and then-Executive Editor Ben Bradlee schmoozed around for plenty of dinners and drinks with ""Jack"" Kennedy. But Spielberg casts these characters as heroic by shunning their past sins of closeness to Democrats ... by undermining Nixon — which only shows they were still doing exactly what the Democrats wanted.Nevertheless, Bob Odenkirk, who plays the leftist Post Assistant Managing Editor Ben Bagdikian, bizarrely claims the movie is ""nonpartisan."" That's perfect in a way. The moviemakers, just like the press, love to pretend they're nonpartisan even as they are doing the most partisan things imaginable.Everyone should embrace the notion that freedom of the press is part of the system of government checks and balances. But what all the media are suggesting about this movie, and about this president, is that no one needs to act as a check or a balance on the press. They can be painted as dangerously ""under siege"" when their bias or errors are questioned. Despite the ""superhero"" treatment at the Cineplex, journalists are not automatically more noble and conscientious than everyone else.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

198,UPS,"Netflix (NFLX) shares rocketed for the second straight day on Wednesday, riding positive sentiment from a pair of bullish analyst reports on Tuesday.X Netflix stock broke out of a 12-week flat base with a buy point of 204.48 in morning trading on Wednesday. That topped its previous all-time high of 204.38, reached on Oct. 17. However, the stock's lagging relative strength line provided a caution flag.Netflix added 2% to close at 205.05 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, it notched a record high of 206.21.On Tuesday, Loop Capital Markets analyst David Miller reiterated his buy rating on Netflix and labeled it his ""best idea of 2018."" He also raised his price target on the stock to 241 from 237. Meanwhile, Macquarie Research analyst Tim Nollen upgraded Netflix to outperform from neutral and raised his price target to 220 from 200.Both analysts said Netflix is well-positioned to lead the subscription video-on-demand market, despite threats from Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Walt Disney (DIS). They also said Netflix is likely to show its earnings power in 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, meaning it has outperformed 94% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis on Netflix, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, Netflix confirmed Wednesday that it has ordered a sequel to its big-budget fantasy cop movie ""Bright,"" which critics hated but audiences like. The movie, which stars Will Smith and Joel Edgerton, premiered on Dec. 22.Netflix said ""Bright"" is the company's highest-viewed original film ever on the service in its first week. The movie, which cost a reported $90 million to make, garnered 11 million viewers in its first three days, according to Nielsen measurements, which MarketWatch calculated would be equal to a $95 million Friday-to-Sunday opening weekend at the box office.RELATED:Netflix Is 'Miles Ahead' Of Rivals, Analyst Says; Stock SoarsNetflix Ups Its Ante In The Movie Business With 'Bright'

199,UPS,"Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped Thursday after reporting fourth-quarter Model 3 car deliveries that fell far short of estimates and raised questions of whether the company will need to raise more cash.X The Tesla report gave fodder to both bulls and bears, with bulls cheerful that Model 3 production accelerated late in the fourth quarter. Bears growled that Tesla again missed production goals and is chewing through cash at a rate of $1 billion a quarter.Tesla reported fourth-quarter delivery estimates after the market close Wednesday that showed it continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans. Production of its two other models, the S and X, were in line with expectations. But Tesla again pushed back production schedules on its Model 3, based on previous projections. The Model 3 is Tesla's first car aimed at the mass market.Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said both bulls and bears got what they wanted in Tesla's report.Tesla's production guidance ""will give bulls some hope, but bears will see support for the thesis around persistent production delays, near-term cash needs, and an overextended organization,"" he wrote in a research note to clients.""We also believe equipment providers are likely looking for payment which could pressure Tesla to run into a challenging cash position. We remain on the sidelines,"" wrote Rusch.Tesla said it manufactured a total of 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter, which is well short of where it had intended to be at this time. Of those, it delivered 1,550 Model 3s, with the remainder in transit. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver about 4,100 Model 3s.""Model 3 volume fell short of expectations which, to be fair, were largely guesswork given the absence of guidance,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a research note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Tesla have been consolidating since the company's stock hit an all-time high of 389.61 on Sept. 18. During this consolidation, it hit a low of 292.63 on Nov. 2. The stock is stuck under its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.A bigger concern is that Tesla pushed back production guidance, which suggests the company will need more capital, he wrote.Tesla now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned.""We see only moderate downside risk to estimates from today's disclosure,"" wrote Houchois, who maintained a rating of underperform with a price target of 240.Tesla shares initially fell 3.6% during morning trading, then won back some of those losses as the session wore on. By the closing bell, Tesla shares were off 0.8% to 314.62 on the stock market today.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson said he detected ""a noteworthy tone change"" in the Tesla announcement as it is ""opting for a more gradual ramp in Model 3 production to focus on quality and efficiency rather than just volume.""""With the 5,000/week production target pushed out a quarter, management is effectively buying itself another quarter of blaming the lack-of-scale for would-be sub-par margins,"" Erickson wrote.""While in the long run (and in the eyes of many bulls), this does not drive that big of a volume change, it does appear there is increasing risk to the Street's 174,000 Model 3 estimate for next year,"" Erickson wrote.Nomura analyst Romit Shah said he was encouraged by the progress on Model 3 production ""and continue to expect Tesla to deliver substantial (+100%) revenue growth in 2018.""He maintained a buy rating on Tesla and a price target of 500.""Importantly, we believe that Tesla is prioritizing quality control,"" Shah wrote. ""While Tesla's repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging.""Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin. Production delays at Tesla are among the reasons a large amount of Tesla shares are sold short.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Self-Driving Cars: Why 2018 Will Be The Year The Rubber Hits The RoadTesla Receives Largest Order For Big-Rig Semi Truck From UPS

Major investors, like JPMorgan CEO James Dimon or the Wolf of Wall Street,  Jordan Belfort, have come out and called Bitcoin a ""fraud."" Others, like Ray Dalio, call it a ""bubble.""Along with these claims comes the advice that you should not invest in, nor own any, Bitcoin. From the world of economics, we can identify three reasons why these bold claims by investment gurus should be taken with a grain of salt and their investment advice ignored – even with the price over $17,000.1) We don't know the future, and neither do they.The price of a stock or an asset reflects the belief about the current and future value of the asset. At over $15,000, one Bitcoin is quite expensive, but that doesn't mean we've hit its ultimate peak — remember we felt that way when it hit $1,000, and now it is up to more than $15,000. Bitcoin could still continue to go up in value.X Even if the market is not perfectly efficient, history shows us that even experts are not capable of knowing the future of particular stocks or specific investments beyond the current price. Experts can guess, and they can even give convincing explanations, but the price of the investment already reflects their rationales. When it comes to Bitcoin, it might be likely to be a failure, but the price already reflects that possibility. The price of $15,000 is probably about right, given the risk of failure and the potential reward from success.2) We fear failure.Why are hedge fund managers and tech investors getting in on Bitcoin, but the average investor is still asking questions while the price has been skyrocketing? Risk and fear can help us explain why.Everyone knows that stocks have higher returns than government bonds. The common sense explanation for the higher return to stocks is that it is a result of their higher risk. However, for nearly a century the return on stocks has been about 6% higher than the return on bonds, and economists have calculated that only a small fraction of this higher return is a reward for higher risk. How do economists explain this phenomenon they call the equity premium puzzle?Behavioral economists, such as Richard Thaler, who recently won the Nobel Prize in economics, explain this puzzle with one of their fundamental and well-founded insights: loss aversion. We hate losses. We hate losses more than we like wins. This loss aversion shows up in our investment decisions and helps economists explain the equity premium puzzle as bonds forego the ups and downs of market swings that stocks naturally experience.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveAs stocks rise and fall, we like the rises, but because we hate loss more than we like gains, we feel the falls are twice as hard as the rises — and this turns too many average investors towards bonds. Loss aversion can help us explain stocks and bonds, but it can also explain why we underinvest in assets, like Bitcoin, that have a reasonable chance of epic collapse.Now, you might say everyone should avoid an investment that has a reasonable chance at an epic collapse — but that intuition is not necessarily true. If you have a 99% chance of having your investment end with no worth whatsoever, and a 1% chance of 500-to-1 returns, a wise investor will set aside a few dollars for such a proposition. The chances of a win seem grim, but no Vegas casino wants a game like that on their floor, as the odds are slanted toward the consumer.However, the high chance of loss creates such a great psychological weight that very few of us are willing to take on such a gamble, even though the math tells us it's a good idea.Bitcoin might be such a proposition. It might have a large probability of failure, but also a non-zero probability that the price skyrockets. It's a high-risk, high-return proposition.3) Diversification shouldn't be forgotten.Probably the most basic rule of investing is to diversify. If you have all of your eggs in one basket, you might end with incredible success. However, you might also end up with nothing. The economic goal of diversifying is to reduce risk while avoiding the small returns of low-risk assets like bonds. You get the both of best worlds with diversification — lower net risk and the potential for high returns.Bitcoin is a great asset for diversification. It isn't real estate. It isn't the stock market. It isn't like most other assets you're likely invested in. It is variety.So — am I pro Bitcoin? Yes and no. The head of Morgan Stanley, James Gorman, recently called Bitcoin ""more than just a fad."" And investment guru Mike Novogratz predicted on CNBC's Fast Money that Bitcoin could easily ""be at $40,000 at the end of 2018."" Listening to Gorman and Novogratz might make you want to go purchase some GBTC or load the Coinbase app on your phone and purchase Bitcoin right away, but I don't think we should put too much faith in those claims either.Claiming that you should or should not invest in Bitcoin is often given as advice based on the prediction of what it will become. To me, that's pure speculation. Chances are it will fail — but even if I think this is so, doesn't basic economics tell us to roll those dice? You do not want to go putting more than you can afford to lose into Bitcoin investments, but why wouldn't you diversify your portfolio and take on a small chunk of risk-reward investing?Stop listening to people try to predict the unpredictable — your investment decisions are too valuable to you to fall for that charade. It really is basic economics: Most people should buy Bitcoin, just not that much.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

201,UPS,"Tesla (TSLA) on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter delivery estimates that show it continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, while production numbers of Model S and Model X were in line with expectations.X Tesla announced it manufactured a total of 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter, which is well short of where it had intended to be at this time. Of those, it delivered 1,550 Model 3s, with the remainder in transit. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver about 4,100 Model 3s.In total, Tesla said it delivered 29,870 vehicles, of which 15,200 were Model S, 13,120 were Model X, and 1,550 were Model 3s.""This was once again our all-time best quarter for combined Model S and X deliveries, representing a 27% increase over Q4 2016, and a 9% increase over Q3 2017, our previous best quarter,"" Tesla said in a prepared statement.But Tesla again pushed back production schedules on it Model 3, based on previous projections.""As we continue to focus on quality and efficiency rather than simply pushing for the highest possible volume in the shortest period of time, we expect to have a slightly more gradual ramp through Q1, likely ending the quarter at a weekly rate of about 2,500 Model 3 vehicles,"" Tesla said. It now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned.Tesla has had a hard time getting the premium sedan off the factory floor with just 222 delivered in the third quarter. Production started in July and Tesla initially planned to be delivering 5,000 vehicles per week sometime during the fourth quarter, but that was delayed to the first quarter after encountering production bottlenecks.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Tesla have been consolidating since the company's stock hit an all-time high of 389.61 on Sept. 18. During this consolidation, it hit a low of 292.63 on Nov. 2. Tesla has an IBD Composite Rating of 37 out of a possible 99, and ranks ninth among stocks in the automotive group, behind first-place Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Shares of Tesla lost 1% during the regular session to 317.25 and were down another 1.7% in after-hours trading to 312 on the stock market today.During the fourth quarter, Tesla said, ""we made major progress addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks, with our production rate increasing significantly toward the end of the quarter.""In the last seven working days of the quarter, Tesla said it made 793 Model 3's. Tesla said it hit a production rate, over the last few days, on each of its manufacturing lines that extrapolates to more than 1,000 Model 3's per week.""As a result of the significant growth in our production rate, we made as many Model 3's since December 9 as we did in the more than four months of Model 3 production up to that point,"" Tesla said. ""Model 3 deliveries to non-employee customers are now accelerating rapidly, and we're confident our customers will love them.""Tesla has struggled to get its Model 3 out the door, during what Chief Executive Elon Musk has called ""production hell.""Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin. Production delays at Tesla are among the reasons a large amount of Tesla shares are sold short.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Self-Driving Cars: Why 2018 Will Be The Year The Rubber Hits The RoadTesla Receives Largest Order For Big-Rig Semi Truck From UPS

202,UPS,"After a postelection year when the S&P 500 climbed 21.83%, the Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% and the market's top stocks did far better, investors may have to search farther for big returns in 2018.
"
203,UPS,"X Since 1963, the S&P 500 delivered 19 years in which it rallied more than 15%. But each year following those big gains averaged a more modest 7.5% advance. That said, money managers and strategists still see plenty of investment opportunities in 2018.And some seem to already be at hand. Scarcely three days into the new year and the Dow has charged ahead 1.4%, in the process topping 25,000 for the first time ever.But some of the best gains for the full year may come in overseas stock markets and in value equities both in the U.S. and abroad. (Click here for a timeline and detailed chart of 2017's remarkable stock market.)That rotation of big portfolios into more foreign stocks is expected to take place despite economic uncertainty due to the U.K.'s Brexit and escalating tensions with Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, not to mention North Korea's nuclear threats.Two big reasons are the prospect of faster economic growth abroad and cheaper valuations for many foreign equities. GDP growth will likely continue strong in both China and Europe, where European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi says monetary stimulus will continue until at least September.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market ReviewThe U.S. economy looks positive too. Investors are heartened by incoming Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and they're jazzed by a drum roll of moves by President Trump, including tax reform, opening the way for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, throttling back on federal regulations and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.But with many stocks up sharply from a year ago, investment strategists and fund managers expect more modest stock price gains in 2018. The S&P 500's 2017 return was more than double the big-cap bogey's 8.50% average annual gain over the past 10 years. The Nasdaq composite index shot up 29.64% and the Dow Jones industrials gained 25.08%.Align Technology (ALGN), part of the Nasdaq and a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks, jumped 131% in 2017. The company is known for its computer-assisted design approach to straightening teeth.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a key cog in the Dow, rose 24% in 2017. IBD Markets Editor Juan Carlos Arancibia analyzes 2017's top-performing stocks in a separate article.Against this backdrop, money pros say some of the best opportunities lie in non-U.S. stocks. And in both the U.S. and abroad, they see good potential in value-oriented stocks, including cyclical stocks whose performance swings up and down with economic conditions.""Stocks will be better than bonds once again in 2018,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for broker and financial advisor Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""And we like international markets better than domestic. That includes developed markets in the eurozone but not the U.K., and it includes Japan.""Joy cites three reasons why foreign stocks may shine. ""Economic growth relative to potential growth appears to be stronger in those international markets than in the U.S. even though the U.S. is doing well,"" he said. ""And central banks in those (foreign) geographies will be more accommodative than in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve as everyone knows is raising interest rates.""The third reason: Valuations. U.S. stocks as a group have grown expensive, Joy says. Other markets are more attractively valued. So there's more upside potential than in U.S. stocks overall.But Joy added, ""We do think U.S. stocks will go higher."" Ameriprise currently forecasts that the S&P 500 will hit 2865 in 2018, up 7% from its 2673.61 level at year-end 2017.Joseph Davis, Vanguard's global chief economist and head of its investment strategy group, says Vanguard expects the lowest returns for U.S. equities in roughly a decade. His group expects 4% to 6% annual gains for U.S. stocks in the next five years.Ameriprise forecasts 3.0% U.S. GDP growth in excess of inflation in 2018. Before Congress passed tax reform, Ameriprise was predicting 2.4%. China's pace should remain around 6.5%. The eurozone's economy should grow around 2.2% vs. 2.1% in 2017.As for interest rates Ameriprise, among others, expects the Fed to continue raising rates. That ""will be a lid on earnings multiples for U.S. corporations and may bring some (multiples) down,"" Joy said. Research firm Action Economics sees the fed funds rate around 2.12% by the end of 2018, up from its 1.25% to 1.50% band since June 2017.U.S. tax reform is a wild card. ""It should add incrementally to earnings growth and economic growth,"" Joy said. ""It should provide a little tailwind to stocks.""U.S. joblessness should drop to 3.6% by the end of 2018, the lowest rate since 1969, Ameriprise says. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in November 2017.David Polak, equity investment specialist at Capital Group, the parent of American Funds, sees investment opportunities in several geographic markets. Asia and the U.S. remain leading sites of technology innovators, he says.Manufacturers of logic chips are one group of innovators. Industry consolidation has left four key players, including Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and California-based Intel (INTC). Fifteen years ago, there were 25.""Taiwan Semi and Intel are dominant,"" Polak said. ""Consolidation has left the space more disciplined, which should lead to more visibility of earnings and more pricing power.""Another Asia stock he likes is Japan's Murata Manufacturing. ""Their ceramic capacitors are crucial components for smartphones, but relatively inexpensive, so manufacturers can stuff phones with them without impacting their margins much,"" he said.Since the capacitors are used in Apple iPhones as well as Samsung Galaxy and other Android phones, ""It's a way to invest in the growth element without having to bet on which phone will do better,"" Polak said.In gaming, he likes the way Japan's Nintendo (NTDOY) has diversified its addressable market. ""They took their intellectual property away from just hardware,"" Polak said. ""You used to have to play their games only on their hardware. Now it's available on multiple devices.""Then there's Tencent (TCEHY), China's leading provider of messaging and mobile gaming services. Tencent also owns the popular WeChat app.For Polak, a key Tencent trait is its leadership in China's mobile payments services, enabling consumers to use smartphones to pay bills and make online purchases.Peter Bourbeau, co-manager of $9.3 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLYX) sees opportunities among U.S. stocks but says it's time to switch from FAANG stocks because their price run-ups have left less room to rise. The ClearBridge fund is on track to becoming a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner after outperforming the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as in the trailing three, five and 10 years.Schlumberger (SLB) should benefit from a bottoming among energy stocks, Bourbeau says. Oil and gas service companies have regained pricing power, he adds.""SLB currently generates incremental margins of 60%-plus (the highest in its history) and is benefiting from its OneStim U.S. joint venture with Weatherford International (WFT) for pressure pumping,"" he said. ""SLB is the only global service company that is using its balance sheet to invest alongside its customers.""Among health care stocks, Bourbeau likes Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). He calls it ""a leader in ultrarare genetic disease treatments. The company recently cleared the decks with new management and a refocused research and development profile. Alexion also received additional approvals for its lead compound Soliris for (treating other maladies)."" Solaris also was being tested for new ways of being administered.Within the financial services stock group, he likes Visa (V). ""Visa is making very good progress on its recent acquisition of Visa Europe with synergies and client engagement,"" he said. ""Although incremental margins are extremely strong, Visa continues to innovate within its core debit/credit portfolio as well as (creating) new ways to integrate with merchants and cardholders.""What about some of the big stocks that padded his mutual fund's recent gains? FAANG stock Amazon (AMZN), up 56% in 2017, was among his top holdings as of Sept. 30. So was Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 38% for the year.""Amazon continues to execute its plan of disrupting adjacent verticals and margin-rich opportunities,"" Bourbeau said. ""It continues to focus on marketplace, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime. The company has a huge opportunity outside the U.S. and will focus on countries like India, which is more hospitable to Western technology companies. We still see a large opportunity in AWS as we are in early stages of a generational shift to how technology is created and consumed.""Regarding Microsoft, Bourbeau said, ""We expect more of the same strong growth trends for Microsoft as the software maker helps its clients move workloads to the cloud. Its Azure cloud business is at a $20 billion run rate (in sales for 2018) and growing double digits. The company continues to focus on partnerships with service providers and competing technology, a departure from the strategy of previous management.""Celgene (CELG), another top holding, is an inexpensive stock, he said, adding that Celgene has a strategy for coping with the patent expiration of its flagship product, the cancer drug Revlimid, in the middle of the next decade. ""The biotechnology company should have 19 late-stage clinical readouts in 2019,"" he said. ""Cash continues to build and we expect some business development opportunities or acquisitions to further bolster its clinical pipeline.""MORE IBD COVERAGE FOR YOU:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Tax Reform Impacts Your Tax Bracket And RateYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeAI In Business: This Is What The Future HoldsBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

204,UPS,"Netflix (NFLX) shares jumped on Tuesday after the internet television network received a pair of bullish analyst reports to start the new year.X Loop Capital Markets analyst David Miller reiterated his buy rating on Netflix and labeled it his ""best idea of 2018."" He also raised his price target on the stock to 241 from 237.Macquarie Research analyst Tim Nollen upgraded Netflix to outperform from neutral and raised his price target to 220 from 200.Netflix shares surged 4.8% to close at 201.07 on the stock market today.""Consumers' increasing lack of tolerance for advertising drives them to subscription OTT (over-the-top television) services, and Netflix is miles ahead of peers,"" Nollen said in a report. ""Disney's (DIS) eventual OTT service is still two years away, and won't threaten Netflix, which besides holding onto a strong U.S. subscriber base is establishing passion brand status in many international markets.""Netflix also is taking steps to improve the quality of its revenue and earnings to take its investor story beyond just subscriber growth, Nollen said.Miller made similar comments.""While last year's subscriber growth was notable, we expect to see true operating leverage out of Netflix this year, and we believe the company is poised to deliver that at a level well beyond what we witnessed in 2017,"" Miller said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, meaning it has outperformed 93% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis on Netflix, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Netflix is being judicious as it shifts from licensed content to a greater reliance on original TV shows and movies, he said.""Cash flow concerns aside, Netflix's move to 60% original content may end up generating cost savings for the company if its comments regarding originals being cheaper per hour than licensed content hold,"" Nollen said.Competition for viewers and original content is likely to remain stiff as Netflix goes up against Amazon.com (AMZN), Walt Disney and others, he said.Apple (AAPL) is rumored to be entering the subscription video-on-demand business this year.Citi analysts Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant believe there is a 40% likelihood that Apple will acquire Netflix, Business Insider reported Monday.

205,UPS,"Tesla (TSLA) will be closely watched as the electric-car company sometime this coming week is expected to report fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries, which could have a big impact on the stock if it misses or exceeds expectations.X The focus will mainly be on the mass-market Model 3. Tesla has had a hard time getting the premium sedan off the factory floor with just 222 delivered in the third quarter. Production started in July and Tesla initially planned to be delivering 5,000 vehicles per week sometime during the fourth quarter, but that was delayed to the first quarter after encountering production bottlenecks.KeyBanc Capital Markets recently slashed its estimate on Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter to 5,000 from 15,000. It also lowered its forecast for 2018 to 108,000 from 120,000.Tesla has struggled to get its Model 3 out the door, during what Chief Executive Elon Musk has called ""production hell.""Tesla has projected it would deliver 100,000 Model S and X cars in 2017, implying about 27,000 deliveries in the fourth quarter, a slight uptick from the 25,915 Model S and Model X deliveries in the third quarter.Tesla shares fell 1.3% to 311.35 on the stock market today. Tesla shares are down 20% from a record high of 389.61 set on Sept. 18, as reports of Model 3 production woes surfaced.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla undercut its 200-day line on Friday and its 50-day line on Tuesday. The stock has been showing a great deal of whipsaw action, as it tries to rebound from its recent lows and build the right side of a potential base. Looking to invest in the stock market?

207,UPS,"For euphemism, dissimulation and outright hypocrisy, there is nothing quite as entertaining as the periodic Senate dust-ups over Supreme Court appointments and the filibuster. The arguments for and against the filibuster are so well-known to both parties as to be practically memorized. Both nonetheless argue their case with great shows of passion and conviction. Then shamelessly switch sides — and scripts — depending on the ideology of the nominee.Everyone appeals to high principle, when everyone knows these fights are about raw power. When Democrat Harry Reid had the majority in the Senate and Barack Obama in the White House, he abolished the filibuster in 2013 for sub-Supreme Court judicial appointments in order to pack three liberal judges onto the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.Bad karma, bad precedent, he was warned. Republicans would one day be in charge. That day is here and Republicans have just stopped a Democratic filibuster of Neil Gorsuch by extending the Reid Rule to the Supreme Court.To be sure, there are reasoned arguments to be offered on both sides of the filibuster question. It is true that the need for a supermajority does encourage compromise and coalition building. But given the contemporary state of hyperpolarization — the liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats of 40 years ago are long gone — the supermajority requirement today merely guarantees inaction, which, in turn, amplifies the current popular disgust with politics in general and Congress in particular. In my view, that makes paring back the vastly overused filibuster, on balance, a good thing.Moreover, killing the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations (the so-called nuclear option) yields two gratifications: It allows a superb young conservative jurist to ascend to the seat once held by Antonin Scalia. And it constitutes condign punishment for the reckless arrogance of Reid and his erstwhile Democratic majority.A major reason these fights over Supreme Court nominations have become so bitter and unseemly is the stakes — the political stakes. The Supreme Court has become more than ever a superlegislature. From abortion to gay marriage, it has appropriated to itself the final word. It rules — and the normal democratic impulses, expressed through the elected branches, are henceforth stifled.Why have we had almost half a century of massive street demonstrations over abortion? Because the ballot box is not available. The court has spoken, and the question is supposedly settled for all time.This transfer of legislative authority has suited American liberalism rather well. When you command the allegiance of 20 to 25% of the population (as measured by Gallup), you know that whatever control you will have of the elected branches will be fleeting (2009-2010, for example). So how do you turn the political order in your direction? Capture the courts.They are what banks were to Willie Sutton. They are where you go for the right political outcomes. Note how practically every argument at the Gorsuch hearings was about political outcomes. Where would he come out on abortion? Gay marriage? The Democrats pretended this was about principle, e.g. the sanctity of precedent. But everyone knows which precedents they selectively cherish: Roe v. Wade and, more recently, Obergefell v. Hodges.Liberalism does not want to admit that the court has become its last reliable instrument for achieving its political objectives. So liberals have created a great philosophical superstructure to justify their freewheeling, freestyle constitutional interpretation. They present themselves as defenders of a ""living Constitution"" under which the role of the court is to reflect the evolving norms of society. With its finger on the pulse of the people, the court turns contemporary culture into constitutional law.But this is nonsense. In a democracy, what better embodiment of evolving norms can there be than elected representatives? By what logic are the norms of a vast and variegated people better reflected in nine appointed lawyers produced by exactly three law schools?If anything, the purpose of a constitutional court such as ours is to enforce old norms that have preserved both our vitality and our liberty for 230 years. How? By providing a rugged reliable frame within which the political churnings of each generation take place.The Gorsuch nomination is a bitter setback to the liberal project of using the courts to ratchet leftward the law and society. However, Gorsuch's appointment simply preserves the court's ideological balance of power. Wait for the next nomination. Having gratuitously forfeited the filibuster, Democrats will be facing the loss of the court for a generation.Condign punishment indeed

208,UPS,"Attention, financial advisors! Don't let bogus stereotypes prevent you from pursuing prospects who can help your practice grow. In particular, don't give up on landing millennial and Gen X investors as clients.Contrary to the conventional wisdom, those younger investors not only are interested in working with human financial advisors, they're actually more likely than a baby boomer to believe that a financial advisor can improve their financial peace of mind, according to a new survey by Capital One Investing. And — also against the prevailing conception — they have more faith in human advisors than in robo-advisors.The survey found that 58% of baby boomers have more faith in human financial advisors than in robo-advisors. But 67% of Gen Xers have more faith in human advisors than robo-advisors. And 78% of millennials have more faith in people than computer-based advisory services.Isn't that upside down? Aren't millennials supposed to put more faith in the internet and robo-advisors and all things digital? Why do the younger investors place more trust in human financial advisors to help them than older investors do?It is the school of hard knocks that has taught younger investors to have so much faith in human financial advisors. ""Often they're managing significant student-loan debt, and in some cases their career path and wage growth have been negatively impacted by fallout from the Great Recession,"" said Jeff Sills, head of national advice at Capital One Investing. As a result, younger investors look for all the help they can get, including human advisors.And as young people, they're flexible in their thinking. ""They are more open to trying out various approaches,"" Sills said.That flexibility makes them more open to robo-advisors as well as to human advisors. Young investors are more likely than older investors to believe that robo-advisors can improve their peace of mind. Sixty-five percent of millennials (investors age 18 to 36) feel that way. That's more than the 53% of Gen Xers (investors age 37-52) who have that much faith in robo-advisors, and its more than double the 31% of baby boomers (investors age 53-71) who feel that way.So, how should human advisors use this flexibility trait to help build and maintain their practices?""There are two things that advisors should do,"" Sills said. ""First, they have to be accessible. Second, they have to build relationships with people.""The desire to talk with a human financial advisor jumps during market volatility. Nearly three quarters — 74% — of investors prefer help from a human advisor when the market is turbulent.In addition to helping clients who reach out, advisors should use that interaction to build their relationships with those clients, Sills says. Here are three do's and three don'ts recommended by Sills for advisors:RELATED:How Much Is A Financial Advisor's Service Really Worth?Here's The Threat To Profits For 80% Of Financial Advisors

209,UPS,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO). The three stocks rose 12%, 23% and 26% in Q4 last year. Apple (AAPL), up 20%, was also a top holding. The iPhone maker has rallied this year — it's close to the 20% profit-taking zone from a Jan. 9 breakout past a 117.12 cup-with-handle entry.""We are generally positive about the technology sector going forward despite many of the end markets being challenged for growth, whether that be in PCs, smartphones or networking,"" the managers said in their Q4 commentary. ""We are feeling optimistic about U.S. economic prospects in the wake of the election. In particular, we are enthusiastic that a less onerous regulatory environment should lead to more robust U.S. economic growth and that repatriation of cash held overseas will benefit a huge swath of technology companies in which the portfolio is invested.""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

210,UPS,"In the most pressure-packed of situations, Denny Crum remained cool. And none is more intense in college basketball than the single-elimination NCAA tournament. Crum, a Hall of Fame coach, took his University of Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team to six Final Four appearances, winning the NCAA title twice. He took his team to the tournament 23 times in 30 years.Throughout his career, Crum's calm presence earned him the nickname ""Cool Hand Luke.""""I tried to set a good example,"" Crum, 80, told IBD. ""I always felt if I couldn't keep myself under control, how could I expect my players to? I always tried to keep a cool demeanor. I didn't yell or scream at officials.""As the Cardinals' head coach from 1971 to 2001, Crum amassed a 675-295 record, good for a .696 winning percentage. His NCAA Tournament record was 43-23, or .652%. The Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, which inducted Crum in 1994, says he's the second-fastest NCAA Division 1 coach to reach 500 wins.He was named NCAA Coach of the Year in 1980, 1983 and 1986. Crum's teams won 12 regular season Metro Conference championships and 11 conference tournaments. Crum and the Cardinals won the NCAA tournament in 1980 and 1986. He was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.""You've got to be able to make the young people that are under your supervision be aware of the fact they aren't working for you, they are working with you,"" Crum said.Darrell Griffith, a former Cardinals star who was named the most outstanding player of the 1980 Final Four, told IBD, ""Coach wanted to do things the right way. He was a hard worker, extremely competitive and had the will to win.""Griffith went on to a stellar NBA career. ""I was fundamentally sound and taught well by a great coach in Denny Crum. I could accept constructive criticism, I had a willingness to always want to be better and I was never satisfied. I didn't take my game for granted. Those were all traits from Coach Crum.""Jerry Jones, an assistant coach for Crum for 28 years at Louisville, said his former boss ""utilized the talents of the players.""""He played to their strengths,"" said Jones, ""and we tried to cover up their weaknesses.""His plan was: day one to the end of the season. He'd say: 'This is where we want to be at the end of the season. Here's how we go about being the best we can be to get there,' and he followed that step by step. Even when there were ups and downs, we stayed with the system.""Crum was born in San Fernando, Calif. His mechanic father instilled in him the ability to avoid ""majoring in minors,"" Crum recalled. ""He meant there are some things you cannot do anything about, so don't dwell on them. Spend your time and effort on things that you can control.""Crum played basketball at Los Angeles Pierce Junior College from 1954-56. He then transferred to UCLA to play under the legendary John Wooden. After graduating in 1958, Crum became UCLA's freshman basketball coach at a time when first-year players weren't varsity eligible. He then went back to Pierce as an assistant and later became its head coach. In 1968, Crum returned to UCLA as Wooden's lead assistant and top recruiter. In that position he would be part of Wooden's 1969, '70 and '71 title teams there.Both playing and coaching under Wooden has left an indelible impression on Crum.""Paying attention to details, that was one of the things I learned from Coach Wooden,"" Crum said. ""If you don't pay attention to details, there are so many little things that are going to slip through the cracks it's hard to get a job done well. They'll all build up to become one big obstacle to whatever it is you're trying to get done.""Coach Wooden would be the first to say he wasn't great at strategy, that he was a teacher.""Crum was influenced by that, and it came naturally to him. ""As a teacher and coach I think patience is crucial because you can't push young people to do things. You've got to lead and guide them.""""Coach dominated and commanded the practices by his teaching,"" Griffith said. ""He taught us well.""After assisting Wooden on title teams — and identifying and then recruiting superstar center Bill Walton to Wooden and UCLA — Crum was hired by Louisville as their head coach at age 34.""I thought I was ready,"" Crum said. ""I had the privilege to play and coach for Coach Wooden, so I learned from both sides of it. When I went back to UCLA as Coach Wooden's assistant I learned the planning, that attention to detail. Coach Wooden's ego never got in his way. He would always say it's amazing what you can get done if you don't care who gets the credit.""At Pierce, Crum found different ways of doing things, and when he'd suggest those to Wooden upon his return, the legend was receptive. Jones said Crum was the same way with his assistants.Having been mentored by Wooden, Crum still strived to be himself. ""You can't do something someone else's way and expect to be as good at it as they are,"" he said. ""You have to have your own personal feelings about things, your own experiences. Everything that goes into making up who you are is what your team will get from you.""At Louisville, Crum instilled something Wooden insisted on for his UCLA teams — that a player who scored on a pass must immediately acknowledge the player who made the assist, as a way to build teamwork and camaraderie.""They had to (do so) 100%,"" Crum said of his players. ""I'd take them out of the game if they didn't. They learned quick. A lot of times we get too hung up on the individual stuff and don't think enough in terms of the team. Teamwork is crucial and essential in almost anything you do that makes you successful.""Crum found success right away. He'd taken over a good Louisville basketball program, but one that hadn't been to the NCAA Tournament since 1968, hadn't reached a Final Four since 1959, and had never won a national championship. Crum's first Louisville team went 26-5 and made it to the Final Four, where he lost to his mentor Wooden.While it wasn't Wooden's way to actively recruit players, Crum recognized that without that kind of stature — and in a region that was a hotbed for college basketball with competition from the universities of Kentucky, Cincinnati, Memphis, Duke and North Carolina — he had to.""Whenever my assistants were out there, and I was out too,"" Crum said, ""I tried not just to find the best players, but to show the kind of interest in them that you were sincere in wanting them to be a player in your system.""Eight years later, after six NCAA Tournament berths and two NIT ones, Crum had his Cardinals in the 1980 NCAA title game, going against UCLA and fellow future Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown.""I can remember telling my 1980 team at halftime,"" Crum told WPLF.org, ""it's a shame that you played so good getting here and now you're playing scared and tight out there. I think you just need to go out there and relax and do what you've been taught to do, and things will turn out good for us.'""It did, as Louisville won the game 59-54, and the title. Six years later Crum's Cardinals were NCAA champs again.Crum feels there are certain characteristics that championship teams have. ""For one, you can't have a selfish team and win against the good competition,"" Crum said. ""Your kids all have to be willing to give their very best not for individual accolades but for the good of the team. Coach Wooden said your best five players don't always make your best team. I believe that 100%.""After Crum retired from coaching in 2001, he began the Denny Crum Scholarship Foundation. Its purpose is to raise money to help kids go to college. Candidates must maintain a B grade-point average and contribute to society in such ways as community service.""Coach is one of the most giving people you'll ever be around,"" Griffith said.""It's a labor of love,"" Crum said of his foundation. His biggest reward is receiving letters from kids saying how much they appreciate it.It's part of what he says is a most important lesson Crum learned from Wooden: ""Do something nice for someone every day,"" Crum said. ""I've tried to do that in my life.""Head men's basketball coach at the University of Louisville, 1971-2001. Lifetime win/loss record of 675—295, .696 winning percentage. Won two NCAA Basketball titles in 1980, 1986. Inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, 1994.Overcame: The challenge of coaching in his own way after working in the shadow of John Wooden.Lesson: Don't let pressure or outside expectations change your approach.""I had a lot of patience. A lot of people don't have that. And when you have a goal, I was pretty good at attaining it.""""You have to be willing to give 100% of your attention and your mind and your body. It's a combination of those things to attain whatever success you're going to have.""""Don't be afraid of failure; if you're afraid you're probably never going to have the kind of success that you could have. If you're afraid of failure, you're not going to be trying new things and you're not going to be willing to listen to anyone else.""""You learn life's lessons by listening and watching and seeing what other people are doing, both good and bad.""RELATED:Dean Smith, An NCAA Champion Coach With Integrity And PreparationBasketball's Jerry West Takes Talent To A Higher Level As An ExecJason Kidd Won An NBA Title As A Player, Now Guides As A Coach

212,UPS,"Lower Treasury yields Friday pressured most financials, including Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS) and American Express (AXP).But Visa (V), the second-best performer on the Dow industrials this year, rose to a fresh all-time high Friday. Its archrival Mastercard (MA) also reached record levels and its stock is still within buy range.The 10-year yield fell below 2.5% intraday, resuming their retreat following the Fed's rate hike on Wednesday, as policymakers did not signal faster tightening ahead.Rates on mortgages and the value of other types of credit are tied in with those yields. The yields also serve as a window into investors' expectations for higher prices in the future — potentially prompting the Fed to raise the benchmark interest rate, which, in turn, can help banks' finances as banks hike their own interest rates and other costs to compensate.Visa rose 0.2% to 90.21 in the stock market today, hitting a fresh all-time high of 90.63  intraday. The stock has been tailing upward since the beginning of the year, logging a 16% gain since Dec. 30.Mastercard climbed 0.1% to 112.83, wthin range of a 109.03 buy point of a flat base initially cleared in mid-January. Mastercard sold off at the end of the month, closing below its 50-day line on Feb. 1. But the stock rebounded, retaking its still-value 109.03 buy point and marching on to new highs.Visa has been gaining on a variety of factors. Among them: stronger consumer optimism, the acquisition of Visa Europe, and the potential in cross-border and electronic payments.Visa and Mastercard, while known for their credit cards, are not technically card issuers. They make money on transaction fees, and aren't directly affected by interest rate shifts. Issuing banks, such as JPMorgan Chase,  Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), actually carry the balances.IBD'S TAKE: Banks and financials have been among the biggest Trump plays this year, on hopes for a combination of fewer regulations and higher interest rates. Steel stocks, potential beneficiaries of Trump's plans for a massive infrastructure investment, are among the others. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.05%, Bank of America 1.4%, Citigroup 1.3% and Wells Fargo 1.1%.Goldman Sachs and fellow investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively, both closing just above their 50-day lines.The Dow's American Express, which does issue cards directly and carry the balances, trickled 0.65% lower. Capital One (COF), which also issues cards, fell 2.2%, undercutting its 50-day line.RELATED:Apple, Nike, Visa Among Dow's Top 5 Gainers So Far This YearDow Stock American Express Ups Ante In High-Fee, High-End Card Race

213,UPS,"Dow component American Express (AXP) on Thursday said it's giving Platinum Card holders $200 worth of Uber rides a year and five-times rewards points to eligible hotels — the latest round in fight for the high-end consumer.The new benefits — along with an annual fee hike to $550 from $450 — kick in on March 30.The offerings follow the huge demand seen for JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) own luxury-level card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which was launched in August with a $450 annual fee and drove up new card account originations by 35% in the third quarter.The Chase card, which gave members 100,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within three months, was so popular the company ran out of materials used to mint it, according to Bloomberg. The Sapphire Reserve offers three-times points on an assortment of travel and dining-related spending.Shares of American Express fell 2.2% to 80.10 on the stock market today. JPMorgan, which is also on the Dow, slipped 1.6%. Payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) dipped 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. (Visa also is a Dow component).American Express' five-times rewards announced Thursday — for eligible hotels booked through amextravel.com — come after the card issuer introduced similar rewards points for flight tickets booked with airlines or American Express Travel.Airlines have increasingly relied on a mixture of high-end and low-end fares and seating classes to fill seats and prop up unit revenue.The new Platinum benefits also provide automatic Uber VIP status when available, Amex said.Analysts, however, have expressed concern about rewards' programs impact on credit-card companies' finances, the Wall Street Journal noted.In January, American Express reported mixed fourth-quarter results, with Morgan Stanley attributing the weakness to more marketing and promo costs. But its full-year earnings-per-share guidance was solidly above estimates.The company has also suffered from the loss of its partnership with Costco (COST).Meanwhile, AmEx's latest attempt to draw a wealthier, discretionary-income-flush consumer comes at a delicate time for Uber.The ride-hailing service faced criticism over its response to the Trump administration's temporary immigration ban, a lawsuit alleging attempts to pilfer technology from Waymo, claims of sexual harassment within the company and a video in which CEO Travis Kalnick got into an argument with an Uber driver about fares that prompted an apology from the chief executive.RELATED:PayPal Q4 Earnings, Revenue In Line; Q1 Guidance Bit LightAmazon Sales, Outlook Weak; Visa, Amgen Beat; Chipotle Profit MissesMastercard Tops On Q4 Earnings, Revenue Just Misses

214,UPS,"Big Government: This week, IBM showed that it could cram data into a single atom, part of the private sector's never-ending quest to make things smaller and more efficient. If only government would follow this model.IBM Research announced on Wednesday that it was able to put a holmium atom — a rare earth element — on top of a magnesium oxide surface, and with ""a pulse of electric current from the magnetized tip of scanning tunneling microscope ... flip the orientation of the atom's field between a 0 or 1,"" according to the journal Nature, which published the findings.Right now, the device can store just two bits of data, and it has to be kept at a temperature close to absolute zero. But when this technology is inevitably scaled up and made commercially viable, it will drastically shrink storage sizes, since today it takes 100,000 atoms to store a single bit of data on a hard drive.IBM (IBM) figures that with this technology, a device the size of a credit card could hold all 32 million songs contained in the iTunes library.There's no telling when such devices would be commercialized, but what IBM's breakthrough tells us about the free market — and about government — is instructive.Scientific breakthroughs like this occur because the private sector relentlessly pushes for greater efficiency. In the case of computing technology, it's resulted in ""Moore's Law,"" named after Gordon Moore, who in 1965 noticed that the number of circuits that could be crammed onto an integrated circuit had been doubling every two years.The result is nothing short of remarkable. The pocket-size iPhone, for example, has more than 2.7 times the processing power of the 1985 Cray Supercomputer, which took up, according to the brochure published at the time, ""a mere 16 square feet of floor space.""This drive for efficiency occurs everywhere in a free-market economy — from warehouses manned by robots, to the way McDonald's prepares its food, to the state-of-the-art navigation systems UPS trucks use to minimize delivery times.But while the free market ceaselessly pushes things to get smaller and more efficient, the federal government continues to get bigger and less efficient.Between 1985 and today, for example, the size of the federal government doubled, even after accounting for inflation, at a time when the U.S. population has increased by 34%.That's just the spending side. Regulations have continued to pile up as well, without any concern about how they interact or overlap or reduce efficiency.The result of this endless government growth has been a slower-growing private economy. From 1960 to 1988, real GDP increased at an average rate of 3.6%. In the years since, it has increased at an average rate of 2.5%. Since the last recession, the average real growth in GDP was less than 2.1%.Can anyone honestly say that a bigger, more intrusive federal government has helped the economy, improved prosperity, or made things faster, better and more efficient?President Trump came into office promising to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington, D.C. A better goal would be for him to follow IBM's lead and try to shrink the swamp until it becomes atomic sized.RELATED:70% Of U.S. Spending Is Writing Checks To IndividualsWhy Government Spending Is An Obstacle To GrowthThe Democrats Want To 'Invest' Big In Big GovernmentTrump News & Tweets

That milestone is especially momentous for investors in mutual funds and exchange traded funds, most of whom have exposure to the index in their brokerage accounts or retirement portfolios.The venerable Dow, established in 1896, is the measure that springs to mind for most investors when reference is made to ""the market"" or its ups and downs.

219,UPS,"The high hopes for self-driving cars that Tesla (TSLA), Waymo-owner Alphabet (GOOGL), General Motors (GM) and others have offered over the years should come into clearer focus in 2018, when the real-world details of actually ushering in a new transportation revolution are worked out.X For example, some of the finer points of self-driving regulations, costs reductions and insurance are expected to emerge in the coming year.California has had self-driving regulations for a few years now, but the cars aren't really driverless. They have ""safety"" or ""backup"" drivers in the front seat, ready to take over the controls if needed. And they are restricted to testing scenarios, not public use.But in October, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles proposed updates to its regulations allowing companies to deploy autonomous vehicles on public roads without human drivers, even doing away with backup drivers. The rules could take effect by June.For the auto industry, a patchwork of self-driving regulations in 21 states is a hurdle to getting vehicles to consumers. They have pushed therefore for federal legislation, with the first national law for self-driving cars now in the works.But since California is the most populous state with the most cars in the country, it has often set the standard on regulations.In 2018, automakers should put in place the building blocks for bringing robocars to the masses.""It will be a pivotal 'test and learn' year to prepare for commitments"" they have made, Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of industry analysis, said on a media call Dec. 18.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates a GM Cruise self-driving test car, packed with up to 40 lidar, radar and camera sensors, may cost $250,000-$300,000, a prohibitive amount for many buyers.GM plans to slash lidar (or ""laser radar"") costs to $300 from $20,000 per car, helped by its acquisition of lidar tech firm Strobe. GM hasn't attached a time frame to that goal, but 2018 will be a crucial year for making progress if the company is to reach another goal of debuting self-driving cars for ride-sharing services in 2019.Meanwhile, car battery packs are also expensive and all those sensors and processors in self-driving systems are a big battery drain. GM seeks to reduce battery costs for its electric Bolt by almost a third in just three years. For its self-driving ride-sharing service, GM is intent on lowering the cost-per-mile to under $1 by 2025, down from the $2-$3 a mile that it says Uber and Lyft customers pay today.It sees that as a crucial level for profitable scale, with the potential to unlock a $750 billion ride-share market, more than 150 times the size of the current market.Waymo's self-driving vehicles are already being tested on public roads in the Phoenix metro area without anyone in the driver's seat, and the Alphabet unit plans to start a ride-hailing service with its fleet of driverless Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) Pacifica minivans soon, though it hasn't offered a firm timeline.GM will expand testing of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts to New York City early in 2018, paving the path for its promised robotaxi service. Also in the coming year, Ford (F) will begin testing new self-driving vehicle technology in an unnamed city, while moving its autonomous strategy team from Dearborn, Mich., to nearby Detroit to explore the needs of urban mobility. For its part, Ford is targeting ""high volume"" fully autonomous cars for ride-sharing services in 2021.The types of cities where testing expands will be critical to developing technologies that allow autonomous cars to operate safely in rough weather, congestion, and different levels of lighting. And that's just the more routine stuff.The cars also must detect bicyclists or pedestrians who share urban roads, as well as determine how to proceed when people break traffic laws, when traffic lights don't work, or when unexpected construction activity makes mapping software unreliable.Meanwhile, Tesla largely has eschewed self-driving alliances and acquisitions in favor of developing its Autopilot feature, which has some autonomous capabilities.Although the company has amassed a vast trove of data from Autopilot usage that could improve performance, Tesla is now seen at risk of falling behind other carmakers on rolling out full autonomy and will likely miss a promised cross-country trip by a fully self-driving Tesla by the end of 2017.Who takes the blame if a driverless vehicle crashes? The driver or the carmaker?When Allstate (ALL) CEO Tom Wilson was asked that question in an interview on Marketplace last month, he replied, ""In that case, it would be the manufacturer of the car.""Liability is likely to loom even larger as an issue in 2018, roiling consumers, automakers and technology companies, not to mention insurers such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) subsidiary Geico.That issue surfaced in California in 2017, with safety advocates seeking changes to proposed regulations on behalf of consumers. And an insurance startup said Dec. 19 that it will partner with Waymo to insure its riders for trip-related medical expenses and property damage.Eventually, autonomous cars are almost certain to make roads safer. This technology is one reason why the auto insurance sector will shrink by 71%, or roughly $137 billion, by 2050, with a lengthy and ""chaotic"" transition likely as the companies develop new business models, consulting firm KPMG said in June.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett agrees self-driving cars will be negative for auto insurers in the long term. If those vehicles prove to be safer than traditional cars, insurance costs will plummet, hurting Berkshire's Geico unit, he has warned.Daimler, the world's largest truck maker, intends to refine its ""platooning strategy"" for self-driving, connected trucks in 2018. The German giant already is testing its Freightliner Inspiration trucks for autonomous driving on public highways in Nevada, but has cautioned that ""much more development is needed,"" according to Trucks.com.The second half of 2018 will see a new entrant in this segment, as Deutsche Post DHL starts testing self-driving trucks, likely in Germany.Autonomous trucks could make delivery and logistics services more efficient, as well as address the persistent shortage of drivers. Waymo and Volvo, as well as Uber through its Otto acquisition, are also pursuing self-driving trucks.Tesla will also loom over trucks, as its Semi has seen a rush of preorders from shipping giants like J.B. Hunt (JBHT) and UPS (UPS) as well as companies with extensive logistical operations like Wal-Mart (WMT).MORE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?The New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles Or Ciscos?Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisAutomotive Industry News

220,UPS,"Estimates on Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 deliveries were slashed by a Wall Street analyst Wednesday, which followed conversations last week with salespeople at 18 Tesla stores nationwide.X KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson cut his estimates on Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter to 5,000 from 15,000. He also lowered his estimate on deliveries for the Model 3 in 2018 to 108,000 from 120,000.Tesla is expected to announce fourth-quarter Model 3 deliveries next week, as the maker of all-electric vehicles has struggled to get its Model 3 out the door, during what Musk has called ""production hell.""""We still forecast the company should ramp up to 350,000 Model 3 deliveries by 2020 but believe the curve toward that point is a bit steeper and thus more back-end-weighted,"" Erickson wrote in a research note to clients. ""While it is likely to be a few quarters before the company's true Model 3 gross margin judgment day arrives, we remain Sector Weight as we think the Model 3 margin ramp will disappoint.""Erickson also believes that deliveries of the Tesla Model S and X are tracking generally in line with management's expectations.As Tesla struggles with Model 3 production, Chief Executive Elon Musk in a tweet on Tuesday said a pickup truck is in the planning stages.""I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it,"" Musk wrote. He first revealed plans for a pickup truck in 2016.The Model Y is a crossover SUV built on the Model 3 platform that is reportedly in the more advanced stages of development. Tesla expects to launch the Model Y by late 2019 or in 2020.Tesla last month announced plans for a futuristic big-rig truck, called Semi, and a new Roadster sports car, at a time when the company is burning cash and is behind schedule for its Model 3.Adding the Tesla pickup to the Model Y, the Semi big-rig and new Roadster means that Tesla has more models planned than are being made.Tesla shares fell 1.8% to 311.64 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla undercut its 200-day line on Friday and its 50-day line on Tuesday. The stock has been showing a great deal of whipsaw action, as it tries to rebound from its recent lows and build the right side of a potential base.Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin. Production delays at Tesla are among the reasons a large amount of Tesla shares are sold short.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Tesla Receives Largest Order For Big-Rig Semi Truck From UPS5 Things To Watch For Tesla, GM, Ford Other Carmakers In 2018How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

221,UPS,"United Parcel Service (UPS) acquired a pharmacy license in Georgia in a move that could broaden its business into not only shipping but relabeling drugs, CNBC reported.XUPS confirmed the move, saying the license is tied to ""new and potential business engagements"" handled out of its Duluth, Ga., facility.It's not clear how strategically significant the move might be for UPS at a time when the company faces uncertainty as Amazon.com (AMZN), a major customer, tests its own final-mile delivery service, which could be a negative both for shipping rates and volume.Amazon also is mulling an incursion into the retail prescription-drug business, which also could entail a role in shipping drugs, challenging drug wholesalers like Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK).Investors didn't initially interpret the late-day UPS news as a threat to the drug wholesale group.

Chevron (CVX) was one of several oil and commodity stocks to moved past buy points. Bitcoin fell sharply as CME futures launched and more companies joined the blockchain craze. Micron Technology (MU), Red Hat (RHT), Nike (NKE), Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Winnebago (WGO) were notable earnings reports while economic data were generally upbeat.X The S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq set all-time bests on Monday ahead of Congress' approval of tax cuts on Wednesday, then moved sideways. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.3% for the week and the Dow 0.4%. Energy stocks, which could be big winners under the new 21% corporate tax rate, were leaders, with Chevron, Diamondback Energy (FANG) and several other oil plays to hit buy zones. There were several notable earnings reports as companies got ready for the post-Christmas week.Bitcoin futures from CME Group (CME), the world's biggest futures exchange, launched on Sunday with an opening trade at $20,650, but tumbled to just under $14,000 Friday, in sync with Cboe (CBOE) Bitcoin futures. Spot prices tumbled intraday below $11,000. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) was developing a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, with a possible debut in June, which would make it the first big bank to be a cryptocurrency market maker. And amid a growing market fixation on anything blockchain, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. vaulted a cool 183% Thursday after the iced-tea seller said it was rebranding itself as Long Blockchain (LTEA) to focus on ""the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.""Diamondback Energy (FANG) broke out in strong volume Wednesday, with Chevron (CVX), Concho Resources (CXO) among those clearing buy points on Thursday. BPBP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among those breaking out in less-impressive trade. Energy stocks are seen as big winners from the tax cuts, while crude prices are holding at two-year highs. U.S. crude inventories fell in the latest week but production hit yet another high. Saudi Arabia reportedly is looking at buying natural gas shale assets in Texas. Meanwhile, several mining stocks, including Vale (VALE) and Rio Tinto (RIO), also broke out.Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and guided much higher than views for the current quarter. Micron earned an adjusted $2.45 a share in the quarter ended Nov. 30, up nearly eight times the 32 cents reported in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 71% to $6.8 billion. Analysts expected Micron to earn $2.20 a share on sales of $6.39 billion. For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn an adjusted $2.58 a share on sales of $7 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling $1.95 and $6.08 billion. Shares rose 4%.Consumer spending and the housing market turned it up a notch in November as the economy fires on pretty much all cylinders. Third-quarter GDP growth was revised down a tick to 3.2%, still the best pace since the first quarter of 2015, as business investment extended its recent strength. Consumer spending rose 0.6% on the month, while wages rose 0.4%. Consumers saved just 2.9% of income in November, the weakest in a decade, which is probably a reflection of greater optimism in the economic outlook. Existing-home sales surged 5.6% to a 5.81 million annual pace, the best in 11 years, as the supply of homes for sale got even tighter. New-home sales skyrocketed 17.5%.Nike (NKE) reported a 5% sales drop in North America, its second straight quarterly decline. But the No. 1 sports brand comfortably topped expectations as Q2 profit fell 8% to 46 cents a share and revenue rose 5% to $8.55 billion vs. views for 39 cents EPS and $8.39 billion. China sales rose 15%. Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and Puma are creeping on Nike's tail, but a recent Cowen survey said Nike is still the top sports footwear present expected under Christmas trees this year. Shares fell 2.3% Friday.FedEx (FDX) easily beat Q2 forecasts, delivering 14% EPS growth to $3.18 while revenue grew 9% to $16.31 billion, and raised guidance to $12.70-$13.30 per diluted share for the year, up from prior outlook for $12-$12.80. FedEx Express revenue rose over 8%, Ground segment revenue grew 12%, and Freight sales rose 10%. Shares rose 4.15%. The report come as FedEx and UPS (UPS) are in peak holiday delivery season, having beefed up staffing to meet delivery goals. UPS has encountered some delays in getting packages to customers.Red Hat (RHT) reported Q3 profit that edged views while revenue, operating margin, and billings also topped estimates. The open source Linux software company is ramping revenue from new products — OpenShift and OpenStack — for hybrid cloud computing, analysts said. For the current quarter Red Hat estimated revenue in the range of $758 million to $763 million, above the consensus of $755 million. It projects adjusted earnings of 81 cents, topping the consensus estimate of 75 cents. Full-year revenue guidance was raised by $21 million at the midpoint to $2.906 billion. But shares sank 4.55%.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 73 cents, up 14%, while revenue rose 14.6% to $1.88 billion, both beating views. Same-restaurant sales rose 3.1% overall. Darden also raised its full-year guidance. Meanwhile, Jack in the Box (JACK) agreed to sell its Qdoba burrito chain to Apollo Global Management (APO), the latest private-equity buyout of a restaurant chain in 2017.RV icon Winnebago (WGO) on Wednesday trounced Q1 earnings views. Shares fell 4.6% Wednesday amid concerns about creeping costs in its motor home segment, but closed up 0.7% for the week. REV Group (REVG), which sells RVs along with an array of specialty vehicles missed quarterly estimates. But the recent IPO rebounded from a steep Wednesday morning loss soar 11% for the week, hitting record highs.Stitch Fix (SFIX) topped estimates in its first-ever earnings report. Analysts said they were impressed with the online tailor's performance, with revenue of $295.6 million, up 25%. Concerns were raised, however, about the Stitch Fix's declining gross margin amid heavy capital expenditures. The recent IPO fell 9.8% on Wednesday but rose 5.6% for the week.Accenture (ACN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations. The Dublin-based global tech consulting and services said it earned $1.79 a share, up 13%, with revenue rising 12% to  $9.5 billion.Biogen (BIIB) reported that a much-followed experimental Alzheimer's drug did not meet success criteria after 12 months in a Phase 2 trial. The study will continue to 18 months. Shares fell 3.3% on Thursday.Cintas (CTAS) saw earnings climb 14% to $1.31 in its fiscal second quarter. Revenue rose 24% to $1.61 billion. Both beat estimates. Cintas also raised full-year guidance.

226,UPS,"Traditionally, business owners have viewed competitors with a wary eye. That's changing, at least among young advisors.Financial planners in their 20s and early 30s who launch their own firm tend to recast potential rivals as supportive peers. Furthermore, they define the market for their services as an ever-expanding sea of prospects rather than a pond with a few fish.""I don't see other advisors as my competitors,"" said Ryan Frailich, 31, a financial planner in New Orleans, La. Growing up, he observed how his father, a stockbroker, operated in a cutthroat environment.""I wanted no part of that, where everyone is going after that client with $1 million to invest,"" Frailich said. ""I didn't want to be competing against people in the next cubicle, where we're all trying to hit certain targets.""Many millennials seek collaborative relationships with other advisors. Rather than hoard information, they often share best practices and refer clients to each other based on their respective skill sets.Young advisors looking to build their practice may seek out peer groups or other networking organizations that promote open communication and information sharing. Through regular meetings and online forums, they exchange marketing ideas, track regulatory news and discuss tech tools and vendors.Among the more popular peer groups for millennials is the XY Planning Network, with more than 350 advisors. Not only are its members mostly in their 20s and 30s, but they primarily serve clients in the same age bracket — many of whom are starting their careers and thus earn relatively modest incomes.Unlike advisors who earn a percentage of a client's account balance (such as 1%) for ongoing financial planning and investment management, XY Planning Network members charge a flat fee. They also gain access to resources to help them manage their business, from creating a user-friendly technology platform to compliance support.Scott Snider, a certified financial planner in Columbus, Ohio, has sought to charge clients on a fee-only basis for a long time. When Snider, 33, worked as an advisor at a commission-based financial services giant, he asked higher-ups, ""Can I charge a monthly retainer?""""They just laughed at me,"" he recalled. ""They were working with (the wealthiest) 5% of investors. Now that I'm on my own, I can work with a much broader population — an underserved market — using a monthly-retainer model. And as my clients advance in their careers, they can grow their assets into the (wealthiest) 5%.""Every week, Snider attends a meeting with other young advisors who are building their business. They compare notes on startup challenges such as managing compliance costs and raising visibility for their brand.""It has been invaluable,"" Snider said. ""We share ideas and growing pains. We're all there to help each other. Everybody feels there's enough business to go around.""One of the reasons that millennials cooperate so enthusiastically flows from their perception of the marketplace. By bypassing high-net-worth clients in favor of young professionals who might generate greater wealth as they age, these advisors can introduce fledgling investors to comprehensive financial planning.""My competition isn't necessarily other advisors, but rather the perceived lack of the need for financial planning services in the minds of my potential clients,"" said Steven Fox, 30, an advisor in San Diego, Calif. He adds that because most planners follow other business models and pursue different niches, he's willing to refer prospects that fall outside of his target market to other advisors.Unearthing a distinct niche can help millennial advisors stake out their position and defend against encroaching rivals. They may specialize in serving educators, military veterans or providers of professional services such as doctors or dentists. Some advisors get creative in finding a pool of prospects that others have overlooked.Take Noa Rodriguez-Hoffman. A certified financial planner in Los Angeles who launched her firm in early 2016, she targets lifestyle and fashion bloggers.Like Frailich, she doesn't view other advisors as competitive threats. But she sees life coaches ""who pass themselves off as financial advisors"" as competitors.""They may call themselves 'life counselors' and they're good at marketing and social media,"" said Rodriguez-Hoffman, 29. ""Some of them have a huge following. Due to regulatory rules, we don't have as much leeway to advertise ourselves the way they do.""To grow her practice, Rodriguez-Hoffman believes in reciprocity. An XY Planning Network member, she refers prospects to other advisors in the group with more knowledge of, say, taxes and estate planning.""And I get referrals from advisors who don't understand the financial life of bloggers and the relationship between bloggers and the agencies they work with,"" she said.RELATED: Advisors Adopt Strategies To Fend Off CompetitorsStay Ahead Of The Competition By Collecting Client Feedback

228,UPS,"At the heart of Donald Trump's foreign policy team lies a glaring contradiction. On the one hand, it is composed of men of experience, judgment and traditionalism. Meaning, they are all very much within the parameters of mainstream American internationalism as practiced since 1945. Practically every member of the team — the heads of State, Homeland Security, the CIA, and most especially Defense Secretary James Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster — could fit in a Cabinet put together by, say, Hillary Clinton.The commander in chief, on the other hand, is quite the opposite — inexperienced, untraditional, unbounded. His pronouncements on everything from the ""one China"" policy to the two-state (Arab-Israeli) solution, from NATO obsolescence to the ravages of free trade, continue to confound and, as we say today, disrupt.The obvious question is: Can this arrangement possibly work? The answer thus far, surprisingly, is: perhaps.The sample size is tiny but take, for example, the German excursion. Trump dispatched his grown-ups — Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — to various international confabs in Germany to reassure allies with the usual pieties about America's commitment to European security. They did drop a few hints to Trump's loud complaints about allied parasitism, in particular shirking their share of the defense burden.Within days, Germany announced a 20,000-man expansion of its military. Smaller European countries are likely to take note of the new setup. It's classic good-cop, bad-cop: The secretaries represent foreign policy continuity but their boss preaches America First. Message: Shape up.John Hannah of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies suggests that the push-pull effect might work on foes as well as friends. Last Saturday, China announced a cutoff of all coal imports from North Korea for the rest of 2017. Constituting more than one-third of all North Korean exports, this is a major blow to its economy.True, part of the reason could be Chinese ire at the brazen assassination of Kim Jong Un's half-brother, who had been under Chinese protection. Nonetheless, the boycott was declared just days after a provocative North Korean missile launch — and shortly into the term of a new American president who has shown that he can be erratic and quite disdainful of Chinese sensibilities.His wavering on the ""one China"" policy took Beijing by surprise. Trump also strongly denounced Chinese expansion in the South China Sea and conducted an ostentatious love-in with Japan's prime minister, something guaranteed to rankle the Chinese. Beijing's boycott of Pyongyang is many things, among them a nod to Washington.This suggests that the peculiar and discordant makeup of the U.S. national security team — traditionalist lieutenants, disruptive boss — might reproduce the old Nixonian ""Madman Theory."" That's when adversaries tread carefully because they suspect the U.S. president of being unpredictable, occasionally reckless and potentially crazy dangerous. Henry Kissinger, with Nixon's collaboration, tried more than once to exploit this perception to pressure adversaries.Trump's people have already shown a delicate touch in dealing with his bouts of loopiness. Trump has gone on for years about how we should have taken Iraq's oil for ourselves. Sunday in Baghdad, Mattis wryly backed off, telling his hosts that ""All of us in America have generally paid for our gas and oil all along, and I am sure we will continue to do so in the future.""Yet sometimes an off-center comment can have its uses. Take Trump's casual dismissal of a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution in the Middle East. The next day, U.S. policy was brought back in line by his own U.N. ambassador. But this diversion might prove salutary. It's a message to the Palestinians that their decades of rejectionism may not continue to pay off with an inexorable march toward statehood — that there may actually be a price to pay for making no concessions and simply waiting for the U.S. to deliver them a Palestinian state.To be sure, a two-track, two-policy, two-reality foreign policy is risky, unsettling and has the potential to go totally off the rails. This is not how you would draw it up in advance. It's unstable and confusing. But the experience of the first month suggests that, with prudence and luck, it can yield the occasional benefit — that the combination of radical rhetoric and conventional policy may induce better behavior both in friend and foe.Alas, there is also a worst-case scenario. It needs no elaboration. RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

230,UPS,"President Trump plans to shut down America's refugee program for four months to give officials time to implement stricter vetting procedures. When the program restarts, it will take in no more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal 2017 — fewer than half the number admitted in 2016.Though designed to safeguard Americans from terrorist attacks launched by refugees — such as the recent stabbing spree at Ohio State University and the truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin — the hiatus will boost citizens' economic security too. In recent years, federal officials have abused the refugee program, turning it into yet another avenue for employers to bring in lower-cost foreign workers who displace American employees.Such behavior is shameful. It's possible to help those fleeing war and oppression without kicking American workers to the curb.The Obama administration announced at the end of June that it was launching a ""Call to Action"" in partnership with major corporations to place refugees with employers in the United States.The administration then announced that all Syrian illegal aliens living in the country would receive Temporary Protected Status, a type of amnesty that awards work permits to the recipients and almost always ends up becoming a permanent situation.Numerous companies are poised to hire these foreign workers. Some of the firms have even laid off Americans, only to turn around and add refugees to their employment rolls.Over a dozen major companies — including Microsoft, Accenture, Google and Chobani — answered the past administration's call. The firms claim they're getting involved because of humanitarian motives.But their bottom lines are a key motive, too.Refugees are a source of cheap labor. The median income for refugee households is $8,000 less than the median for native-born American households. Forty-four percent of refugees qualify as ""low income,"" compared with just one-third of U.S.-born residents.Chobani, the Greek-yogurt giant,  opened a Twin Falls, Idaho, plant in 2012. The company has hired nearly 200 refugees — at a plant that now employs more than 1,000 people.With 300 refugees arriving in Twin Falls each year, there is a good chance they will displace more Americans. The company previously laid off over 40 employees in the midst of its refugee hiring binge. And the CEO has admitted that employing refugees helps to ""fuel business's bottom line.""Despite a slowly improving economy, 7.5 million Americans can't find jobs. Nearly two million of them have been searching without success for over six months.Admittedly, some refugees are in desperate need of help. There are nearly 7 million displaced people in Syria alone. An additional 5 million have fled the country. Many of them, especially those languishing in refugee camps, lack adequate food, medical services and access to education.Companies don't have to hurt Americans to help these people. For the cost of resettling one refugee in America, government agencies and private corporations could care for 12 refugees on-site in the Middle East, leaving them well-situated to return home when conditions there stabilize.Some firms are already providing aid in the region. HP has donated laptops to Syrian children living in refugee camps. UPS has delivered health kits and winter clothing. If they want to help solve the crisis, other companies could join them, instead of selfishly using the refugee program to boost their own profits.The Trump administration can keep its promise to protect Americans by restricting the resettlement program. Doing so will not only reduce the risk of terror attacks, but also prevent employers from using refugees as cheap labor.Editors' note: An earlier version of this story asserted Chobani, the Greek yogurt company, hired refugees instead of American workers due to a wage discrepancy. However, the author's contention could not be confirmed, and it has therefore been removed from the piece.

235,UPS,"General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Tesla (TSLA) face key milestones in 2018 as developments in electric and autonomous vehicles pick up, while overall car demand cools further.Here are some trends that analysts at Edmunds noted in a media call Monday:X The new year could be the greenest one yet for the auto market. The overall market share for green vehicles, which  include all-electric autos, plug-in hybrids and traditional hybrids, will reach 4.4% in 2018 vs. 3.2% in 2017, according to Edmunds.However, a lot will depend on Tesla meeting production goals for its Model 3 electric vehicle (EV). As it grapples with production bottlenecks, Tesla said in November it is now targeting production of 5,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of March, instead of by the end of this year.If production of the Model 3 is at full strength by May, it will unseat the Toyota (TM) Prius as the best-selling green car for the first time ever, Edmunds said.But even if Model 3 production doesn't hit its target until midsummer, 2018 will still be a banner year for green vehicles. ""The price of batteries is coming down, EV range is rising, and shoppers will have more choices than ever,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of industry analysis.However, the EV market will start to feel pressure once federal tax credits, which have propped up sales, start to wane. That is expected to happen toward the latter half of 2018.For Tesla, the phase-out of tax credits is anticipated to start in the second quarter, according to Edmunds. For GM, it's Q3. For Nissan (NSANY), it's after 2020.Although EV tax credits are on the way out, there may be a silver lining. It ""will give the first indication of how ready the segment is to stand on its own,"" Caldwell said.The rise in green car sales may be a critical brick on the road to self-driving cars. Automakers from GM to Ford and Fiat Chrysler have built their self-driving systems around electric or hybrid vehicles.Automakers have ambitious goals to launch self-driving cars for ride-sharing, as early as 2019. And a ""viable"" EV platform, in terms of battery costs and driving range, will be critical for automakers to meet those near-term timelines, Edmunds said.So ""2018 will be a year of right-sizing for the present, while putting some of the critical building blocks in place for the future,"" Caldwell said.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is a great place to start.Edmunds foresees a total of 16.8 million new cars, crossovers, SUVs and light trucks being sold next year, down from the expected 17.2 million new vehicles in 2017, which would be down from 17.55 million last year.""There's a lot for automakers to feel good about heading into 2018, but as sales decline the battle to retain market share is going to get intense,"" said Caldwell.Edmunds expects automakers to continue to scale back slow-selling passenger cars in favor of red-hot SUVs, especially smaller models. Passenger car sales will represent a record low 34.5% of the auto market in 2018. It was 50% in 2012.Automakers saw the ""days to turn"" — the average number of days vehicles sat in dealer lots before being sold — rise in 2017 to roughly 75, the highest level since the 2009 recession.""Demand is just not there,"" Caldwell said. ""It's a big sign saying we need to dial back how many cars we make.""While auto sales remain robust, they come as manufacturers flourish new car rebates and other incentives to lure buyers on the sidelines. Incentive spending crossed $3,000 in 2017 for the highest level going back to 2002.Those two trends, rising days to turn and rising incentive spend, are likely to accelerate, Edmunds said. Still, analysts there do not expect cutbacks in output and layoffs at auto factories to be drastic.RELATED:Tesla Receives Largest Order For Big-Rig Semi Truck from UPSTesla Leads Five Stocks To Watch At Intersection Of Cars And TechnologyAutomotive Industry News, Self-Driving Cars And Stocks To WatchWhy General Motors May Be The Real Deal Among 'Mobility' Companies

Volume swelled across the board vs. the same time Tuesday.Steel, bank and telecom-related plays were among the biggest gainers; software, department stores and gold miners lagged.Apple gapped up and soared nearly 6% in massive volume to its highest level since November 2015. Shares are now extended well past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point cleared on Jan. 6. The company reported fiscal Q1 results late Tuesday that beat forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, thanks to better-than-expected iPhone sales.

RBC Capital Markets raised its price target to 140 from 125, with an overweight rating.Among other Dow stock, Disney rose fractionally while Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) were each up more than 1%.

The stock is still technically in flat-base range with an 11% correction from the left high to low, but the high-volume gap-down below its 50-day and 200-day lines is bearish action. The package delivery giant's Q4 results missed estimates Tuesday and its full-year guidance disappointed.Private-sector employers added 246,000 jobs in January, ADP reported, well above economist forecasts for 168,000 and December's 153,000.

Abney said Q4's results indicate that UPS should ""quicken the pace"" of investments and network shifts to handle increasing e-commerce.Meanwhile, Amazon confirmed late Tuesday that it will builds its first air hub in Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio.Here are the results and outlook:Estimates: Earnings per share up 8% to $1.69. Revenue should increase 6% to $17.01 billion, which would mark the sixth straight quarter of glacially accelerating top-line growth.Results: Adjusted EPS of $1.63 as revenue climbed 5.5% to $16.93 billion. Domestic package revenue climbed 6.3% to $10.91 billion.Outlook: Fiscal 2017 EPS of $5.80-$6.10, below consensus views of $6.16.

242,UPS,"The major averages pared early gains Wednesday ahead of the Fed's policy statement, but Apple (AAPL) remained sharply higher.The Nasdaq held a 0.2% gain, the Dow Jones industrial average was flat and the S&P 500 fell 0.2%. Volume swelled across the board in the stock market today vs. the same time Tuesday.Commercial lenders, transportation equipment stocks and hospitals led the upside, while software, steel and department stores lagged.Apple gapped up and soared nearly 6% in massive volume to its highest level since November 2015. Shares are now extended well past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point cleared on Jan. 6. The company reported fiscal Q1 results late Tuesday that beat forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, thanks to better-than-expected iPhone sales. It sold 78.3 million iPhones, up 5% from last year and above views for 77 million. RBC Capital Markets raised its price target to 140 from 125, with an overweight rating.Among other blue chips, American Express (AXP), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) each held gains of around 1%.Facebook (FB) pared a 1.5% gain to 0.4% ahead of its Q4 results after the close. Shares remain in buy range from a 129.37 handle entry. Analysts expect the social network's earnings to jump 66% to $1.31 a share with revenue up 46% to $8.51 billion.United Parcel Service (UPS) sank 4% in heavy turnover, extending Tuesday's 7% drop. The stock is still technically in flat-base range with a 13% correction from the left high to low, but the high-volume gap down below its 50-day and 200-day lines is bearish action. The package delivery giant's Q4 results missed estimates Tuesday and its full-year guidance disappointed.On the IBD 50, Wabash National (WNC) surged 14% to its highest level in more than a decade after reporting mixed Q4 results Tuesday. EPS missed views by a penny, but revenue beat. Shares of the transportation equipment maker are more than 35% extended from a 14.82 buy point cleared in December.Nvidia (NVDA), up 3%, was also a big IBD 50 winner. Shares have been consolidating above the 50-day line for five weeks since peaking in late December. The correction from the left side high to the bottom is 17%, which puts the stock out of flat-base range. A cup base needs a minimum of seven weeks. Analysts expect the graphics chip designer to post a 60% jump in Q4 EPS on 50% higher sales when it reports later this month.In economic news, private-sector employers added 246,000 jobs in January, ADP reported, well above the consensus estimate for 168,000.

243,UPS,"Trucking logistics outfit XPO Logistics (XPO) was close to breaking out of a cup base Tuesday after the company offered an upbeat outlook on the rest of 2017 as well as 2018.Shares climbed 2.6% to close at 49.06 on the stock market today, closing in on a 49.96 buy point of a cup base begun in December.In an investor update filed Tuesday in relation to a conference presentation, XPO said it was ""on track"" to reach this year's and next year's targets for EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. XPO said it expects its adjusted EBITDA growth to outpace any of its rivals over that time.The company said that 63% of Fortune 100 companies did business with it. In the investor update, XPO also said it was the biggest ""outsourced e-fulfillment provider in Europe, and a significant e-commerce player in North America.""Before the cup-base formation, the stock cleared a consolidation in November and a double-bottom base in August. Buying XPO on pullbacks to its 50-day line, however, have been occasionally more effective than on traditional buy points.C.H. Robinson (CHRW), another player in the transportation logistics business, ticked up 0.3% to 77.20. That stock was close to breaking out of a flat base late last month. It has retreated since then and recovered somewhat.Transportation service provider YRC Worldwide (YRCW) slipped by 8 cents to 13.25, while Saia (SAIA) lost 2.5% to 47.60.RELATED:UPS Dives On Q4 Miss, Outlook; Amazon Plans Kentucky Air Hub

245,UPS,"Cancer biotech Incyte (INCY) topped Wall Street's Q4 sales expectations early Tuesday, despite a steep slide in profit amid rising costs and Jakafi sales that narrowly missed analyst expectations.In the stock market today, Incyte rebounded from premarket losses and rose 1.8% to 123.32, earlier touching a 16-month high of 125.49.For Q4, Incyte reported revenue of $326.5 million, up 34% from the year-earlier period, and earnings per share minus items of 5 cents, down 83%. Analyst consensus had called for $324.4 million and 13 cents.Sales of Jakafi, the company's main product, which is used to treat myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, a bone marrow disorder, rose 30% in Q4 to $237.5 million. RBC Capital analyst Simos Simeonidis says the consensus called for $238.3 million in Q4 Jakafi sales.Novartis (NVS) paid Incyte $33 million and $111 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively, to market the drug outside the U.S., as Jakavi.Iclusig, which wasn't being sold a year ago, brought in $12.87 million. Incyte sells Iclusig outside the U.S. in a deal with Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA). Japan's Takeda Pharmaceuticals last month announced an agreement to acquire Ariad for $5.2 billion.Incyte wrapped up 2016 with $1.1 billion in sales, up 47%, and EPS of 54 cents, up from 3 cents in 2015.For 2017, Incyte guided to $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion in Jakafi sales and $60 million to $65 million in Iclusig sales, which would be up 23% and 119% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Jakafi sales grew 42% in 2016.Incyte didn't provide Q1 or 2017 earnings or overall revenue guidance. Analysts have modeled $1.54 billion in 2017 sales, up 40%, and EPS ex items of $1.31.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte was expected to top Q4 expectations on a number of potential blockbusters. Head to The New America for a broad take on Incyte and why its stock might be work a look.Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the headline and clarify in the text that the company's sales guidance was for its Jakafi product only and that Incyte did not issue disappointing guidance for its overall revenue.  RELATED:I-O Players Incyte, Roche Squeeze Array's Melanoma Market: LeerinkWill Merck Let Incyte Go After AstraZeneca, Bristol, Roche Team-ups Too?Incyte Gets $112 Million Boost On Novartis Jakavi Royalties: RBC

246,UPS,"Here's a news flash for Democrats and other Americans on the left: Four years ago, when Barack Obama was re-elected president, conservatives were just as depressed as you are now that Hillary Clinton lost and Donald Trump won.I describe this as news because this undoubtedly surprises many of you. You probably never gave a moment's thought to how depressed conservatives were in 2012. (Why would you? Unlike you, we shun hysteria.) But believe me — we were.Many of us believed that President Obama was doing great damage to America. Now we are convinced that he did more damage to America domestically, to America's position the world and to the world at large than any other two-term president. He left office with racial tensions — many of which he exacerbated — greater than at any time since the civil rights era half a century ago. He left the world's worst regimes — Iran, China, Russia, North Korea and radical Islamist terror groups — stronger and more aggressive than before he became president. Economic growth never rose above 3%, a first for a two-term president. He nearly doubled the national debt and had little to nothing to show for it. ObamaCare hurt more people financially than it helped medically, including physicians. More people than ever are on government aid. The list is far longer than this.Moreover, just like most Democrats in 2016, most Republicans in 2012 expected to win.The depression among conservatives was palpable. To cite only my own experience, I turned the television off on election night. It was too painful to watch. Instead, I played hearts on the computer and listened to Strauss's ""Death and Transfiguration"" to lighten the mood.But why does the level of conservative despair four years ago come as a surprise to Americans on the left?First, unlike much of the left, most conservatives handle despair like mature adults. Most obviously, we didn't riot. In fact, in America, rioting — not to mention shutting down highways and airports, taking over college offices and protesting at peoples' homes — is a monopoly of the left.Nor did we allow our conservative children to take a day off from school to demonstrate.Nor did conservative teachers preach opposition to Obama in their classrooms.Nor did we print posters with the words ""Not My President.""Nor did conservative clergy declare fast days.The second reason is that we know you, but you don't know us.You read, listen to, watch, socialize with and study under leftists. Only if you are stuck with some immediate relatives who aren't on the left do you encounter a nonleftist (let alone a nonleftist idea). Therefore, there is no way you would know how painful it was for conservatives during that time. While liberals feel free to express their emotions and opinions to anyone, anywhere, any time, conservatives, especially those who voted for Trump, live like Marranos.The Marranos were Jews living in Spain or Portugal during the Spanish Inquisition in the 1400s who lived like Christians but secretly practiced Judaism. That is how most Trump voters have been forced to live. They live like most people and hide their identity as Trump voters, lest they lose their job, their business, their relatives, their friends and/or their good name.A gay professor writing in The Wall Street Journal recently echoed this analogy when he likened being in the closet as a Trump voter to being in the closet as a gay man when he was younger. He said:""I began having gay relationships at 25 but remained closeted. I hated lying to people, but in the 1980s and '90s I feared that coming out would estrange me from family and damage my career. Similarly, I now find creative ways to avoid answering whether I voted for Donald Trump. This may be hard for some to believe, but watching protesters today call Trump supporters racists and bigots has been nearly as distressing as being told to 'die in hell, (vulgarity)' 30 years ago. ... I am as afraid about acknowledging that I voted for Mr. Trump today as I was about being gay yesterday. There seems to be as little understanding of my political views as there was about my sexual orientation.""Finally, leftists lack self-awareness. They think they are the apotheosis of tolerance when in fact they are far less tolerant than most conservatives. They think they embody kindheartedness when in fact the further left you go, the greater the meanness. And they think they suffer uniquely when they lose a national election.Leftists' pain is not one whit greater than that of conservatives four years ago. But many of them can't handle pain nearly as well. If they could, they'd be grown-ups and no longer on the left.RELATED:Now We Know: Those 'Spontaneous' Anti-Trump Airport Protests Weren't Spontaneous At AllLeft-Wing Bigotry And Hatred Is On Full Display After Trump WinDennis Prager: America's Second Civil War

247,UPS,"Incyte (INCY) could pull in $4.8 billion in 2026 peak sales on its Merck (MRK) partnership alone, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter said Friday — and that's without noting collaborations with AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY).But those collaborations with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche don't target the substantial non-small cell lung cancer market, an opportunity that Richter pegs at $2.7 billion in 2026 peak sales. And whether Incyte goes that route will likely depend on whether Merck pushes for exclusivity, she says.Richter boosted her price target Friday on Incyte stock to 149 from 116, and kept her buy rating. In the stock market today, Incyte stock rose 0.9% to 121.72. Shares are up 21% for the year but are now extended from a 110.05 buy point out of a flat base first touched on Jan. 9.Incyte's epacadostat is an immune-oncology, or I-O, drug, as are Keytruda from Merck, Opdivo and Yervoy from Bristol-Myers, Tecentriq from Roche and durvalumab from AstraZeneca. These therapies target PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and IDO molecules, which act as ""brakes"" on the immune system, providing a negative signal to T cells.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte has a slew of potential blockbusters, and not all in the immune-oncology sector. Dive into The New America for a deeper analysis for more ""Incyte"" into those potential markets.Tumor cells apply the brakes to prevent their destruction by the immune system, Richter explained. I-O drugs remove the brake, allowing T cells to attack the tumor. Combinations of I-O drugs are thought to be more potent than combining I-O with chemo (though Merck is testing that too).""Based on encouraging early data from epacadostat in combinations with Keytruda, we view Incyte's IDO (inhibitor) as one of the leading 'add-ons' to PD-1/PD-L1,"" she wrote in a research report.Merck and Bristol-Myers are often seen as going head-to-head in the I-O space as their Keytruda and Opdivo both target PD-1 and are approved as monotherapies for melanoma, advanced lung cancer, and head and neck cancer. Both firms are also working on combos.This month, though, Merck announced an expanded collaboration with Incyte to test Keytruda and epacadostat in a total of five tumor types: first-line melanoma, advanced lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer and bladder cancer.Incyte's epacadostat is safe as a monotherapy, but only 29% of advanced melanoma patients in an earlier phase 1 trial could achieve a stable disease. In an earlier combo of epacadostat and Yervoy, 31% of patients hit an overall response rate. But toxicity also rose in the liver.""In our view, this result highlights the potential for I-O/I-O synergies with IDO, with a continued focus on finding the most effective I-O doublets as second generation immunotherapies continue to emerge,"" Richter said.She sees Incyte hitting $2.7 billion in 2026 peak sales in the NSCLC market alone. But that estimate could be conservative. Incyte could also team up with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche in NSCLC, pending the details of exclusivity with Merck.Outside its partnership with Merck, Incyte is already testing epacadostat with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche in treating other types of cancer.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth paragraph to correctly identify the Roche and AstraZeneca drugs.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O RivalryCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Biotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On These 4 Key Sectors In 2017

248,UPS,"Following reports that Facebook (FB) is scaling back its retail presence for Oculus Rift virtual-reality headsets, some analysts are saying prospects for the VR product are diminishing.Business Insider reported Wednesday that Facebook is closing about 200 of its 500 Oculus virtual-reality demo stations at Best Buy (BBY) stores in the U.S. It said the in-store pop-ups are being closed for poor performance. Some of the pop-ups often would go days without giving a single demonstration, BI said.""VR seems only to be popular at trade shows."" Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor said in a research report. ""After a very disappointing 2016, virtual reality looks set to have another disappointing year in 2017 while its proponents work out how to fix the issues that keep it from being a success.""VR headsets aren't cheap, and Facebook's $600 Oculus Rift requires a high-performance PC to run. Compelling content also has been lacking, Windsor said. Plus, some people experience nausea when watching VR videos.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is one of the FANG group of closely watched internet stocks, along with Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. Facebook stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 5 out of 54 stocks in IBD's Internet-Content industry group.

249,UPS,"The sell-off in Greek bonds amid the nation's dispute with its creditors passed another milestone, with the yield on its two-year notes rising above 10%.The notes fell for a third time this week as squabbles between Greece, euro-area creditors and the International Monetary Fund about debt sustainability stalled negotiations aimed at completing the second review of an 86 billion-euro ($92 billion) bailout program. While euro-area finance ministry officials are set to discuss Greece when they meet in Brussels later Thursday, an immediate breakthrough seemed unlikely.The impasse is the latest in a saga that has buffeted the nation's securities since the euro-region's debt crisis that began in Greece in 2009. Flare-ups in its debt talks have previously shown the potential to spill over into other European markets, increasing the focus on Greek bonds even though they trade with thin volumes and tend to have a niche investor base. The difference between bid and ask yields on the 2019 notes, a measure of market liquidity, is about 50 basis points, compared with 0.4 basis point for benchmark German 10-year debt.The volatility ""has no reason to decline until we get an agreement on the ongoing program review,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, a senior economist at Banque Pictet & Cie in Geneva. ""The recent rhetoric suggests it may take time.""The yield on notes due in April 2019 rose as much as 70 basis points to 10.06% as of 2:41 p.m. in Athens, crossing 10% for the first time since September. The bond was sold in 2014, marking Greece's return from market exile. An index of local stocks slid more than 1%, set for the lowest close since November.The increase in yields has coincided with a step-up in hard-line rhetoric from euro area lawmakers this week. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told broadcaster ARD on Wednesday that Greece would need to leave the euro area if it wants to get its debt restructured, while Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said that the Netherlands won't maintain participation in a bailout if the International Monetary Fund withdraws its support.Despite the increase in yields, there are no signs of panic that the nation will be unable to meet its obligations. The bond maturing in July 2017 was trading at 95.6 cents on the euro, compared with just 42.78% two years ago, when failed negotiations with creditors led to a referendum that threatened Greece's position in the euro area. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bonds rose a milder 11 basis points to 7.84%.
"
250,UPS,"Executives from Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), JetBlue (JBLU), Southwest (LUV) and others met with President Trump at the White House on Thursday.As the meeting began, Trump said he would work to cut ""burdensome regulations"" in their industry and said the current air-traffic control system is obsolete. The president also said he would have an announcement related to taxes in the next few weeks.Gulf-carrier competition, which for years has been a major sore point for the U.S. network carriers, was not discussed, apparently, despite widespread expectations it would be high on Thursday's agenda.When asked by CNBC after the meeting if the subject came up, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the focus of the meeting was ""solely"" on taxes, regulations and the need for infrastructure investments.However, Trump did allude to looming competition from abroad during introductory remarks at the meeting.""I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers — I've been hearing that a little bit,"" he said. ""At the same time, we want to make life good for them also. They come with big investments. In many cases, those investments are made by their governments.""Trump's executive order suspending immigration and refugees from seven largely Muslim nations deemed a security risk was not on the agenda, Bloomberg said. Airline stocks sank after that order was signed, on Jan. 27, amid concerns that it would hurt travel demand. Late Thursday, a U.S. appeals court upheld a lower court's suspension of the ban.Executives from Alaska Air Group (ALK), FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) were also set to attend, Bloomberg said. American Airlines' (AAL) CEO, Doug Parker, did not attend due to an already-scheduled management conference taking place.Delta shares were up 2.6% on the stock market today, while American rose 2.75% and United advanced 1.8%. JetBlue added 3.5%, Southwest rose 3% and Alaska Air rallied 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Norwegian Air International is an Irish subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, whose low-cost trans-Atlantic flights already pose more competition to Delta, American and United. The big three are trying a variety of cheap and expensive seats to compete. Following the meeting, statements from the airlines also notably left out any mention of the Gulf carriers.JetBlue: ""Today we had an extremely encouraging conversation with the president about modernizing our air traffic control system to reduce frustrating flight delays and further improve aviation safety. Everyone agreed we need an infrastructure plan that will once again give the American public an aviation system we can be proud of.""United: ""We share the President's passion for the tremendous opportunity this country has and his commitment to protecting and creating American jobs. We look forward to working together with the President on the many initiatives and issues that will make America better and the U.S. aviation industry the best in the world. This includes modernizing our aviation infrastructure and cutting the red tape that gets in the way of our industry's ability to deliver the best experience for our employees and customers.""Delta: ""We had a positive discussion about many of the major issues facing U.S. travelers, airline employees and the aviation industry, which is a vital economic engine for America.""The big three U.S. airlines have repeatedly complained that three Persian Gulf-region carriers — Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad — benefit from government subsidies that give them more room to expand and compete in the U.S. The Gulf carriers, in turn, have repeatedly denied that claim.The subsidies, the U.S. airlines say, violate the Open Skies agreements that facilitate cross-border service.""If left unchecked we will continue to see the Gulf carriers expand in the U.S. market, causing further harm to hard working Americans,"" CEOs from Delta, American and United said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. ""In fact, for every long-haul route lost or foregone as a result of subsidized Gulf carrier competition, more than 1,500 American jobs are lost.""But a battle could be heating up over those agreements. CEOs of JetBlue, Hawaiian Holdings' (HA) Hawaiian Airlines, FedEx Express and Atlas Air (AAWW), in a letter dated Tuesday, urged Tillerson to reject the big three's demands to clamp down U.S. access to the Gulf carriers. Their letter, which expressed support for maintaining global Open Skies arrangements, said those demands ""would jeopardize Open Skies and reduce competition in an already overly concentrated U.S. airline market.""U.S. carriers also argue that Norwegian Air International's recently approved service to the U.S. would allow the carrier to dodge labor and safety rules, Bloomberg said.Trump also said he wanted travelers ""to have the greatest customer service with an absolute minimum of delays, and with the greatest convenience all at the lowest possible cost.""Those remarks follow the bruising that airline stocks took for much of last year and 2015 after airlines dropped fare prices in some markets to lure passengers. That competition damaged unit revenue, an important industry metric that gauges how much money an airline makes compared to its supply of seats and flights.Meanwhile, American Airlines said earlier Thursday that passenger traffic for January fell 0.3%, while carrying capacity rose 1.2%. American backed its first-quarter forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% increase in unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5%.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticJetBlue Trims Capacity, Delta Upgraded, Ryanair Warns On EuropeAlaska Air Beats Q4 Forecasts; Trump, Carriers To MeetAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back Up

"
252,UPS,"Media Bias: In the span of a few days, two major news outlets came out with huge Trump/Russia bombshells that blew up in their own faces. In both cases, the error involved getting something as simple as a date wrong.CNN was in a frenzy on Friday over an apparent scoop by reporter Manu Raju, who claimed that an email sent to President Trump, Donald Trump Jr, and others on the campaign — and dated Sept. 4, 2016 — offered Trump access to purloined WikiLeaks documents.The story, posted on CNN's website at 8 a.m. and carried the headline: ""Exclusive: Email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents,"" claimed that the email had been ""described to CNN by multiple sources and verified by Trump Jr.'s attorney.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveA later update to the story also noted that Sept. 4 was also the day that Trump Jr first tweeted about WikiLeaks and Clinton.Raju noted that the ""timeline is important here,"" because the date on the email was more than a week before WikiLeaks posted these documents on its website.It looked like a genuine smoking gun — showing how Trump was colluding with WikiLeaks to spread documents hacked by Russia — and spread like wildfire across social media and on other news outlets.Except the story was completely bogus.Unlike CNN, the Washington Post obtained an actual copy of the email, and found that it wasn't sent on the Sept. 4th. It was sent on Sept. 14th — after WikiLeaks had posted the documents online and promoted that fact to the world.In other words, there was no story here whatsoever.One week before CNN committed journalistic malpractice, ABC News's Brian Ross announced to the world that ""Michael Flynn promised 'full cooperation to the Mueller team' and is prepared to testify that as a candidate, Donald Trump 'directed him to make contact with the Russians.' ""That story, too, looked like a smoking gun. It would show that Trump was in fact working with Russians prior to the election. In fact, the news was so shocking it sent the stock market reeling.But it, too, was false. The meetings in question all took place after Trump had won the election. In other words, they had nothing whatsoever to do with collusion or election meddling.These aren't the first or by any means the only examples of reporters rushing out some ""bombshell"" story, only to later admit they got key facts wrong. We noted several in this space a few weeks ago.Reuters and Bloomberg also botched a Trump story last week, when they reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed Trump's Deutsche Bank records. He hadn't.Even the liberal-leaning Politico noted that CNN's disaster ""extends (the) run of journalistic mishaps.""This sort of blatant journalistic malpractice, which seems to be getting more egregious the longer Trump is in office, is bad enough.Worse has been the reaction of fellow journalists, who instead of demanding higher standards from their peers, are busy making excuses, downplaying the importance of the screw-ups, or using these foul-ups as a way to attack Trump.Consider that in response to Raju's reporting fiasco, CNN said the network had ""followed the editorial standards process. Multiple sources provided him with incorrect info.""X So CNN's ""editorial standards process"" allows reporters to run Trump-bashing stories based entirely on a document it didn't have in hand, but that the Washington Post was able to obtain the same day? How reassuring.After Ross' epic error, ABC News initially issued a mild ""clarification"" to the story, and rather than firing him, it suspended Ross for all of a month.Meanwhile, other reporters, rather than using these failures to take stock of the impact that their raging anti-Trump bias is having on the credibility of their profession, circled the wagons.USA Today commentary editor Jill Lawrence, for example, decided to twist the episodes into an attack on Trump for his ""hypocrisy,"" because Trump has attacked the media for false reporting even though he has said things media have labeled as ""lies.""Lawrence even laughably — and lamentably — claims that Trump's ""attacks, falsehoods and secrecy are inspiring great journalism."" She goes on to say that ""The profession I love is going to emerge from the Trump era stronger than ever.""And they say Trump is delusional?New York magazine's Benjamin Hart suggested that only real problem with CNN's ""incorrect"" report was that it ""provides fuel for pro-Trump media.""It was up to independent journalist Glenn Greenwald to offer the correct analysis of the problem. In an article headlined: ""The U.S. Media Suffered Its Most Humiliating Debacle in Ages and Now Refuses All Transparency Over What Happened,"" Greenwald says that until the mainstream press gets its act together, ""their cries and protests the next time they're attacked as 'Fake News' should fall on deaf ears, since the real author of those attacks — the reason those attacks resonate — is themselves and their own conduct.""Amen to that.RELATED:Do The Media Hate Trump?

253,UPS,"Even as Brexit talks lurch from one hurdle to another, the pound is enjoying a rising wave of confidence among investors and analysts.Aberdeen Standard Investments recently added to sterling long positions, betting it will rally in 2018 as Britain and the European Union make better progress in their negotiations than the market expects. The currency will also benefit from the prospect of interest-rate increases by the Bank of England, according to the U.K. firm and JPMorgan Asset Management. Strategists at SEB AB recommend buying the pound while those at Nomura International see room for gains next year.Option-market sentiment on sterling is now the most bullish in two months and it is one of this quarter's top performers among major currencies against both the dollar and euro. Concessions made by Britain last week on the contentious Brexit bill suggests the likelihood of further ""U.K. capitulation"" on other topics, allowing a transitional deal and giving the BOE a green light to raise rates, according to Nomura strategists, including Jordan Rochester.""There is too much pessimism about the path of the U.K. economy,"" said James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard, which oversees a total of 670 billion pounds ($899 billion) in assets worldwide. ""There's too much pessimism on the negotiations and the future relations with the EU, and I think BOE interest rates will be higher by the end of 2018. I am still long sterling and I've added to that position recently.""The pound slipped 0.4% to $1.3425 as of 10:10 a.m. in London on Tuesday, after the U.K. and the EU failed to get a much-hoped-for breakthrough on Brexit with the issue of an Irish border derailing a tentative deal. Against the euro, sterling was 0.4% weaker at 88.33 pence. Still, three-month risk reversals in the British currency against the dollar, a measure of the appetite for bullish options relative to bearish ones, traded near the highest since Oct. 5 reached on Tuesday.The increased sterling optimism is also evident from Bloomberg currency surveys. About a fourth of the predictions see the pound rising to $1.40, a level not since the Brexit referendum, in the coming year. A year ago, there were no forecasts for that level to be met in 2017.Aberdeen Standard's Athey prefers to express pound optimism against the euro rather than the dollar, saying that there has been ""far too much exuberance"" in Europe's shared currency. He sees sterling strengthening almost 10% to 80 pence per euro ""over the medium term.""Selling the euro against the pound with a target of 80 pence is among the top 2018 trade recommendations from SEB strategists, including Richard Falkenhall. Nomura is ""still short euro-sterling, looking for 0.87 and pound-dollar to break its September highs and approach $1.40 in the new year,"" strategists at the bank wrote in a client note dated Nov. 28.Aberdeen Standard's Athey and Nicholas Gartside, chief investment officer for fixed income at JPMorgan Asset, see room for the BOE to raise its benchmark rate twice next year, compared with current money-market pricing for a single 25-basis-point increase by November 2018.While uncertainties around the U.K.'s exit from the EU still linger, the fact that the pound is set to end the year stronger shows markets are becoming less sensitive to the ups and downs of the protracted Brexit process, according to Gartside. With a little more clarity on Brexit and a likely transition deal, there was ""no reason"" for the pound not to climb toward $1.40 next year, he said in an interview.""A no deal exit"" would be ""accompanied by substantial wealth losses in both the U.K. and EU,"" SEB analysts wrote in a client note last week. ""Given the size of the risk premium, a breakthrough in negotiations would most likely trigger a substantial sterling recovery in 2018. Partly, this may even happen in December if exit talks progress sufficiently to open up negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and U.K.""

254,UPS,"United Parcel Service (UPS) is showing it can make money from the surge in online shopping, just in time for the crucial holiday season.XRevenue for each package in the U.S. climbed 2% in the third quarter, the courier said Thursday as it reported earnings. That more than doubled the increase of a year earlier, before the world's largest package-delivery company implemented higher prices and new fees on over-sized items.The sales gain for each parcel is bolstering results as UPS seeks to reap the rewards of stepped-up investments in automated warehouses, new jets and upgraded technology. The year-end shopping rush will test the company's efforts to improve the efficiency of home deliveries, which are booming because of e-commerce — but are far less profitable than shipments to businesses.The ""result was impressive, particularly considering weather-related/natural disaster disruptions in the U.S.,"" Benjamin Hartford, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a note. ""International segment results remain outstanding.""UPS shares fell to 117 early, then rebounded off their 50-day moving average to climb 0.7% to 119.33 on the stock market today. Shares are in buy range from a 115.44 buy point decisively cleared on Sept. 11. FedEx (FDX) shares rose 1.55%, also still in buy range.UPS's earnings excluding certain items rose to $1.45 a share, matching the average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the third quarter climbed 7% to $16 billion, topping the consensus forecast for $15.6 billion.The company said it would earn $5.85 to $6.10 a share this year, a nickel higher at the low end compared with the previous forecast.Drivers at UPS typically deliver only 1.1 packages to a household, compared with more than three to a business. While the company is investing heavily in automating its package-sorting facilities to make them more profitable, the added spending is expected to pressure operating profit by $200 million in the next few years.This summer, UPS announced it will charge most users of its residential ground network a peak-season fee of 27 cents a package during certain weeks in November and December, a first for the Atlanta-based company. That's persuading some customers to ship during weeks that aren't subject to the fee, although not all packages can be shifted, said Kate Gutmann, chief sales and solutions officer.""It's helping to steer where possible,"" she said.Customers are expected to send more packages during less busy periods to avoid the surcharges, UPS said on a conference call with investors and analysts.The question now is whether UPS can replicate its smooth holiday period of 2016, said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at Seaport Global Securities. In previous years, it underestimated demand for last-minute deliveries and failed to drop off packages by Christmas, or overestimated demand and wound up with idle workers and facilities.This year, UPS projected global holiday demand for 750 million packages. Deliveries between Black Friday and New Year's Eve will rise 5% from a year earlier, the company said.""UPS is a show-me story of how they handle fourth quarter and peak season,"" Sterling said.

256,UPS,"November has been a month of merger talk. Chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL) agreed to buy rival Cavium (CAVM) Monday for roughly $6 billion. Broadcom (AVGO) has tried to acquire fellow wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM) for $130 billion, which would make it the largest tech takeover ever. Hasbro (HAS) has bid for rival toy maker Mattel (MAT). The media and telecom industries are basically in a speed-dating frenzy, with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) reportedly attracting many suitors for key assets.XWhy now? No one unifying catalyst appears to be behind the chatter or loosening the taps to facilitate the flow of deals. And M&A is on track to reach its lowest point in seven years.Still, while every company and industry has its own problems, cash, broadly, has not been not one of them.Companies across the S&P 500 Industrials — S&P 500 index members excluding financial, utilities and transportation companies — were sitting on a record $1.5 trillion in cash or cash equivalents in the second quarter. That cash hoard likely hit another all-time high in the third quarter, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.""All the tools are there for M&A. The tools are there, the ability is there, the economy continues on,"" he said, adding: ""And every company has a list of other ones that they want to buy.""A mountain of cash also makes a company more attractive to investor holding groups, he said.But as GOP tax reform makes its way through Congress, nothing in the legislation pointed directly to a more M&A-friendly environment, he said. Despite the reports of corporate courtship, the numbers also don't exactly show any dramatic uptick in merger activity from years and quarters past.The tally of announced deals in the U.S. this year is on track to be at around 16,000. That would be the lowest since 2010, Richard Peterson, a principal analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, notes.Peterson said that buyers might be worried about stretched valuations. He added that foreign purchases of U.S. businesses have slowed, and that souring sentiment on weaker industries like retail and automobiles could be making big private-equity deals look less attractive.""With robust deal activity in recent years, buyers may be may finding it's taking longer to assimilate acquisitions into operations,"" he added.So far this year, some $1.2 trillion in deals have been announced, potentially down from around $1.65 trillion last year and nearly $2 trillion in 2015, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The total value of deals announced so far this quarter was at $287.5 billion, well below the roughly $521 billion announced during the quarter a year ago. Deals announced in the third quarter of this year amounted to $322.5 billion.And amid an economic recovery that, for many over recent years, has still like a recession, big companies have tried to snap up smaller ones because there have been fewer avenues to grow sales to Wall Street's liking.Consider the striking contrast between deals struck before the financial crisis and after. Since 2010, companies announced more than 140,000 deals, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. From 2000 to 2007, in the run-up to the financial crisis, there were around 77,000.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Some of the merger talks have also come in industries that have faced technological upheaval in recent years.Comcast (CMCSA), Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ), have set their sights on 21st Century Fox in one way or another, while AT&T has struggled to win approval for its planned acquisition of Time Warner (TWX). The FCC has voted to ease rules surrounding media ownership, potentially making future tie-ups easier. But the cable industry is also dealing with cord-cutting. Questions remain about whether Disney can throw enough ""Star Wars"" movies and streaming content at analysts to keep them from fretting over ESPN.Meanwhile, Marvell's chip business has struggled. Apple (AAPL) may or may not keep putting Qualcomm chips in its iPhones, and the two companies have been tangled up in a patent dispute. Meanwhile, Hasbro snagged Mattel's license for Disney (DIS) toys last year, while Mattel suspended its dividend in October.At least if more companies decide to continue to get together, the cash will be there.""It all makes the stakes higher,"" Silverblatt said. ""If everybody has money, that means more people can get into the game.""Marvell jumped 6.4% in the stock market today, while Cavium leapt 10.8%. Broadcom rose 1.1%; Qualcomm fell 0.4%.RELATED:Disney Vows To Launch Netflix Rival 'Aggressively'Comcast, Verizon Reportedly Eyeing 21st Century Fox AssetsStocks Up; 4 Reasons Why Apple Rally Has Room To Run

257,UPS,"Before you travel a long way, you make a checklist of what to do. You pack clothes. Ask your neighbor to collect your mail. Lock all the doors. Then finally you go. By checking everything off your ""to do"" list, you eliminate many unnecessary bumps along the way.XAdopt a similar mindset when you prepare an ""investing trip"" with a growth stock.With IBD's research tools, you can quickly build a watch list of potential market stars. But your work doesn't end there. To raise the probability of notching a 20% winner here and a 200% screamer there, you need to devote time to identifying those stocks that already show signs of strength.A price base serves at least two vital functions. One, it marks the beginning of a resting phase for a stock that has already moved sharply higher. This rest period can last as little as four weeks or as long as 65 weeks or even longer. The base gives big investors a chance to pick up shares as others unload their shares to cash in gains.Once the herd of desperate sellers has dispersed, a new crowd of hungry buyers sends the stock catapulting to a new advance.Whether you're a brand-new IBD reader or a veteran CAN SLIM stock hunter, you can always benefit from this checklist to help you sort among your stock candidates and increase your profit potential.Look for weeks in which shares rose in heavy volume. On a daily chart, gap-ups in strong volume are a plus. A cup should in most cases show a decline of no more than 33% to 35%. Flat bases and square boxes have a dip of less than 15%.Amgen (AMGN) passed this checklist in the early 1990s. From March 1987 through part of 1989, the young biotech's stock moved like a sitting duck. But from August 1989, the stock ramped up 61% from 37.50 to 60.25 (before a 2-for-1 split in August 1990).It faded in November, starting a 16-week double-bottom base. It fell 29% from the base's high to low. So far, so good.Amgen rallied past its 55.60 buy point (pre-split) in February (1), then formed a handle. The handle wasn't perfect, but volume was dry as sand. The stock also held up near its high. The time to buy: when Amgen eclipsed the handle's high of 59.50 the week ended March 16, 1990 (2). It boasted a 94 EPS Rating and an 89 RS.The stock gained 113% by year's end.(A version of this column originally ran in the Nov. 16, 2010, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Can You Spot Major Market Peaks?

260,UPS,"AstraZeneca (AZN) execs remained confident Thursday on immuno-oncology combinations despite Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) decision in January against seeking accelerated approval for a rival combo from the Food and Drug Administration.But Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez was less enthused on AstraZeneca's Q4 and 2016, and 2017 guidance — all hinging on a year-over-year increase in externalization revenue and other operating income. Plus, AstraZeneca needs to restructure SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative expenses), Fernandez said Friday.On its face, AstraZeneca smashed Wall Street's Q4 and 2016 expectations. For Q4, the firm printed $5.86 billion in sales and $1.21 core earnings per share, topping the consensus for $5.43 billion and 59 cents. Though sales fell 13% vs. last year, EPS grew 29%.For 2016, AstraZeneca reported $23 billion in sales, down 7%, but edging views for $22.9 billion. Core EPS came in at $4.31, up 1%, and more than doubling the consensus view of $2.09.But in Q4 and 2016, product sales declined 15% and 10%, respectively. Externalization revenue grew a respective 58% and 69% on a year-over-year basis. Other operating income was up 10% in 2016. Guidance for 2017 depends on increases in those metrics, Fernandez said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech Incyte is often referred to as a ""throwback"" to what biotech companies ought to be doing. And its stock price has reflected that over recent months. Dive into The New America for a deeper look into Incyte and its blockbuster potentials.AstraZeneca guided to low to mid single-digit declines in sales and core EPS for 2017. To stave off some of those declines, the sum of externalization revenue and other operating income is expected to be ahead of 2016, the company said.In 2017, AstraZeneca has a slew of trials slated to unveil data. Key among those is the Mystic trial, which looks at durvalumab and tremelimumab in first-line non-small lung cancer. Progression-free survival (PFS) data is due in mid-2017.Mystic is expected to be a key indicator of Bristol's Checkpoint-227 trial. Both trials are examining I-O combinations that target PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints in advanced lung cancer. But in January, BMS decided against seeking accelerated approval for its I-O combo in lung cancer.Still, AstraZeneca isn't concerned, Chief Medical Officer Sean Bohen said on the Q4 earnings conference call early Thursday. AstraZeneca assumed from the beginning that accelerated approval wouldn't work for an I-O combo based on the high bar already set by the standard of care (chemotherapy).""The BMS announcement — part of what you're asking is what did BMS see. I don't know any more than you do about what BMS saw,"" Bohen told an analyst on the call. ""It was our assumption that, that accelerated approval path wouldn't work.""AstraZeneca ended trading up 1.3% to 27.92 on the stock market today.

262,UPS,"Merck (MRK) stock popped Thursday on in-line Q4 and 2016 metrics, but U.S. Keytruda sales included $40 million in deferred revenue and, without that, would have lagged Wall Street's targets, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum said.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Merck stock finished the session up 3.4% to 64.18, after the company wrapped its Q4 conference call with analysts. Shares are currently building a flat base with an entry point at 65.56.For Q4, Merck reported $10.12 billion in sales and 89 cents earnings per share minus items, down 1% and 4.3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales were below analyst's views for $10.22 billion and EPS met.Merck wrapped 2016 with $39.8 billion in sales and $3.78 EPS ex items. Sales closed in on analysts' expectations for $39.9 billion, and EPS topped by a penny. On a year-over-year basis, sales grew 1% and EPS was up 5.6%.IBD'S TAKE: CEOs of Merck, Lilly, Celgene, Novartis and others met with President Trump on Tuesday. Trump pledged to cut taxes and deregulate the drug industry, but also called for firms to manufacture in the U.S. Get the deep dive.The company also provided in line guidance with $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion in sales and $3.72 to $3.87 EPS minus items bracketing consensus expectations. The guidance includes royalty payments to Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and assumes the FDA approves expansions in Keytruda's label.Keytruda, Merck's immuno-oncology drug, is being evaluated by the FDA in combination with Eli Lilly's Alimta chemotherapy as a treatment for first-line non-small cell lung cancer. There, it competes with Bristol, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY).""Merck said they expect uptake to be relatively rapid once the combination is in Keytruda's label,"" Schoenebaum wrote in a research report. The uptake will start with healthier patients who can tolerate the added toxicity in the combo, but then move to all patients, Merck said.""Management did highlight several times that they expect the first-line market to become fragmented and personalized and that no single combination would ultimately dominate the market,"" he wrote.In Q4, Keytruda brought in $483 million in sales, up 125% vs. a year earlier, but missing the consensus for $508.8 million. U.S. sales actually missed at $311 million because that included $40 million in one-time deferred revenues. Without that, U.S. Keytruda sales would have missed by 8%.RELATED:Roche CEO Shrugs Off Trump's Drug Stance; 2016 Sales Narrowly MissLilly Hijacks J&J Diabetes Share In Q4; Trump Rattled Sector DipsWill Merck Let Incyte Go After AstraZeneca, Bristol, Roche Team-Ups Too?

""I have no doubt whatsoever that there will be continued demand for such solutions, and particularly the U.S., I'm convinced, will reward this kind of innovation.""The U.S. market is important to Roche. In 2016, nearly half of Roche's pharmaceutical sales — 47% — stemmed from the U.S., and 26% of its diagnostics tools were sold in North America. But on Tuesday, Trump reaffirmed his pledge to go after rising drug prices.""We have to get lower prices,"" he told a slew of pharma bigwigs, including the CEOs of Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Novartis (NVS). A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) executive also was reportedly in attendance. There, President Trump promised to deregulate the drug industry and cut taxes.Trump also abandoned his proposal to revisit the idea of allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid, which cover millions of Americans and are among the largest purchasers of drugs and health care services in the world.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary momentarily boosted drug stocks on Tuesday, but a day earlier the president's ban on immigration took a bite out of airline stocks.

J&J's hep C sales dipped to ""virtually nothing"" in the fourth quarter.Swiss Roche saw a similarly painful decline. Sales of hep C drug Lucentis, which is only sold in the U.S., fell 10% in 2016 to $1.42 million. Offsetting that, sales of breast cancer drug Perjeta and rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra rose 26% and 16%, respectively.Roche also listed seven new launches, including oncology drug Tecentriq.

Baidu (BIDU), American Airlines (AAL), Intel (INTC), Comcast (CMCSA), UPS (UPS) are among the dozens of notable companies reporting, along with an important European Central Bank meeting.But let's focus on a trio of tech titans, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which have literally grown into rivals with each other.XWhile their origins are in different fields, the tech titans are all major cloud-computing players, with Microsoft and Google trying to close the gap on dominant Amazon Web Services. Apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult, because the companies are vague about the size and scope of these businesses and they compete in somewhat different fields. But investors will get an idea of how well these companies are doing in the cloud and some indication of overall cloud growth.S&P 500 futures rose about 0.1% above fair value. So did Dow futures. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed nearly 0.2%.In Wednesday's stock market trading, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials all fell 0.5%, though they finished off session lows.Amazon earnings are expected to tumble to 1 cent a share, excluding items, from 52 cents a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is seen climbing 28% to $41.97 billion. While investors will want to know about Amazon's Whole Foods integration, how much it's investing to speed up deliveries, and its holiday guidance, the e-commerce giant will continue to rely on AWS for much of its revenue growth and the bulk of its profit.Amazon shares dipped 0.3% to 972.91 on Wednesday, holding just above a 50-day moving average. It's in a flat base with a potential 1,083.41 buy point. But it's in a late-stage pattern, which is more likely to fail.Alphabet provides the least clarity about its cloud computing business, which is grouped in an ""other revenue"" category. But Google executives have said that cloud computing is a rapidly growing business.Alphabet announced an alliance with Cisco Systems (CSCO) to help it market its cloud services to businesses, government agencies and medical institutions. Google has mostly made inroads on tech firms.Overall, Alphabet revenue likely grew 20% to $21.94 billion, with EPS advancing 16% to $8.43.Alphabet shares cleared a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 13, but fell back below that level a few days later. The stock edged up 0.3% to 991.46 on Wednesday.As for Cisco, shares fell 0.8% to 34.30, testing a 34.20 buy point cleared last Friday.Microsoft groups its cloud figures in a variety of ways, making it hard to understand the size and speed of its businesses. In its fiscal Q4, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud revenue grew 11% to $7.4 billion, including a 97% spike in its Azure business to an unspecified total. In any case, cloud computing has been a key source of growth as its legacy Windows/Office business struggles with PC sales trending lower.A growing sense that Microsoft has turned the corner has lifted the stock, which is up 26.5% year to date. Shares dipped 0.3% to 78.63. That's slightly extended from a 74.52 buy point after briefly pulling back into the 5% chase zone intraday.Investors expect fiscal Q1 EPS to drop 5% to 72 cents. Revenue should expand 15% to $23.53 billion.RELATED:The Big Picture: Distribution Grows; This Fear Gauge RisesThese Tech Giants, ECB Will Dominate Thursday: Investing Action PlanAmazon Earnings Due As Analysts Ponder Whole Foods IntegrationWhy Cisco Is Good Fit For Google's Push In Cloud ComputingApple Has New Buy Point; AMD's 2 Painful Lessons3 Rules For Buying Stocks Like Facebook During Earnings Season

267,UPS,"Nike (NKE) shares popped Wednesday after the athletic apparel and shoe giant reassured at its investor day that it still expects solid revenue growth over the next five years and sees a way out of the retail labyrinth that has confounded so many other brick-and-mortar-based brands.XOver the next five years, half of Nike's growth will come from ""new innovation concepts,"" digital sales will rise from 15% to 30% of revenue, and nearly 75% of its growth will come from outside the U.S., said Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker from the company's headquarters in Beaverton, Ore.He is ""very confident"" that Nike's strategy, which focuses on speed to market, tighter product selection and a digital-focused consumer experience, will help drive high-single-digit revenue growth and midteens profit growth over that time frame.ICYMI: NIKE says at investor day that it sees high-single-digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth over the next 5 years $NKE pic.twitter.com/VsocqIHQ3c— Elaine Low (@IBD_elow) October 25, 2017Meanwhile, CNBC reported that Nike is ""on track"" to hit $50 billion within five years, which presumably means 2022. At its prior investor day in 2015, Nike had forecast it would hit $50 billion by the end of fiscal 2020.Mark Parker confirms to @CNBC that @Nike is on track to hit $50B in five years. $NKE— Jess (@JGolden5) October 25, 2017Adidas' (ADDYY) current surge of popularity has been stronger than some expected, and Nike execs attempted to soothe any concerns that the Swoosh was losing its edge among teens.""Consumers tell us that we are the No. 1 cool brand and the No. 1 favorite footwear and apparel brand for today's youth,"" said Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards, citing Nike's third-party tracking studies.And amid a rough brick-and-mortar retail landscape, Nike outlined a few ways it intends to fight to stay the No. 1 athletic apparel and shoe brand in the world.""Make sure that nothing stands in the way of getting that consumer the exact product they want at the exact moment they want it,"" said Edwards.That includes Nike.com exclusive products, same-day deliveries in certain major cities, and pulling away from ""undifferentiated"" retail outlets, which appear to be stores that do not have stand-alone Nike-centered displays.""Undifferentiated mediocre retail won't survive,"" said Edwards.The massive impact that Amazon and online shopping as a whole has wrought on retail is not lost on the brand. Management emphasized throughout the presentation that its focus now is making sales on Nike.com, Nike brick-and-mortar stores, and through strategic wholesalers. Currently 40% of the brand's wares are in what it terms ""differentiated"" spaces. It plans to take that up to 80% over the next five years.Execs also highlighted strategic partnerships with Foot Locker (FL), and online team-ups with marketplaces such as Zalando and Amazon (AMZN), adding that Nike would be launching more pilots with online marketplaces internationally in the coming months.The iconic brand is also integrating with WeChat, owned by Tencent (TCEHY), weaving  its Nike+ membership program with the popular China-based messaging platform.Nike shares rose 2.9% to 54.94 on the stock market today, closing just above their 200-day moving average. Nike edged higher in late trading, despite implying it would hit the $50 billion sales in 2022, not 2020.Nike hit a 2017 low of 50.35 earlier this month on concerns about high inventory and clearance sales. Nike hit an 18-month high of 60.53 in August.RELATED:Nike Flash Sale 'Unprecedented' As Teens Ditch Iconic BrandWhy Nike's Weak U.S. Sales May Be A Bigger Warning Than You Think

270,UPS,"On Feb. 28, 2016, the entertainment industry gave the Oscar for best picture to ""Spotlight,"" a fictionalized version of The Boston Globe's reporting of sexual abuse and its cover-up within the Catholic Church in Boston. The self-congratulation looks amazing now, after the exposure of decades of alleged harassment, and perhaps even rape, by Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein.""This film gave a voice to survivors, and this Oscar amplifies that voice, which we hope will become a choir that will resonate all the way to the Vatican,"" said ""Spotlight"" producer Michael Sugar. ""Pope Francis, it's time to protect the children and restore the faith.""We can guess no one will make a movie about the decades of harassment by Weinstein and Hollywood's cover-up. And, certainly, no one would win an Oscar for it. No Holy Father in Tinseltown has moral authority. Feminist superstars like Meryl Streep professed they hadn't the slightest idea of what their friend Harvey was doing ... which makes them either profoundly cynical or amazingly clueless.A far more believable response came from French actress Lea Seydoux, who wrote in the Guardian that she was groped by Weinstein. She said: ""Everyone knew what Harvey was up to and no one did anything. It's unbelievable that he's been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career.""If the liberal intelligentsia found it completely unbelievable that a Catholic bishop might have been uninformed about sexual abuse by priests, then how do they expect anyone to believe it's impossible for the Streeps of Hollywood to be unaware?The news reports on this scandal have underplayed or ignored the deep hypocrisy of Weinstein's business efforts against bullying and sexual assault. His company distributed the documentary ""Bully"" to theaters in 2012. In 2015, it funded and distributed ""The Hunting Ground,"" a documentary pitched as ""a startling expose of rape crimes on U.S. college campuses, their institutional cover-ups and the devastating toll they take on students and their families.""Months after the 2016 Oscars, Hollywood feminists railed against President Donald Trump for a 2005 videotape in which he made crude remarks about what a powerful man can do to women. They shared their outrage on Twitter -- Cher, Patricia Arquette, Debra Messing, Lena Dunham, and Ashley Judd. The day after Trump's inauguration, the Hollywood feminists marched in Washington, D.C., in Park City, Utah (where they hold the Sundance Film Festival), and other cities. There in the Utah ""feminist"" crowd was one Harvey Weinstein.Judd, who notoriously screamed grotesqueries at Trump at the March on Washington, was the first big name to allow her name to be used in The New York Times story on Weinstein. Dunham wrote in the Times that she regretted shaking Weinstein's hand at a Weinstein-organized rally for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She had heard the rumors but ultimately ""made a calculation"" since she desperately wanted Clinton to win.Can today's young women in Hollywood count on an anti-Weinstein ""choir"" to ""resonate"" around the entertainment industry? The Catholic Church has taken dramatic steps to prevent the abuse of children. It is Hollywood's turn to put its money where its mouth has been.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

271,UPS,"FedEx (FDX) reported weak fiscal first-quarter results and slashed its full-year earnings guidance, as a cyberattack and Hurricane Harvey slammed earnings.XThe delivery giant's report comes a day after it announced higher shipping rates for some services next year.Estimates: EPS to rise 9.3%, to $3.17, while revenue climbs 4.8%, to $15.37 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Adjusted EPS of $2.51, or $3.32 after adjusting for the impact of the TNT hack and Hurricane Harvey. Revenue was $15.3 billion.Outlook: Adjusted full-year EPS of $12.00-$12.80, well below estimates for $13.38. In June, FedEx saw EPS of $13.20-$14.00.""The impact of the cyberattack on TNT Express and lower-than-expected results at FedEx Ground reduced our first quarter earnings,"" said CFO Alan Graf in a statement. ""We are currently executing plans to mitigate the full-year impact of these issues.""Stock: FedEx fell 2% late. Share closed up 0.4% at 216.00 on the stock market today. Shares have carved a flat base and sit 2% below a 220.09 buy point.Rival UPS (UPS) lost 0.9% late, after finishing 0.5% lower. Shares of UPS are already in buy range after breaking out of a multimonth consolidation last week.Smaller peers Air Transport Services (ATSG) and Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW), which has partnered with Amazon.com (AMZN) to provide air cargo services, were up.IBD'S TAKE: Flat bases have been common recently as the major stock indexes grind higher. Here is how to spot this super-growth pattern that can herald big upward moves in a stock.Unlike UPS, FedEx has chosen not to impose surcharges on most holiday orders around frantic Black Friday and Christmas. However, it said it will charge extra for oversize and unauthorized packages.And starting Jan. 1, FedEx Express rates will rise by an average of 4.9%, while FedEx One Rate pricing will increase by 3.5%.

Shares had run up to a 10-year high on Jan. 23, rising 207% over the course of four months through Friday's close.But shares crashed Monday after Schmidt downgraded Array stock to market perform from outperform.

277,UPS,"Procter & Gamble (PG) reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates as the the world's largest consumer-products maker sold more new and premium products.Profit was $1.08 a share, excluding some items, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, Cincinnati-based P&G said in a statement Friday. Analysts estimated $1.06, on average.The results signal that Chief Executive Officer David Taylor is making progress in his efforts to speed up cost cuts and reorient the company's culture toward growth and innovation. Yet more may need to be done to revitalize P&G, including bringing in managers from outside the company, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.P&G rose 2.7% to 87 in premarket trading on the stock market today. The stock gained 5.9% last year, trailing the 9.5% increase for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.While revenue slipped 0.3% to $16.9 billion, that topped analysts' $16.8 billion average estimate. Organic sales — which exclude the effects of currency-exchange rate fluctuations as well as acquisitions and divestitures — rose 2%.IBD'S TAKE: While consumer products giants cut to grow, company start-ups are finally on the rise, but today's entrepreneurs aren't adding many jobs.Sales by that measure rose 3% in P&G's beauty division, helped by gains for the premium SK-II skin-care brands. Organic sales gained 7% in health care, driven by innovation in oral-care products. Organic sales increased 1% in the grooming, fabric & home care and baby, feminine & family care units.The company reiterated its forecast that earnings per share, excluding some items, will gain at a mid-single-digit percentage this year. Organic sales may increase as much as 3%, up from a previous projection of 2%.Taylor, who took over as PG's CEO in November 2015 after 35 years with the company, pledged to make the owner of Tide, Pampers and Olay a more nimble and innovative competitor. Once known for churning out hit products like Swiffer mops, P&G has struggled to invent new blockbusters in recent years.P&G's challenges aren't unique. New brands, particularly those with natural or organic ingredients, have attracted younger shoppers, a trend that prompted Unilever (UN) to acquire Seventh Generation last year. Large consumer companies also are coping with higher ingredient costs, sluggish demand and a stronger U.S. dollar, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English said in a report downgrading the household products sector to cautious.

The Nasdaq finished with a 1.45% weekly gain, and the Dow outpaced them with a 1.6% rise The economy lost 33,000 jobs in September, but financial markets overlooked that temporary, hurricane-related hit and focused on the employment report's underlying strength. The jobless rate fell to 4.2%, the lowest since early 2001, while average hourly wage gains jumped to 2.9%, matching the best gain since 2009. Other data earlier in the week also pointed to an economy that seems to finally be breaking out of its eight-year run of slow growth, though some of the strength may reflect a boost from hurricane recovery efforts. The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey index jumped to a 13-year high of 60.8, far above the 50 neutral mark. The ISM's nonmanufacturing survey gauge also surprised on the upside, registering its fastest growth since August 2005.RELATED:Economy Sheds 33,000 Jobs, But Jobless Rate Hits 16-Year LowISM Manufacturing Index Jumps To Highest Since 2004General Motors, Ford Motor (F), Toyota (TM) and most automakers reported stronger-than-expected September U.S. sales, as demand rebounded following hurricanes.

Tesla delivered just 220 Model 3 cars in Q3. Overall deliveries reached 26,100, amid strong demand for the more-expensive Model S and Model X. But the Model 3 woes are a bad sign for Tesla's push to make 20,000 in December and an even-faster pace in 2018. Tesla shares fell to a two-month low, extending a recent pullback.

Google added a new member to its voice-activated home automation family but didn't one-up Amazon, which has sold some 15 million of its Echo speaker systems. Google rolled out a new $399 home speaker system that competes with Apple's HomePod. The 5-inch-screen Pixel 2 starts at $649 while the 6-inch-screen Pixel 2 XL starts at $849, which is about $150 less than the iPhone X but $80 more than the large-screen version of the first Pixel rolled out in 2016. Google also unveiled a new $999 Pixel-branded laptop that will compete with Apple's MacBooks.RELATED:Google Hardware Launch Takes More Shots At Apple Than AmazonLennar (LEN) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue Tuesday. Despite slightly raising its forecast for hurricane-related delays, the builder's stock rose 6% for the week, clearing a buy point of 55.85. Meanwhile, KB Home (KBH) and Meritage (MTH) broke out on Monday and kept rising. KB Home reported strong earnings on Sept. 29, while Meritage gave solid Q3 orders and sales figures on Tuesday. D.R.

Gasoline supplies rose by 1.6 million, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts expected a 1.5 million-barrel decline in crude inventories and a 1.5 million-barrel gain in gasoline. Crude production rose to 9.561 million barrels per day last week, from 9.547 million bpd a week prior. Russia seemed open to extending the current output deal with OPEC that expires in March to the end of 2018. West Texas Intermediate ended 4.5% lower for the week at $49.29 a barrel.Las Vegas-exposed casino stock MGM Resorts (MGM) fell after a gunman killed at least 58 people and injured 489 others at a country music concert outside MGM's Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, in the worst shooting in modern U.S. history. MGM's China unit also said it would delay the opening of its new casino on the Cotai strip section of Macau to early next year, from the last half of 2017, due to damage from Typhoon Hato in August. September gambling revenue from Macau jumped 16% to $2.7 billion, but early estimates on the number of visitors to Macau during the key ""Golden Week"" holiday period were weak.Delta Air Lines (DAL) led the airline sector higher after the carrier offered a third-quarter unit-revenue forecast that, when factoring out Hurricane Irma, looked OK in the eyes of some analysts. Delta, American Airlines (AAL), JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) were seen as more vulnerable to the areas where the storm struck. Cowen also said that the guidance suggested ""stabilizing pricing trends for Delta"" amid a fare war between network carriers and low-cost rivals that had earlier ravaged airline stocks.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) said it would take a 38.6% stake in Pilot Flying J, a large truck-stop chain, with plans to gobble up an extra 41.4% in 2023.

The membership-based retailer reported that EPS grew 18% to $2.08 as revenue climbed 16% to $42.3 billion. Both topped estimates, as did results for same-store sales. Some investors worry about the Amazon effect on Costco's business, but the retailer's e-commerce sales grew 30% in September and 21% in the fourth quarter.The Yum Brands (YUM) spinoff increased its share buyback and initiated a dividend, while also naming a new CEO.

283,UPS,"Uncharitable Rage: Among the more volatile, extreme and dangerous political movements to arise within a major American political party in recent U.S. history is the so-called ""resistance"" to President Donald Trump. What's especially disappointing is finding out who is behind it.An investigation by the Washington Free Beacon looked into the progressive community organizing group called the Center for Community Change Action (CCCA), which has spearheaded the anti-Trump ""resistance."" What the Beacon found by looking at the group's unredacted tax returns was surprising: Far from being funded by like-minded activists and grass-roots contributions, the anti-Trump CCCA is secretly funded by major charities with respectably wholesome, centrist images. In some cases, the charities fund other extreme left-wing activist groups, too.Among those giving money to the CCCA — which, the Beacon notes, ""has been involved in direct action against President Donald Trump and Republicans before and after the November elections"" — include the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, the Ford Foundation and billionaire George Soros' Open Society Foundation, which have together funneled millions of dollars to the anti-Trump, anti-conservative, anti-Republican activist group.Kellogg alone gave $3 million, while the Ford Foundation ponied up $2.3 million. Soros delivered a cool $1.75 million to the anti-Trumpistas.And there were others, among them the California Endowment (created by the 1996 acquisition of WellPoint Health Networks by Blue Cross of California), $524,500; the Marguerite Casey Foundation (started by UPS founder Jim Casey), $515,000; and the National Immigration Law Center, $316,000.Yes, these bland-sounding charities and others help fund the far-left ""resistance,"" arguably damaging our democracy in the process. Sadly, in most cases, if these charities' founders were alive today, they would be deeply ashamed and, perhaps, even enraged.So how can charities that began as dispensers of aid and advice to the needy and to local community groups have morphed into funders of chaos and anti-democratic activism, against their original founders' wishes?Well, as with all organizations in the U.S., over time even the most well-meaning and well-run charities eventually get taken over by the far-left and progressives. It's a tried-and-true tactic, one that has worked not just in charities but in local school districts, university administrations, local governments, the federal bureaucracy, even in the arts.And it's not an accident.Italian Marxist-strategist Antonio Gramsci, who died in 1937, called this the ""long march through the institutions."" The website Discover The Networks describes the Marxist theorist's ideas thusly: ""Gramsci called for Marxists to actively spread their ideology in a gradual, incremental, stealth manner, by infiltrating all existing societal institutions and embedding it, largely without being noticed, in the popular mind.""Sure, Gramsci might be obscure to you, but he isn't to the left. He's a hugely influential hero. For that matter, so was Saul Alinsky, whose Marxist-inspired ""Rules for Radicals"" has become something of a primer for today's activists. The link here is that, in writing his famous little book, Alinsky was basically cribbing from Gramsci's ideas.Alinsky, by the way, was the main political influence on Hillary Clinton (who wrote her senior thesis on him), along with an entire generation of left-wing activist-politicians who rose through the ranks with her in the post-Watergate Democratic Party and now dominate.This well-funded tactic explains why the Democratic Party, rather than acting as the loyal opposition, has gone over the top and become an actively obstructionist opposition, unwilling to compromise or cooperate at all. And it explains why Democratic Party operatives, including Democratic National Committee Chairman Thomas Perez, not to mention failed Democratic presidential candidate Clinton, have chosen to openly ally with this movement, which seeks nothing less than to undermine and overturn a U.S. election.America's charities are at the heart of what makes America special. So it's especially sad that some have become less-than-charitable funders of division and political rage, rather than unity and political compromise.

The S&P 500 took a fractional loss, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2%.The major indexes may or may not be due for a pullback, with the Dow and S&P 500 sitting atop four-week run ups that have consecutively scored new highs. Investors also may have an eye on a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, scheduled before today's close, as well as Friday's payrolls report, ahead of which the market often sees subdued trade.Apple dropped 0.7%, the deepest early loss among Dow industrial stocks. The stock continues to lag below its 10-week moving average, as well as the 156.75 buy point it has been struggling to clear since early August.Amazon.com faded 0.2%, after European Union regulators ordered the Luxembourg government to recoup $294 million in taxes from the e-commerce giant, taxes that had been waived as part of a financial incentives program. The EU also said it was pursuing Ireland to assess a similar charge against Apple.Amazon stock has been meeting resistance at its 10-week moving average, unable to start up the right side of a two-month flat base.Netflix (NFLX) led the FANG stocks for a second day, surging 3% and to within 3% of a 190.05 buy point in a two-month, cup-with-handle base.China-based names showed some of the strongest early moves among IBD 50 stocks, boosted by another strong session in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.8% Wednesday, putting it ahead 3% so far for the week and less than 2% from a 10-year high. Hong Kong markets will close Thursday. China's markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen and a number of other Asian markets remain closed all week on holiday.Autohome (ATHM) led the index, up 2% in early trade.  The stock is climbing off Monday's low, after a sharp three-week pullback that cut below its 10-week moving average in heavy trade, a sell signal.IBD 50 name Tal Education (TAL) added 1% at the open.

A consensus of economists had projected a slowdown to 140,000 added jobs. Some 29,000 layoffs in trade, transportation and technology services skewed the numbers lower.

To counter living in our hurry-up-and-go society that's wired us to always have to be ""on,"" Asprey recommends to set up time every day to tune out and go offline — and put it on your calendar.He notes that every one of the highest-performing scientists and executives he's coached or interviewed uses some form of mindfulness practice that slows the brain down.""Consider taking up yoga or the breathing exercises,"" Asprey said. ""In just 20 minutes you can significantly boost working memory"" and, with regular practice, improve brain function.Terraform your bedroom. Most people don't get good quality sleep, Asprey says.  ""Multiple studies have shown that it's quality, not quantity that matters most.""Poor sleep quality causes brain function to plummet and reduces your body's ability to manage your blood sugar, he says.The most important sleep factors in a physical bedroom are darkness, noise and temperature, Asprey says. By making small changes, such as installing blackout curtains, blocking LED lights on electronic devices, and reducing your bedroom's temperature you can significantly improve your rest. ""A pitch-black sleeping environment pays dividends every night.""Fuel your mind. Eat more wild caught fish, coconut oil, nut butters, and other healthy fats, Asprey advises. These kinds of foods power your brain and body.Peter Shankman, author of ""Faster Than Normal: Turbocharge Your Focus, Productivity and Success With the Secrets of the ADHD Brain,"" points out that pizza and other types of junk food are all counterproductive to optimum brain performance.Shankman, who has ADHD, is a tech entrepreneur who has started and sold three companies, an Ironman triathlete, and a corporate keynote speaker.Junk food has lots of fat and carbs, and usually just requires you to eat more next time to get the same high, he says. Focus on healthy food instead; get your needed natural chemicals from exercise and other, more-beneficial options.Train your body. There are two types of exercise that can help you to grow more energy production in your brain and muscles, Asprey says. The first is to go for a walk every day for at least 20 minutes — ""no jogging required!""The second is to push yourself really hard for only 15 minutes once or twice a week. The most effective forms of this kind of exercise are short sprints or lifting really heavy things. ""It saves a ton of time and allows your body to be ready for making lots of energy at any time,"" he said.To add a little extra focus for your next meeting, Shankman has found the simple act of walking up a few flights of stairs or doing jumping jacks or pushups is enough to ""physically change your brain for an hour, by providing dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline — the three key brain chemicals that keep you alert and on the ball.""Prepare. To focus on changing up brain chemistry first thing each day, Shankman starts his morning being ready to exercise.To fight the stay-in-bed-and-hit-the-snooze mentality, he has automated lighting that turns on just before he wakes up. Furthermore, Shankman sleeps in his gym clothes. By the time his alarm goes off early in the morning, he's ready to go.""The first two hours of my day are spent exercising,"" he said.

Rival Tencent's (TCEHY) 4.1% weekly gain added to its 4.8% rally the prior week and put it above its 50-day line.Alibaba competitor JD.com's (JD) rise was more modest (3.3%) but enough to reclaim that key support level too.Meanwhile, internet portal Sina (SINA) and microblogging service Weibo (WB), which is majority-owned by Sina, are near their 50-day averages after weekly surges of more than 10%.The run-ups in Chinese stocks weren't limited to internet darlings either.

FedEx Express revenue rose 2% to $6.74 billion, FedEx Ground revenue climbed 9% to $4.42 billion, and FedEx Freight revenue added 3% to $1.6 billion.

292,UPS,"AT&T's (T) promotional pricing for its DirecTV Now mobile video service will end on Monday, but it'll still have a $35-per-month offer on the table for consumers as Hulu revs up its live-TV service, which the company has said will be priced ""under $40.""Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Time Warner (TWX) has a 10% stake in Hulu. AT&T has agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion, though President-elect Trump has stated opposition to that merger, fearing too much media strength is being concentrated in too few hands.AT&T launched its video streaming service in late November. While AT&T's ""Go Big"" package of 100-plus channels will cost $60, up from the promotional $35, starting Jan. 9, DirecTV Now will also offer a 60-channel package called ""Live a Little"" for $35.AT&T's ""Live a Little"" package still lacks CBS — which announced a deal with Hulu on Wednesday — and regional sports, but it still could prove a popular offer, says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.IBD'S TAKE: CBS is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Media-Diversified group. CBS stock has shot up since forming a cup-with-handle formation in September. Analysts say CBS content is coveted in video streaming packages. CBS could be a takeover target. Learn more about CBS at IBD Stock Checkup. ""Virtually all of the channels that anyone would really want, save for regional sports networks, are included in the $35 ""Live a Little"" package,"" said Moffett in a research report.""The step-up to $50 for the ""Just Right"" package is arguably a sensible one for a genuine sports fan, but the step-ups from there to the ""Go Big"" and ""Gotta Have It!"" packages, at $60 and $70 per month, respectively, are mostly for a bunch of filler,"" Moffett wrote.AT&T stock fell 2.1% in the stock market today to 41.26. CBS stock, which spiked to a nearly three-year high of 66.88 on Wednesday, fell 1.8% Friday to 64.30.AT&T sells Time Warner's HBO for $5 extra per month, down from its usual $10 to $15 fee. AT&T on Thursday said Time Warner will not need to transfer any of its FCC licenses to AT&T in order to continue to conduct its business operations after the deal closes. If that's the case, analysts say, regulatory approval of the merger could be smoother.It's not clear that Hulu will get all of CBS' programming. CBS, meanwhile, has its own streaming service, CBS All Access, which has over 1.2 million subscribers.Analysts estimate that Dish Networks' (DISH)Sling-branded streaming service, which starts at $20 monthly but with no broadcast channels, has nearly 1 million subscribers.The DirecTV Now streaming service could boost AT&T's wireless business, where growth has stalled amid continuing postpaid subscriber losses. AT&T will not count DirecTV Now streaming toward the monthly data caps of its own wireless subscribers.AT&T's DirecTV Now does not provide a cloud-based DVR service and limits users to two simultaneous video streams.RELATED:CBS, Hulu Officially Ink Deal For New Live-TV ServiceAT&T Taps Apple TV In Launching DirecTV Now Streaming-Video Service

293,UPS,"Big-cap techs powered the market higher during late afternoon trading Friday and the Nasdaq led the way, rising nearly 0.7% and notching all-time highs, as its largest member by market cap looked poised for a fresh breakout from a new base.Apple (AAPL) has no doubt become a mature income play (it has a 2% annualized yield), but the mega-cap consumer stock is still showing signs of growth left in the tank.As noted in a Stock Market Today column Thursday, the company is poised to reignite an acceptable rebound in revenues, which could put Apple back on track for renewed profit growth.Apple has seen profits wither vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters, down 18%, 15% and 23%. Fiscal Q1 profit is seen down just 2%, though, to $3.22 a share. The stock, up 1.1% to 117.91, is trying to move past a 118.12 buy point in a 12-week cup-with-handle base following news of a pay cut for CEO Tim Cook. Shares have so far gotten as high as 118.16.The buy point is found by adding 10 cents to the handle's intraday high of 118.02. The handle began forming its six-day handle on Dec. 28.Watch to see how Apple's volume finishes by day's end. While it's higher than Thursday's session, you'd prefer to see volume grow sharply above its 50-day average (currently 32.3 million shares a day) if and when the breakout occurs. In some rare cases, volume doesn't come in big until days or weeks after the actual piercing of the correct entry price.The tech-rich Nasdaq 100, which houses the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose  as much as 1.1%, better than gains of nearly 0.5% by the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500.Investment bank, super regional bank, medical software, railroad, oil drilling, travel booking, desktop software, internet content and security software firms paced the market's upside as these industry groups all throttled 1% higher or more. Gold miners fell hard, down more than 5% as a group. Coal, steel and water utility stocks also slumped.Small cap names lagged, with the Russell 2000 losing modest gains and falling 0.2. Volume is running lower on the NYSE with less than 30 minutes left in Friday's session and higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Thursday.While the U.S. payrolls increase of 156,000 jobs in December missed a consensus view of 178,000, investors shrugged off the miss and decided to embrace the better than expected jump in wages, up 0.4% vs. an expected 0.3% increase.While some observers noted that the report likely gave members of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting FOMC committee a feeling of justification in raising interest rates last month, others wondered whether it would lead to a change in thinking on how much more labor participation is possible and how it could impact future economic growth and overall inflation.""The payroll report asks more questions than it answers. Specifically, have we reached full employment; is this as good as it gets?"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD.Banking stocks are helping lead the rally; Goldman Sachs (GS), part of IBD Leaderboard, jumped 1.7% to 245.32. Leaderboard, which features charts that are annotated in real time to help readers discover signs of strength and weakness and proper buy and sell signals, currently shows 11 names on its Leaders list.Super regional lenders Regions Financial (RF) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) were up 0.6% and 1%, respectively. Both have been trading in tight price ranges, a bullish sign following excellent breakouts (10.18 entry for Regions, 21.21 for Fifth Third) that preceded big run-ups from October through December of last year.The Federal Reserve has signaled that it may raise the fed funds rate three more times in 2017, reflecting confidence in the overall U.S. economy.Returning to Apple, the iPhone maker had climbed nearly 8% following its latest breakout, a Sept. 14 move past a 110.33 entry in a 12-week cup with handle that formed amidst its bottoming process. A bottoming base pattern emerges when a stock makes a dramatic decline of 30%, 40% or more, then breaks a long-term downtrend line.Apple got as high as 118.69 before fading on concerns of Apple Watch and iPhone 7 model unit sales. However, as seen in the daily chart, the stock showed a terrific bounce off the 200-day moving average, a good shakeout that helped set the course for the creation of the right side of a new base.For fiscal 2017, which ends in September this year, the Street expects Apple's earnings to grow 8% to $8.99 a share, then accelerate to a 12% increase to $10.08 a share in FY 2019.Apple has 5.33 billion shares outstanding and a float of 5.28 billion. Elsewhere in the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA), gaining much attention at the CES 2017 show in Las Vegas, rallied 2.7% to 103.51 as it attempts to put the brakes on a new correction.At the end of December, the leading designer of chips for graphics, data center, VR and artificial intelligence research staged a climax run, hinting that it was in need of a break.At its recent low of 99.38, Nvidia has fallen 17% below its all-time peak of 119.93. That's well within range for a potential cup, double bottom, or saucer pattern to form.RELATED:The Bottoming Base Pattern, Part I: How It Can Help You Make Money In StocksThe Bottoming Base Pattern, Part II: How Apple Formed One In 2009How To Invest: Why The Cup With Handle Can Help You Score ProfitsHow To Invest: Gain Timeless Market Wisdom From Wall Street Great And Author Gerald LoebStock Market Today: When Did Apple Initially Break Out?

294,UPS,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

295,UPS,"Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy recently joined Water Street Capital and has pushed the secretive hedge fund firm to build a large stake in Micron Technology (MU), arguing the market for its main product is set for a sustained boom without the wild ups and crushing downs of the past.The rise of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality applications on Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other high-end smartphones will spur stronger demand for dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, chips, Joy wrote in a recent memo to Water Street founder Gilchrist Berg and other executives at the firm.DRAM supply is likely to fall well short of this demand as it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive to churn out more capable chips, and a smaller number of manufacturers behave more rationally to maintain profit, Joy added.These arguments are well-known in the business, driving the spot price of these chips up more than 70% in the past year. What's unusual is Joy's conclusion that the market for DRAM chips will no longer be whipsawed by oversupply and fluctuating demand.""With the DRAM industry untethered from its highly cyclical past, we believe chip prices and company earnings are going to be and remain higher for longer than investors currently expect,"" Joy wrote in the memo, which was obtained by Bloomberg.Shares of Micron, which competes with industry leader Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. in the DRAM market, could trade as high as $64, almost 70% above current levels, Joy predicted.Water Street, which hired Joy as a principal at the firm in May, has taken his advice, investing about a quarter of its total assets in Micron stock and options. The firm's equity portfolio is worth about $2.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, although its total assets under management are larger.That's a big change for Water Street, which shorted, or bet against, Micron and other DRAM chipmakers as the industry went through severe cycles in the 1980s, 90s and early 2000s. Water Street has made successful tech investments before, having bet big on Apple shares in late 2003, long before the iPhone became a moneymaker.While some analysts agree with Joy's theories, they're wary of calling an end to the industry's cycles because manufacturers have shown time and again that they can't resist the urge to churn out more DRAM chips in ever more efficient ways. The components store data for processors to manipulate, and the more capable DRAM chips you have the faster your device. That makes them key ingredients in data-center servers, personal computers and mobiles devices. However, the industry has historically struggled to match new capacity with swings in demand.""We've been through these cycles before. When you're near the top it always looks this way,"" said Anand Srinivasan, a semiconductor and hardware analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""Participants look very rational in tight memory markets like this one, but that can change.""Micron shares have already surged 73% this year, while short interest, a measure of bets against the stock, has dropped to 1.7% recently from more than 6% at the end of 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Newman has a market perform rating on the stock partly because most of the strong DRAM market is already reflected in the shares.Bloomberg's Srinivasan, though, sees the DRAM market staying strong through 2018. After that, he said anything is possible. If Samsung adds DRAM capacity, that could ""break"" the market, he said. That company is close to completing a new chip plant that's about a mile around. Newman called it a ""monster.""Joy also wrote that Micron may get a boost from Apple, a big DRAM buyer that's keen to have alternatives to Samsung, its main smartphone rival.The latest iPhones have AI and augmented reality capabilities that require more memory. Joy expects the amount of DRAM per iPhone to reach more than 10 gigabytes from about 2 GB today.""This newfound prosperity in the DRAM industry will persist for longer than investors currently believe,"" Joy concluded, while advising Water Street to hold Micron shares for the long term.

296,UPS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose slightly Tuesday morning vs. fair value ahead of notable economic data and comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen.XThe Nasdaq composite led Monday's selling, testing its 50-day moving average as Facebook (FB) plunged through that key support, Tesla (TSLA) triggered multiple sell signals and Apple (AAPL) kept falling.Meanwhile, a large number of mostly tech breakouts joined Apple and Tesla underwater, including Alibaba (BABA), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA). The Nasdaq composite slid 0.9%, while the big-cap Nasdaq skidded 1.1%, below its 50-day. But the S&P 500 index and Dow industrials lost just 0.2%.S&P 500 index futures rose a fraction Tuesday morning above fair value, Dow futures were up 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%.August new-home sales data and the Consumer Confidence Index for September will released at 10 a.m. ET. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen will give the keynote speech at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics in Cleveland at 12:45 p.m. ET, with several other Fed officials set to speak today.Tech stocks, especially longtime big-cap leaders like Facebook, are having a rough go right now. But there are several sectors and specific industry groups that are faring well, with Dow components Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) in or near buy zones.IBD'S TAKE: Don't rely on market pundits telling you where they think the market is heading next year. Listen to what the market is saying right by following the major market averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (open access through Oct. 8) for timely analysis.Facebook had been trading tightly in a flat base just below a buy point. But shares fell 4.5% to 162.87 on Monday in heavy volume, tumbling below their 50-day moving average and undercutting the low of their current consolidation. Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well. Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are among those in buy zones. General Dynamics (GD) is close.Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Marriott International (MAR), and Hyatt Hotels (H) are among several hotel operators that have broken out. But they've generally broken out on light-to-lackluster volume. Casino stocks have been doing well, though Melco Resorts (MLCO) fell below a buy point and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) nearly did so.D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) are all near buy points.On a related note, Home Depot crept out to a buy point on Monday, but in below-average volume.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tech Stocks Crushed As Nasdaq Reaches A Key TestWhy Tesla May Not Be Leading This Part Of The Self-Driving Race75 Recent Breakouts, And This Stock Is The Biggest Winner So Far?New High Analysis: Nasdaq Sell-Off Spares These 7 StocksFacebook Down As Zuckerberg Scraps Stock Plan, Will Sell Shares

297,UPS,"Owning a 401(k) is a surefire way to boost your confidence about meeting your retirement savings goals. You can amp up your confidence even more by taking specific steps to make the most of it.XThe Investment Company Institute (ICI) found in a survey that 82% of households that do own at least one such account say they are somewhat or very confident those accounts will help them save enough money. In contrast, only 63% of households that don't own a 401(k) account or IRA express confidence.""And you should be able to increase your confidence by doing things that leverage the benefits of a 401(k) account,"" said Sarah Holden, the ICI's senior director of retirement and investor research.Holden recommends three steps in particular:Three out of every four 401(k) plans do have a company match. Formulas vary. The most common formula is 50 cents for every $1 you contribute, up to a maximum of 6% of your pay, Holden says. ""If you don't max out the match, you literally are leaving money on the table,"" Holden said. ""It's like turning down part of your paycheck. No one would do if they understand what they're doing.""Suppose you earn $70,000 and contribute $3,000, and your company match is 50 cents for every $1 up to 6% of pay. In that scenario, your company is kicking in $1,500 a year. But if you jack up your own contribution to 6% of your pay, or $4,200 a year, you can get an additional $600 from your company, for a total match of $2,100.That can turn into a lot of extra dollars in your retirement account. If the market grows an average of 7% those $600 a year in additional contributions from your company would grow into $132,007 over the course of 40 years thanks to miracle of compound growth.  Average annual growth of 7% is a reasonable assumption, since the broad market measured by the S&P 500 has grown an average of 10.1% a year since 1926 through Aug. 31, according to Morningstar Direct.And that's in addition to the rest of your nest egg. Your own contribution plus the full company match total $6,300 a year. With an average annual return of 7%, that would balloon into $1.38 million over 40 years.So, which would you rather have? $132,007 or $1.38 million? Obviously, you'd prefer the larger total. And that's how much you'd end up with by maxxing out your company match.If you kick in more than 6%, you'll build your retirement nest egg even more over time. And that may be wise, even if your company will pony up only a total of $2,100 because of the 6% cap.In general, you want stocks and stock mutual funds in your portfolio to produce the growth described above. The downside is that stocks and stock mutual funds will give you more ups and downs over time than bonds and bond funds or cash.That volatility is easier for most people to handle while they are young. The younger you are, the more time your portfolio has to bounce back from the market's inevitable ups and down. Knowing that, it may be easier for you to stomach market gyrations in your younger years.If you want to dampen market volatility, add bonds and bond mutual funds, which typically offer a smoother market ride. Just remember, bonds can lose value while interest rates are rising. And we're in a period when the Federal Reserve is expected to be raising rates.Income used to be a second big reason that investors beefed up their bond holdings as they entered and advanced through retirement.But these days, you may prefer to wring income out of your portfolio by adding dividend-paying stocks or funds or selling off some of your stock-based securities. Income yield from stocks and stock funds may be close to many bonds and bond funds, with less downside risk from Fed rate hikes.Whichever strategy you choose, you should have lots of ways to implement it. The average 401(k) plan offers 28 investments to choose from.And, don't forget, you can let a professional money manager choose your stocks and bonds for you and decide how much of each to hold on your behalf by opting for a target-date fund. Those portfolios typically boost their weightings in bonds and cash as you reach and enter your target date, customarily at or near the year you retire.And the average 401(k) plan offers you a choice of 22 target-date funds.IBD'S TAKE: If you are a newcomer to stock investing who wants a few pointers, check out IBD's introduction to stock investing or IBD's mutual funds section for tips and strategies.Moving an account balance is likely to happen if you change jobs or retire. Whether you shift your assets into a plan at a new workplace or into an IRA upon retirement, be sure to let custodians at each account location make the arrangements.This is especially important with a traditional 401(k) as opposed to a Roth 401(k) account. If you take a check made out to you personally and don't deposit the money properly within 60 days, you'll be hit with a whopping tax bill as the withdrawal will be treated by the IRS as taxable income.Adding insult to injury,  you can be hit with a 10% penalty if you are under the age of 59-1/2 or not eligible for an exemption from the early withdrawal penalty.   RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeIf You're An Experienced Investor Who Wants To Know What The Stock Market Is Doing Now, Go To IBD's Stock Market Today Page

298,UPS,"Amazon.com (AMZN) kicked off its Whole Foods takeover on Aug. 28 by slashing the prices of avocados, kale and other items at the ""Whole Paycheck"" grocery chain by as much as 43%. Who could argue with that?Consumer welfare has been the foremost concern of U.S. antitrust law since the 1980s, with price hikes seen as the surest sign of monopoly power. Yet a growing chorus of critics complain that Amazon and fellow internet giants Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are becoming too dominant, snuffing out competition, innovation and even freedom of expression.Wall Street is starting to ponder a trillion-dollar question: Could the Whole Foods buyout mark a turning point that leads to serious U.S. antitrust scrutiny for Amazon, Facebook and Google?""In the face of bona fide threats of regulatory and political opposition to Amazon, we against all odds finally may be facing 'Peak Amazon,' "" hedge fund manager Doug Kass wrote on July 11.His warning was premature. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the Whole Foods deal in barely two months.When it comes to total sales, Wal-Mart's (WMT) $486 billion towers over Amazon's $136 billion in 2016, and its nearly 4,700 U.S. stores dwarf Whole Foods' 460. However, Amazon did grab 43% of U.S. online sales in 2016, as well as 53% of the growth in the fast-moving sector, according to Slice Intelligence.Rather than unfair competition, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet's Google are the beneficiaries of the internet's winner-take-all dynamics, says Joachim Fels, managing director at Pimco. These superstars ""benefit from network effects that are especially strong in social media and software platforms, where the value of the services increases with the number of users,"" Fels wrote. ""Size begets size, which in turn begets size.""If someone wants to connect with friends or customers via social media, Facebook is the obvious choice: 85% of Americans who are online are members. Not even Google could compete with that. And if you want to shop, where else to start but Amazon.com, which lists hundreds of millions of items?But natural or not, their advantages unnerve observers from the far left to the White House and even at the pro-market University of Chicago, which spawned the big-isn't-necessarily-bad legal shift under President Reagan.Before Steve Bannon was pushed out of the White House as President Trump's senior advisor and returned to the populist, right-wing news site Breitbart, he reportedly made the case that Facebook and Google's dominance made them ""essential elements of 21st-century life (that) should be regulated as utilities."" Could that be sour grapes?  A majority of Americans now say they get their news from social media sites led by Facebook and from Google's search.XYet many conservatives and even some libertarians with traditionally hands-off inclinations toward business are growing concerned over the internet giants' power. That's intensified after Google's recent firing of an engineer for politically incorrect views on women and the high-tech workforce, and moves by Facebook and others to combat ""fake news"" and ban offensive speech.Trump raised the possibility of antitrust action against Amazon during the campaign. He still has CEO Jeff Bezos' empire in his sights, even if his real beef is with the Bezos-owned Washington Post. ""Amazon is doing great damage to taxpaying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!"" Trump tweeted recently.Worries about Amazon's impact on retail jobs and wages also risk making it a prime target on the left. Democratic Party leaders called for an antitrust crackdown as part of their ""Better Deal"" economic platform in July. Although they singled out the cable industry, rather than the Silicon Valley and Seattle tech giants, that could change. Rep. Keith Ellison, who represents Minneapolis and serves as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, recently retweeted a Bloomberg opinion column titled ""Should America's Tech Giants Be Broken Up?"" with a one-word response: ""YES!""Economists and technologists worry that these internet companies' dominance will snuff out innovation. Consider Snap (SNAP), which raised $3.4 billion in March in the biggest IPO in three years. Already hopes have faded that it might erode Facebook's position. Analysts say Facebook has simply copied Snapchat's popular features and left it in the dust. With Snap shares lagging below its IPO price, funding may be harder to come by for the next David to challenge a Goliath.Luigi Zingales, finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is calling for a more-proactive antitrust approach that would have kept Facebook from buying up Instagram and WhatsApp. He says the antitrust action against Microsoft (MSFT) in the 1990s and early 2000s helped create a climate in which Facebook and Google could rise to the top. But he worries that the current crop of leaders are growing too powerful to cut into their advantage. ""A system where this does not change is a system that is fossilized and hurts everyone,"" he said.Current antitrust policy focuses on preventing companies from consolidating power to raise prices, harming consumers. But Lina Khan, until recently a fellow at the New America Foundation's Open Markets program, argues that a new approach is needed to address companies like Amazon that operate online platforms.""The economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,"" Khan wrote in the Yale Law Review. ""Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational — even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.""Khan may have a point: While shares of Amazon are off their recent all-time highs, they are still up 33% so far this year, even as earnings are expected to sink more than 20% in 2017.Amazon Prime may have started as a loss leader to gain customer loyalty, but Amazon has made the service so broad and attractive — offering free shipping, Amazon Prime Video, various special offers and now discounts at Whole Foods — that it is creating a world in which people make purchases only via the internet giant.Already about half of U.S. households are Amazon Prime members. And 55% of all online shopping searches started on Amazon last year vs. 30% in 2012. In recent months, Nike (NKE) and Sears (SHLD) threw in the towel and agreed to begin selling their athletic shoes and Kenmore appliances on Amazon.As for Google and Facebook, proving a price monopoly is a nonstarter since their services are free to consumers.But if not by pricing control, how should a monopoly be defined?Under the Democrats' ""Better Deal"" outline, regulators would use criteria to judge whether a merger would ""reduce wages, cut jobs, lower product quality, limit access to services, stifle innovation, or hinder the ability of small businesses and entrepreneurs to compete.""Those guidelines hearken back to ""the bad old days of antitrust, when it was used to protect inefficient small businesses and to pursue confused social goals,"" wrote Elizabeth Popp Berman, associate professor of sociology at the University at Albany in New York. ""While no one thinks that low prices for consumers are the only thing worth pursuing in life, they are the appropriate goal for antitrust because they make it coherent and administrable.""That consensus is entrenched in the antitrust enforcement agencies, codified into law through court decisions and resistant to change.Still, the EU's fine of Google for abusing its dominant position in internet search could hint at future U.S. policy.In prioritizing its own comparison-shopping site in search results, the European Commission said Google ""denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate.""Online platforms, Khan noted, ""control the essential infrastructure on which their rivals depend.""In a reflection of the increasingly fragile embrace of Democrats and Big Tech, the Google-funded, left-of-center New America think tank last month cut loose the Open Markets group after it praised the European Union's fine vs. Google.While Google disputes the EU's charge, noting Amazon's lead position in shopping searches, it agreed to make changes by Sept. 28. The EU also is scrutinizing Google's bundling of its Google Play app store with its free Android app.Luther Lowe, vice president of policy at Yelp (YELP), a crowdsourced review site, called the Google fine ""the most significant enforcement event in consumer tech antitrust in nearly 20 years,"" alluding to the Microsoft case.Yet the Microsoft antitrust fight was expensive and dragged on for years, underscoring the limitations of traditional antitrust actions in a complex and fast-moving industry.Tech journalist Walt Mossberg and economist Hal Singer have promoted addressing monopolistic and discriminatory competitive practices through a ""special, permanent, nonpartisan, independent commission — or even a special, narrowly focused court — to adjudicate disputes about internet issues."" The issues could run from network neutrality violations to heavy-handed behavior by Google or Amazon.Singer notes that such a tribunal already exists to handle complaints that cable companies are giving preference to their own programming.While Google is in the EU's line of fire now, Amazon is starting to come under the microscope.Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and co-author of the report, ""Amazon's Stranglehold,"" argued at a recent Forbes forum that Amazon's anticompetitive effect stems from its inherent conflict as both a direct seller and the operator of a platform that it invites other sellers to use.Khan cites Amazon's big discounts from Federal Express (FDX) and UPS (UPS) as a high-volume customer. Amazon passes along those discounts to independent companies that use its fulfillment services.Extending its empire to 460 Whole Foods stores substantially increases Amazon's logistics footprint, facilitating in-store pickup by customers and lowering the cost of last-mile delivery. Amazon already has been taking steps to increase its own delivery capability, in part with its Uber-like delivery force of flextime workers paid $19 to $24 per hour.While customers cheer the convenience and low cost, critics argue that companies may have no choice but to use Amazon's fulfillment services if they want to get competitive shipping rates and favorable listings.""What Amazon has done is turn an open market into a privately controlled arena where it sets the terms by which other players may buy and sell,"" Mitchell said at a Forbes forum. ""That's why its platform has to be broken off from its direct retail and made to comply with common carrier rules.""Yet the idea comes across as so radical, showing how poorly antitrust law is suited to dealing with today's tech titans.""You want Amazon to look like the local power company?"" countered Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law and Economics.

301,UPS,"TCW Select Equities Fund (TCGEX) is enjoying a big rebound from 2016, thanks to a steadfast focus on leading stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Mastercard (MA) and Zoetis (ZTS). Not only are they poised for future growth, they have climbed 33%, 36% and 22% respectively this year.XLast year the $909.2 million fund lagged nearly its entire large-cap growth peer group tracked by Morningstar Direct. This year's rally — the fund's 26.51% year-to-date gain going into Thursday topped 89% of its direct rivals as well as the S&P 500's 13.19% advance — fits in with the fund's long-term outperformance.The challenge last year was that the market rotated toward value-oriented stocks in materials, industrials, energy and financials, and away from the more growth-oriented stocks that fund manager Craig Blum likes. ""The 2016 struggles have pretty much unwound in 2017,"" Blum said. ""We're not hoisting any trophies. We've got the rest of the year to go. But we're proud to have delivered some upside (to our shareholders) and be on our way to recovering from 2016.""Over the past 10 years, the fund is in the top 28% of its peers. In 2015, it outran 98% of its peers.Even in 2016 when the fund fell 8.07%, the fund stuck to its knitting. ""We never changed our approach,"" Blum said. ""We stayed resolute in our focus on quality stocks and growth.""And with a portfolio of 32 names as of June 30, ""focus"" is the right way to describe the portfolio. It ranges between 25 and 35 names. It aims for companies capable of long-term price appreciation through earnings growth. The quality part of the equation? ""We want companies capable of durable, sustainable earnings growth, which have a wide moat around their businesses, that are capturing market share and have balance sheet strength,"" Blum said.The technology sector is where Blum is looking for a lot of those stocks now. He had a 40% tech weighting as of Aug. 31. ""We find a lot of disruptive forces there,"" he said. ""And we want a large opportunity. Many tech companies have large total addressable markets.""Amazon is one of those tech names. The e-commerce and cloud-services giant was still a top-10 holding as of June 30 even though Blum made small trims in recent disclosures. ""We work with long-term and short-term price targets,"" he said. Amazon is at or near its short-term target, he adds, ""but we feel quite confident in our long-term thesis.""He added, ""Amazon's spending on fulfillment center expansion and aggressive investment in Amazon Web Services (AWS) are justified."" More big enterprises are shifting data center operations to services like AWS, he says. ""In the long-term this spending will be value accretive,"" he said.He says the Whole Foods acquisition is not related to his Amazon trims. ""We are constructive on the Whole Foods acquisition over the long-term for a variety of reasons,"" he said. Among them, he calls the takeover an opportunity to speed up Amazon Prime membership sign-ups. It's also a big increase in Amazon's distribution and fulfillment capabilities.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on IBD's Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks. One emerging Amazon strength is that it is becoming a consumer-electronics maker in its own right with the popular Echo digital assistant products.Mastercard is a relative newcomer. Blum began to buy in January. Blum calls the stock — which is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals — an attractive play on growth in e-commerce and card penetration.Blum also owns Visa (V), but likes Mastercard's outlook slightly better because it has more room to grow. Mastercard is developing technologies and advertising services that, if successful, will be new sources of revenue and earnings growth.For one, it is developing technology that could enable banks to wring more information out of the stodgy Automated Clearing House (ACH) network that banks use to manage services such as processing of payroll, direct deposits, tax payments, consumer bills and money transfers from one account to another.Zoetis is another newcomer. Blum began to buy in May. ""The growthier part of the business is the companion-animals segment,"" Blum said. ""There's a secular trend of folks spending more at veterinary clinics on their pets.""The farm-animals segment is more stable, which Blum likes. It does not fluctuate much as the broader economy speeds up and contracts because the cost of vaccines and other health products is small compared to overall costs of running a farm. Also, it's crucial for a farm to maintain the health of its livestock.Also, Blum says the company is better focused than rivals that are part of large, more diverse pharmaceutical companies. ""Those rivals aren't able to integrate marketing and research-and-development the way Zoetis is,"" Blum said. ""Their focus is a competitive advantage.""That durability of revenue and earnings is something that Blum values among several of his holdings. ""It's appropriate to maintain a balanced view,"" he said. ""It's good to combine higher beta, more aggressive growth companies with more defensive names like Zoetis.""Why? Because you never know when a recession could start. ""Since 1900, the average business cycle has lasted 47 months,"" he said. ""We're now 99 months into this one. We're cyclically bullish short-term. But our eyes are wide open midterm.""RELATED:Should You Join Lawsuits Mushrooming In Equifax Hack?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

303,UPS,"The infrastructure rally, the telecom rally, the oil rally and the bank rally.Those were some of the stock market trends that highlighted 2016, and each is reflected in the year's 100 best stocks.A chunk of the year's winners owe their success to the final two months of the year. Without the postelection rally, some of the stocks may not have made the list. The Nov. 8 election, which resulted in Republican control of the White House and Congress, sparked institutional investors to spend their capital on infrastructure stocks, financials and (for a time) pharmaceuticals.President-elect Donald Trump promised massive spending on roads, highways, airports and other public works projects. Banking executives cheered his criticism of regulation in the industry. Drug manufacturers were relieved that Hillary Clinton lost, only to watch in dismay a month later as Trump blasted high drug prices in much the same way Clinton had.A few biotechs made the top 100, and all were new issues in 2016 or went public within the past three years. In 2015, biotechs and other medicals dominated the year's top 100.Best Stocks Of 2016Banking stocks benefited from Trump's victory and a favorable trend in interest rates. Several regional banks made the 2016 winners list, but there could have been dozens more had they met the requirements for this list, which include a minimum price of 12 a share at the beginning of the year. Most regional banks are thinly traded.That gave rise to little-known leaders such as Independent Bank Group (IBTX) and Middleburg Financial (MBRG), which had their most productive breakouts in October.Heavy construction companies — sure to win more business in an infrastructure boom — saw their share of winners too. Argan (AGX) extended an already successful year with a breakout to new highs Nov. 14. Mastec (MTZ) broke out the day after the election and soared as much as 31% from its buy point.Put steel makers in that mix as well: Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Schnitzer Steel (SCHN) saw noticeable improvement in their stock performance after the election. The industry may end up benefiting from trade tariffs.July saw the start of a rally in telecom stocks, as talk of a supercycle of upgrades in high-speed network communications swept through the industry. Finisar (FNSR) and Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) are symbols of that trend, which has cooled off.Despite losing about half its value since a Sept. 7 peak, Acacia Communications (ACIA) is still ending the year nearly three times higher than the 23 price of its initial public offering on May 13.As oil prices rebounded in 2016, so did the beaten-up energy sector. About a dozen oil stocks are in today's list, more than any other sector. Continental Resources (CLR), Chart Industries (GTLS) and Unit Corp. (UNT) were some energy stocks that kept a fairly steady advance throughout the year.While industry trends underscore the success of the Top 100 stocks, bear in mind that only a few from each sector made it to the list. Indeed, that shows the value of good stock-picking skills. The history of market winners is laden with examples of companies that excelled in their groups.For a lot of stocks, the price run-ups coincided with improvement in earnings. Some went from declines back to gains. Poor performance had hurt their EPS Ratings, and that's one reason why they didn't show up in IBD screens until late in the year, if at all.Nvidia (NVDA) is a good example of finding the best an industry can offer. Known best for computer graphics technology, Nvidia was discussed in IBD 50 coverage on Feb. 22, while the stock was forming a base with a 34.04 buy point. The company's sterling fundamentals caused Nvidia's inclusion on the list.The stock was already on its way to 2016 glory, more than doubling in the first 10 months of the year. But then, a strong earnings report Nov. 11 sparked a burst that sent the stock up 77% more.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewApple, Broadcom, Nvidia Among RBC's Top Stock Picks For 2017Can Trump Revive Reagan's Stock-Market Magic?

304,UPS,"History tends to repeat itself, so your first action to make money in 2017 is to look back at 2016's trades.2016 was certainly a volatile year. Stocks were challenged multiple times by global and domestic geopolitical crises. Despite the volatility, the Nasdaq is looking to close out the year strong around all-time highs.An honest, thorough post-analysis is a great opportunity to review your previous year's stock trades with the purpose of discovering potential flaws and improving your investing skills. Investors of all disciplines can learn by contrasting the good calls — big winners you identified early and entered correctly — against those where you made the wrong move or missed taking action at all.IBD founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil created his ""Up 20% In 3 Weeks"" rule from his own post-analysis. A stock he owned went up 20% in a short period of time, pulled back and shook him out, before rebounding and rallying substantially higher.In his eyes, the biggest mistake was identifying a big winner and then messing up the trade. In response, the native Oklahoman created this rule to prevent him from getting shaken out of a potential big winner in the future.You review your own personal trades as well as the year's best performing stocks.When you analyze your trades, you want to focus on the biggest winners and the biggest losers in your portfolio. Perhaps there is a common attribute that your losers share that you can identify and mitigate. If you can eliminate a few of your biggest losers, then your performance will be greatly improved going forward.In the long run, not losing much money can be just as profitable as making money.As you analyze the year's top stocks, print them out and mark them up with a pen. Start off with proper entry points. Ideally, where should you have bought the stock? Was there a cup-with-handle, a flat base, or a double bottom?To help train your eye spotting patterns, you can use How to Make Money in Stocks"" by William J. O'Neil, or MarketSmith's Pattern Recognition feature.Next, where should you have sold the stock? Look for sell signals, both offensive and defensive. An offensive sell signal occurs on the way up, like a climax top. A defensive sell signal occurs on the way down, like a decisive break of the 50-day line.Keep in mind that being down 7%-8% from the buy point is an automatic sell rule.If the stock wasn't on your radar at all, keep an eye on IBD's stock lists, like the IBD 50, IBD Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Stock Spotlight.If you want to build your own screens with custom criteria, the quarterly MarketSmith Stock Guide can provide guidance on relevant screens in the current market. For example, the Autumn Stock Guide highlighted earnings gap ups and gap downs. The best growth stock of 2016 was Nvidia (NVDA). The stock broke out of a classic cup with handle in March 2016 and proceeded to rise 246% from its 33.16 buy point.If you mishandled it or missed it altogether, study the stock and its move so you can capitalize on a similar situation next time. Every year, stocks break out of proper chart patterns and go up more than 100%.You also want to include the general market conditions at the time to see if the distribution day count affected your overall performance. History shows that three out of four stocks follow the general market, so tracking the general market is an easy step to potentially reduce losses.Keep it simple. You need to have two or three different rules from a post-analysis. You don't want to completely overhaul your investing strategy, since it may negatively affect your positive investing traits.Similar to a batting stance in baseball, you don't want to overhaul your strategy completely -- you make adjustments and examine their impact.Investing isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. Only by continually improving yourself can you achieve long-term investing success.RELATED:The IBD 50 In 2016: A Lesson In How To Achieve Big ReturnsHow To Invest: Timeless Trading Tips By Wall Street Pro And Author Gerald Loeb

305,UPS,"Health Reform: On the eve of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and the looming repeal of ObamaCare, Democrats are making claims that the law is just now starting to work as promised. It's a convenient narrative for the left, but totally false.ObamaCare advocates point to a couple bits of news as evidence that after a rough year, the law appears to be stabilizing.Last week, the Obama administration celebrated what it called ""a record"" level of sign-ups, with enrollment up 400,000 from last year.""Today's enrollment numbers confirm that some of the doomsday predictions about the marketplace are not bearing out,"" said Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell. ""American people don't want to go backward. They don't want to gamble with their health care during a repeal and delay.""The next day, a Standard and Poor's report says industry losses from their ObamaCare plans might be tapering off, and that 2017 ""will likely see continued improvement"" with ""more insurers getting close to break-even or better.""The attempt by Democrats to make ObamaCare look healthy is transparently political. They want to pin the blame for any future problems with the law on the GOP's repeal effort. So they have no other choice but to pretend that it was working before any repeal vote is cast.But take a look at the claims being made about ObamaCare's supposed newfound health.That enrollment ""surge"" is nothing to brag about. According to the White House, enrollment is up 400,000 compared with last year. That's a gain of 6%. However, the number of new enrollees is down by 14%, which is a terrible sign for a product that middle-class families allegedly love.What's more, the administration has made it impossible to directly compare overall enrollment numbers because, unlike last year, it isn't counting those who've been automatically re-enrolled.Last year at this time, the White House said 8.3 million had either actively enrolled or were automatically re-enrolled. This year's report includes only those who've actively enrolled, which tallies up to 6.4 million.It is possible, then, that a direct comparison of total enrollment would show an overall decline.Even if the 6% gain is legitimate, the administration projected total enrollment would climb by 9% over last year, which means the current trend is actually below expectations.In any case, ObamaCare enrollment is about half of the administration's original forecasts, and far too few young people are signing up to stabilize the market, let alone bring premiums down.The Standard and Poor's report must also be taken with a large grain of salt. After all, we've heard such upbeat forecasts about insurance industry profits before, only to find out that ObamaCare costs — and resulting industry losses — were higher than expected.There's a reason that working-class voters in states who are supposedly benefiting the most from ObamaCare decided to elect the person who vowed to repeal the law, not the one who promised to fix it by applying more of the same.Democrats can keep pretending that all is well with ObamaCare, but the public knows better.RELATED:Did ObamaCare Add 20 Million To The Insurance Rolls?

307,UPS,"Tiny houses have emerged in the past decade as a promising way to house more homeless people for less money. Now the idea has gained a powerful proponent in the billionaire California real estate developer John Sobrato, who unveiled a proposal this month to build 200 micro-apartments for homeless and low-income renters in Santa Clara.Sobrato, who has spent much of his career building office space for many of Silicon Valley's technology giants, asked the Santa Clara City Council for exclusive negotiating rights to lease a 2.5-acre plot of city-owned land, three miles south of the San Francisco 49ers football stadium and currently leased to a Hyundai dealership. His plan for the lot calls for a mix of 160- and 240-square-foot units, large enough for a kitchenette and bathroom with shower, which he said could be fashioned out of repurposed shipping containers.""I think it's time to turn my attention to creating a very cost-effective solution to housing the homeless and very low-income people,"" Sobrato said at a Dec. 6 meeting of the Council, video of which is posted online. ""Instead of sleeping in a pup tent or under an overpass, Santa Clara homeless folks will have a clean, dignified, safe place to call home.""The history of the project dates back to 2005, when the city acquired the empty lot with an eye to building affordable housing. Funding for that project fell through, and the property sat vacant. In October, Sobrato wrote a letter to Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor laying out the novel proposal.Under the plan, the developer asked for a 57-year lease at the cost of $1 a year. In return, the Sobrato Organization, based in Cupertino, would build and own the apartments, then lease them back to Santa Clara County, which would hire property management and homeless service providers. The project, called Innovation Place, could open as soon as 2018, with half the units rented to homeless and half offered to renters earning between 50% and 80% of the area's median income.The proposal was reported this month by the Santa Clara Weekly. An online petition opposing the plan, posted anonymously, has gained more than 100 signatures.Sobrato didn't respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.Santa Clara County is a ripe setting for such a project, defined by highflying tech workers and hyper-expensive housing markets — median rent in the county was $3,520 a month, according to Zillow data. Despite the thriving local economy, or perhaps because of it, the county had more than 6,500 homeless residents in 2015, among the highest totals in the U.S. The county spends about $520 million a year providing health care and other services to its homeless population, according to a report last year.Sobrato, 77, has erected office buildings and research labs for the companies that generate much of the region's wealth. He started out selling homes in the 1950s before moving into commercial real estate in the 1970s to take advantage of the region's nascent technology boom. Over the next three decades, Sobrato's company developed more than 150 buildings, helping the developer amass a fortune of $5.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Sobrato, who has promised to give away his entire fortune, stepped down from daily operations of his company in 2013 to focus on the philanthropic mission of making Silicon Valley ""a place of opportunity for all its residents."" Much of that work has revolved around education and skills training for low-income students and workers.The plan to build micro-apartments taps into a handful of converging trends, including the ""housing first"" approach to alleviating homelessness, which prioritizes providing permanent housing ahead of other services. That movement, in turn, has led advocates to light on the idea of tiny homes as a way of providing cheap, decent housing to a larger number of people. It has gained traction in Dallas, Detroit, and Portland, Ore., among other cities.The notion of repurposing shipping containers as cheap, very small apartments has also attracted attention. The San Francisco-based real estate developer Panoramic Interests has been touting a plan to retrofit the steel containers as stackable pod apartments, while sky-high Bay Area rents have created a new class of landlords letting out communal living spaces, including a warehouse filled with shipping containers.Mock-ups presented to the Santa Clara City Council showed the apartments constructed out of shipping containers. Sobrato said they could also be built out of another modular system, or by traditional, ground-up construction.It's still early days for the housing project. Sobrato's appearance before the Santa Clara City Council was in support of his request for an exclusive negotiation for a ground lease on the property; the Council granted that by unanimous vote. Beyond that approval, the developer asked for support for the project in the face of community opposition, a problem that has roiled plans to build homeless shelters and low-income housing from New York to Los Angeles.""I expect that the Council will hear from somebody in the neighborhood. There's always some Nimby that you're going to hear from that's going to object to the project,"" he told the Council at the Dec. 6 meeting, referring to Not In My Back Yard. ""We want to make sure that at the end of the day you're going to be there for us.""Gillmor, the mayor, said that even if the city agreed to the lease, the project would need to go through the approval process that governs all new construction. Still, she offered qualified support.""Right now we're housing cars on the property. That's a waste,"" Gillmor said. ""I think we should look at housing people.""RELATED: Entrepreneurs Fit A Tiny House Into An Anti-Vacation PackageAffordable-Housing Crunch Moves Inland To Modest-Sized U.S. CitiesDevelopers Rehab Rust Belt Relics Into Luxury Hotels

309,UPS,"For financial planners, a minor mistake can cause major headaches. One small slip-up can prove costly.XBecause small mistakes often trigger large problems, advisors adopt processes and systems to prevent mishaps. They harness technology, provide staff training and create procedural safeguards to ensure accuracy and manage compliance tasks.Despite their best efforts, however, many advisors recall the sting of a simple error — and its lasting repercussions. To avoid a recurrence, they learn to identify operational red flags and deploy resources to run a tighter ship.""My experience is (that) little mistakes can balloon into big problems,"" said Steve Branton, a certified financial planner in San Francisco. ""Having a structure in place to make sure you check all the details"" can minimize the odds of errors, omissions or oversights.Branton has taken a series of steps to reduce the likelihood of small mistakes. Like many advisors, he uses customer relationship management (CRM) software to capture client data, track account activity and prompt action items such as submitting documentation on a timely basis.He also prepares for client meetings by drafting all the necessary paperwork and asking account holders to confirm accuracy. To facilitate communication among third parties, he has clients sign release authorization forms.""That way, we can speak to their CPA, attorneys and other professionals,"" he said. ""An accountant or attorney cannot share certain information with us without a signed authorization from a client, due to privacy rules. With that authorization in place, we can be much more proactive"" on the client's behalf.Early in his career, Branton saw firsthand how a tiny mistake could mushroom into a mess. Inheriting an aging client with a $1 million IRA, he realized upon the client's death that the primary beneficiary was a trust.""The surviving spouse faced a very tax-inefficient situation,"" he said. ""She should've been listed as the primary beneficiary.""To save the widow a hefty tax bill, Branton spent four months working with the custodian to orchestrate a spousal rollover. He had to enlist every potential beneficiary of the trust — including the couple's adult children — to notarize that they approved of transferring the IRA directly to the surviving spouse.Since then, Branton has conducted annual client reviews of all listed beneficiaries. He checks account titling and transfer capabilities, especially between tax-deferred retirement accounts and trusts. He also participates in monthly meetings with nine other advisors at his firm, Mosaic Financial Partners, to review best practices, assess processes and propose new ways to improve operations.Clear client communication keeps everyone on the same page. Advisors often find that completing documents (such as change requests on insurance polices or updates to beneficiary arrangements or property records) requires close coordination with clients.Pat Renn, an Atlanta-based certified financial planner, holds monthly client meetings by phone that usually run 20 to 40 minutes. The agenda largely flows from a customized checklist that his aide prepares for each call.""With this 'client roadmap' we can review everything to make sure we have current information,"" Renn said. ""When my assistant makes the appointment, she has the checklist in front of her and goes over what's on the list"" so that the client comes prepared.Experienced advisors know that the potential for mistakes increases when clients face tight deadlines or try to execute transactions that involve third parties. A seemingly innocent misunderstanding can lead to severe unintended consequences.""The biggest errors occur when money is in motion,"" said Scott Bishop, a Houston-based certified financial planner. ""So I'm always telling my team that we need to double-check and communicate, communicate, communicate when money is moving.""Like Renn, Bishop is a fan of using checklists as error-prevention tools. He has developed action items for many scenarios including a sequence of to-do steps after a client dies.""Every time we make a little mistake, we learn from it and I make another checklist for our operations manual,"" Bishop said.After nearly two decades as an advisor, Bishop has learned that asking the right questions — and getting accurate answers — goes a long way toward eliminating errors. When clients seek to sell a mutual fund, for example, Bishop will ask, ""What's your tax basis on that fund so that I can compute your capital gain?""Documenting client responses in a consistent manner adds another layer of protection to ward off snafus. Renn and his team take detailed notes of all client conversations and highlight any pending actions.""I'll dictate into an iPhone what we agreed to do,"" Renn said. ""It's all very specific with the time, date and next steps.""

U.S. diversified stock funds were left with a 9.05% year-to-date return.Mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD expect many of their opportunities for new gains to come from technology innovators and from ""quality"" companies — firms capable of churning out earnings growth even in a slow economic growth environment.Factors that heartened investors last month included a weak dollar, which boosted U.S. exports, said manager Daniel Strickberger, whose $211 million Touchstone Large Company Growth Fund (TSAGX) topped 95% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct in August. In addition, manufacturing showed strength, based on the monthly Institute of Supply Management report. Overall U.S. employment posted gains, though less than in July.""Retail sales and consumer sentiment were pretty good,"" Joy said.But negative factors included soft inflation numbers, which is a sign of tepid overall economic growth. The defeat of health care reform signaled that tax reform and infrastructure spending are uncertain, Joy said.And geopolitical tension involving North Korea contributed to investors' skittishness, Strickberger said.In addition, low inflation could help persuade the Federal Reserve to slow its interest-rate hikes. ""Interest rates are heading to where they were six to nine months ago,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 97% of its large-cap growth rivals last month. ""Over the long run, falling rates usually help utilities and hurt financials.""In contrast to U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, world stock mutual funds eked out a 0.84% gain in August. Latin American funds led that charge, rising 4.35%.Many investors sought safe havens last month. Taxable bond funds in general advanced an average of 0.51%. They were led by U.S. Treasury bond mutual funds, which gained 1.93%. Muni funds also advanced on average. And precious metals stock mutual funds topped sector fund categories, racking up a 6.10% advance.Despite August's market blahs, Ameriprise's Joy is guardedly optimistic going forward. U.S. economic growth remains muted but positive, he said. Global growth, at least in developed markets, is at its strongest since the recession. Many foreign central banks are continuing monetary policies that support stocks. And he expects large U.S. businesses to continue to benefit from a weak dollar through at least year-end.Model portfolios that Ameriprise recommends to its financial advisors' clients remain overweight in the technology sector, which in general still has room to run, Joy said. Those model portfolios' weightings in emerging markets stocks have also been boosted but are still underweight.China remains strong. Latin American economies are healing, he said.Fidelity's DuFour also sees attractive trends in the tech sector. Digital advertising, electronic payments and the growth of exchange traded funds (ETFs) ""are areas to get excited about,"" he said. He cited holdings as of July 31.A digital advertising name in which he had a stake was Adobe Systems (ADBE). Its business model has morphed. It used to sell its programs via computer disks through brick-and-mortar retailers. Customers would have to upgrade by buying new disks every few years.""They've evolved into software-as-a-service, where you pay on a monthly basis, and you've always got access to the latest version of a program,"" DuFour said.Once you create your digital product, Adobe also can monitor the online traffic it attracts and help clients manage online advertising campaigns. In addition, they have a commercial image library. That multiservice approach positions Adobe to benefit from the growth of digital media and online advertising, DuFour said.""PayPal (PYPL) is growing with the growth of electronic payments around the world,"" DuFour said. ""They have done a good job of increasing the number of places that accept PayPal, and they have a higher percentage of online transactions than physical store ones. As online commerce grows at the expense of physical stores, they are net gainers.""PayPal also owns Venmo, which is a payments service that lets users divvy up payments for shared goods or services. It is popular among millennials.S&P Global (SPGI) is poised to benefit from the growth of ETFs. The company has exited education books and ownership of Businessweek to focus on three areas in which the company provides data to clients. One of those areas consists of the indexes that customers like State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) license for the ETFs that they build and operate. ""S&P Global's business is very exciting and has very substantial margins,"" DuFour said.In other sectors, Touchstone's Strickberg cites Zoetis (ZTS) as ""the sort of quality, predictable growth company we like. We want companies that will prosper whether U.S. GDP growth is 0% or 3%,"" he said.Roughly half of sales by the developer of animal medicines and vaccines are for livestock rather than pets. Commercial agricultural sales don't fluctuate much in economic ups and downs. That steadiness makes it ""the kind of business we look for,"" Strickberger said.The $9.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX), a large-cap growth fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, edged up 0.36% last month. It owns ASML Holding (ASML), a Dutch maker of lithography systems used to create computer chips. Shares have climbed 39% this year.The stock has a very strong 98 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.IBD'S TAKE: ASML's A SMR Rating means the semiconductor equipment maker is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula. Buying stocks with high SMR ratings at proper buy points increases your chances of investment success.  RELATED:Here's An Easy Routine To Get You Started In Stock InvestingWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Some Investors Turns More Defensive Even As Market Rises Again

315,UPS,"The next earnings season for fiber-optic network part makers gets underway on Wednesday, when down-on-its-luck Infinera (INFN) reports, followed by bellwether Lumentum Holdings (LITE) after the close Thursday.Oclaro (OCLR) reports fiscal Q1 earnings on Nov. 1, followed by Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) and NeoPhotonics (NPTN), which both report Q3 earnings on Nov. 3. Former hot IPO Acacia Communications  (ACIA), which has upped Q3 guidance amid a secondary stock offering that pummeled its shares, is slated to report on Nov. 10. Ciena (CIEN) and Finisar (FNSR) are expected to report results in early December.IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics group is still ranked No. 1 out of 197 industry sectors, where it's ranked for most of the past eight weeks, but many stocks have cooled off after recent run-ups. The group is back trading above its 50-day moving average, though, after a 3.9% jump Monday. The group fell 2.5%, by the closing bell on the stock market today.Demand for cloud services has been driving data center networking upgrades by internet companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google to 100-gigabit-per-second technology. Telecom companies led by Verizon Communications (VZ) have been upgrading communications networks in metropolitan areas. And China's demand for optical parts has boomed.IBD'S TAKE: Looking at hot industry groups is one option to narrow down possible stocks to buy. Another option, look at IBD's Sector Leaders, where stocks such as Broadcom, Facebook, Gigamon, GrubHub and NetEase are listed.For Lumentum, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect revenue of $252 million for its fiscal Q1 ended Sept. 24, up 19% from the year-earlier quarter and accelerating from 16% year-over-year growth the previous two quarters, with EPS minus items rising 69% to 44 cents.JDS Uniphase spun off Lumentum last year.Lumentum stock ended Tuesday trading down 1.3% to 40.85, but shares have soared 87% in 2016. It has a Relative Strength Rating of 98, putting it among the top 2% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.Shares of Acacia were plunged 5.2% Tuesday to 86.50, while Oclaro lost 1% to 8.24. Ciena slid 0.8% in the regular session but was up more than 2% after the close to 20.30. Infinera stock was down more than 1% to 8.78. Infinera and Ciena make system-level components as well as modules that plug-into networks.Infinera stock plummeted in July after the company's guidance disappointed. For Q3, analysts estimate Infinera's revenue will fall 20% to $186 million, with EPS falling 101%.For Oclaro's fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 1, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect revenue will jump 50% to $132 million, while the company swings to earnings per shares minus items of 10 cents from a 2-cent loss in the year-earlier period.Applied Optoelectronics' Q3 revenue is projected to climb 12% to $64 million, and EPS ex items are seen falling 30% to 28 cents.RELATED: Spinoff Is Best Thing That Ever Happened To Young Fiber-Optic FirmMarket-Leading Fiber-Optic Stocks Suffer Heavy DamageU.S. Optical Firms Dominate Supercycle As Chinese Rivals Lag

316,UPS,"Indexes weakened in afternoon trading Tuesday, as earnings reports caused a tumble for General Motors (GM) and for home-improvement stocks.The Nasdaq was down 0.5% and the S&P 500 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average did a little better, down 0.2% as components Procter & Gamble (PG) and Merck (MRK) rose following earnings reports.Volume was running higher on the Nasdaq and NYSE.The building products industry and other home-improvement stocks were rattled in a combination of weak earnings reports and a poor outlook from a major appliance maker. Air conditioning and heating, construction products, wood products, paints and appliances were industry groups down 2% to 6%.Masco (MAS) plunged nearly 10% in heavy trading, falling below the long-term 200-day moving average. The stock had been forming a base-on-base pattern, but is now seriously damaged. Masco missed third-quarter profit expectations, and sales growth of 2% continued a trend of flat or low single-digit gains dating back to 2015. Masco — which makes doors, windows, plumbing fixtures and other construction products — is exiting its lower-margin cabinet business.BMC Stock Holdings (BMCH) fell 5% in rapid trade. The supplier of lumber and other building products has been trading below the 200-day moving average for about two weeks. It's been below the 50-day line since Sept. 9.Whirlpool (WHR) gapped down to a loss of more than 11% in the highest volume since at least April 26, where there was a similar earnings-related sell-off. The appliance manufacturer missed profit and sales estimates and it cut its full-year earnings outlook. Whirlpool expects to earn $14 to $14.25 a share in 2016, down from an earlier forecast of as high as $14.75. The company cited soft demand in the U.S. and the U.K. and the weakening of the British pound.General Motors skidded 4% in heavy volume. The stock dipped below its 50-day moving average but shares remained in a long sideways pattern. The automaker beat profit and sales expectations and it forecast full-year earnings at the high end of $5.50-$6; that's above analysts' consensus of $5.85. But GM warned it may miss its 2016 European profit target due to Brexit. It also saw a softening in the U.S. auto market.Waters (WAT) gapped down to a loss of nearly 12% in huge volume after it reported Q3 profit that met the consensus estimate. The maker of products for drug development reported adjusted earnings of $1.57 a share, up 11%, on sales of $526.8 million, a 5% increase. Waters had been a leading stock, mounting a 15% gain from a 140.80 buy point. It was forming a new base, but Tuesday's crash has roiled the pattern.Metals stocks were leading the market, and a high-rated part of that sector made a breakout.Ternium (TX) jumped nearly 5% as it topped the 23.69 buy point of a cup-without-handle base. Volume was running four times the average, leaving little doubt that a stampede of institutional investors was buying shares. The Luxembourg-based steel producer is in talks to acquire a steel plant in Brazil from Germany's ThyssenKrupp, according to reports.RELATED:GM Sinks On Europe Warning; United Tech Ups View; Cat, 3M Guide LowApple Earnings After The Close: What To ExpectLockheed Martin Soars On Outlook But F-35 Contract Talks Drag On

317,UPS,"In an era when more than 80% of the active managers fail to beat their benchmark index, finding a mutual fund that consistently achieves the elusive element of alpha is akin to finding the Holy Grail.USAA Growth Fund (USAAX) is one of those funds. This portfolio of large-cap growth stocks has beaten its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. year to date, as well as in the past one, three, five and 10 years. And it has beaten the S&P 500 stock index in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2015, it returned 5.63% vs. the S&P's 1.38%.Lately much of its outperformance has been driven by such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alibaba (BABA).The portfolio managers are Michael Schroer of Renaissance Investment Management and Aziz Hamzaogullari of Loomis Sayles. They each separately manage half the portfolio. Schroer has been with the fund since 1991 and Hamzaogullari since 2010.The fund's strategy is to look for high-quality companies that can generate sustainable and profitable growth. When the managers see stocks selling at a significant discount to their estimate of intrinsic value, they snap them up. This leads to a small portfolio of just 92 companies. The fund also has a very long-term investment horizon, seen in its 31% portfolio turnover rate.Still, even a fund that consistently outperforms has moments when it doesn't. So far this year, it's underperforming the S&P 500 5.90% to 6.61%.""We favor companies that are high quality growth selling at a reasonable valuation,"" said Schroer. ""In the first half of the year lower P/E growth didn't do well. Higher P/E companies led the market, but by the later part of the year that reversed and lower P/E companies are doing better and we've benefited from that. We're in the sweet spot for the market where lower P/E, higher quality are doing better.""Another part of the strategy, this one favored by the Loomis Sayles team, is described as high ""active share."" Active share is a way of measuring how much a portfolio differs from its benchmark index. ""Our active share has been at or above 80%,"" Hamzaogullari told IBD late last year. ""While it does not ensure outperformance, we believe it is a necessary condition for generating alpha and outperforming the benchmark, net of fees, over the long term.""U.S. stocks make up 90% of the fund, with the rest in foreign equities. Technology makes up 27% of the portfolio.Amazon as of July 31 stood as USAA Growth's largest holding, at about 4% of assets. The stock made up the entire retail-internet segment of the fund. Amazon is up 21% this year, sitting just above support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back 3% from its all time high set Oct. 6. Analysts expect Amazon to post Q3 earnings 371% higher than a year earlier when it reports results Thursday.Facebook is the No. 2 holding also at about 4% of assets. The social networking and media leader is up 24% year to date near the 28.43 buy point of a flat base. Fiscal Q1 earnings are expected to rise 70% from a year earlier when results are reported, expected Nov. 2 after the market's close.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giants and another top fund holding, is up 28% so far this year. The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 52-week high. The company is expect to show a fiscal Q2 earnings increase of 23% when it reports Tuesday.Not all USAA Growth top holdings have been barn burners. Database bellwether Oracle (ORCL) is up 5% this year. It's been in the fund since 2007.The rest of the top 10 holdings and their percentages are: Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3.24%; Visa (V), 3.11%; Qualcomm (QCOM), 2.89%; Monster Beverage (MNST), 2.52%; Alphabet (GOOGL), 2.48%; United Parcel Services (UPS), 2.37%.""We think technology and consumer discretionary look attractive,"" said Schroer. ""Health care still looks attractive. Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) still look very cheap. In this market there are still high quality companies.""Schroer likes Foot Locker (FL). The athletic shoe retailer posted very good second-quarter sales and still trades at a ""very reasonable multiple of 14."" The stock is up only 4.4% this year.""Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) and both are doing well over the last several months,"" said Schroer. ""They had sold off on fears of the Zika virus hurting tourism, but they didn't suffer too much. Now bookings for next year are running high and multiples are very attractive, Royal's trailing P-E is 13 and Carnival's is 14.""We've taken some things off the table, but we still think there are selective opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""We've gone through six quarters of negative earnings growth and we're watching this quarter carefully for signs of a rebound.

318,UPS,"Halliburton (HAL) is still in a ""brawl"" on pricing with competitors, despite the recent rebound in crude and drilling activity, and signaled Wednesday it's open to increasing its prices even if it means losing some customers.The oilfield services provider and rivals like Schlumberger (SLB) slashed the prices they charged during the depths of the oil bust. As oil headed back up this year, they indicated such discounts would be taken back.But Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar said on a conference call that while the industry can see ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" and unconventional drilling was leading the oil price recovery, the market is still ""very challenging.""The company doesn't expect activity in North America to increase in Q4 as customer activity is typically lower on holiday- and weather-related closures. Lesar said some customers were delaying drilling ramp-ups until Q1. By then, they could see higher prices.""We have the highest market share that we've ever had in the U.S.,"" Lesar said. ""If we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach.""Halliburton reported Q3 earnings per share of a penny vs. analysts' views for a loss of 7 cents, prompting Lesar to say, ""I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit.""Revenue sank 31% to $3.83 billion, below views for $3.89 billion. Operating margin jumped to 3.3% from 0.8% a year ago.Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai said Halliburton should see pricing improvements on services in North America in Q4 or Q1, but it could be a year before prices rise internationally.""Schlumberger mentioned previously that in some of their contracts they had an oil price slider,"" he told IBD. ""They gave a lot of discounts, but if oil prices improved they had to get better pricing. I think there is a similar case at Halliburton.""Halliburton shares were up 4.25% to 49.07 on the stock market today, gapping up above buying range after bobbing above and below its entry point for the last week. Schlumberger (SLB) rose 2.5% to 83.44 clearing an 82.54 buy point. Baker Hughes (BHI) rallied 2.4% to 52.83, closing just below a 52.93 pivot after breaking out last week.Also adding momentum to shares in the energy sector was a rally in oil prices, helped by a drop in U.S. crude inventories.IBD'S TAKE: Oilfield service providers are expected to be the first in the oil patch to see stock gains as oil prices increase. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes are near buy range as oil bounces around $50. Desai, who now sees Halliburton breaking even in Q4 vs. a prior view of a loss of 10 cents a share, said the oil price needed for renewed activity has been falling, but doesn't expect it to fall much below $50 per barrel as drilling-improvement gains are maxed out.On the conference call, Lesar maintained that ""significant activity increases starts with sustainable commodity prices of over $50 per barrel.""Schlumberger reports Thursday. Baker Hughes, whose merger with Halliburton was called off earlier this year over antitrust concerns, reports Oct. 25.RELATED:Schlumberger To Take Back Discounts As Oil Recovers U.S. Oil Rig Count Up For 7th Week As Crude Rises For 4th Week Oil Markets Could Rebalance In Early 2017 If OPEC Keeps Deal

319,UPS," How many more broadcast bust-ups will it take before America finally decides to make its presidential election debates tolerable again? I can't take it anymore. Can you?For the past three cycles -- 2008, 2012, and 2016 -- I've chronicled the depressing, systemic bias of left-leaning partisans whom the Commission on Presidential Debates routinely installs as ""moderators."" It would be one thing if these activists posing as journalists were upfront about their political preferences. But they continue to star in phony debate theater wearing their dime-store costumes of objectivity.The even bigger farce? Masochistic Republican Party bosses let them get away with it year after year after year.Note to President Obama: This is not ""whining."" This is truth-telling. I find it rather rich that the complainer-in-chief who spent two terms incessantly attacking Fox News and conservative talk radio is now wagging his waggy-licious finger at anyone else who bears grievances against hostile media and its enablers.In 2008, the Commission on Presidential Debates allowed liberal PBS anchor Gwen Ifill to serve as unfettered moderator for the sole vice presidential debate. As I reported at the time, Ifill had failed to disclose before the event that she had a book coming out on Jan. 20, 2009 -- a date that just happens to coincide with the inauguration of the next president of the United States -- titled ""Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.""The promotional material left no question about Ifill's perspective. She hyped Obama's campaign as ""stunning"" and marveled at his ""bold new path to political power."" She also used her access to author a hagiographic pop culture piece for Essence magazine about the Obama family.When asked to respond to criticism about her ideological and financial conflicts of interest, Ifill acted like a true-blue leftist and played the race card.This year's vice presidential debate ""moderator"" didn't fare much better. Billed as a ""historic"" choice because of her Filipino heritage, Elaine Quijano was a historic doormat for Clinton's babbling running mate, Tim Kaine. Her media cheerleaders, led by The New York Times' Nick Kristof, naturally invoked the gender card to defend her embarrassing passivity.Another ""diversity"" moderator, Telemundo celebrity journalist Maria Celeste Arraras, known as ""the Katie Couric of Spanish TV,"" soaked up nearly half a CNN GOP primary debate earlier this year representing ""the Latino community"" on issues such as Puerto Rico's bankruptcy.2012, of course, was the year of Bitter Candy -- CNN's Candy Crowley. She notoriously injected herself into the second debate (a town hall debate that was supposed to spotlight citizens' questions) by arguing with then-GOP nominee Mitt Romney about Benghazi and running interference for Obama.Crowley was just the latest Democratic plant at a CNN-sponsored election debate. The network has a long history of passing off partisan operatives as ""ordinary people"" and ""undecided voters"" during town halls while failing to disclose their political affiliations to viewers.Moreover, there's no telling how many CNN contributors are acting as moles for Democratic campaigns. We know of at least one. This week, CNN host Jake Tapper was forced to admit that a WikiLeaks-published email showing CNN contributor and DNC head Donna Brazile had tipped off the Clinton campaign in advance to town hall questions was ""horrifying.""And four years ago, we also endured the spectacle of Clinton adviser-turned-ABC newsman George Stephanopoulos pushing the Democrats' ""war on women"" propaganda by pressing Republicans on a nonsense contraceptive ban.Yet, the debate commission and the Republican National Committee keep drawing from the same tainted well of cloistered media personalities. Establishment journos Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC News were repeat moderators this year -- with disastrous results. Raddatz, another left-wing PBS alumna and Beltway fixture, created her own bitter Candy moment at the second presidential debate last week when she lost her marbles over Syria and scrapped with Donald Trump over Syria. He was right to call the townhall charade a ""one on three"" battle.Actually, ""one on three"" is not quite accurate. As the Center for Public Integrity revealed this week, a whopping 96% of the nearly $400,000 in presidential campaign donations from ""people identified in federal campaign finance filings as journalists, reporters, news editors or television news anchors -- as well as other donors known to be working in journalism"" has gone to Hillary Clinton.Wham! There's your fact-check of the year, my fellow journalists. I'm looking at you in particular, Washington Post reporter Chris Cillizza. Annoyed by mounting social media criticism of liberal reporters tilting their coverage, he tweeted this week: ""Let me say for the billionth time: Reporters don't root for a side. Period.""Denial ain't just a river in Egypt. It's the fuel that sustains the Fourth Estate's undeserved superiority complex and monopoly over the debates. What would be so wrong with allowing open, transparent, informed partisan journalists from all sides of the political aisle a bite at the presidential debate apple? Abandon the pretenses. Put all the ideological cards on the table. Make the debates honest and tolerable again.The problem isn't the partisan press. It's the poseur press.

320,UPS,"Not even Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or Brexit have affected appetites for Domino's Pizza (DPZ), as its shares jumped more than 6% on earnings Tuesday, and its chief executive said he expects more consolidation among fast-casual rivals as the company grows.CEO Patrick Doyle told Investor's Business Daily that the company has no interest in participating in a merger via acquisition, but he said some fast-casual pizza restaurants could probably come together as more pop up.""At some point, scale matters, and there are enough different players within that category that I'm sure you will see some consolidation at some point,"" he said.During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Doyle also said enough fast-casual restaurants started up at the same time and have a similar approach that tie-ups were likely.That consolidation would come as Domino's tries to position itself as a better-ingredient pizza chain and as bigger players in the business take market share from smaller competitors.The consolidation would also follow Domino's outperforming a slumping restaurant sector. Domino's third-quarter U.S. same-store sales jumped 13%, well above views for an 8.8% increase, the company said on Tuesday.Earnings soared 43.3% to 96 cents a share, topping estimates for 90 cents. Overall revenue rose 16.9% to $566.7 million.Shares ended trading up nearly 5% to 159.45 on the stock market today. The stock saw a similar bounce after Domino's reported second-quarter earnings, but shares in recent weeks had trended closer to their 50-day line, a key test of investor support.International comp sales climbed 6.6%. The stronger dollar, particularly against the pound, remained difficult, as it has for other companies with a presence in the U.K. But Doyle said he doesn't anticipate this summer's Brexit vote hurting U.K. demand.""It still has to play out, and you're still a couple years away from the actual exit taking place,"" he said of the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. ""But honestly, I think that was overplayed at the time on just how big an effect that might have on the U.K. economy and on the global economy.""Shares of Domino's and Papa John's (PZZA) have been outliers in a restaurant industry where comparable store sales have lagged due to value-meal-related discounting. Consumers also appear more likely to eat in or order in as grocery prices fall and anxieties about global events weigh.Fast-food bellwether McDonald's (MCD) reports Friday and total sales are expected to continue declining.During the call, Doyle said that frozen-pizza offerings at grocery stores have not affected Domino's sales all that much, adding that they were more likely to cannibalize other frozen food.""Despite how they've tried to position themselves, one more sale of frozen pizza is one less sale of frozen lasagna,"" Doyle said on the call.Domino's and Papa John's, analysts say, have benefited from a variety of factors. Lower ingredient costs in general have allowed for healthier margins for the business and more value — and food — for consumers. Digital ordering technology also lends itself more easily to the pizza business, where customers have already been ordering delivery over the phone for decades.Analysts had been watching to see if Domino's could continue to buck the trends seen with other restaurants.""This quarter further demonstrates Domino's ability to leverage its digital platform to consistently take market share in a mature, slow growth category,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh wrote in a research note.""Domino's posted the best Q2 domestic same-store sales growth of the 25 largest restaurant chains in the U.S. -- and now looks poised to do so again in Q3, likely by a wide margin,"" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Since breaking out of a cup base on July 21, Domino's shares have continued to rise, staying above their 50-day line and earning a place on IBD's Leaderboard. On Tuesday's earnings, shares jumped out but could be extended, signaling a note of caution for new investors.Domino's results follow a difficult third quarter for Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands (YUM). Pizza Hut's same-store sales slid 1% during the quarter.""We believe that Domino's particularly took share from Pizza Hut (which reported a 2% same-store sales decline for its third quarter), regional pizza concepts, and mom-and-pop pizza shops,"" Kalinowski wrote.Smaller pizza restaurants are likely to suffer as Domino's strengthens its digital ordering platform, Kalinowski said. Domino's last month launched a bot that allows U.S. customers to order pizza via Facebook (FB) Messenger, following ordering platforms it has introduced via Amazon (AMZN) and Twitter (TWTR).Doyle would not comment specifically on what other platforms the company was targeting, saying it would continue to look at where their customers spend their time.Even as anxiety about the election and global events weigh elsewhere, Doyle said he hasn't seen any meaningful change in consumer behavior as a result. Instead, he credited company fundamentals for Domino's success, rather than a greater desire to eat in due to that anxiety.And he said a dip in demand for Election Day, typically a big night for pizza orders, appeared unlikely, even as the presidential campaign takes on a darker, meaner tone.""Any time people are gathering around television sets, we're going to feel a positive effect from that,"" Doyle said.""In terms of its overall effect on a quarter, it's just not big enough that you'll actually feel it in our numbers,"" he continued. ""Certainly anything that becomes a spectator sport — and this election has clearly become a spectator sport — is going to have some positive effect.""RELATED:Kroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-MartForget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar Stores

321,UPS,"Which party is going to control the House and hold a majority in the Senate in January 2017? Even if you regard the presidential contest as over -- a proposition for which there is powerful evidence, including Donald Trump's current campaign message choices -- the answers to those questions are, respectively, mildly and very unclear.The Trump campaign has a legitimate gripe against mainstream media for their nonstop coverage of the groping charges against him and their downplaying -- or complete blackout -- of the WikiLeaks and other revelations about Hillary Clinton and her supporters inside and outside the Obama administration. Does she really, as she swore under oath, have no recollection of key facts about her email servers?Her advisers' contempt for the Roman Catholic faith and willingness to use politics and government to transform it should put a chill up the spine of anyone who thinks the Framers got it right with the First Amendment in banning the federal government from prohibiting the free exercise of religion.Mainstream (and other) media were happy to give Trump lots of airtime in the primaries, while the Clinton folks, we learn, tried to manipulate the nomination process in his favor. But the First Amendment guarantees a free press, not a fair one. Any Republican candidate has to expect unfair treatment, and one vulnerable to damaging last-minute stories maybe shouldn't run.So far, the evidence suggests that the effect of all this on down-ballot races is less than you might think. Americans have been voting mostly straight party tickets for 20 years, as the major parties' presidential and congressional candidates have been closely aligned. The Republicans are obviously not so aligned this year. The fact that Trump hasn't been endorsed by the men who won six of the past seven Republican nominations underlines the point.Polling conducted between Sept. 26 (when the first debate was) and Oct. 12, according to FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten, shows Trump losing ground in all the 26 states with Senate races being polled. But it also shows Republican candidates gaining ground -- some a little, some a lot -- in 24 of the 26 states. The exceptions are Illinois, where Republican incumbent Mark Kirk has always been the underdog, and Colorado.Senate races are relatively high-visibility contests. Enten's numbers show that even as Trump's chances have fallen, Republican Senate candidates have gained ground in key races in Wisconsin (where many had given up on incumbent Ron Johnson), Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Nevada (the one possible Republican gain). His website rates the chances of Republicans limiting their net loss to three, which would guarantee their majority, as slightly under 50%.There's not much publicly available polling in House races -- aside from the two parties' committees' releases, which understandably are limited to those showing their side winning or doing better than expected. But information about district demographics provided by The Cook Political Report's David Wasserman helps identify districts where a Trump downdraft could cost Republicans seats.Of the 26 Republican seats Cook labels toss-ups or only leaning Republican, only eight have large pluralities of anti-Trump demographic groups -- e.g., Latinos and white college grads -- over non-college-educated whites, who lean toward him. And five have many more non-college-educated whites than college grads and Latinos combined.Republicans also stand to lose a net one or two seats because of mid-decade redistricting. And they have fewer targets -- only seven Democratic seats are rated toss-ups or leaning by Cook -- for offsetting gains. Wasserman forecasts the net Republican loss at 10 to 15, with Democrats needing 30 to make Nancy Pelosi speaker again.Paul Ryan's widely reported conference call Oct. 10, the morning after the second presidential debate, gave approval to what had already been going on -- disavowal, to varying degrees, by Republican House members in anti-Trump-leaning districts. Some leading authorities, including Karl Rove and National Review Editor Rich Lowry, think it unwise to have gone public on this. Better to keep mum and let members do their thing.The problem with this is the one factor pollsters have trouble projecting -- turnout. If voters believe that Hillary Clinton is sure to be elected, they might elect Republican senators and representatives as a check and balance. But some Republican-leaning voters might be so dismayed or disgusted as to not bother voting at all. Ryan's message to them is that it still matters.Turnout has been declining, not increasing, during the Obama years, and the Clinton campaign is clearly worried about low turnout, especially among millennials. The Senate and House contests may turn on which side's turnout sags most.

322,UPS,"Apple (AAPL) stock jumped on Wednesday after Taiwan-based DigiTimes reported that the company has increased its part and component orders for its recently released iPhone 7 series smartphones.Apple finished trading up 0.8% to 113.95 on the stock market today. Apple stock has been choppy over the last two weeks as investors try to gauge whether the company's 10th-generation handset is a success. The DigiTimes report provided a sign that iPhone sales are looking up.Taiwan-based touch-panel makers told DigiTimes that Apple's iPhone 7 orders for the fourth quarter are 20% to 30% higher than expected.Shipments of iPhone 7 handsets from contract manufacturers are expected to reach 80 million to 84 million units in the second half of 2016, compared with 85 million to 90 million iPhone 6S shipped in the same period last year, DigiTimes said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 54, meaning it has outperformed 54% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more details on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi on Wednesday reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 125.He said the iPhone 7 lineup will boost Apple's average selling price for its smartphones, thanks to higher data storage configurations and a mix shift to the premium Plus models.His analysis indicates that iPhone average selling prices could increase from a recent low of $595 in fiscal Q3 to $679 in fiscal Q1 2017. (Apple's fiscal 2017 starts Sept. 25.)""We believe that consensus estimates for iPhone 7 ASPs of $659 in the December quarter (fiscal Q1 2017) may be too conservative,"" Sacconaghi said. ""For full year fiscal 2017, higher-than-expected ASP strength could provide the equivalent revenue boost of about 6 million incremental iPhone unit sales.""Potential iPhone ASP strength could provide a cushion to fiscal Q1 consensus revenue estimates, he said.""Collectively, the December quarter's additional week (of sales) and potentially higher ASPs could add over 10% to iPhone revenues year over year,"" Sacconaghi said.RELATED:Aetna Will Subsidize Apple Watch In Health Care Win For AppleApple iPhone 7 Sales Forecast Upped On Samsung Woes, High-End Models

323,UPS,"Former supermodel Kathy Ireland learned about facing down adversity on the first day of her newspaper route at age 11. The job's ad had called for a boy to deliver the heavy papers by bike, but she insisted that she could do it.""One man was standing in his driveway as I came up and started yelling that it was a boy's job and I'd never last,"" Ireland told IBD during a break on the set of one of her TV shows in Los Angeles. ""I was determined not to let him see me cry and to prove him wrong.""She was named her delivery district's Carrier of the Year three times in a row. Later, she learned to develop a thick skin as a model who didn't fit everyone's idea of perfect. This lifetime of building resilience came in handy when she launched privately-held kathy ireland Worldwide (kiWW) in 1993. (""The lowercase k and i are intentional, because the company isn't all about me, it's about our team and the customers,"" she explained.)The former runway star became a runaway success, with over 17,000 products now carried in 50,000 stores across 50 countries, ringing up $2.6 billion in retail sales last year, giving her a net worth of $360 million (just under that of Barbra Streisand on Forbes' list of self-made women).Ireland, 54, was born in Glendale, Calif., and at 3 her family moved to Santa Barbara, Calif. (where she still lives with her physician husband, three children and four dogs). At 4, she was selling painted rocks out of her wagon. An indifferent student and shy tomboy, her parents sent her to a finishing school where the Elite Modeling Agency discovered her in 1980 at 16.Four years later, she was featured in the first of 13 consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues, and when she was put on the cover in 1989, it became the best-selling edition of all time. (She also appeared on the cover in 1992 and 1994.)Ireland tried to diversify her career without much success until 1993 when, pregnant and 30, she launched her first product: socks. Everyone told her she'd fail because she should have started with a swimsuit, but she believed she could design a better foot-warmer. In partnership with marketer John Moretz, and after taking out a $50,000 personal loan, she took the first step to selling over 100 million pairs.The following year, she signed an exclusive agreement to sell her expanding clothing line at Kmart (now part of Sears Holdings (SHLD)). By 1999, the growth of kiWW was so impressive that she was named Businesswoman of the Year by the National Association of Women Business Owners. When Kmart filed for bankruptcy three years later, Ireland refused to abandon it as they worked through the enormous challenges, even when her bank threatened to seize her family's assets.""I learned from Warren Buffett, when we worked with him on our carpet line, that you need to find stores which can deliver a great customer-service experience, so we began shifting our distribution to independent specialty retailers, which have been the key to our success,"" said Ireland. ""We had lucrative offers from chains to be exclusive, which would have given us much more visibility and fast growth, but also would have put a ceiling on our potential. We could see that brick-and-mortar would be increasingly challenged and our new strategy avoided being entangled in more bankruptcies.""She and Stephen Roseberry, kiWW's president, often begin their day with sales calls while she uses her time efficiently by being driven to one of her offices.""If we're getting rejected, I want to know what we can do better,"" she said. ""If there is a misconception about our brand, we want to clear it up. It still shocks me that some people think I would just slap my name on a product. If our success depended on my celebrity in the last century, we'd all be unemployed. To make a product move, you need much more than an autographed photo, you have to have all the right design elements, infrastructure, a sales team, and creative marketing.""Ireland says kiWW has a unique business model that starts with licensing products. (The magazine License! Global ranks her No. 26 among the most powerful brands, just behind Ferrari and ahead of Ralph Lauren.)""We carefully vet everyone we work with to be sure we share the same values,"" she explained. ""We have thorough contracts, but then we put them in a drawer to work together like a family, hoping for the best. Our aim is to become full, formal partners so that we have a powerful relationship in which we are mutually invested. Probably close to 90% of these work out well and we've had some partnerships for 15 to 24 years, compared with an average of just a few years elsewhere.""The hybrid of licensing and partnerships covers a vast array of products and services, stretching from the NuGene line of stem cell-based cosmetics to offering insurance customized for entrepreneurs. As part of this boundary-stretching business model, she is the chief creative officer for virtual reality company Endeavor One and lifestyle brand I'M1, part of Level Brands — doing everything from producing music festivals to making films.Roseberry says that her fierce dedication to combining innovative quality with affordability has enabled kiWW to successfully enter new markets, like diamond jewelry (hers has a patented design), that would otherwise be virtually impossible to penetrate. He said that Ireland's brand also helps one of her primary target audiences, busy moms like herself, simplify the choices they face by knowing they can trust her judgment.Ireland says she's very careful about picking the right ""brand ambassadors"" and is especially excited by Katie Meade for the Beauty & Pin-Ups line of hair care products.""She's the first person with Down syndrome to be the spokesmodel for a beauty brand and she's turning the industry on its head,"" said Ireland. ""Beautiful people come in every size, color and age, and I rejected the idea from my early career that everyone should have the goal of unobtainable sameness in their appearance.""After working her way up in an industry that told her to just ""shut up and pose,"" Ireland expresses a passion for enabling companies to get their messages out.""Too many aren't covered by mainstream media or, when they are, what is said or written about them is garbled or inaccurate,"" she explained. ""All TV is sponsored — we're just more transparent about helping leaders and experts talk about what they do."" Her ""Worldwide Business"" interviews are broadcast on Fox Business on Sundays and are available in 50 countries, while ""Modern Living,"" aimed at consumers, is on E! Thursdays and airs via Bloomberg International and other networks.Perhaps the best evidence that Ireland is recognized as one of the top living entrepreneurs is that each year she's invited to the Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) annual shareholder meeting with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Since she and Buffett delivered newspapers as kids, the three of them compete with attendees to see who can throw them most accurately.""From the people cleaning the warehouses to the CEOs of the global companies we work with, Kathy believes everyone deserves the same amount of respect,"" said Roseberry. ""She doesn't tell us what to do, she shows us what must be done. She doesn't believe in making excuses and is always an inspiration. Kathy's business proves that for her, love is a verb.""""Never compromise your character to achieve any goal.""""Don't think less of yourself, think of yourself less.""""It takes years to build trust and respect, but a moment to destroy it.""""When someone tells you no, ask why.""""It's great to have goals, but don't forget to enjoy the journey.""""Own money; never let it own you.""""Discover, live, and practice your boundaries and beliefs.""""Your amazing spirit is strong enough to overcome any obstacle.""Former supermodel became a supermogul branding everything from flooring to wedding destinations.Overcame: Bankruptcy of Kmart, the exclusive outlet for her products, in 2002.Lesson: When you put your name on something, be sure you have hands-on control of its quality.MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Fashion's Maureen Chiquet Landed Big Roles By Accepting Small OnesDonna Karan Created Simple Fashion For Modern WomenRuth Handler And Her Barbie Refashioned Mattel And The Toy Industry

324,UPS,"Facebook (FB), Under Armour (UA), United Airlines (UAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and FedEx (FDX) top brass led this week’s insider trades, as earnings season remained busy.Facebook’s chief product officer, Christopher Cox, unloaded more shares this week. He disclosed on Wednesday a sale of 15,600 shares for a total transaction value of $1.71 million.The social-networking giant has seen regular sales from board members and C-suite executives in recent months.Facebook late Wednesday crushed first-quarter earnings and sales estimates. Shares closed Friday with a 6.35% weekly gain.Robin Thurston, Under Armour’s chief digital officer, disclosed on Tuesday the sale of 17,140 shares for a little more than $796,000. Other Under Armour executives disclosed sales this week as well, one week after the company beat quarterly expectations.Earlier this week, rival Adidas raised its full-year sales growth outlook as it pre-announced some Q1 results, ahead of its full report May 4.Under Armour shares fell 6.5% for the week, near sell territory.United COO Gregory Hart and Director James Kennedy disclosed Wednesday the purchase of 2,000 shares for a total of about $99,800 each. Another director, Robert Milton, disclosed the purchase of 1,000 United shares for a little over $49,000.Meanwhile, Southwest Director David Biegler disclosed Thursday the sale and options exercise of 8,000 shares for a total of nearly $376,000.Airline stocks have been under pressure recently amid signs that expansion plans are eroding unit revenue. Last week, United said that it would curb growth as industry capacity outpaces traffic.United shares plunged 9.5% vs. a week ago, and Southwest fell 5.6%.FedEx CEO Frederick Smith disclosed on Monday a sale and options exercise of 200,000 shares for a total transaction value of $33.2 million.The sale came ahead of rival UPS’ (UPS) earnings on Thursday. UPS beat views but warned that pension cuts may result in a $3.8 billion charge that could lower full-year earnings.FedEx shares dipped 0.7%, and UPS eased 0.4%.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.

325,UPS,"Aetna (AET) reported 911,000 ObamaCare exchange members as of March 31, down more than 4% from over 950,000 at the same time a year ago.The news is somewhat of a surprise after Anthem (ANTM) said it saw a modest increase in customers largely thanks to nonprofit co-ops going out of business in some of its 14 markets like New York and Colorado.Anthem ObamaCare enrollment rose 8.6% to 975,000, from 898,000 a year ago.Centene (CNC), a Medicaid insurer specialist that's rapidly expanding its ObamaCare exchange reach with low-premium, high-deductible plans, recently reported a 55% enrollment spike to 683,000. UnitedHealth (UNH) had 795,000 exchange customers at the end of Q1, but has said it will exit all but a ""handful"" of states in 2017.Total exchange sign-ups rose 8.5% to 12.7 million, from 11.7 million a year ago, but it's not yet clear how many people actually paid. Last year, 1.5 million had dropped out by the end of March.Reports from six states show that ObamaCare enrollment has shrunk about 14% from the number reported in February, but it’s unclear if that trend will hold.Aetna management expressed optimism that its exchange business will break even in 2016, though it's still getting a feel for the medical costs of this year's members, given the relatively large amount of customer churn from year to year.Overall, Aetna's ObamaCare-compliant enrollment, including off-exchange customers, fell to 1.2 million from 1.275 million a year ago.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said he sees the exchange business as a good investment for the company, despite modest losses so far, provided that Congress and the next president are able to set politics aside and modify the program, as they do for Medicare and Medicaid on a pretty regular basis.Aetna shares rose modestly on the stock market today on stronger-than-expected Q1 results.

334,UPS,"The trend toward more casual workplaces makes professional social gatherings trickier to navigate. How much looser can you get? Etiquette expert Sharon Schweitzer says that while these events are a great way to connect with co-workers and rub elbows with higher-ups, they can also be disastrous without modern manners.Here’s a tip sheet for happy hour success.Make the effort and go. Not only is happy hour supposed to be fun, but it’s also a chance to get to know your co-workers, your boss and the folks in other areas of the organization.A CareerBuilder survey showed that 82% of workers attend happy hour to bond with co-workers. Some found it to be a great way to network and a chance to get to know their boss better.Sometimes these contacts help your career down the line.The survey said that among retail sales workers who attend happy hour, a third said it helped them get close to someone in a better position and/or higher up in the company.Know company culture. Explore the firm’s website thoroughly before you go to happy hour.Search social media for photos of past company events, like corporate retreats and holiday parties, suggests Schweitzer, CEO of Protocol & Etiquette Worldwide. Look at how people are dressed and if alcohol is served.Observe your colleagues, Schweitzer told IBD: “Cultivate relationships with your mentors and ask them about the histories of these social events.”Don’t ignore your personal style, though.“You have to be authentic,” Schweitzer said. “Find that middle ground. What is your comfort level? You don’t ever want to dance on the tables.”Socialize wisely. Put your phone down and venture out to meet people from other departments.Listen 80% of the time and ask questions the other 20%, Schweitzer says.Read a lot about current events from a variety of online and offline sources before the event. The best topics to spark conversations? Travel, pets and local sporting and cultural events.“Do your homework ahead of time,” Schweitzer said. “Do you see photos on your colleague’s desk? Are there photos of pets? Family photos? Those are great conversation starters.”Stay away from hot topics involving religion, sex and politics, which can tank your career.If you must offer your 2 cents, think how you might field -- or deflect -- a question.In an election year, politics will come up, so be prepared to keep it civil.“If you don’t want to engage, you can say: 'I’m still observing the candidates and haven’t made a decision,’ ” Schweitzer said.If the person asking the question persists, be firm about wanting to keep your thoughts private and steer the conversation elsewhere.Remember why you’re there. Don’t loosen up too much. If you don’t normally drink alcohol, don’t start now. Having a drink in hand while chatting with co-workers is key, Schweitzer says, but what’s in the drink is irrelevant.And don’t always do as your boss does. Perhaps the chief really lets loose at events. This is not an opportunity for you to do the same. Whether it’s fair or not, you are still climbing the ladder, and your view is not the same as the one from the top, Schweitzer says.“Have the maturity to know what to emulate,” she said. “If your boss is dressing sharply and doing all the right things, then yes, do as the boss does.”Be prepared. Bring some cash. If the company sponsors the event, it might cover the tab for the night. If not, you don’t want to be stuck if the venue doesn’t take credit cards, says the Cheat Sheet, a website that offers advice to “sophisticated modern men.”Plus, you might have to split the cost for a cab ride home, which is more easily done with cash.Image provided by Shutterstock.

335,UPS,"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump won only five state primaries Tuesday, all in the East.That's good news for Trump, however, because only five states held primaries Tuesday. He won them all. Not just won them. He won them BIG.Like nearly 60% big; 64% in Rhode Island. ""When you crack 60 with three people,"" said one prominent politician, ""that's really hard to do."" That politician was the modest Trump himself. But he speaketh the truth.Have you been watching Congress recently? Exit polls revealed about 60% of Tuesday's voters feel betrayed by GOP leadership. Against that tide of antipathy even the nettlesome freshman senator Cruz has somehow become an insider.Tuesday's results give the New Yorker about 950 delegates, still nearly 300 shy of the 1,237 majority needed in mid-July to grab the GOP nomination in his big, rich hands. Always understated, the presumptive Trump has now pronounced himself ""the presumptive nominee.""Not quite yet. But it's closer.Trump's five latest victories, coming on the heels of his over-powering 62% New York showing last week, do put the focus squarely on next Tuesday. That's primary day for the unlikely battleground state of Indiana, which usually only gets national attention in May for the Indy 500.If Trump wins those 57 winner-take-all GOP delegates, the Republican race is basically over -- despite the tardy new Cruz-Kasich anti-Trump alliance. Trump wouldn't garner the majority for some time. But barring an unexpected surprise, it becomes virtually inevitable.Cruz is from Texas, but Hoosierland is his Alamo. He's been campaigning there since Saturday when he saw the handwriting on the ballots and surrendered the Northeast. Typical Cruz, he spent longer mingling with last night's Indiana crowd, signing autographs and doing, selfies, than he did speaking.Trump goes to Indiana today to campaign with legendary hothead Bobby Knight.Psychologically, the sense of Trump momentum becomes harder for Cruz and the majority of Republicans to resist. Although they will, because suicidal Republicans always fight harder against each other than against Democrats.In an attempt to preempt the night's awful news, Cruz said moving West is better for him, which is true. He should, for instance, win Nebraska next month.Cruz also warned that the evil media would start writing him off. And -- Oh, look! -- here we are. Cruz is only at 560 delegates, almost 400 behind Trump. The Ohio governor holds 153, still  fewer than the long-gone Marco Rubio.""Kasich is one (win) in 41,"" observed Trump. ""Now, he's one in 46. Why is he here?""Might Cruz try a surprise Reaganesque move before Tuesday, announcing his running mate to throw Trump off-balance?UPDATE Wednesday afternoon: Oh, look! Cruz did exactly what we said today, picking Carly Fiorina as his running mate. You read it here first--or should have.
"
336,UPS,"The only real hope now to stop Trump is a contested convention, holding him shy of 1,237 to force a second ballot, when 57% of delegates become unbound. An overwhelming percentage of GOP primary voters tell pollsters the man with the most delegates going into Cleveland should get the nomination.That goes against majority Republican rules and tradition going back to the party's first national convention in 1856. But don't forget, more than 150 initially unbound delegates will show up in Cleveland. If Trump is close, they could sway the day, claiming the need for unity.At the moment, however, GOP unity seems far-fetched.A quarter to a third of Cruz and Kasich voters say they could never vote in November for Trump, who shows no signs yet of reaching out. He needs to broaden his core support beyond blue-collar high school graduates and do much better among women.Trump can't win without them and polls today show Republicans can't win with him. Trump's negatives are worse than Hillary Clinton's, which are terrible.Nonetheless, Trump is instead targeting Clinton as an inept secretary of State, adding: “Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she would get five percent of the vote.”He added, ""I'll beat Hillary so easily.""Clinton captured four of the same five states with between 52% (Connecticut) and 63% (Maryland) of the vote.

341,UPS,"VanEck Vectors Coal ETF is ending 2016 as one the year's winners as signs indicate that demand for coal should remain strong.But the ETF is showing signs it may need a break.The exchange traded fund has climbed about 150% from its January low — a price advance that has met little opposition. The ETF this week fell below the 50-day moving average for the first time since it broke out of a base in June. That marks a potential change in direction, but so far the drop has been mild enough that it leaves the possibility of a rebound. It would also give investors a chance to buy on a secondary buy area of support.One way to tell how an ETF is acting is by checking its main components. On that account, there are mixed signals.The fund's top holding, Teck Resources (TECK) with nearly 9% of the weighting, is in step with the ETF. It also dipped below the 50-day line this week. Teck, a Canadian mining company, is fighting to get back above the line, and success would bode well for the ETF.At the same time, two Australia-based stocks also have fallen modestly below the 50-day line this week. Aurizon Holdings is forming the right side of a base, while Whitehaven Coal slipped below support after a strong run this year.Other big holdings are not providing much direction. Some are flagging while others remain in price uptrends. Consol Energy (CNX), the only other major U.S. stock in the fund, failed a Nov. 30 breakout.The coal industry may be a pariah for clean-air advocates, but that hasn't done much to slow demand. Coal remains a major source of fuel for energy producers in many countries.China is the largest producer and consumer of coal-fired electrical power. China's coal-power generation capacity will grow as much as 19% over the next five years, even as the government tries to cut pervasive pollution in its skies, Bloomberg reported last month.Chinese companies make up 23% of VanEck Vectors Coal's portfolio, the largest of any single country.Some coal is used in steel making, and the surge in steel stocks since the U.S. election contributes to the outlook for coal.On Nov. 22, Teck Resources raised its forecast for steel making coal for the fourth quarter, citing strong spot prices. It saw the blended price for its products at $200 to $205 a ton, up from a forecast below $200. Its guidance for sales volume was unchanged at 6.5 million tons.Historically, the ETF has gone through major price run-ups and declines, including one that lasted from 2011 to January's low. Because of that steep slump, the ETF has an average annual return of -10.5% since its inception in January 2008. But 2016 has been the year to own it — it has more than doubled.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

342,UPS,"November retail sales rose 0.1% vs. the prior month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, less than expected as the holiday shopping season got underway and consumer optimism jumped after the presidential election.Sales rose 0.2% excluding autos and 0.2% excluding autos and gas.Economists expected a 0.4% seasonally adjusted increase for retail sales, as well as a 0.4% gain excluding autos and 0.3% excluding autos and gas. October retail sales rose 0.6%, revised down from 0.8%.One issue is whether postelection sentiment would spur higher spending. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index shot up to a 10-year high in December. The stock market has soared to record highs since Donald Trump's presidential win on hopes for big tax cuts and regulatory relief. The stock market rally both reflect and fuels increased confidence — and bolstering portfolios and 401(k)s.However, auto sales fell 0.5%, their first decline since March.Amazon (AMZN) and other online retailers remain strong. Nonstore sales rose just 0.1% vs. October, seasonally adjusted, but were up 11.9% vs. a year earlier, far outstripping other major categories. Several reports indicated that Thanksgiving weekend sales rose sharply online, with mall traffic declining.IBD'S TAKE: After initially lagging during the Trump market rally, Apple, Amazon and other big-cap techs are shaping up for potential breakouts.Department store sales fell by 0.2%, with sporting goods chains down 1%. Electronic and appliance stores edged up just 0.1% while clothiers' sales were flat. Furniture and home furnishing chains (up 0.7%), restaurants (0.8%), grocery stores (0.4%) were solid.However, Target (TGT) gave upbeat guidance last month and later said Black Friday sales were strong. Shares of Target and many brick-and-mortar retailers rallied sharply following the election and amid relatively upbeat earnings and outlooks. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, also has risen, despite a brief sell-off on weaker-than-expected Q3 sales. Target, Wal-Mart and many traditional retailers are seeing significant online sales growth.As for hot products, the Apple iPhone 7 likely will be a solid seller. Apple iPads and Samsung 4K TV were hot sellers on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, thanks to big discounts.Hefty discounts make it hard to tell if a retailer's holiday sales will translate into big profits or weak margins.Next week, FedEx (FDX) will report quarterly earnings, with close attention paid to the shipping giant's comments about holiday shipments. FedEx and UPS (UPS) offer a rough proxy for e-commerce sales.Also next week, Nike (NKE) and mall-based athletic shoe retailer Finish Line (FINL) should give an idea about holiday demand for athletic footwear and apparel.In stock market trading, Amazon ended the trading day down 0.7% to 768.82, still below its 50-day moving average. Apple edged higher, extending a rise above its 50-day line as it nears a buy point. Target dipped while Wal-Mart rose fractionally.RELATED:Wholesale Prices Jump 1.3%, With Inflation On The Comeback TrailFactory Production Drops for First Time in Three Months

Phone calls and emails have value of course, but you never really get completely around having to provide a personal touch.That's from Andrew Glincher, CEO and managing partner of Nixon Peabody, a law firm with 1,500 colleagues and 700 attorneys in 17 cities.Glincher spends some two to three weeks a month traveling to his firm's different offices. This road warrior offers a perspective: ""Our inventory is people, so our assets go home every night and they have to decide that Nixon Peabody is the place they want to return to the next day. You have to give them something to come back, and I think that's in the personal touch.""He says Nixon Peabody has the lowest unwanted departures in the industry at all levels — partners, associates, and staff.Be transparent. Glincher says ""my style is: What you see is what you get. I'm candid, I'm blunt. Everyone knows what I'm doing, and where I am. No hidden agendas. You've got to be direct with people.""He sees all employees as important, regardless of their hierarchy.""I want to keep in touch with people at all levels of our firm, and want them to feel completely comfortable just saying anything to me,"" he says.Joyce Russell, president of Adecco Staffing USA, adds ""core team members must know where you are, what you'll be focused on and how to reach you. If you do a good job communicating these things to the people who need to know them, you'll eliminate inefficiencies.""Say it again.

Glincher tries to put himself ""into the shoes of the folks that you're dealing with and talking to.""Call. If your relationship is based on emails only, ""then you don't have a relationship,"" Glincher believes.""Whenever I can, I pick up the phone,"" he said.

""The call should not take more than 30 minutes each week and someone should also take the minutes so follow-through is made on matters decided on.""Stay accessible.

"
344,UPS,"Herewith some unsolicited free advice for the Democratic Party. Whether it's worth more than the price I leave up to Democrats to decide.The first thing to remember is that the Democratic Party is the oldest political party in the world. It's had its ups and downs over many years. Under any fair reading of history, it has done many good things for this country and the world. It is not going away any time soon.But it is in a bad way. Its chances of recapturing the presidency in 2020 depend largely on decisions by Republicans and on events outside anyone's control.Democrats currently hold fewer House seats, governorships and state legislatures than at any time since the 1920s. And the signature policies of the outgoing Democratic president — ObamaCare and the Iranian nuclear deal — are not political assets.The first thing Democrats need to do is to end the alibi game. Yes, it's a shattering experience to lose a presidential election that, until the 9 o'clock hour on election night, you seemed sure to win.But alibis don't help you win next time. Don't blame ""fake news"" when your candidate had lots more money to spend delivering her message. Don't blame the FBI director when your candidate violated criminal laws and the attorney general had to disqualify herself after revelation of her secret meeting with the candidate's husband.Don't blame the ""racism"" of an electorate that twice elected the first black president. Don't blame the Electoral College when everyone knew beforehand that you need 270 electoral votes, not a popular vote plurality, to win.Blame instead the Clinton campaign's ""ascendant America"" strategy — to reassemble the 2012 Obama coalition of nonwhites and millennials, on the assumption that the attitudes of other voters, notably white non-college graduates who cast critical Obama votes in the Midwest, would remain static.Exit polls showed that Donald Trump, supposedly toxic to nonwhites, ran slightly better among them than Mitt Romney did in 2012. Their apparent regression to the mean, to voting more like the national average, undercuts the theory that nonwhites, tormented by oppression and seething with grievance, will remain overwhelmingly Democratic forever.To recover, Democrats need to take a look at the map. The relevant map in this election divides the nation between coastal America (the West Coast plus Hawaii, as well as the Northeast from Maine to Washington, D.C.) and heartland America (the South, the Midwest and the Mountain West, as well as energy states Alaska and Pennsylvania). Coastal America casts 31 lar votes and 170 electoral votes. Heartland America casts 69 lar votes and 368 electoral votes.Clinton earned all but one electoral vote (Maine's 2nd Congressional District) in coastal America. But in heartland America — where Barack Obama lost the electoral vote narrowly, 206-162, in 2012 — Clinton got only 63 electoral votes, compared with Trump's 305. Yes, Trump won the 46 electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by a combined popular vote margin of only (at latest count) 77,193. But the fact is he didn't need a single popular vote in coastal America to win.Democrats are even weaker in heartland down-ballot elections. In races for the House of Representatives, Republicans won more than 200 seats there, compared with only 90 for Democrats. Democrats could win half of the Republicans' 35 U.S. House seats in coastal America and still fall short of a House majority. In state legislatures, heartland Republicans outnumber Democrats by nearly a 2-1 ratio.My advice to Democrats is the advice Justice Louis Brandeis gave to young New Dealers in the 1930s. ""Get out of Washington,"" he said. ""Go home, back to the states."" Leave the latte-soaked coastal cocoons. Return to your hometown or set down new roots, and run for office in the heartland — and not in university towns but in real America.That's what many young liberals did in the 1970s, shoring up Democratic congressional and legislative majorities for two decades, learning from constituents rather than instructing them, participating in local civic culture rather than lamenting it. The Democratic Party and the nation would be well-served if smart, ambitious young Democrats started packing their bags and competing where their party has been falling fatally short.

348,UPS,"Nike's (NKE) first-quarter results were ""peppered with red flags,"" says one retail analyst, as many on Wall Street note that Under Armour (UA) and Adidas are chipping away at Nike's stranglehold on the American consumer.The athletic apparel giant beat earnings estimates by quite a bit when it reported late Tuesday, but much of that came from a one-off tax-rate benefit, among other things, noted Canaccord Genuity's Camilo Lyon, who rates Nike a hold with a 52 price target.And North America futures orders growth of 1% — well below consensus for 4.4% — was a ""disconcerting surprise"" to him and ""likely a result of the competitive landscape shifting toward Adidas and (Under Armour),"" he wrote.Much of Lyon's bearishness appears to come from futures orders, the Nike-created metric of products to be delivered to retailers. Outside of earnings and revenue, it is largely the metric to watch in the company's quarterly results.But the Swoosh, which pointed out a declining correlation between reported revenue and futures, likely believes Wall Street is focusing on futures to a fault: Management announced during the call that it will only release the figure during the earnings call and in SEC filings, and not with the earnings release. (Nike's continued investments in Nike.com and its direct-to-consumer business may explain some of the disconnect.)Nike shares closed down 3.8% at 53.25 in the stock market today. Under Armour shares pared earlier gains and finished up 0.5%, after hitting resistance at their 200-day average.But Canaccord wasn't the only firm to highlight Under Armour and Adidas flexing their retail muscle in the U.S. and Canada.Cowen analyst John Kernan highlighted that Adidas has grown its brand sales in North America by 31% in the first half of 2016 as it increases its market share, a contrast to Nike's futures performance in the region.""We think the N. American market, in particular, is being impacted by the brand resurgence of Adidas given its increasing visibility and strong product cycle, and ongoing competition with Under Armour,"" he wrote, calling Adidas his top pick.IBD'S TAKE: Nike is part of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing industry group, which currently ranks a lowly 186 out of 197 tracked sectors. To figure out when a buying opportunity may present itself, IBD University has tips on ""how to find and evaluate stocks.""Brean Capital downgraded Nike to hold from buy, while a number of analysts trimmed their price targets on the stock.

Nomura trimmed its price target to 60 from 64, but analyst Simeon Siegel reiterated a buy rating on the stock.""Despite the threat from a push by competition & disappointing futures, we view NKE's scale (and) dominance as a (long-term) barrier to entry (and) maintain our Buy despite what appears a nascent share loss,"" he wrote Wednesday.On the call late Tuesday, Nike CFO Andy Campion said he expects North America's ""reported revenue growth over the balance of the year to outpace the rate of futures growth driven by stronger sell-through to consumers.""RELATED:That Nike Metric That Sank Shares?

349,UPS,"It's official. BlackBerry (BBRY), the Canadian company that invented the smartphone and addicted legions of road warriors to the ""crackberry,"" has stopped making its iconic handsets.Finally conceding defeat in a battle lost long ago to Apple (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics, BlackBerry is handing over production of the phones to overseas partners and turning its full attention to the more profitable and growing software business. It's the formalization of a move in the making since Chief Executive Officer John Chen took over nearly three years ago and outsourced some manufacturing to Foxconn Technology Group. Getting the money-losing smartphone business off BlackBerry's books will also make it easier for the company to consistently hit profitability.""This is the completion of their exit,"" said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. ""Chen is a software CEO historically. He's getting back to what he knows best: higher margins and recurring revenue.""Chen should be able to execute his software strategy as long as he keeps costs in line and maintains cash on the balance sheet, Gillis said.BlackBerry said Wednesday it struck a licensing agreement with an Indonesian company to make and distribute BlackBerry-branded devices. More deals are in the works with Chinese and Indian manufacturers. It will still design smartphone applications and an extra-secure version of Alphabet Inc.'s Android operating system.""We are reaching an inflection point with our strategy,"" Chen said in a statement announcing the shift as well as quarterly earnings. ""Our financial foundation is strong, and our pivot to software is taking hold.""The new strategy will improve margins and could actually increase the number of BlackBerry-branded phones sold, Chen said, as manufacturers license the name that still holds considerable sway in emerging markets like Indonesia, South Africa and Nigeria.IBD'S TAKE: The days of massive growth may be past, but megacap techs Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Cisco are cash kings.Although BlackBerry's latest phone, the DTEK50, was already almost completely outsourced, the move is a big symbolic step for a company that once reached a market value of $80 billion. Today, it's worth $4.3 billion.When the BlackBerry 850 was released in 1999, it married a functional keyboard with email capability and essentially ushered in the modern smartphone era. With a proprietary operating system known for its watertight security, the phones became ubiquitous and extended the workday onto commuter trains and into restaurants and homes. They were an instant hit with business executives and heads of state alike. President Barack Obama was fiercely committed to his, but finally ditched it earlier this year, reportedly for a Samsung.Then, in 2007, enter the iPhone with its touch screen interface and app store. People at first said they didn't want to give up BlackBerry's keyboard and simplicity. But the lure of apps eventually sent almost all its users to phones running Android or iOS.""It was inevitable at this point; they didn't have the unit volumes to sustain the business profitably,"" said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. ""This is doubling down on the efforts to focus on software which is really what their strength is."" BlackBerry shipped only 400,000 phones in its fiscal second quarter, half what it sold in the same period last year. Apple sold more than 40 million iPhones last quarter.BlackBerry said software and services revenue more than doubled in the quarter from a year earlier to $156 million. Still, software revenue was down from the previous quarter's $266 million, which Chen blamed on patent licensing deals that didn't carry over into the quarter.Adjusted earnings were at break-even, compared with analysts' estimates for a loss of 5 cents. Revenue in the second quarter was $325 million, falling short of analysts' projections for $390 million. For the full year, BlackBerry expects a loss of 5 cents or to hit break-even, compared with what it said was a current consensus of a 15-cent loss.RELATED:Apple Ups iPhone 7 Component Orders In Reassuring Sign Apple iPhone 7 Sales Forecast Upped On Samsung Woes, High-End Models Stocks To Watch: Are Apple, Facebook And Alphabet Still Buys?

351,UPS,"Mighty e-commerce firm Amazon.com (AMZN) is launching its payments service on several platforms that cater to small and midsize businesses, the company said Monday.Called the Global Partner Program, the new business will allow firms that build e-tail storefronts on the platforms Amazon is partnering with to integrate the ""Pay With Amazon"" feature. Pay With Amazon aims to reduce any friction when checking out online. By logging in with Amazon, shoppers don't have to enter a 16-digit credit card number and other billing details.Rival payments firms such as PayPal (PYPL) have been working on reducing friction at checkout for years.Partners in Amazon's Global Partner Program include Japan-based FutureShop, France-based PrestaShop and Canada-based Shopify (SHOP).Amazon stock fell nearly 1%, to 593.19, on the stock market today. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, where 99 is the highest. Amazon stock is forming a cup base, with a buy point of 696.54, after touching a seven-month low of 474 in early February.The new payments program ""could help Amazon reach a much larger audience of merchants,"" Colin Sebastian, an analyst with Robert W. Baird, told IBD via email. ""However, I believe there are still channel conflicts that may exist with allowing Amazon to see transaction data. In fact, Shopify and others already have relationships with payment platforms such as PayPal and Stripe. As such, it may still be an uphill battle for Amazon payments to gain a lot more traction with merchants.""That said, Amazon does have a lot of customers who may wish to use Amazon payments, and the plus side for merchants would be higher transaction volumes.""Wedbush analyst Gil Luria says Amazon has struggled for years to make headway in the payments business against firms such as PayPal.Apple (AAPL) and Google, a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), also have entered the payments sector with digital wallet technologies that revolve around use of cellphones for payments transactions.The Amazon announcement is hot on the heels of similar moves by PayPal and Square (SQ).On Wednesday, Square said it planned to add Web checkout capabilities to its payment processing product -- a direct challenge to much larger competitor PayPal, which has more than 13 million merchants vs. Square's 2 million.Also Wednesday, PayPal's Braintree unit -- which boasts that it processes payments for startups such as Airbnb, Jet.com and Uber -- announced that it was partnering with several all-in-one e-commerce platforms, such as BigCommerce.

352,UPS,"Orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised guidance Wednesday, sending its stock up about 1% in after-hours trading.Stryker reported earnings of $1.24 a share, up 12% from the year-earlier quarter and topping analysts' consensus of $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 5% to $2.5 billion, slightly above consensus. On a constant-currency basis, sales grew 6.1% in the quarter.Stryker added half a percentage point to its full-year organic sales-growth guidance, now 5.5% to 6.5%. EPS guidance was raised and tightened to $5.65 to $5.80, from $5.57 to $5.77. For the second quarter, Stryker guided earnings of $1.33 to $1.38 a share, on the high side of Wall Street's estimate of $1.34.Stryker's sales grew across all three of its divisions — orthopedics, MedSurg and neurotechnology/spine — which CEO Kevin Lobo said provided the confidence to raise organic sales guidance this early in the year.""I feel very good about the strength of our entire business portfolio,"" he said on a conference call with analysts.The major weak point was international sales — contributing more than a quarter of total revenue — which declined 4.6% on a reported basis and by a fraction on a constant-currency basis. The economic troubles in China and Brazil have been affecting the company since last year, but Lobo said he expects the impact to ease in the second half of this year. Last year's Q1 was especially strong in emerging markets, sharpening the most recent quarter's decline, he said. Also, he noted, ""the inventory bleeds will eventually bleed out.""Analysts were also impressed by the 21% organic growth in the Neurotechnology unit, the fastest-growing subdivision in the company. The bulk of the business comes from Stryker's line of catheters, stents and coils for treating hemorrhagic stroke, but the company also is seeing growth from its newer products treating ischemic stroke, which is a new market.""There are many strokes that hadn't been treated prior,"" Lobo said on the call. ""When you're creating a new market it's difficult to predict the pace of growth, but there's no doubt the growth will be very significant. Obviously, that contributed to the strong performance of neurovascular.""Orthopedics and MedSurg (a division of surgical products) both reported 4.6% organic growth in the quarter. Spinal products rose 8.9%.Analysts on the call also remarked on the improvement Stryker's operating margin, which rose to 24.2% from 20.8%. Stifel analyst Rick Wise questioned how sustainable this was, given the ups and downs of margins in prior quarters, but Lobo sounded confident.""I'm not going to promise 90 basis points (of improvement) every single quarter, but we are committed to driving leverage at the operating level,"" Lobo said. ""You'll see that this year, and you'll see that when we provide guidance for you in 2017.""Interest expenses were somewhat higher than normal in the quarter due to three recent acquisitions: Sage Products, which makes oral, skin-care and cleaning products; Physio-Control International, which makes monitors and defibrillators; and Synergetics, which filled out the neurology & spine portfolio. Stryker management noted that both the Sage and Physio-Control deals had closed ahead of schedule, in early April.Stryker stock is up about 19% for the year, hitting a series of new highs since it broke out of a consolidation last month. Despite its recent pattern of single-digit growth, it has attained a strong Composite Rating of 91. In regular trading on the stock market today it rose 0.9% to 110.73 after hitting an intraday high of 110.97, a penny short of the all-time high it hit the previous day. About 90 minutes after the close, the stock had cracked 112.

353,UPS,"Health Care: In the summer of 2014, President Obama promised swift changes to resolve chronic delays and cover-ups at the Veterans Health Administration. Today, veterans are still waiting months to see doctors and the VHA is still doctoring wait times, an audit finds.The Government Accountability Office tracked 180 newly enrolled veterans to see how quickly they could get in to see a doctor. The results are disturbing.It found that 120 of these vets waited from 22 to 71 days to see a primary care doctor. Worse, 60 of these vets still hadn't gotten in to see anyone, and in almost half these cases it was because the VHA didn’t bother to schedule them. Mind you, these are primary care doctors, the first step in getting whatever care these vets need.The GAO also found that the VHA systematically tries to mask the length of these delays by starting the delay clock from the date vets say they’d like to be seen, instead of when they call to schedule an appointment.What’s more, “ongoing scheduling errors, such as incorrectly revising preferred dates when rescheduling appointments” -- which is to say, VHA incompetence — also served to understate the amount of time veterans waited to see a doctor, the GAO says.This is the same VHA that was supposed to have been fixed two years ago, in the wake of revelations about chronic delays that in some cases led to veteran deaths, as well as findings that VHA officials had tried to cover up these problems.In August 2014, Congress overwhelmingly passed a reform bill providing the VHA with $16 billion in extra money. When he signed the bill, Obama called the scandal “outrageous” and promised that his administration was “moving ahead with urgent reforms, including stronger management and leadership and oversight, and we’re instituting a critical culture of accountability.”Obama said the new funds would be used to “hire more doctors and more nurses and staff more clinics.”  He also promised that vets would gain access to private providers outside the VHA through a new “Veterans choice card.”Since then, Obama has kept none of those promises.The VHA remains largely unreformed, and almost no one involved in the scandal was fired. The Justice Department couldn’t even bring itself to file charges against two VHA officials who allegedly defrauded the agency of $400,000. The VHA only demoted them.Last year, an Associated Press investigation found that “the number of patients facing long waits at VHA facilities has not dropped at all” and the number of vets waiting more than 90 days to get an appointment “has nearly doubled.”Whistleblowers who alerted the public to the original VHA scandal say that wait times are still being manipulated.“I can promise you that it is still going on at facilities across this country,” one source told USA Today. “I mean, it’s sad because veterans are still getting poor care.”The “choice card” Obama touted has turned out to be a cruel joke, as the VHA made it difficult for vets to use it in a timely manner, and because the VHA didn’t pay some private doctors and hospitals who took the card. One survey found the VA owed Florida hospitals more than $100 million in unpaid claims, for example.Obama should be held accountable for his abject failure to fix the VHA as promised. But of course he won’t be, since no one ever holds Obama accountable for anything.In the meantime, however, the ongoing scandal at the VA should serve as a warning to anyone who thinks socialized medicine is a good idea. The VHA is a showcase of what it’s like when the government runs health care.

Tesla saw a 1.8% increase.David Aldrich, CEO at Apple chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), on Thursday disclosed a sale and options exercise of 15,000 shares for $1.12 million.Justine Lien, a director at fellow Apple supplier Broadcom (AVGO), sold a little over 4,000 shares for a transaction total of nearly $91,000, according to a disclosure filed Wednesday.The sales came as another Apple supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), warned Thursday that demand for $500 smartphones -- including the iPhone -- has declined.On Friday, the Nikkei Asian Review reported Apple will continue reduced production of iPhones this quarter amid sluggish demand.Despite the warnings, Broadcom is still trading near highs and only lost 0.4% this week. But Skyworks fell 3% and is 33% below its 52-week high.Meanwhile, Apple added 1.1% for the week as it sits 18% below its high, reached last April, and Taiwan Semi rose 0.7%.The banking giant's CFO and COO, Marianne Lake and Matthew Zames, unloaded some shares Thursday after the company's Q1 earnings the day prior beat forecasts.Lake sold nearly 14,000 JPMorgan shares for about $854,000, while Zames sold a little over 45,000 shares for a total of about $2.8 million.JPMorgan shares gapped up after the report but are now hitting resistance at the 200-day line. They rose 7% from a week ago.GoDaddy (GDDY) insiders made significant trades this week. CEO Blake Irving disclosed on Wednesday a sale and options exercise of 50,000 shares for a total of $1.51 million. Other major stakeholders, such as Silver Lake Group, sold millions of shares.GoDaddy failed to break out of a cup-with-handle base at the beginning of the month and has been testing support at the 50-day line. Shares fell 3.1% for the week.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.

355,UPS,"And now for something completely different: Democrats yelling at each other.Keeping with the debate's setting in Brooklyn, we pictured the old guy and the old gal yelling at each other through opposing apartment windows about five flights up.Bernie Sanders: ""Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and intelligence to be President? Of course she does. But I do question her judgment.”Hillary Clinton, referring to a Sanders newspaper interview: ""When asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counter-terrorism, except to say if he had some paper in front of him, maybe he could. I think you need to have the judgment on Day One to be both president and commander in chief.”Clinton vowed to break up any bank that fails to meet Dodd-Frank's requirements.To which Sanders replied: ""My goodness, they must have been really crushed by this. And was that before or after you received huge sums of money?""Of course, everyone has known that Sanders has no chance of capturing his party's nomination in Philadelphia, unless the FBI does something serious about her email, national security, FOIA troubles.Clinton says there'll be no problem there and President Obama agrees, as if both know something we don't.But Sanders, who always talks as if his hearing-aid battery is dead, has won eight of the last nine Democrat contests. And according to new polls, he's inched closer to her as Tuesday's big New York primary looms, a measure of widespread Democrat disquiet with the former first lady.Gallup reported Thursday that Clinton's net favorable rating among her own party's faithful has plunged to its lowest level yet -- +36 -- since it started tracking her last summer. In November, she was at +63.In fact, for weeks Sanders' net favorables (now +53) have topped not only Clinton but all of the remaining Republicans.John Kasich is the best of the worst on that side at +26, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz lagging badly at +9 and +8, respectively.So, nobody likes anybody left in this presidential cycle, except for the curmudgeonly, socialist grandpa who wants more taxes on anyone with any money and is beloved by young people who don't have much of it to lose but like free stuff.And while New York polls give Clinton a comfortable lead over Sanders for now, a new Fox News national poll shows her support slipping across the country. Among 1,021 respondents, Clinton now draws 48% support, down from 55% a month ago. While Sanders has jumped from 42% to 46%, a statistical tie.In hypothetical fall match-ups, Clinton beats Donald Trump 48% to 41%, inches past Ted Cruz 45% to 44% and loses to John Kasich 49% to 40%. Like Sanders, Kasich today has no mathematical way of becoming the GOP nominee in Cleveland.But wait! There's more! Sanders, the guy who has no chance to win the Democrat nomination, currently defeats all three Republicans, going 53% to 39% over Trump, 51% to 39% over Cruz and 47% to 43% even over Kasich.As for Republican nominee preferences, after a terrible month of gaffes, retreats and defeats Trump's support has jumped from 41% to 45%.After his impressive recent primary and caucus victories, Cruz' support has sagged from 38% to 27%.And Kasich, who hasn't won anything except his home state a political eon ago, has climbed from 17% to 25%.Other than all this, everything continues to make complete sense this presidential cycle.RELATED:

357,UPS,"Headlines haven't been kind to Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. ""America's Most Expensive Fighter Jet is Also Its Worst,"" Maxim wrote. ""Report: The F-35’s Pilot Eject System Could KILL You And Definitely Will Maim You,"" according to the Daily Caller. ""The Pentagon's Official F-35 Bug List is Terrifying,"" said ExtremeTech.Government reports of the $400 billion program have also been scathing. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain is a major critic, and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has said he'd consider dropping the program if he gets elected.But a Marine pilot who has been flying the F-35 for nearly four years feels differently, even if some bugs still need to be worked out.""I love the airplane, and it's great to be flying something that's newer,"" Maj. Brendan Walsh told IBD.He previously flew F/A-18C Hornets, which debuted in the 1980s, but he's now flying a so-called fifth-generation fighter with stealth technology.""Even in today's battlefield and even with what some people call immaturities on the F-35, I would hands down rather be in an F-35 than an F-18 in just about any situation,"" Walsh said.The Marine Corps declared the F-35B variant combat ready in July, and Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121, the ""Green Knights,"" became the first squadron to become operational with an F-35.Since then, the Marines have been preparing for the F-35's first deployment to Iwakuni, Japan, next year.A short, expeditionary runway comprised of metal sheets was used at a Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, Calif., to practice short take-offs and vertical landings (STOVL).""The STOVL is awesome,"" said Walsh, who is the operations officer for the Green Knights. ""We can deploy fifth-generation platforms in decentralized areas that make it hard for the enemy to target.""The F-35 has come a long way since Walsh started flying it four years ago. For example, it now takes Walsh eight minutes to hit the runway for take-off, comparable to the F/A-18, and down from two hours when he first started flying the new jet.He is also impressed with the F-35's stealth, among other features, and is confident that even more advanced capabilities will come later.""The radar has performed well, the surveillance systems and electronic surveillance systems have performed very well, even in this configuration of the airplane, and they are only going to get better,"" Walsh said.But while Walsh prefers the F-35 over his old jet, a dogfight in the new aircraft could be problematic.Last year, the military blog War Is Boring reported that an older General Dynamics (GD) F-16 outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air-combat test, setting off a firestorm of criticism.But the Pentagon has since said the F-35 wasn’t equipped with its full array of avionics, helmet mounted display or compete stealth coatings. It also is trying to downplay dogfighting, saying that's not the F-35's main mission.Another fifth-generation stealth fighter, Lockheed's F-22 Raptor, was designated primarily as an air superiority fighter. But it was canceled less than halfway into its production run as costs soared, leaving the Air Force with only 187 operational planes.The F-35, which will have three versions for the Air Force, Navy and Marines, is seen as a multirole fighter, with production expected to hit 2,443 for the U.S. services and more than 900 for international customers.Meanwhile, China has been developing the J-31 fighter, which is believed to be made from stolen F-35 plans, and a new long-range air-to-air missile. Russia also has been expanding its radar and weapons capabilities.But given its advanced features, Walsh doesn't see the F-35 doing much turning and burning against other fighters. “If you’re in a dogfight in this airplane, you did something wrong, because you should have killed everyone way before you got there.""Still, he said, there have been “better performances recently” in dogfighting match-ups, based on what he's heard from operational testers, and those tests are still ongoing.Other issues continue to hang over the F-35 program. Last month, at a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller said that he has “concerns about where the software was"" and wanted Lockheed to hurry up with fixes.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester has pointed out glitches in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues.Walsh's squadron tested the troublesome system, considered the ""brains"" of the F-35, in December, and it set up the complex server in a remote area in Twentynine Palms.""I have full confidence that we can deploy the server and go somewhere if we have to,"" Walsh said. ""I had no issues with it from a pilot's point of view, getting into the system and signing for the aircraft and screening it as appropriate for flight.""An evaluation of the ejection system also found that it's possible lightweight pilots could break their necks while ejecting. A fix is in the works, and Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work recently said he is confident ejection issues with lightweight pilots will be resolved. Also, until a software upgrade next year, the F-35 can't fire its 25 mm cannon.But the evaluation of one warfighter who would fly the F-35 into combat is clear: ""I feel way more survivable and way more lethal in the majority of mission sets in this airplane than with anything the Marine Corps has in the air right now,"" Walsh said.

358,UPS,"While there's attention on how Apple (AAPL) and the so-called FANG internet giants are performing, several megacap stocks have broken out and retaken buy points in the past week. General Electric (GE), IBM (IBM), Home Depot (HD) and Comcast (CMCSA). All four have market caps above $150 billion.Keep in mind that these four giants, with fundamentals that range from decent to lackluster, are late to the party. Many other stocks have had earlier run-ups and breakouts.General Electric rose 8 cents to 31.86 on the stock market today. GE closed Friday up 0.8% at 31.78, slightly above a 31.59 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. GE just topped that entry on Wednesday, then pulled back on Thursday. Volume was not impressive on the breakout, raising at least a yellow flag.GE peaked at an eight-year high of 33 on July 19, then pulled back to the 50-day line, where the stock clung tightly, barely moving for the next several weeks. Shares then broke down until early November. Shares have rebounded nicely since then, regaining their 50-day line on Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election, and then their 200-day line on Nov. 10.GE has struggled to deliver growth in core industrial orders and revenue, but investors are betting that the company will benefit from tax cuts, infrastructure spending and pro-energy moves under the Trump administration.GE's relative strength rank is a mediocre 46 out of 99. But its RS line, which gauges a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, has improved since late October. (The RS line is the thin blue line on the chart below).IBD'S TAKE: Here are five shale stocks that were near buy points before non-OPEC members agreed Saturday to join and OPEC production cut.Big Blue fell 0.6% to 165.50 Monday. IBM retook a 161.96 buy point on Wednesday in above-average volume, continuing to rise through Friday to close at 166.52, the highest since late July. IBM initially moved into buy range on Nov. 21, but fell back down on Dec. 1.IBM revenue has fallen vs. a year earlier for 18 straight quarters, though the declines have shrunk to just 0.3% in Q3.Home Depot rose 0.9% to 134.58. Shares climbed 0.65% to 133.39 on Friday, adding a little distance from a buy point of 132.23 first topped on Wednesday in above-normal trade. Home Depot hit a record 139 on Aug. 2, then retreated somewhat over the next three months before bottoming on Nov. 1.Comcast fell 0.7% to 68.97, just above a 68.46 buy point. Comcast first topped that entry on Nov. 17, after racing from the bottom in the prior two weeks. Much of the run-up was in very heavy volume, though the actual breakout had essentially flat trading activity. As recently as Wednesday, shares sometimes fell back below the buy point, at least intraday.Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal in addition to its cable and internet infrastructure, could benefit from tax cuts and a possible reversal of net neutrality rules under the Trump administration.As for Apple and the FANG stocks, Apple and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell less than 1% but closed above their 50-day lines after both retook that key support level on Friday for the first time in weeks, joining Netflix (NFLX). Netflix ended virtually unchanged.Amazon (AMZN) fell 1.1%, consolidating between its 50-day and 200-day lines. Facebook (FB) remains stuck below its 200-day after coming up just short on Friday.

360,UPS,"No football fan can forget Paul Brown. His name won't let them.The Cleveland Browns? Named for him.The Cincinnati Bengals' venue? Paul Brown Stadium.Why the recognition? Paul Brown owned pro football midcentury, capturing seven crowns.That's partly why Andrew O'Toole, author of ""Paul Brown: The Rise and Fall and Rise Again of Football's Most Innovative Coach,"" calls him one of the five greatest in pro history.""In no particular order, Vince Lombardi, Brown, Chuck Noll, Bill Belichick, George Halas,"" O'Toole told IBD. ""Plus, the Paul Brown coaching tree is still going. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin learned from Tony Dungy, who coached under Noll, who was Brown's messenger guard in Cleveland.""ESPN lauds Brown as the National Football League's sixth best, with three men he had on his staff — Noll, Don Shula and Bill Walsh — ranked higher.""Brown was the first to hire a full-time coaching staff that worked year-round, and he took the scouting of college players to a new level,"" noted the network. ""Brown, who had a teaching background, also used extensive film study of his players and graded them. He called plays from the sideline, using alternating guards to shuttle information to the field.""Brown also helped integrate professional football. Defensive lineman Bill Willis and running back Marion Motley were two of the first African-Americans to play professional football after they joined the Browns in 1946.""Sports historian Aaron Tallent, writing for Athlon Sports & Life, ups Brown to No. 5 among the tops.""In ranking coaches,"" he said, ""you have to take a look at their full body of work, regardless of whether their careers lasted six years or 40 years. In his 25-year NFL career, Brown made 10 straight title game appearances with the Browns and won seven championships. He then coached the newly launched Bengals and led them to two divisional titles. Brown's success with the Browns in the 1940s and 1950s made him a legendary coach, but his success with the Bengals in the 1970s showed why he was the best of the pre-Super Bowl era.""He won wherever he went, with a grip as firm as his stare.""First and foremost,"" Mike Brown, Paul's son and the Bengals' president, told IBD, ""PB was a teacher. That's how he saw his role. Then he was demanding, meaning that he required his players to know their assignments and perform. These traits … were key to his success.""One of Brown's players once said, ""Paul is a lot more than a coach in Cleveland. He signs you to a contract; he coaches you on the field; he tells you what to eat; and he tells you when to get up and when to go to bed.""On top of that, the man pushing all the right buttons knew he was good. His response to possibly fielding an inferior team? ""I'll never be that bad.""Brown (1908-91) was born in Norwalk, Ohio, and by high school and college was in every corner of sports: football, basketball, baseball, track and field.He starred at Washington High in Massillon, southeast of Norwalk, in the 1920s. After starting college at Ohio State, he transferred to Miami University in Oxford, way to the west of the state, studying English and history while quarterbacking and playing center field for the Big Red.Meanwhile, Paul was so close to his high school sweetheart, Katy Kester, that he married her in June 1929, before their senior years of college. They would have three sons.The middle one, Mike, said of life with Dad: ""He was the head of the household. If he said 'jump,' I was in the air before his sentence stopped sounding. His children respected him. They also loved him for his guidance and protection.""Paul graduated in 1930 after producing a 13-4 record in two varsity seasons as Miami's QB. With football in his veins, he sought a coaching job and found one at Maryland's Severn Military Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy. After one season, he headed back to the Buckeye State to coach his old Tigers of Massillon.Brown was judge and jury, with nary an appeal: ""Of course we have no smoking or drinking at any time. Any boy found guilty of either is out, definitely and completely.  That's the law. … During the football season we have some additional rules. We don't ride in an automobile, don't go to dances, don't have dates. … The boys are off the streets at 9:30 and in bed by 10.""If anyone swerved?""He's a forgotten man,"" said the taskmaster. ""He just disappears from the squad. There is no trouble about it.""The squad responded by crushing teams through the 1930s. Brown's Tigers were so confident that they took on Kent State University in a practice game in the spring of 1940 and trampled the Golden Flashes 47-0.America was catching on, with Life magazine, the Saturday Evening Post and the Philadelphia Inquirer profiling Brown's boys. Chester Smith of the Pittsburgh Press was sold: ""It is whispered here and there, Coach Brown teethes the town's boys on shin guards and old shoulder pads, so that by the time they reach high school age, they walk the streets in huddles and signal for a fair catch every time the local trolley comes along.""Brown was ready for a bigger stage. ""You know, Katy,"" he said during a visit to Ohio Stadium, ""I've a feeling that someday I'm going to be running this show.""He was by 1941. It took him just one more season to coach Ohio State to the national championship.With America at war by then, Brown joined the Navy and as a lieutenant coached the Great Lakes naval station team.In 1945, the last year of World War II, Brown heard from Cleveland of the new All-America Football Conference. The team wanted his heft so badly that it offered an annual salary of $25,000, worth $330,000 today.Brown's answer: Yes. He was ready for pro ball.Only what to call the team? The front office decided to name it for the big-name coach: the Cleveland Browns.""The new league had no bigger marketing tool than Brown,"" wrote O'Toole, ""and such was the respect Brown garnered and the reverence he was given in Ohio.""The coach quickly earned the fans' huzzahs. With 60,000 flowing into Municipal Stadium to catch this brand-new act of 1946, the Browns produced a 44-0 triumph. They were on their way to the inaugural AAFC title.Brown's Browns were rolling toward a dynasty, packing 83,000 fans into Municipal Stadium amid their 14-0 campaign of 1948.After winning the AAFC crown again in 1949, Brown's guys joined in on the merger with the NFL and didn't miss a beat. They won it all in 1950, 1954 and 1955, when a then-record 88,000 jammed the Los Angeles Coliseum for the title game.In the middle of his pro domination, Brown planted himself on the cutting edge. He invented the face guard, bolstered his staff with six assistants vs. the league's usual two, designed intricate pass patterns and triggered the zone defense.Yet his decade of domination had hit its peak. The coach drafted another great Brown, by the name of Jim, in 1957. But the title years were over.Cleveland fired its nickname's origin after the 1962 season. Brown kept the title of vice president and a handsome salary, plus played golf at his new home near San Diego, but he missed football.So in 1968, fresh off entering the Pro Football Hall of Fame the year before, Brown gladly returned to the sidelines. This time he ran the expansion Bengals as coach and general manager while owning 10% of the team and drawing today's equivalent of $400,000 a year.""I was dying by inches,"" he said of his exile. ""Nothing is very important to me outside of my family and football.""Said Mike: ""Football coaching was what he wanted to do. Do what makes you happy. That's the best way to generate success.""Paul also rebounded personally. Stung by Katy's death in 1969, he married Mary Rightsell four years later.After coaching the Bengals to their third playoff appearance, in 1975, Brown quit coaching and stayed in the front office to help oversee their two Super Bowl appearances — both losses to his old assistant Walsh.""Brown is the only football coach to ever win a state championship, national championship and world championship,"" noted Tallent. ""His 1950 Cleveland Browns won the NFL title its first season in the league. The only team since — that has had any sort of comparable success — was the 1996 Carolina Panthers, who made the NFC championship in its second season as an expansion team.""In Cincinnati, Brown gave Walsh the latitude to pioneer the West Coast offense. Walsh was one of countless successful coaches that Brown mentored in his career.""Brown's KeysCoached Ohio State to a national championship, then led Cleveland to seven pro football titles.Overcame: Doubts about his revolutionary passing schemes.Lesson: Stick with the strategy you believe in.""We're not interested in building confidence or initiative.

Volume was lower across the board, suggesting a lack of appetite among institutional buyers.Minutes fr0m the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting left more signs that policymakers are inclined to raise interest rates by year's end. In fact, a rate hike last month was termed a ""close call"" by participants, who judged the economy strong enough to make a ""reasonable argument"" to raise the fed funds rate.Some officials voiced concern that a delay in a rate increase could hurt the Fed's credibility. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee saw Brexit risks receding and that the labor market has improved appreciably in past year. Those are ingredients for an increase in borrowing costs.Mining, retail and some building stocks led today's trading, while the health care sector continued to show broad weakness. Managed-care stocks made up a cluster of stocks down in unusually heavy volume.Humana (HUM) plunged 5% in heavy volume. The HMO had been forming a shallow base, but the sell-off has soiled the pattern. Humana announced preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15 a share, above views. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the company's share of members in four-star or higher-quality plans fell to around 37%, from 78% the prior year. The drop threatens to hurt bonuses that Humana earns.Aetna (AET), which is fighting antitrust issues to acquire Humana, fell 1.5% to the lowest level since May.Cigna (CI) was down more than 2% as its four-star-or-higher enrollments dived to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note. Anthem (ANTM), which is trying to merge with Cigna, was off nearly 1%. That deal also faces objections from the U.S. Justice Department.In other parts of the medical sector, Illumina (ILMN) continued to weaken following Tuesday's 25% crash on a lowered sales outlook.

362,UPS,"Pessimists often compare today's troubled America to a tottering late Rome or an insolvent and descending British Empire. But medieval Europe (roughly A.D. 500 to 1450) is the more apt comparison.The medieval world was a nearly 1,000-year period of spectacular, if haphazard, human achievement -- along with endemic insecurity, superstition and two, rather than three, classes.The great medieval universities -- at Bologna, Paris and Oxford -- continued to make strides in science. They were not unlike the medical and engineering schools at Harvard and Stanford. But they were not centers of free thinking.Instead, medieval speech codes were designed to ensure that no one questioned the authority of church doctrine. Culturally or politically incorrect literature of the classical past, from Aristophanes to Petronius, was censored as either subversive or hurtful.Career-wise, it was suicidal for, say, a medieval professor of science at the University of Padua to doubt the orthodoxy that the sun revolved around the earth.Similarly, at Berkeley or Princeton, few now dare to commit the heresy of expressing uncertainty about whether man-caused global warming poses an immediate, existential threat to human civilization.Today, a fifth of American households have zero or negative net worth. The shrinking middle classes struggle to service trillions of dollars in consumer and student debt to big banks -- in the manner of medieval peasants.In the medieval world, impoverished serfs pledged loyalty to barons in exchange for their food and housing on the manor.In the modern world, progressive government is the bastion that distributes entitlements on the expectation that the masses show their political fealty at election time.In medieval Europe, widespread literacy disappeared. Superstition reigned in place of reason.Despite spending some $11,000 per student each year, are we all that much different?In many polls, more than a quarter of Americans believe in astrology. A quarter think aliens have visited Earth. More than 40% can't name their own vice president. Nearly three-quarters of Americans have no idea what the Cold War was about.The ruling cliques of the medieval court were full of insider knaves and scoundrels, plots and intrigue. Compare the current scandals, lies and hypocrisies of our Beltway cloister in Washington.Closeted scholiasts wrote esoteric treatises that no one read. These works were sort of like the incomprehensible ""theory"" articles of university humanities professors who are up for tenure.To talk to the masses, the Latin-speaking elite spoke localized slang that would centuries later become English, French and German -- the medieval version of our electronic grunts and made-up words on Twitter and email that are forming a new popular language.Medieval Europe was fragmented into local and warring fiefdoms. Tribalism trumped state unity -- not unlike America's descent into separate red-state and blue-state cultures and identity politics.With ancient borders long forgotten, medieval elites relied on massive walls, moats and keeps to stay safe -- sort of similar to what we see with the present-day gated estates of Malibu and Silicon Valley.Today's zillionaire lords drive BMWs and fly in private jets instead of riding huge warhorses. They may wear jeans and flip-flops in place of robes and crowns, but their wealth and influence are as unlimited as the splendor of the lords of the medieval manor.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg apparently does not assume that state law enforcement can guarantee the security of his estate.Instead, he has his own security personnel to keep out bounders -- and buys up all the houses around his own in a postmodern effort to form a sort of premodern moat.The great architects of the late Middle Ages could design majestic cathedrals at places such as Chartes and Rouen.But debt, incompetence and quarreling meant that their construction -- unlike the earlier construction of the Parthenon -- took centuries to complete.The blueprints and mock-ups for California high-speed rail are as grandiose as the plans of medieval Gothic churches. But the reality of ever completing the project will require a half-century of cost overruns, lawsuits, and continual higher fees and taxes.For their roads and water, isolated medieval fiefdoms relied on the crumbling ancient infrastructure of long-gone Rome.In 21st-century America, we rely on -- but could never again build -- structures such as the Hoover Dam. It's inconceivable that we could build, for instance, a new eight-lane, interstate super freeway system from coast to coast.Medieval mass entertainment -- puppeteering, mimes, jugglers, acrobats -- was far different than the sort of entertainment that troubadours and bards performed for the lords. In our age, think of the gulf between the symphony and reality TV, quiz shows and the NFL.There is one great difference, however, between the medieval and modern worlds.People living in the first millennium believed in transcendence and a soul, and sought to keep alive culture until civilization returned.People living in the second millennium increasingly live for their appetites without worry about what follows -- with little awareness of what has been lost and so not a clue about how to recapture it.

363,UPS,"Acacia Communications (ACIA) shot up on the stock market today after raising third-quarter earnings guidance for the second time in little more than a week. That came after the Acacia stock passed a key technical test in bullish fashion on Tuesday even as other hot IPOs chilled.Late Tuesday, Acacia raised its outlook again for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. The maker of components for high-speed networks  now expects diluted earnings of 83 cents to 90 cents a share, up from the 72-98 cents it projected on Sept. 26. Acacia also said it sees revenue at $130 million to $133 million, up from the $129 million midpoint projected in last month's guidance.Acacia's Sept. 26 guidance was above analyst estimates, but only slightly. And at the same time Acacia announced plans for a $450 million stock offering that will mostly go to existing shareholders. Shares plunged 10.2% that day. (Acacia said late Tuesday that it is launching the follow-on offering.)Acacia shares rose 11% to 113.54 Wednesday, pushing the stock already well beyond range from a follow-on buy opportunity triggered in the prior session.IBD'S TAKE: Acacia is part of the highly rated Telecom-Fiber optics group. Read this Industry Snapshot for an in-depth look at what's driving the fiber-optic super cycle.Acacia stock had been pulling back since peaking at 128.73 on Sept. 7. Tuesday morning, shares fell to pennies above their 50-day moving average, but then quickly rebounded, closing up 2.5% to close at 102.But shares were still up some 343% from the IPO price of 23 as of Tuesday's close.The 50-day line is important, because mutual funds and other big institutions will often buy up shares around that level. This was Acacia's first brush with that support level since it came public in May.Other recent strong IPOs are taking a breather in recent days. Nutanix (NTNX) shot up 131% in its trading debut Friday, then followed up with 20% gain Monday. Nutanix, which has pioneered a new field called hyperconvergence infrastructure, pulled back 14.3% to 38.09 on Tuesday. Nutanix fell 5% Wednesday.Cloud software firm Twilio (TWLO) skidded 2.6% Tuesday to 62.50. Twilio has pulled back from last week's 70.96 peak, but is still up sharply from its June IPO price of 15. Twilio rose nearly 1% Wednesday.Japanese messaging giant Line (LN) fell nearly 2% to 47.25 on Tuesday, its its fifth straight down session after peaking at 51.48 on Sept. 28. Line broke out to a new high in late September, but had passed earlier buy points. Line stock rose 2.4% Wednesday.Line came public at 32.75 in July.RELATED:Acacia Communications Ups Guidance, But Tumbles On Stock OfferingFabrinet Hits Bullish Level As Analyst Raises Expectations For StockNutanix Stokes IPO Fire; Tech Unicorn Doubles In Debut

364,UPS,"Recent IPOs have enchanted investors lately, with Nutanix (NTNX) — more than doubling in its Friday debut — marking just the latest sign of strong demand for new issues.But the honeymoon period may come under some strain in the coming week from high flyer Acacia Communications (ACIA).The provider of high-speed fiber-optic communications gear saw its first real test of its fast-rising 50-day average since going public in May. Acacia also is close to undercutting recent lows.Acacia hit an intraday high of 128.73 early last month but has dropped 20% since then, due in part to a secondary stock offering.The stock fell 3.7% to closed at 99.50 on the stock market today but dropped as low as 98.75 earlier, both above its 50-day average.Other recent IPOs Impinj (PI) and Twilio (TWLO) have bounced higher above their 50-day lines. Twilio took a 6% dive Friday but rallied 1% Monday. Impinj rose early but reversed to finish 3.8% lower.Meanwhile, Japan-based messaging service Line (LN), which went public in July, has fallen below a 48.20 buy point Monday with the Leaderboard stock down 0.6% at 48.13.The newest hot IPO is Nutanix. Late Thursday, the cloud company priced 14.9 million shares at 16, above its estimated range of 13-15. And on Friday, it soared 131%, a bigger surge on its first day than the debuts for Line (up 27%), Impinj (28%), Acacia (up 35%) and Twilio (92%).On Monday, Nutanix shot up 20% to 44.46.IBD'S TAKE: IPOs are a wellspring of innovation and can be huge stock winners. But they can reverse quickly. Read this IPO Analysis: IPO leaders Can Fall Hardest In A Weak Market.

365,UPS,"The optical component industry is entering the ""strongest demand environment since the telecom bubble of the late 1990s,"" says a Jefferies analyst, who initiated coverage of Oclaro (OCLR) with a buy rating and raised his EPS and revenue estimates for Lumentum Holdings (LITE).James Kisner set a price target of 11.25 on Oclaro stock. Oclaro on Sept. 21 announced a $15 million stock offering for which Jefferies served as the sole book-runner.""Over the last few years Oclaro's management has transformed the company, shedding several businesses, paying off its debt and focusing on the product areas where it can most differentiate,"" Kisner said in a report. ""This has resulted in a stunning turnaround from years of operating losses to a near tripling of gross margin and double-digit operating margin.""Kisner hiked his fiscal 2018 profit estimate for Lumentum to $2.61 per share, which he said was 14% above consensus estimates. Kisner raised Lumentum's fiscal 2018 revenue estimate to $1.29 billion, 11% above consensus estimates, he said.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optics group is ranked No. 2 out of 197 industry groups, with Oclaro, Lumentum, hot IPO Acacia Communications, Finisar and NeoPhotonics among the top-rated stocks. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Oclaro shares rose 2% to close at 8.72 on the stock market today. The stock hit a 5-year high of 9.34 on Sept. 22. Lumentum fell 0.8% to 41.45. Shares hit an all-time high of 42.35 on Sept. 28.Shares in Lumentum's forerunner, JDS Uniphase, and other fiber-optic parts makers soared during the late 1990s as startups built new long-distance networks to carry Internet traffic. Over-investment led to a glut in network capacity and the telecom bubble burst in 2001.Optical component makers are now getting a boost from internet firms such as Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) which are building new data centers that require fast communications networks. There's also strong demand for optical parts in China. And, phone companies such as Verizon Communications (VZ) are upgrading network rings in metropolitan areas to faster 100-gigabit-per-second technology.""We believe end demand is still ramping steeply for all three (China, 100G metro and hyper-scale data centers) of the major demand drivers,"" Kisner said. ""Our discussions with the management of optical component companies in recent weeks convince us that the optical component industry is entering the strongest demand environment since the telecom bubble.""RELATED:Stocks To Watch: Acacia Nears Key Test As Nutanix, Other IPOs Take OffU.S. Optical Firms Dominate Supercycle As Chinese Rivals LagAcacia Communications Ups Guidance, But Tumbles On Stock Offering

367,UPS,"Nike (NKE) beat first-quarter forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, but futures orders growth was weaker than expected, sinking shares initially late Tuesday.Going forward, the impact of ""futures orders"" on the stock is changing, however, as Nike CFO Andy Campion announced during the call that the sports apparel titan is no longer releasing those figures with its quarterly reports.""The relationship between reported futures and reported revenue in a given quarter has become less correlated based on our evolving business mix,"" said Campion. From now on, futures will ""first be referenced in the context of broader guidance"" in the earning call instead of as a standalone, forward-looking metric in its earnings releases.The Nike-created metric, which represents products scheduled for delivery to retailers, is probably the most closely watched quarterly result outside of earnings and revenue.The change in futures reporting could be indicative of Nike's continued investments in its direct-to-consumer business, which grew 22% on a currency-neutral basis during the quarter, including 49% growth at Nike.com.@IBD_elow i think it indicates that the metric is less important as their owned retail business grows— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) September 27, 2016Shares closed up 1.8% to 55.36 in the stock market today, then dropped 2% after hours as investors focused on Nike's performance in the U.S. Rival Under Armour (UA) edged up 0.4% late.Here's the rest of Nike's quarter, by the numbers:Estimates: Analysts saw a 16% earnings-per-share gain to 56 cents on 5% revenue growth to $8.87 billion.Results: EPS of 73 cents on revenue of $9.1 billion.

Worldwide futures orders, excluding currency effects, rose 11%.Stock: Nike breached its 50-day line on Sept. 8 and spent but a few sessions above the 200-day moving average since April. Nike scores a relatively weak IBD Composite Rating of 31, which means 69% of all other publicly traded companies outperform the sportswear giant in a combination of technical and fundamental factors.Why It Matters: The Swoosh dominates athletic apparel, but creeping competition from Under Armour, Adidas and other athletic brands is nipping at Nike's heels.IBD'S TAKE: Nike is part of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing industry group, which currently ranks a lowly 189 out of 197 tracked sectors.

"
370,UPS,"This presidential season Americans have been treated to the usual outrageous campaign promises and extraordinary candidate alibis about past transgressions, but those pale in comparison to claims about gains in family incomes served up by the Obama administration last week.According to the Census Bureau, average annual household incomes leaped a whopping $2,798 or 5.2% in 2015. Democrats offer that as proof the country is on the right track and Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton.Those numbers can't be correct if GDP grew only 2.6% and households receive through wages, interest, dividends and other sources about 75% of national income -- 85% if we add in government payments like Social Security.The extra cash had to appear out of thin air or U.S. borrowing from foreigners jumped much more than the increase in the sale of assets indicate.I am not a conspiracy theorist but the household income report smacks of political manipulation, or incompetence among government number crunchers.Part of the problem is that the Census Bureau reported household incomes fell $809 in 2014 -- an equally silly finding given that GDP advanced 2.4%.Even if we take the numbers at face value, the Census report tells us why most voters are unhappy.Since the financial crisis, household incomes are down $907 and since 1999, down $1,393. Simply, family incomes have their ups and downs but the trend has been downhill as the economy has mustered only 1.8% annual GDP growth in this century.Incomes for the top 25% of households have been advancing but for ordinary folks, economic conditions have been getting worse much more rapidly than the averages indicated. Particularly hard hit have been rural areas and states heavily dependent on the declining manufacturing sector.Globalization has destroyed too many jobs, because free trade agreements have opened U.S. workers to competition from imports while mercantilist nations like China, Japan and Germany have found ways to shut out competitive American products. And technologies, from automated checkouts at the drugstore to robots in warehouses, are gradually eliminating many ordinary jobs and driving down wages.For Americans well versed in technology and finance or with degrees from elite universities, the economy is great, but for the rest it's a slow sink into primeval mud, or worse.Mrs. Clinton would have us believe all our problems stem from economic injustice -- the rich don't pay enough taxes and stingy corporate leaders thumb down wages and are unfair to women.She promises to raise their taxes to subsidize paid maternity leave and day care, expand ObamaCare, lower the age threshold for Medicare, offer free tuition at state universities, and more.The top 20% of earners already pay 84% of all income taxes, and unless anyone believes marginal rates tax rates of 60% or more won't inspire high earners to work less, find ways to move income off shore or emigrate to saner places like Ireland or the U.K., we are likely already pressing the limits of social benefits the government can finance without boosting taxes on the beleaguered and ever sinking middle class.The only genuine solution is to get the economy growing more robustly as it did during the Reagan-Clinton years -- about 3.4% -- or borrow from foreigners until a burgeoning national debt leaves the country as bankrupt as Greece.Donald Trump could not resist the campaign temptation to offer his own package of maternity leave and day care subsidies and he has yet to identify an entitlement he doesn't like, but at least his overall program is focused on revving up growth and not punishing success.The United States is still a well spring of innovation -- thanks to our great network of engineering colleges and commercial research labs — but getting the country growing requires investments to transform that intellectual property into jobs and a business friendly environment to better do it.Cutting not raising taxes, stripping away unnecessary and unproductive government regulations and assuring U.S. businesses the opportunity to compete fairly on global markets through better trade deals are the answer. We simply are hearing more about those opportunities from Mr. Trump than Mrs. Clinton -- who is too busy obsessing about injustice to realize America's untapped potential.Exaggerated promises abound from both candidates but the choice between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is really about optimism and confidence in America and a dreary pessimism that the world is endlessly unfair.

374,UPS,"Twitter's (TWTR) board reportedly will meet Thursday amid takeover speculation but the social network might wait until Q4 to make a decision after its NFL live-streaming deal kicks in, says Jefferies.Twitter stock edged up in August amid speculation the company could be acquired. According to media reports, former Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Steve Ballmer and Saudi Arabian Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal were interested in acquiring Twitter for $22 to $26 per share. Twitter's board will meet Thursday to discuss options, says tech website ReCode.Former Twitter CEO Evan Williams has suggested the struggling internet firm should ""consider the right options."" Although Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) still looms as a potential buyer, private equity firms also could be in the hunt, says Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz in a research report.""Twitter's turnaround has had its ups and downs, but we believe that Twitter has a very attractive real-time data asset, which could be valuable to numerous strategic buyers,"" said Pitz in the report.

375,UPS,"For eight years, TTT Moneycorp Ltd. regularly took Dariusz Suchicki to dinner and soccer matches, all while selling him, as the head of finance of a U.K.-based importer of Polish foods, a series of complex currency derivatives.When the pound started moving sharply against the zloty, those instruments became toxic: They began costing Suchicki's company, Best Foods, tens of thousands of pounds a month, the company said in court filings last year. Now, as Britain prepares for Brexit, blow-ups of this type of complex financial instrument are surging.About a quarter of all U.K. small and midsize enterprises routinely use hedging tools to manage currency risk, broker Afex Markets found in a survey carried out in 2015. Many of these instruments are highly leveraged, and can result in magnified losses for companies hit by big currency swings.Since the pound plummeted 12% after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, lawyers say they have been inundated with inquiries from companies that claim they were cajoled into buying similar esoteric products. The concerns come as British firms are already bracing for economic headwinds likely to accompany a future outside the European Union.Like Best Foods, many of those companies claim they were pressured into buying products they didn't fully understand and whose risks weren't properly explained -- so-called misselling. The derivatives sold to Best Foods were so numerous and of such ""exceptionally high complexity,"" the firm said, that Suchicki lacked the expertise and equipment to evaluate them.In the court documents, Moneycorp said that by entering the contracts, Best Foods acknowledged and understood that ""trading in options, even when used to cover a commercial position, may involve a high degree of risk and is appropriate only for persons who are able to withstand the risk of loss."" The firms settled out of court this year. Both declined to comment for this article.""It's not until the tide goes out that you discover the hidden risks of some derivatives products,"" said Alberto Thomas, a founding partner of Fideres Partners, a consultancy that works with law firms to bring misselling claims. ""We have seen a rise in cases of less sophisticated investors who were sold highly structured products which turn out to be of little or no use as hedging instruments,"" said Thomas, who wasn't involved in the Best Foods matter.The story of the unsophisticated investor buying complicated financial products and later facing costs they can't bear is a familiar one. Thousands of public authorities, from Jefferson County, Alabama, to Saint-Etienne, France, have paid millions of dollars to terminate swaps that soured. In the U.K., nine banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc, paid 2.2 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in response to claims they missold interest-rate swaps to 18,000 customers.The difference this time is that many of these instruments are sold by lightly regulated brokers, because bigger banks have grown fearful of getting embroiled in another potential scandal, said Robin Henry, a partner at London law firm Collyer Bristow LLP, which advised Best Foods on its case. These brokers cold-call prospective customers, offer their services in newspaper advertorials and motivate their sales people with fat commissions, lawyers said.The derivatives subject to misselling claims have names like ""seagull"" and ""two-times leveraged accelerated knock-out, knock-in forward."" Most follow a standard format: The company agrees to buy a certain amount of currency each month based on the foreign exchange rate at the time.In the short term, it gets a better deal than it would get in the spot market or by using simple forwards. However, if exchange rates fall outside a given range -- after Brexit or the Swiss government's 2015 decision to ditch its currency peg, for example -- covenants are triggered that force the company to purchase much more currency than it needs or buy at unattractive levels.""We've seen examples of companies who need to swap $50 million worth of currency a year but, because of the leverage, they end up being obliged to buy $500 million,"" Collyer Bristow's Henry said. ""That's where you get these losses of $10 million or $15 million, which are completely unsustainable and take these companies completely by surprise.""Suchicki's problems started in early 2013, when the pound, spurred on by a buoyant U.K. economy and a series of Polish rate cuts, began a two-year ascent versus the zloty. Ordinarily, such moves would have helped the bottom line of Best Foods, which imports Polish meats and vegetables into the British market. Instead, according to the legal filings, the company suffered heavy losses. At one stage, the company said it was paying as much as 16 times more than it would have in the market to transfer pounds into zlotys.It's unclear just how many companies are struggling with soured contracts like these. Vedanta Hedging Ltd., a firm that provides financial expertise for lawyers who bring misselling cases, has helped its clients settle seven currency product cases, and says it has received 18 inquiries since the June 23 Brexit vote. Collyer Bristow is currently working on about half a dozen cases.Few are likely to make it to court, according to Clive Zietman, a partner at Stewarts Law. ""We are seeing more of these types of claims, but we are talking about small businesses, and it's prohibitively expensive to bring action,"" said Zietman. ""They are complicated, there's a lot of evidence work, and banks and other sellers will fight them.""The total market for foreign exchange derivatives is close to $3 trillion globally, according to the Bank of International Settlements' most recent review, but most of that is made up of transactions among large financial institutions, funds and sophisticated multinationals.Still, the money to be made from the small and midsize companies market has attracted big players. In August 2014, Bridgepoint, one of the U.K.'s biggest private equity firms, acquired Moneycorp in a deal worth 212 million pounds. The previous year, World First UK Ltd. sold a 40 percent stake to U.S. private equity firm FTV Capital for an undisclosed sum.A spokesman for Bridgepoint declined to comment. World First and FTV Capital didn't reply to e-mails seeking comment.The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority has seen little evidence of widespread misselling and doesn't view it as a significant problem, according to a person at the regulator, who asked not to be cited by name. The FCA declined to comment.So far, at least, many brokers have been willing to work with companies to find a solution behind closed doors -- either through restructuring, delaying payments or increasing credit limits.The situation could change if the pound continues its Brexit-spurred descent because most buyers of the derivatives haven't posted enough collateral to cover the losses they would face, according to Collyer Bristow's Henry. The currency is currently on track for its longest losing streak in three weeks versus the dollar. If enough businesses are affected, it would be the brokers' profits that ultimately get slammed.

376,UPS,"Emotions are unquestionably one of the biggest detriments to an investor's success. Control them, and profits await; let them control you, and disaster can strike.But it's not just your emotions that require attention. Mass psychology at extreme levels of fear or overconfidence provide key insights into whether markets are at unsustainable levels.To that end, IBD provides a Psychological Market Indicators page to assist in gauging market sentiment. Understand that these are secondary indicators -- analysis of price and volume of the major market indexes remains primary. However, psychological indicators let you know when the environment may be changing and confirm the chart action.The Volatility Index, also known by its symbol as ""the VIX,"" uses option activity in the S&P 500 to quantify investors' desire to hedge their portfolios, usually to protect from downside risk. A rise in the VIX suggests elevated levels of fear, hence its nickname ""the fear index."" IBD has long used the VIX to confirm intermediate and longer-term market bottoms. But it's also useful at flagging short-term market bottoms.The Put/Call Volume Ratio also measures options activity. When the volume in (bearish) puts gets to extremes vs. (bullish) calls, that also suggests a lot of interest in protecting portfolios from downside risk. Again, the fear and desire for protection usually get to their highest levels close to market bottoms.Another popular contrarian indicator is the Investors Intelligence survey of market newsletters. You would think the professional advisors, the so-called ""experts,"" would provide valuable information on market direction. But the more they agree, the more their collective advice tends to be on the wrong side. Professional advisors are human too and susceptible to emotions like the rest of us. This indicator tends to work best in signaling market bottoms when the percentage of bears exceeds the level of bulls. The more fear there is, even among the experts, the more likely a bottom is near.Two new psychological indicators also join the page. The High-Low Ratio is a tally of new highs and lows across all indexes and is put into a proprietary ratio. A low number reflects an abundance of lows relative to highs. After reaching extreme lows, an uptick in this ratio can suggest the market is on an upswing.Finally, the other new indicator helps with major tops, which tend to be more elusive. Tracking Margin Debt can let you know when overconfidence and an absence of fear are ruling investors' emotions. A top is imminent when more people use margin, or borrowing, to make a killing on a market that continues going up. With an increase of 55% versus the same month of the prior year, you can usually expect a major downturn. The data for this indicator isn't available right away, but since the time frame is on a long-term basis, it gives you ample time to make adjustments.The new page on Investors.com is available now in the Market Trend section and features charts on each indicator with a description and real-time marks when indicators hit critical levels, as well as historical flags using the indicators.

377,UPS,"New data out from the Obama administration on Tuesday seemed to suggest that all the hand-wringing over double-digit ObamaCare rate hikes in 2016 was much ado about not that much: The average exchange premium on plans selected via HealthCare.gov rose a less-jarring 8.4% from 2015.Yet a close look at the data shows that HealthCare.gov rates actually did rise at least 10% after all, with the average premium rising less, in part, because people were buying less coverage for their money.The average premium on plans selected (but not necessarily paid for) via HealthCare.gov as of Feb. 1 was $386 a month, $30 per month more than the average policy selected during the 2015 open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services said.There are three main ways that the reported 8.4% increase understates reality. First, new enrollees were somewhat more likely to opt for catastrophic and bronze coverage, while most people with platinum coverage dropped it. The effect of people choosing, on average, a slightly lower-level plan was to reduce premiums by nearly three-fourths of a percent, an IBD analysis finds.The second way that premiums understate the apples-to-apples increase in rates is harder to detect but may be significant. Consider that Florida, ObamaCare's largest exchange with 1.75 million members, saw just a 2.7% hike in premiums, meaning the rest of the HealthCare.gov states saw an average 9.7% hike.Now take a look at Miami-Dade County, Florida's largest market and the largest in the county. Centene's (CNC) Ambetter unit has the two lowest-priced silver plans, including one with an eye-popping $6,500 deductible that is 6.2% cheaper than the cheapest rival plan from Molina Healthcare (MOH).As explained at HealthCare.gov, a silver plan is designed to pay 70% of the total cost of covered expenses by all members. Yet that's not quite true -- especially in markets like Miami, Atlanta, Seattle and Jackson, Miss., where Centene's Ambetter is the low-cost provider and covers as little as 68% of total member costs.A primary reason that premiums didn't rise as much as feared, HHS says, is that consumers were active shoppers and swapped out of plans with big premium hikes. Yet many of these plan changers may have been swapping into plans with higher deductibles, lower cost-sharing and less coverage -- even if they didn't shift from, say, silver to bronze.Among silver plans in the biggest HealthCare.gov markets of each state, the average deductible of the second-lowest-cost silver plan rose 11% from 2015, IBD found.The third reason that the HHS spin doesn't quite add up is that sign-ups among children under age 18 jumped by more than 21% vs. the overall gain of just under 9%. While it's good that more children have insurance, they cost a whole lot less to insure. Including children in the mix has the effect of lowering the 2016 premium increase by about two-thirds of a percent.There's a good reason that signups in 2016 grew so little -- despite the ramping up of the penalty for going uninsured. Millions and millions of people are finding that the plans provide too little and are too costly -- even with subsidies that held down the effective premium hike to just 4% for the vast majority of exchange shoppers who qualify. While the new HHS data on premiums is misleading in a number of ways, the real problem is that the Obama administration is missing the forest for the trees.In coming weeks, insurers will begin to provide an early look at 2017 premiums, and the picture could get worse. One of ObamaCare's fiercest defenders, Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee, has predicted big premium increases across the country. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth (UNH) has already told Arkansas and Georgia that it's bailing on their exchanges.

That's a 19% premium to Chemtura's close Friday. The Lanxess-Chemtura deal will have an enterprise value of $2.5 billion.Chemtura rose 16% to 32.75 before the opening bell on the stock market today.Earlier this month, Germany chemicals firm Bayer (BAYRY) agreed to pay $66 billion, or $128 a share, for seeds and herbicide giant Monsanto (MON), after raising the bids several times. Monsanto shares, which were at 106.10 before the deal, have drifted down to 103.50, reflecting concerns that the merger won't pass antitrust muster.IBD'S TAKE: The domestic chemical industry is booming, with U.S. and foreign companies spending some $170 billion on 268 projects. Credit cheap natural gas at home. Read more about the renaissance in ""Shale 2.0: A Follow-On Boom In The U.S. Chemicals Trade.""Monsanto previously had sought to buy Swiss-based Syngenta (SYT), but Syngenta rebuffed those advances, in part on antitrust concerns. Syngenta has accepted a takeover offer form China's ChinaChem.Also this month, Praxair and Germany's Linde ended talks on an industrial gases megamerger, with the fate of Linde's Munich headquarters an apparent sticking point.One advantage to foreign takeovers of U.S. companies is that the change of ownership can lower the tax bill of the newly acquired firm. The Obama administration has tightened restrictions on tax inversions, wherein U.S. companies buy a foreign firm but redomicile overseas to lower taxes on non-U.S. operations. But that does nothing to reduce the tax incentives of foreign purchases of American companies.Amid the cross-border chemical romances, there are domestic tie-ups.

382,UPS,"In 2009, 50 of fashion's leading designers created the hottest ticket of New York City's Fashion Week. The show celebrated a beloved muse on her 50th birthday: The Barbie doll. Barbie debuted in 1959 and ""perseveres today as a cultural icon ... her enchanting essence has allowed generations of women to enter a world of make-believe that knows no boundaries,"" said Vera Wang in InStyle magazine.Barbie is the product of the make-believe and boundless marketing acumen of Ruth Handler, who co-founded Mattel (MAT) with her husband Elliot Handler and Harold Matson in a Los Angeles garage in 1945. Today, Mattel is the world's largest toy manufacturer with sales in 150 countries and annual revenues of over $6 billion. Elliot Handler created many of Mattel's early successes, and Ruth's marketing genius brought them to the masses.Handler was born in Denver in 1916, the tenth child of Jewish immigrants who fled anti-Semitism in Poland. After her mother became ill, infant Ruth went to live with her eldest sister, Sarah, and her husband, Louie Greenwald, hardworking small-business owners who owned a pharmacy, lunch stand and one of Denver's first post-prohibition liquor stores.Handler had a more affluent upbringing than her siblings, whose home was plagued by their father's gambling debts. But hers wasn't a life of leisure; Ruth began working in the Greenwald businesses as soon as she could.In addition to her job at the lunch stand and classes at the University of Denver, 18-year-old Ruth was occupied with Elliot Handler, a young artist she met at a dance. Wanting to see the world, however, she accepted a girlfriend's offer to explore Los Angeles.  Elliot saved up money to attend Los Angeles' Art Center College of Design and soon joined Ruth, who worked in the stenography pool at Paramount Studios. They married in 1938.While Ruth continued at Paramount, Elliot began making a name for himself as a designer of costume jewelry. She often made sales calls for him on her lunch hour. In 1941, she gave birth to a daughter named — you guessed it — Barbara. While a reluctant homemaker, she then had a son — yes, Kenneth — in 1944.In 1945, Elliot and colleague Harold Matson founded Mattel. Ruth, itching to get back in business, suggested they make picture frames, convinced that she could get a local photo studio to place a large order. She was right. Mattel soon outgrew the garage.Mattel had its first hit toy in 1947 with the Uke-A-Doodle, a miniature ukulele, and the Handlers bought out Matson. They had their next hit in 1950 with a hand-cranked low-cost music box inserted into several toys, including the jack-in-the-box.By 1951, Mattel had 600 employees. Ruth, as executive vice president, handled marketing and operations.  ""(Ruth) was very hands-on. She was on the floor doing quality control. She and Elliot had an open hiring policy. She hired for talent,"" Robin Gerber, author of ""Barbie and Ruth,"" told IBD. Their factories employed far more women and people of color than the norms of the day, and in 1951 Mattel earned the Urban League Award for nondiscriminatory hiring practices.In 1955, ABC announced the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" series. Ruth knew instinctively that kids watching other kids play with Mattel toys would be a game-changer. She bet the farm, paying $500,000 for a sponsorship, nearly all of Mattel's net worth. The gamble paid off, and sales of the featured Burp Gun broke records. Mattel's investment in television ads changed the key toy consumer from parent to child and created a year-round demand for toys, a business which had always been seasonal.On a trip to Switzerland in 1956, Ruth spotted the popular ""Lilli"" doll, based on a racy cartoon character in a German newspaper, which had adult features and fashionable outfits, and was marketed to adults as a gag gift. Since the early 1950s, when she observed young Barbara rejecting the child paper dolls in favor of adult ones, Handler had been trying to convince her team that a doll with adult features would be a hit. They nixed it, saying it would be too expensive to manufacture. But in her autobiography ""Dream Doll,"" Ruth wrote that the reluctance ""stemmed mostly from the fact that the doll would have breasts.""Seeing Lilli changed the team's tune. Handler hired marketing psychologist Ernst Dichter to explore whether Barbie's breasts would turn off parents. His advice, after conducting interviews with girls and their mothers? Make them bigger.Barbie debuted in 1959. Handler marketed Barbie as a ""teenage fashion model"" and created a commercial displaying her many different looks. Sales started slow, but once school got out, Barbie flew off the shelves. It took Mattel three years to catch up with consumer demand.In 1960, Mattel went public. In the following years it introduced other iconic toys including Chatty Cathy and Hot Wheels cars. By 1966, Mattel had reached $100 million in sales and was listed on the Fortune 500.By the late 1960s, Mattel's annual sales were over $200 million and its stock offered a 16% return. Mattel implemented a growth strategy of acquiring other companies aimed at youngsters and made a splash by purchasing Ringling Brothers Circus. But sales sagged in the economic recession — compounded by a fire in a Mexican factory that destroyed inventory and a dock workers' strike that halted deliveries. Handler had other battles to fight, though, as she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1970.Upon returning to work after her mastectomy, she discovered that Mattel was implementing ""bill-and-hold,"" a practice of recording sales to be shipped later, in order to maintain its stock price. Bill-and-hold was legal. However, the extent to which Mattel used it meant that it submitted false and misleading information in its financial reports. Handler claimed that she didn't know the full extent of the practice, but many were skeptical that her eye for detail could miss the discrepancies.In 1972, shareholders sued Mattel. In 1974, the SEC began investigating, and she and Elliot left the company. What had led to her recklessness? In an interview with Robin Gerber, Elliot said that with her preternatural drive, Ruth ""couldn't turn it off.""Fortunately for many breast cancer survivors, she didn't turn it off. Unhappy with her awkward prosthetic breast, a friend suggested that she visit sculptor Peyton Massey. With her input, he designed one superior to those she'd worn before. They created Nearly Me, a reasonably-priced, natural-feeling line of prosthetics fitted to women's bra sizes. Nearly Me launched in 1976 in high-end department stores. Letters of gratitude poured in, including one from Betty Ford.But on Feb. 17, 1978, Handler was indicted on 10 counts of mail fraud and making false statements to the SEC and federally insured banks. Convicted, Judge Robert Takasugi fined her $57,000 and gave her a sentence of 500 hours of community service for five years. Handler's probation officer assigned her to help create Foundation for People, which helped young disadvantaged young men with job training.Nearly Me continued its success in the 1980s. In 1989, she and Elliot were inducted into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. The same year, her poor health convinced her to sell Nearly Me to Spenco Medical.Handler faced her greatest loss, however, in 1994, when her son Kenneth died of AIDS. But Barbie would help bring her out of her grief and return her to the spotlight. When Kenneth told Elliot and Ruth of his disease two years earlier, the Handlers sprang into action. helping with research and care, but his decline was rapid.A surprise visit from her past creation — Barbie — brought Handler unexpected attention and satisfaction in the midst of her mourning. Mattel Executive Jill Barad had created the ""We Girls Can Do Anything"" campaign that capitalized on Barbie's professional achievements. ""Barbie was able to step into the shoes of so many women's careers before they could. There was astronaut Barbie long before there was a real (female astronaut). That's something Ruth should be proud of,"" Tanya Lee Stone, author of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Barbie"" told IBD. In 1994, Barad asked Handler to travel with her, publicizing Barbie's role as a working woman.After years of failing health, Ruth died on April 27, 2002. She spent her final years advocating for breast cancer survivors and examining the ups and downs of her extraordinary career. In the closing lines of ""Dream Doll"" she wrote, ""Even now, at 77, I can say that whatever has driven me for all these years is driving me still, even if at a slower pace. There's still a lot of fight in me, and perhaps the fight's the thing.""Marketing genius and self-confidence propelled Handler to help create Mattel, the Barbie doll and Nearly Me breast prosthetics.Overcame: Lack of college education and few female business role models to start industry-leading Fortune 500 company.Lesson: Find your customers' needs and devise a better way to meet them.Quote: ""I've come full cycle from the first doll with a real breast to answering a real woman's need for a breast.""RELATED:Barbie Vs.

Hulu's live service might pose more of a threat to Comcast's  cable TV business than Netflix's on-demand service, some analysts say.Netflix is more akin to HBO, which also is available on Comcast's X1 set-top boxes.Comcast CEO Brian Roberts showcased how Netflix programming will be presented on Comcast's X1 cable platform at a Goldman Sachs conference on Tuesday.Roberts also signaled that Comcast might offer other streaming video services, aside from Netflix. ""Our organization has made a conscious decision that we are going to aggregate other people's content, some of which we sell directly, some of which we don't,"" Roberts said.""Netflix, as we know, is wildly successful, and it has pretty much got content that you don't get with your (Comcast) X1 existing subscription,"" added Roberts.Shares of Comcast ticked up 0.6% to 66.23, while Netflix added 0.2% to 98.25 at the close on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock is down about 13% in 2016 and has been trading in a tight range in lower volume amid higher investments. With a market cap over $42 billion, it's a big fish. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Roku, Verizon Communications (VZ) and Dish Network (DISH) provide access to apps from Netflix and Hulu.On Comcast's Xfinity platform, existing Netflix customers will be able to log-in and watch shows as normal. Comcast customers will be able to search for Netflix programming before deciding whether to subscribe.Analysts say one benefit for Netflix will be reaching an older demographic, as opposed to millennials that view most content on mobile devices. Comcast gains by making Netflix available to its customers as federal regulators seek to open up the set-top box market.Comcast did not disclose pricing for Netflix's service.It will vary depending on how many devices can view shows at the same time.At Apple's (AAPL) iTunes store, Netflix offers the same monthly rates for people who buy through iOS as it does for web sign-ups. Netflix shares subscription revenue with Apple. Terms of the Comcast-Netflix deal have not been disclosed.Comcast did not respond to a request for information in time before publication.Meanwhile, expectations have been building for Hulu's new live TV service.""We think the run-up to Hulu's early 2017 live streaming launch could be a watershed event for media (stocks),"" said Steven Cahall, an RBC Capital analyst, in an August report.RELATED:Apple's New Hire Signals Tech Giant Serious About Streaming TV ServiceNetflix Playing Long Game With Liberty Global, Cable Deals

387,UPS,"Shares of JetBlue (JBLU) soared on Tuesday after the carrier said traffic growth outpaced capacity in August and forecast quarter-to-quarter improvement in unit revenue, a key measure of an airline's efficiency.The company said that it expected third-quarter unit revenue, a measure of revenue as it relates to an airline's available seats and flight coverage, to fall between 3%-4%, an improvement from the 8.2% drop JetBlue reported for the second quarter.One analyst said that forecast suggests an improved end to the quarter for the carrier.""The guidance implies September unit revenue will be down 1%-4%, better than initial (forecasts) of September being the worst month of the quarter,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""JetBlue's guidance update is consistent with what we heard from other airlines, with the first half of August being worse than expected, but improving throughout the month and continuing into September.""Traffic rose 6.2% during the month, outpacing capacity growth of 5.7%. Load factor, a measure of an airline's ability to put passengers in seats, rose 0.4 point to 87.4%.JetBlue's traffic and capacity figures for August reverse the trend seen from bigger network carriers American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), which both said passenger traffic had grown less than capacity, or an airline's supply of seats and flights.Wall Street has wanted airlines to curb that supply and raise fares amid concerns that carriers' expansion was unsustainable. Delta has been saying that the days of low oil prices, which cushioned airlines' profits and allowed them expand and absorb costs, are over.JetBlue ascended by 2.4% to close at 17.19 on the stock market today, popping above its 50-day line. American lost 2.5% to 37.37, testing its 200-day line, while United dropped 3% to 51.64. Delta Air Lines (DAL), whose forecast greater operational discipline on a potential rise in fuel prices helped lift airline stocks last week, was down 2.4% to 37.53, undercutting its 50-day line. Southwest (LUV), which has also forecast reined-in capacity growth next year, fell 1.8% to 37.14.IBD's TAKE: Airlines don't exactly rank highly among their peers from other sectors, with IBD's Transportation-Airline group coming in at 108 out of 197 tracked industries. But Hawaiian Holdings has mostly been a standout, hovering within buy range in recent days.  JetBlue's results come after a summer marked by Brexit, terrorism concerns and choppy unit revenue and capacity trends, massive rounds of flight cancellations and executive shake-ups. Meanwhile, Labor Day travel is expected to have increased.RELATED:JetBlue Eyes Flights To Europe As Premium Service ExpandsDelta, American, United Sink On European Travel FearsHere's How Much 'Brexit' Will Hurt American, Delta And United Air

388,UPS,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) beat on both the top and bottom lines in its second quarter and raised full-year profit guidance -- so why are shares down Friday?The beauty retailer has consistently delivered strong numbers. In Q2, same-store sales growth accelerated to 14.4% from 13.9% in Q1, and up from 12.5% in Q4, 12.8% in Q3, and 10.1% a year earlier. Meanwhile, Gap (GPS) and department stores like Nordstrom (JWN) have posted negative comparable sales (-2% and -1.2%, respectively, in their most recent reports).The one blemish on Ulta's Q2 was the company's earnings guidance for Q3 -- a range of $1.25-$1.30 vs. consensus for $1.29 -- which might have dampened some enthusiasm.Still, Ulta's recent track record of outperforming retail peers has started to stir some disdain, at least online. But Zacks Research Equity Strategist Tracey Ryniec tweeted that some investor-commenters on StockTwits were ""getting more hostile"" amid Ulta's success ""because they don't 'get' the biz.""When asked whether it's male investors who aren't getting it, she replied:@IBD_elow Yes. They don't understand how it can be doing that well. But don't want to learn about it either.— Tracey Ryniec (@TraceyRyniec) August 25, 2016One male commenter acknowledged not getting Ulta's business, as he regretting missing out on its stock run.$ULTA Wish I'd invested in it ages ago. I look at it as a male and I think, ""how can so much money be spent on all this nonsense?"" #stocks— Hugh J. Robbins (@HughJRobbins) August 26, 2016Ulta shares were down 6.1% to 254.85 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day average for the first time since March. The stock is still up around 38% so far this calendar year.IBD'S TAKE: Got in on Ulta before this year's run but not sure if you should sell? IBD University has a few tips on when to take profits.The reaction from Wall Street analysts has been more positive. Nomura upped its Ulta price target to 287 from 244, and Cowen raised its target to 286 from 265 late Thursday following earnings, days after Piper Jaffray bumped up its target to 290 from 250.Lofty expectations appear to have gotten the better of Ulta on Friday, particularly as its previous three quarterly reports have prompted big gap-ups. And analysts note that high valuation is prompting some investor pushback.""We believe Street's high expectations were likely already priced into the shares ahead of the solid print, and we would be buyers on weakness,"" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen, who has an outperform rating on the stock.Meanwhile, other Ulta metrics continue to shine. Its loyalty program grew about 28% to 20.6 million active members during the quarter, well ahead of other strong loyalty players such as Starbucks (SBUX), which has 12.3 million active U.S. and Canadian members at last count.RELATED:Ulta Beauty EPS Guidance Is Blemish On Priced-For-Perfection Stock

389,UPS,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reported second-quarter earnings late Thursday. A standout in an often volatile retail environment, the specialty beauty retailer beat on both the top and bottom lines, but Q3 profit guidance came in a little light, and shares are sliding in after-hours trade.Estimates: Profit was expected to rise 21% to $1.39 per share, on 21% revenue growth to $1.06 billion.Results: Q2 EPS rose 24% to $1.43. Sales rose 21.9% to $1.069 billion. Same-store sales rose 14.4% on top of Q2 2015's's 10.1% comps. E-commerce sales rose 54.9%.Prior Quarter: Q1 EPS grew 39%, the biggest increase in 14 quarters. Sales rose 24%, the best gain in 11 quarters. Same-store sales increased 15.2%. Loyalty program membership rose 25% to 19.4 million.Guidance: Ulta sees current third-quarter EPS of $1.25-$1.30, the midpoint of which is shy of consensus for $1.29. The midpoint of its Q3 revenue outlook for $1.072 billion $1.09 billion beats estimates for $1.075 billion. The company raised full-year EPS to low- to mid- 20% range vs. prior target of low 20% range, and now sees 11%-13% in comps vs. prior guidance for 10%-12%.Stock: Ulta Beauty shares fell 1.8% to 266.50 in after-hours trading. Shares closed down 0.9% to 271.45 on the stock market today.The stock hit a record intraday high on Wednesday. Ulta has been in a strong rally since early May.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty shares are extended above buy range. But several quality stocks are near buy points, including two retailers. To find that list, as well as stocks actually breaking out, take a trial of IBD's Marketsmith.What It Means: Ulta's light Q3 profit outlook is one of the few blemishes on an otherwise regular-looking — for Ulta, anyway — Q2 report, but it's possible investors believe the stock was already priced for perfection going into earnings results.On the earnings call, management said Ulta's loyalty program membership had crossed the 20-million mark, growing 27% year over year to 20.6 million members. (By contrast, Starbucks (SBUX) -- whose rewards program is generally well-regarded -- only has 12.3 million active members in the U.S. and Canada.)The company said it sees strength across all ages and demographics, but is excited about its growing millennial and teen customer base. Ulta also recently rolled out a private-label credit card as it hopes to convert some of its membership base to Ulta card users.What's Next? In the regular trading sessions following the prior three quarters' after-the-close results, Ulta shares have gapped up in big volume.RELATED:What To Expect From Ulta Beauty Earnings On ThursdayUlta Beauty Shines Amazon Armor As It Crushes Views, Ups Outlook

Here are tips on how to identify a cup-with-handle chart pattern.UPS said domestic revenue rose 2.4%, with average daily package volume up 2.5%.

391,UPS,"ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund (SBLGX) makes a habit of staying on top. The now-$3.5 billion portfolio's 15.72% average annual return over the five years ended July 29 ranked No. 5 among all large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.It was also in the top 3% and top 5% among its direct rivals over the past 12 months and three years.How does the fund do it? Co-manager Peter Bourbeau, who has been at the helm since July 15, 2009, says he and Margaret Vitrano -- co-manager since Oct. 11, 2012 -- stick to a few techniques, including investing in just their best ideas and investing in not one but several types of growth stocks.The results speak loud and clear. Their fund was in the top 33% of all U.S. diversified stock mutual funds last month. And their track record has made them an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner. The fund outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Forty-eight-year-old Bourbeau, who is based in Manhattan, spoke with IBD about his investment approach, while he was on the road in Nashville, Tenn.IBD: Peter, you hold three types of growth stocks: cyclical, stable and what you call select. Why not just focus on one?Bourbeau: We believe different types of growth companies will perform better at various stages of a market cycle. We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

392,UPS,"Vanguard on Thursday announced it's closing the $30.6 billion Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX) to new investors. It wasn't because this popular mutual fund has suddenly been failing to attract assets. In fact, it was quite the opposite.The world's largest investment manager is no longer accepting new accounts in the actively managed fund to control asset growth. Existing shareholders may continue to invest without limits.""Vanguard is proactively taking steps to slow strong cash flows to help ensure that the advisor's ability to produce competitive long-term results for investors is not compromised,"" Vanguard CEO Bill McNabb said in a statement.The statement added: ""The fund's performance record vs. a relevant dividend benchmark and peer funds has resulted in strong cash flows and asset growth. Over the past six months, the fund has received an additional $3 billion in net cash inflows and, over the past three years, the fund's assets have nearly doubled.""Dividend growth strategies have found favor with investors looking for successful investing ideas in a volatile year. These funds tend to focus on larger, profitable U.S. companies -- the sort that have the cash balances to increase payouts to shareholders over time, and a competitive edge to weather stock market squalls. Think Microsoft (MSFT), United Parcel Service (UPS) and Costco (COST) -- the top three holdings in Vanguard Dividend Growth's 45-stock portfolio.Don't let the news that Vanguard is shutting the door to new investors in this fund dismay you. Vanguard Equity Income Fund (VEIPX) taps a similar large-cap, dividend-focused vein that prioritizes healthy balance sheets. The ETF world too offers several alternatives to Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund. As passive, index-tracking funds, they cost less to boot in terms of the expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is trading near all-time highs, but rising long-term interest rates are a risk factor. The outlook for rates is murky, and the Federal Reserve may have boxed itself in on monetary policy.Two of those options come from Vanguard itself, and at a fraction of the price of their actively managed sibling.Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index, composed of 185 stocks that have raised their dividend for at least 10 consecutive years. It yields 2.16% vs. a slightly more modest 1.86% for Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund.The ETF's ""quality tilt has helped it shine during market downturns,"" Morningstar analyst Katie Rushkewicz Reichart wrote in May. Its top holdings are quite different from Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund, but the funds have similar big stakes in the industrials, health care and consumer staples sectors.VIG has a 0.09% expense ratio and Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund 0.33%. The latter has outperformed the index tracked by the former over the past one, three, five and 10 years ended June 30, according to Vanguard, albeit modestly.Vanguard's High Dividend Yield (VYM) is another low-cost and, notwithstanding its name, high-quality ETF option. VYM has a slightly higher yield than either of the above-mentioned siblings. It too has a 0.09% expense ratio, but it does not have a 10-year history.Other ETFs to consider, costing less than Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund, include Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity (SCHD) and WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW).Keep in mind that Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund's portfolio manager will eliminate stocks that are likely to cut their dividends. It's an actively managed fund, after all. Few ETFs offer a forward-looking approach to dividend growth. WisdomTree's product is one that does.

393,UPS,"Every year, more than half a million patients in the U.S. are unknowingly put at risk of contracting a superbug infection during a common medical procedure. A doctor threads a tube-like scope down your throat and into your digestive system to treat cancer and other problems. You assume the tube is clean. Think again.The scope's defective design allows bacteria to lurk within, even after rigorous cleaning between patients. The federal Food and Drug Administration has known about this problem since 2012, yet dawdled. Three months ago, the manufacturer of most of the scopes, Olympus, began recalling them.But numerous hospitals are still using them, and patients are still getting infected and dying -- eight more infections and two more deaths according to last month's FDA data.Patients have contracted infections linked to the contaminated scopes (duodenoscopes) at prestigious institutions such as UCLA Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian, Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, Massachusetts General in Boston and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.Hospitals don't warn their patients about the risk, which makes a mockery of the idea that patients are giving ""informed consent"" before the procedure, says medical safety expert Lawrence Muscarella.Worse, the FDA and another federal agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, go along with the hush-up about which hospitals are having a problem. These agencies are supposed to work for us -- the public -- but clearly they're siding with the hospital industry instead. The FDA refuses to reveal where the two most recent deaths occurred.It's been a four-year saga of incompetence, cover-ups and dying patients. And it's still going on, even after a U.S. Senate report in January 2016 exposed the agencies' blunders and called for reforms. The agencies ""have known about this for so long and people are still dying,"" laments Glenn Smith, whose teenage son nearly died from a superbug infection after being treated with the device.In the winter of 2012-2013, 38 patients at a suburban Chicago hospital contracted the deadliest superbug, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, after being scoped. The CDC issued a perfunctory report in January 2013, but omitted the model number and manufacturer of the faulty scope, referred to ""hospital A"" instead of naming Advocate Lutheran General Hospital. Forget alerting the public, or doctors who want to protect their patients from a similar fate.At the same time, at least 39 patients contracted the same type of lethal superbug at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, and 18 died, all after being treated with the dirty scope. After initially losing the paperwork regarding these early incidents, the FDA began investigating in September 2013, but took no steps to alert hospitals, doctors or the public about the risk for another 17 months.That's why two patients died needlessly at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center after being treated with bacteria-laden scopes. UCLA didn't even begin using these scopes until June 2014. Had doctors there been alerted, it's likely these patients would have been spared.That's how deadly government dysfunction and secrecy can be.But, as the Senate report makes clear, the hospital industry is to blame as well. Not a single hospital where the device-related infections occurred reported the problem quickly to the manufacturer or the FDA, as required. The Senate investigation found that NewYork-Presbyterian waited seven months. The Senate's report rightly calls for hospitals that hide or delay reporting deaths caused by defective medical devices to be barred from Medicare.The biggest problem is the unholy alliance between the hospital industry and complacent federal bureaucrats. They all want to keep problems quiet. Publicizing infections is bad for hospital revenues and erodes the public's misplaced confidence that the federal government is performing its oversight function. Doctors were kept out of the loop about the dangers of these scopes. But the real victims in this conspiracy of silence are trusting patients.

394,UPS,"While income taxes are in the spotlight this time of year, property taxes continue to count the most on the state and local level. And America's real estate rebound of the past few years means that state and local governments are reaping more from them. The third quarter of 2015 saw the largest year-over-year boost in property tax funds -- 3.9%, or $19 billion -- since 2010, says the National Association of Home Builders.But collections from other sources, such as income and sales taxes, have been growing at a slightly faster clip than property taxes.Still, the most recent numbers available, Q4 2015's, showed that property taxes made up the largest slice of the pie. That's normally the case and is likely to continue. As the NAHB points out, there's less volatility in property collections because they're less prone to the ups and downs of the business cycle than corporate, sales and individual income taxes.Why Property Taxes VaryWhile it's no secret that property taxes can vary from state to state, in its study this month on ""Property Tax Rates in and Within Counties,"" HousingEconomics.com looked at why ""effective real estate tax rates vary widely"" in areas right next to each other. While counties in the Northeast and along the California and South Florida coasts might have reputations for having high property taxes, based on an average rate per homeowner, the report sees that as simply stemming from the high home values there.The report by the NAHB-affilliated website argues that looking at the rates that homeowners pay per $1,000 of a home's value is ""more meaningful."" When viewing them that way, it says, some counties in the Northeast still rank among those with the highest taxes, but coastal California and South Florida are replaced by most of Texas and large swathes of the Midwest.Using this formula, big differences emerge between counties in a state, and even between counties' Census tracts -- which HousingEconomics.com notes, number no more than 8,000 people who usually share ""population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions."" In Arizona's Pima and Pinal counties, for instance, the website points out that some tracts are only taxed at $1 per $1,000 of home value while others pay $14.Among the prime factors it cites as contributing to dramatic differences between Census tracts:Related:State-Local Tax Burdens — How Does Yours Compare?Dos And Don’ts For Deducting Sales Tax On Your Federal ReturnDeducting Medical Expenses From Taxes: Seniors’ 7.5% Solution

395,UPS,"And the mkts have come roaring back…even the trains, planes and automobiles are joining in on the fun as the Dow Transports (Trannies) are now back in 'official' Bull mkt mode having rallied 22% off of the January lows…..Now Dow Theory tells us that the mkt is in an uptrend when ONE of its averages (the industrials or the trannies) advances above a previous important high….it should then be followed by the other Dow index…Now while the Trannies have not pierced their November highs of 8286 - they have rocketed higher over the past 8 weeks – (as noted up 22%), they have pierced the down trending 200 dma at 7856 and look like they are 'breaking out'..... and appear to be on their way to challenge the November high -Now this is important really – because the Trannies represent the transportation sector of the US economy and its companies are tied to the shipping, rail, and trucking sectors – sectors that 'move stuff around' and send signals about the health of the economy…..now recall – this index got 'clocked' in the early part of the year……after concerns about global growth and a coming US recession caused investors to shift out of this important 'barometer group' - Because slowing global growth and a US recession would negatively impact these companies. And there were some real serious concerns – as investors took some 22% out of the index since late November - but remember simple math works in strange ways....if the index (or a stock or any asset) goes down in value by 22% and then rallies back by 22% - you are still short - you have NOT gone back to 0 - in fact the index needs to rally back 30% just to stay even. So it still has work to do.......The latest move now tells us that investors have changed their minds…..Global Growth Concerns? US Recession? – Bah Humbug……Apparently investors are convinced that the worst is over and they have gone out on a buying spree – scooping up some names for a fraction of their current value. Now the Trannies are trading at about 13 times trailing earnings – or a 32% discount to their 3 yr avg of 19.2 times. So there IS value there IF the supposed improving global macro data is true. A look at some of the participants reveals where investors are placing their bets....UPS (UPS) & FedEx (FDX) - have rocketed higher, piercing their 200 dma's....while , Kansas City Southern (KSU), CSX Corp. (CSX), Kirby Corp. (KEX) are all teasing these key trend lines....Now overnight - global mkts began the week a bit mixed.....There is not a lot of macro data due out this week - so we can expect the mkts to churn and digest the latest moves in this holiday shortened week.......Japan was closed for a holiday and China surged by 2% as investors there focused on loosening margin lending requirements.....Australia came under a bit of pressure as losses in commodities weighed on that mkt.In Europe - those mkts are flat to slightly higher after a weaker opening....There was no material news out to drive the mkts either way - so they churn. FTSE -0.09%, CAC 40 -0.2%, DAX +0.4% , EUROSTOXX +0.12%, SPAIN +0.19% and ITALY +0.83%.Oil once again under pressure as the dollar stabilizes and moves a bit higher....remember - much of the oil action has been dollar driven and more unprecedented global monetary easing has created a currency war but has helped to wipe out the losses suffered since January. Now while it makes everyone feel good - the weak dynamics of the global economy still exist....and with earnings season only 2 weeks away - it will be about the fundamentals once again.....And while the central banks have all created the fire - the latest move is sure to come under some pressure if the fundamentals disappoint..... If the fundamentals do not disappoint - then the conversation returns to FED policy and interest rates. I continue to believe that June will see a small hike of 25 bps - but then nothing more.US futures are flat, the dollar is flat and oil is now down 1% as the day begins.....We only have one data point and this is Existing Home Sales - expectations are for a drop of 2.9% m/m. Atlanta FED's Dennis Lockhart is due to speak today at 12:30 pm - I would not expect him to say anything so significant - as he tends to be Dove and is on the side of the latest FED move. - So if anything - look for him to remain cautious on the outlook.....Now the S&P at 2048 is well above the 200 dma which stands at 2017. In this holiday shortened week - with little eco data to digest - it would not be surprising to see the S&P test what is now support for the mkts. After the most recent rally - the mkt is a bit ahead of itself and some back testing is in order.Take Good Care

397,UPS,"Stocks reversed higher in early afternoon Thursday trade, sticking to its bullish script of the past several weeks since the Feb. 17 follow-through. However, Amazon.com weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite.The S&P 500 rose nearly 0.6%. It was down mildly in the early going. The Dow Jones industrials gained nearly 0.8%. The Nasdaq, however, lagged with a 0.2% gain amid a more than 2.5% slide by Amazon (AMZN). The e-commerce behemoth is now facing its third test of the key 200-day moving average in nearly four weeks.Without question, Amazon's stock is still cooling off after a red-hot 2015, which saw shares climb 104% after a Jan. 30, 2015, breakout past a 341.36 entry point. The stock is now forming a new base but lies nearly 19% below its all-time peak of 696.44.Also without question, sector indexes continue to steal thunder from the major averages. The Dow utilities were up 1.1%, but the Dow transports soared as much as 3% on the back of positive fiscal Q3 results from FedEx (FDX). The large cap soared nearly 11% in volume running five times normal pace.The letter and package delivery giant smashed Wall Street's expectations with a 24% jump in profit on an 8% lift in sales, the biggest year-over-year revenue increase in 16 quarters. FedEx also posted a third quarter in a row of accelerating bottom-line growth.The stock bolted back above its 200-day moving average, a bullish sign. But it needs more work on the right side of an emerging base before a proper entry point arrives.FedEx gets a mediocre 67 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Keep an eye on that number; further stock gains should boost that rating. The company is a major shipping partner with Amazon. However, the latter is seeking new ways to deliver items quickly and at lower cost. It's committed to doing some of its own air delivery with the lease of jets and has experimented with drone-based delivery.FedEx rival UPS (UPS) (81 Composite) shows a stock that's in technically better shape. Shares jumped more than 2% in heavy trade and are approaching prior resistance near 105. The stock is just 2% below a 52-week high of 107.32, and the relative strength line has been rising since January, an indicator that it's outperforming the S&P 500.

398,UPS,"FedEx (FDX) posted strong quarterly earnings and revenue growth Wednesday and offered bullish guidance as e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) have continued to gain customers.The shipping company's fiscal third-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items climbed 25% to $2.51 on an 8.5% increase in revenue to $12.7 billion. Wall Street expected EPS of $2.34 on $12.38 billion in revenue.FedEx raised the low end of its full-year EPS guidance and now sees $10.70-$10.90 vs. $10.40-$10.90 previously, saying, ""Positive financial momentum should continue into our upcoming fiscal 2017,"" which begins in July. Analysts expect EPS of $10.56.FedEx also lifted its capital spending forecast for the fiscal year to $4.8 billion from $4.6 billion.Shares of FedEx were up nearly 5% in extended trading in the stock market today, after closing up 0.8% at 144.27. Rival UPS (UPS), the No. 1 U.S. shipper, climbed 1.8% late. Amazon, which saw Prime membership jump 51% last year, dipped 0.7% late.Last month, UPS reported that its EPS had climbed 26% to $1.57, topping estimates by 15 cents a share. Revenue edged up just 1% to $16.05 billion, missing Wall Street's $16.28 billion target.Meanwhile, Amazon last week announced that it had signed a five-to-seven-year lease for 20 Boeing (BA) 767 jetliners from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) to ship packages, and that it had bought a roughly 20% stake, valued at around $125 million, in the company.Amazon denied that it would compete with UPS and FedEx, saying that the move would enable faster shipping to its customers.

399,UPS,"A week of missteps has taken its toll on Donald Trump's support among Republicans and the general public, the latest IBD/TIPP Poll shows. Trump’s lead against his GOP rivals narrowed considerably, and he fares worse against Hillary Clinton than he did in national surveys taken before last week.Among registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, Trump’s lead over Ted Cruz shrank from 11 points in late February to 7 points today, as the GOP field narrowed and the bulk of that support went to either Cruz or John Kasich -- who gained 11 and 12 points, respectively, to Trump’s 7-point bump.Currently Trump leads with 38%, followed by Cruz at 31% and Kasich at 19%.More telling, however, is what happens when Republicans’ first- and second-choice candidates are combined. Cruz now handily beats Trump 63% to 49% -- a huge turnaround from the prior IBD/TIPP Poll, when Trump beat Cruz 42% to 39%.On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders pulled to within one point of Clinton, who now leads Sanders 45% to 44%.The IBD/TIPP Poll -- conducted from March 28 through April 2 -- is currently the only national poll that taken while Trump was badly stumbling on issues ranging from abortion, his campaign manager’s assault charge, his claims that he would use nuclear weapons in Europe, and his decision to abandon his pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee. Various surveys also show Trump badly trailing Cruz in Wisconsin, which holds its primary on Tuesday.At 38%, Trump’s support among Republicans is below all seven other national polls taken prior to last week. And in a match-up with Hillary Clinton, Trump trails Clinton by 12 points, which is a bigger gap than Real Clear Politics average.Trump also fares worse against Clinton than do either Cruz (who comes within 5 points of Clinton) or Kasich (who beats Clinton 45%-38%). He also does worse than his Republican rivals in match-ups with Sanders, the self-described socialist Democrat.Interestingly, Sanders does better than Clinton in match-ups with each GOP candidate, beating Trump by 17 points, Cruz by 12 and Kasich by 3.The IBD/TIPP Poll also reveals other trouble signs for the current leader in delegates for the GOP nomination.While 84% of Democrats say they would vote for Clinton vs. Trump, just 69% of GOP voters say they’d vote for Trump, suggesting a wide gulf in party enthusiasm for each candidate. Both Cruz and Kasich do far better among Republicans, while draining some Democratic support for Clinton.Regionally, Trump does well against Clinton only in the South -- where they are tied at 42% -- and in rural areas where he beats Clinton 52%-31%.Trump’s biggest problem, however, is with women, a mere 29% of whom say they’d vote for Trump against Clinton. Both Cruz and Kasich do better among women. Kasich, in fact, nearly ties Clinton, 41% to 44%, among women.Other IBD/TIPP Poll findings:Methodology:The IBD/TIPP Poll included 902 adults and has a margin of error of +/-3.3 percentage points. The sample size for registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents was 388 and has a margin of error of +/- 5.1 percentage points. The sample size of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents was 383, with a margin of error of +/- 5.1 percentage points.For a more thorough explanation of how the poll was conducted, its track record in past presidential elections, and the complete April poll results, click here.

Shares have dipped below that level several times over the past month, but were able to quickly regain their composure.CyberArk erased early losses Monday to close 1.4% higher at 52.58.Apple also undercut its 50-day line with a 2.3% retreat Friday, as investors failed to be impressed by the consumer tech behemoth's fall product Apple launch event. The 50-day line just crossed above the 200-day line, which is bullish, but the stock is fading away from a potential buy point at 110.33.Apple rose 2.2% to 105.44, retaking its 50-day line.Netflix, which is 28% below its 52-week high, has been hitting resistance near the 200-day line for the past few sessions and gapped well below it Friday. Netflix also hit resistance there as it attempted to retake the line in May and July. Even if the stock was able to climb back above this key support level, the chart has suffered technical damage, with the 50-day line below the 200-day since February amid some rocky earnings reports.Netflix rose 2.6% to 99.05, finding support at the 50-day line and close to its 200-day as it remains in a narrow channel.

Rival Under Armour (UA) lost 1.4% to 39.35.IBD's TAKE: Nike is part of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing industry group, which currently ranks a lowly 188 out of 197 tracked sectors. To figure out when a buying opportunity may present itself, IBD University has tips on ""How To Find And Evaluate Stocks.""Nike can perhaps thank the fashion-conscious for the competition.

403,UPS,"Maybe Hillary Clinton isn't going to be elected president after all. That's a thought that's evoking glee in some, nausea in others, terror in some and relief at the removal of an increasingly tedious figure from public view in still more.The thought is prompted by the CNN/ORC poll showing Clinton trailing Donald Trump in four-candidate pairings by a 45% to 43% margin. Clinton's lead in the RealClearPolitics.com average of recent polls is down from 7.6% on Aug. 9 to 2.8% today. The FiveThirtyEight website has Trump's chances of winning up to 30%.The CNN/ORC poll has been criticized for having more self-identified Republicans than Democrats. Since random sample polling was invented in 1935, there hasn't been a presidential election in which self-identified Republicans outnumbered self-identified Democrats. The closest was in 2004, when the exit poll showed both parties with 37%.But there may be something to learn from CNN/ORC's decision to whittle their sample down to likely voters. The Clinton campaign's goal has been to replicate Barack Obama's 51% coalition in 2012. Assembling that coalition relied on spurring turnout among black, Hispanic and young voters.There are plenty of signs Clinton is poorly positioned to do that. Black turnout and Democratic percentage is likely to be down, at least slightly, from when the first black president was seeking reelection. Polls have shown Hispanics less interested and motivated by this campaign than just about any other demographic group.Young voters, while repelled by Trump, are not attracted by Clinton. She ran way behind Bernie Sanders among young women as well as young men in primaries and caucuses. Four-candidate polls typically show Clinton running far behind the 60% Obama won among under-30s in 2012, with as many as 20% preferring Libertarian Gary Johnson or Green candidate Jill Stein.So turnout could tilt more Republican this time. And these polls mostly don't measure the impact of the recently released notes from Clinton's FBI interviews that took place over the weekend before July 4. They were released late Friday afternoon before the Labor Day weekend, and only two current national polls included some interviews conducted afterwards.So most respondents had no time to digest the juicy bits, such as the BleachBit destruction of thousands of emails after they were subpoenaed by the House committee on Benghazi. Also revealed was the fact that Clinton used not one email device, as she claimed in March 2015, but at least 13, and that several were lost and two smashed with a hammer. When asked about the ""C"" notations on documents, Clinton said that perhaps they had something to do about alphabetical order, even though there were no documents labeled ""A,"" ""B"" or ""D."" The candidate touted as the most qualified ever professed deep ignorance about government classification practices.According to polls, more than 60% of Americans believe Clinton is not honest or trustworthy. The FBI interview notes provide further convincing evidence that she is a liar and a cheat. The kid gloves treatment she got from the FBI -- no recordings, allowing aide and co-conspirator Cheryl Mills in the interview -- confirm the impression, created by the intended-to-be-secret meeting of Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch days before, that the fix was in. So does the fact that Clinton and her aides in court-ordered interviews claimed loss of memory 378 times.None of this is helpful to Hillary Clinton's candidacy. It helps explain why she has not subjected herself to a standard press conference in 278 days, and why the polls are suddenly tightening.Another reason is that Trump finally found his bearings. When Clinton was fundraising in Hollywood, the Hamptons and Martha's Vineyard, Trump visited flood-stricken Louisiana and met with President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City, where he was treated as and acted like a serious national leader. That night in Phoenix he dialed back on unrealistic immigration promises (of deporting all 11 million illegals) and advanced a surprisingly plausible reform package.In a world where FedEx and UPS can track packages and Visa and MasterCard can process purchases, why should it be impossible for the government to track visa holders and verify job applicants' legal status? And why shouldn't we revise immigration law to encourage high-skill and discourage low-skill immigration? The United States always needs more Einsteins but hasn't needed more low-skill job seekers any time lately.Of course, Trump has proved himself capable of self-harm, and many voters will likely continue to find him unacceptable. But suddenly it's looking like a real contest.

404,UPS,"Scandal: Hillary Clinton says if she wins the presidency, it might be a good idea for former President Clinton to cut his ties to the Clinton Family Foundation. Good idea? A new IBD/TIPP Poll suggests that average Americans are way ahead of her on this issue.""I don't think there are conflicts of interest"" with having former Bill Clinton run a foundation that raises money around the world during her campaign, Hillary Clinton said in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday. Americans, it seem, would disagree.Average people have a far less benign view of what's gone on at the Clinton Foundation. And it looms as a major problem for Clinton as she pursues the presidency.In our latest IBD/TIPP Poll, taken the week of Aug. 26 to Sept. 1, shows that Americans are increasingly wary of the Clinton Foundation's questionable practices, which IBD has written about extensively. The poll of 934 adults has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points.The ups and downs of the Clinton Foundation, it turns out, are of big interest to average Americans. Some 72% in the IBD/TIPP Poll said they are following it.Perhaps more significantly, of the 72% who are following it, three-fourths — or 77% -- believe that donors to the Clinton Foundation received special access and favors from the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.And there is, surprisingly, bipartisan agreement on this: Some 55% of Democrats agree that the Clintons used public office to dispense favors to their foundation's friends.Yet, those investigating both the Clinton email scandal and the related questions about the Clinton Foundation have been met with hostility by Clinton partisans. FBI Director James Comey, who all but indicted Hillary with his words when he announced he would not prosecute her, this week even had to defend his decision to release more documents from his investigation. For the record, his investigation — and subsequent testimony to Congress — found that Hillary lied repeatedly about her home-brew email server and about sending and receiving classified information on it. All of these are crimes.But even bigger questions are now being raised about the cozy ties between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary's State Department. Though she promised an arms-length relationship to the foundation when she was first named secretary of state, at least 181 Clinton Foundation donors — companies, individuals, even countries — lobbied the State Department during her years there.Indeed, more than half the non-government people who met with Hillary — 85 of 154 — while she was in office gave money to the Clinton Foundation. Those donors, together, gave as much as $156 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to an Associated Press analysis.It strongly suggests a quid-pro-quo relationship, given that the State Department can act as a favor-giver and gatekeeper for business deals and other lucrative arrangements around the world. It reeks of a corrupt pay-to-play system based on a major conflict of interest, in which Hillary Clinton was ideally positioned to grant government favors to those who had already enriched her, her husband Bill and her daughter, Chelsea, by giving boatloads of money to the eponymous family foundation.Charles Ortel, a highly regarded Wall Street financial expert, took a look at the Clinton Foundation's books over the last year or so and this week published his partial conclusion: ""To informed analysts, the Clinton Foundation appears to be a rogue charity that has neither been organized nor operated lawfully from inception in October 1997 to date ... it is a case study in international charity fraud, of mammoth proportions.""Based on what appears to be repeated violations of the law and a shocking disregard for the minimal ethics requirements of government officials, it's time for a special prosecutor of Hillary Clinton to look into both the family foundation and the emails.Our polling shows Americans would definitely support such a move, either before or after the election. According to IBD/TIPP, nearly two-thirds (63%) think a special prosecutor should be appointed. And 88% of Republicans and 68% of Independents want a special prosecutor to look into the possible misconduct. The sentiment that something wrong has taken place is overwhelming.To save the nation from another failed presidency, it's time to put this issue to rest by naming a special prosecutor.RELATED:What's The Latest News On The Hillary Clinton Email Scandal?Scandal Without End: Is The Clinton Foundation A Fraud?Clinton Scandal: Bill, Hillary And The $18 Mil They Made From A State Dept.

407,UPS,"A new report from RBC Capital Markets asks the ever more pressing question about Amazon.com (AMZN) and its deliveries ambitions: Does the transportation sector have a problem?The short answer is no -- at least not yet, according to RBC analyst John Barnes.The crux of the issue for the e-commerce leader is that its shipping costs soared 32% to $11.5 billion in 2015, while sales rose about 20%. That, says Barnes, suggests that Amazon might have trouble ahead if it continues on course. As a result, Amazon has been taking more of the shipping task into its own hands.RBC emphasizes, though, that Amazon isn't anywhere near able to separate itself from shipping partners such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). But the company will incrementally begin to do so, the report says, at least in certain areas.In prior years -- though not in 2015 -- both UPS and FedEx have stumbled during the critical holiday season. Packages not being delivered on time, Barnes says, is like Amazon being closed on random days without warning.Amazon's massive distribution network is as complex as it is large. It includes a growing trucking operation and the recently disclosed air transport and ocean shipping components.Ocean shipping is where Barnes suspects the company will attack first. ""We believe Amazon will take over large swaths of its ocean freight supply chain, as the move can lower its own shipping costs, drive third-party sellers to the platform and eventually turn into a profit center,"" Barnes wrote in the report, released late Monday.As IBD has reported, industry experts estimate that the ocean shipping business has the potential to be worth millions in free cash flow for Amazon, mostly from selling capacity to third parties. Analysts says that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos might not go after the free cash flow but instead drive the value back to consumers in some fashion, such as still-lower prices. But the ocean shipping industry is vast, and Barnes estimates that the Seattle-based company would grab only between $200 million and $400 million in business. It could, though, affect shippers such as Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD) as well as UPS and FedEx.The ocean shipping grab isn't without precedent, either. Wal-Mart (WMT) has been taking possession of suppliers' goods in China and doing its own shipping for years.Amazon's growing air network is one area where the company will be content to work with third parties, Barnes said. Amazon's recently announced deal with Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) to lease 20 767 jets highlights this point. As part of the deal, Amazon will be able to purchase about 20% of ATSG's common shares over a five-year period.Meanwhile, Barnes says that UPS and FedEx are both fighting Amazon's long-term onslaught. UPS now provides 30% of Amazon's parcel needs, netting $2.2 billion in revenue, and FedEx hauls in $1.5 billion, or about 20%. Those figures translate to about 8% and 10% of ground revenue, respectively, for the shipping companies.

409,UPS,"And as expected - stocks did very little yesterday...in yesterday's note - I suggested that we would remain in the 2055/2065 range with no reason at all to do much else....in fact yesterday's range was 2057/2063 - and there were no fireworks, no end of month or end of qtr surprises at all as investors were just happy to see the end of the qtr come (and go)! In the end the Dow end the qtr with a 1.5% gain and the S&P had a 0.8% gain.Now you could credit yesterday's lack of activity to both exhaustion and reluctance by anyone to do anything ahead of today's NFP report and the host of other macro data points that will bombard us today......... Remember today is April 1st - otherwise known as April Fool's Day around the world....now while its origin is unknown - it is a day defined by tricks, tomfoolery and hoaxes - all designed to make someone look like an April Fool..... So the question today is:Will today's NFP report just be an April Fool's joke? Mkt expectations are calling for an increase of 205k jobs created in March - now remember last month the call was for +195k and the gov't came out and told us that we really created 242k jobs! (Now THAT is a joke.....).....on Wednesday - the ADP reported a slightly higher number of jobs created + 200k (vs. the expected 195k), and they raised the prior month from 205k to 214k......this now suggests that we will get a stronger NFP report.... and to that I say - ""April Fools!!!""Other eco data due out today includes:

US futures are down 9 pts in early pre-mkt trading.....Now remember - it is a NEW qtr...the slate has been wiped clean and the odometer has been reset to zero.....The dollar continues to come under pressure, oil appears to be de-coupling from the broader mkt - the recent rally in oil driven more by the dollar action vs. any real change in fundamentals.....Gold - which has seen a dramatic 16% gain over the past 3 months is now coming under a bit of pressure as investors decipher the tea leaves over the future of US and global economics. If the data begins strengthen then logic tells us that Gold should weaken (think other more dynamic opportunities) but if the global economies continue to stall or weaken then watch Gold spike higher yet again (think the safe haven play)....Earnings are now clearly in the bulls eye as investors prepare themselves for the onslaught of coming earnings over the next 3 weeks.The WSJ runs with a headline article this morning detailing the state of the IPO (Initial Public Offering) mkt.""Lackluster IPO Market Flashes Warning - Pace for initial public offerings is slowest first qtr since 2009, and analysts warn that second period may not bring much relief""In this article the writer tries to connect the dots between the lack of new product and investor appetite for risk...... I am not sure that is the connection...investor appetite will be fed by interesting and dynamic product as well as realistic valuations for these untested products.....it is the purest form of mkt dynamics that rewards proper risk taking......Investment by PE firms, Venture Capital Firm and large asset management firms have push valuations to extremes and maybe investors are finally waking up the idea that these extreme valuations reward nobody but the investment banks and the insiders looking to unload these 'over valued' shares.Yesterday we learned that many of the big asset managers (Fidelity, Blackrock, TRowe Price etc....) - the same ones that have invested in private start ups (PRE-IPO) have pushed valuations to 'extreme' levels and are now taking - 'hair cuts' ( I think it was described as an AX) to valuation estimates for these privately held (difficult to value) companies. I would argue that it was THESE asset managers themselves that are responsible for the crazy valuations creating ' Unicorns' that they now are the focus of investor angst.[A Unicorn is usually a startup company that does NOT have any established performance metrics but have a supposed stock mkt valuation of more than $1 billion dollars]So now that all of these asset managers are having a 'V-8' moment and becoming more realistic - we are beginning to see a change in psychology.....Should these companies really have such ridiculous valuations? Apparently not! And these very markdowns have sucked the life out of the momentum - making it harder for investment banks to 'sell this story' at the ridiculous valuations that they have tried to convince us all of....So now you get untested, overvalued private companies that think they are going to cash out at 'X' and are now told that ""maybe that is not the case""......they may have to settle for something more realistic like 'Y'....and they don't want that - so they don't come to the mkt....It's like the guy that says my house is worth $1 mil while everything around him is trading at $400k......HELLO??? Does this remind anyone of the late 90's DOT.COM bubble?????Global mkts begin the new qtr all in the RED - (no one should be surprised at all).

If we don't find support on the future right here at 2040 - then a move into the low 2030's would be expected.Global mkts also started the new qtr in the RED - In Asia - all mkts ended the day lower.....In Japan the March Manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.1 while the important Tankan Survey also missed estimates coming in at 4 vs. the exp of 6 - and this only causes more angst over the Japanese economy. Next door in China - we did see China Manf PMI rise (surprise) to a 9 month high of 50.2 vs. the est of 49.4. All of this just noise as all eyes are focused on the US - after all the drama of the past couple of weeks. Japan - 3.5%, Hong Kong -1.34%, China +0.12% and ASX -1.64%.In Europe - PMI""s were than the flash estimates, but the weakness in Japan ended up stealing the show....Volumes remain subdued as European investors count the minutes until the US jobs report.

422,UPS,"Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Marissa Mayer has a bit of extra incentive to sell the ailing Internet company, which is facing a proxy fight.According to CNN Money, Mayer gets $37 million if she's fired after selling the Sunnyvale-based company, under the terms of her employment contract.But she’ll be paid only $12.5 million if she’s let go without a sale. In that case, Mayer would take home $1 million in salary, a $2 million cash bonus and $9.5 million in stock that would vest in 2016, the report says.But being ousted after a sale significantly ups the ante by triggering ""the release of all her stock awards. In virtually any other scenario, Mayer would have needed to stay at Yahoo for a certain period of time in order to cash out those rewards,"" said CNN Money.In either scenario, her golden parachute will be worth significantly less now than it was a year ago, since the price of Yahoo stock has fallen 18% over the past 12 months. On Wednesday, Yahoo stock rose a fraction, to 36.56.A year ago, Mayer would have taken home $110 million had she lost her job because of Yahoo's sale and $26 million if she was let go without a sale, the report said. Mayer, who joined Yahoo in 2012, earned $42 million in cash and stocks in 2014, CNN Money said. Her 2015 compensation is expected to be reported next month.Sale or not, Yahoo is facing rough waters. Last week, in a letter charging the current board of Yahoo with failing to deliver results for its shareholders, activist investor Starboard Value announced that it wants to sweep out all of the ailing Web company's nine directors and replace them with its own slate during Yahoo's 2016 shareholder meeting.The letter -- from Starboard Value managing member Jeffrey Smith, one of Starboard's slate of Yahoo board nominees -- indicates that Starboard also doesn't trust Yahoo's current directors to perform in terms of either the strategic review of Yahoo's core search and display-ad business or with the eventual fate of Yahoo's 15% stake in China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) and its holdings in Yahoo Japan.Yahoo this month appointed two members to its board, Catherine Friedman, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS), and Eric Brandt, a former chief financial officer of Broadcom (AVGO).Yahoo's revenue growth has stalled for nearly a decade as ad dollars continue to slip away to rivals including Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google, and others that include high-profile startups Snapchat and Pinterest.Yahoo has reportedly gotten interest from as many as 40 groups who have until April 11 to submit preliminary bids for its core business and Asian operations.

427,UPS,"Clouds are gathering over the robo-advisor industry. And the forecast should inspire investors who use robo-advisors to keep an umbrella nearby, according to a prominent observer of the robo-advisor space.Robo-advisors are finding it increasingly difficult to grow their rate of asset inflow.IBD'S TAKE: Having their own robo-advisor may be a good strategic move for asset managers, but investors should think twice before buying these stocks now. The Finance/Investment Management Group has lagged the general stock market over the past six months, ranking 119th out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. To find the groups that are leading the market now, bookmark the daily IBD Industry Themes column.And while that does not put investors' account balances in jeopardy, ""it increases the risk that some robo-advisors may have to raise prices in the coming year,"" Michael Kitces, director of wealth management for Pinnacle Advisory Group and a prominent commentator on the retirement-funding industry, told IBD.Still, even after a price hike, robo-advisors' fees may remain well below what full-service brokerages, for example, charge. On an account balance of $125,000 with a 60-40 stock-bond mix, prominent robo services like that of Charles Schwab (SCHW) levy a 0% annual robo fee plus a 0.23% average ETF expense ratio, according to investorjunkie.com. Betterment assesses a 0.15% robo fee plus a 0.15% average ETF fee. Vanguard charges a 0.30% robo fee plus a 0.09% average ETF fee. In contrast, full-service wirehouses tend to sock clients with fees of 1% to 1.5%.Asset-gathering growth rates are falling rapidly for robo-advisors, especially independent ones, Kitces says. Key robos' growth of assets under management (AUM) is just one-third of what it was one year ago, Kitces wrote on his website. Wealthfront is growing AUM at a little more than 2% annually, down from above 6%. Betterment's growth rate north of 6% is down from better than 17%.Dan Egan, Betterment's director of behavioral finance and investing, says asset growth can reflect temporary factors such as overall market run-ups or pullbacks. Robo-advisors in general and Betterment in particular, he says, remain very popular. And Betterment's AUM continues to grow in dollar terms, he adds. ""Betterment is the largest and fastest growing (robo-advisor),"" he said. ""When something gets very large, growth is harder to sustain on a percentage-wise basis.""Robos' slowing pace of AUM growth reflects high client acquisition costs and an inability to achieve economies of scale.The slowdown could force some robos to shut down or, ""more realistically, to be sold,"" Kitces told IBD. If your robo-advisor folds, you would not lose assets -- but you would have to transfer your account holdings to another asset manager, he says.""Fortunately, many of the independent robo-advisors have raised significant capital (from investors in the advisory firm itself) though. So even that prospective 'day of shutdown' (or 'forced sale') could still be a long, long ways off,"" Kitces said.""In terms of costs, though,"" he continued, ""a growth slowdown is not a good thing, especially since many (industry observers) have noted that robo-advisors don't even appear to be profitable (or financially viable) at their current pricing and volume of clients. If they can't dramatically increase the number of clients and scale,"" price hikes by robo-advisors will be more likely in the next 12 months, to avoid running out of operating capital.Egan says Betterment is not considering any such move. His shop's growth, he adds, will enable it to fund continued innovation and new services, such as January's rollout of its 401(k) plan offering.Kitces says it is unclear whether robos' root problem is that competition is crimping their ability to attract net new assets, or that they ""grossly underestimated the challenge of getting clients in a scalable manner.""The net amount of new dollars flowing into robo coffers has stayed even, he says. Robos are not taking in less money.""It's just that taking in the same money as the base gets bigger means the growth rate is falling. Getting $100 million per month when Betterment (had assets under management of) $1 billion was a 10% monthly growth rate,"" he said. ""Getting the same $100 million now when Betterment is $5 billion (in AUM) is only a 2% monthly growth rate.""Worse, Kitces cites research that says robo-advisors need tens of billions of dollars in AUM to be profitable and financially healthy. So to become and remain profitable, their asset-growth rate must rise, not decline, he says.Of 13 active robo-advisors that investorjunkie.com views as big enough to track, the only one with more than $10 billion in assets is Vanguard's, which has $31 billion in AUM. That's just a fraction of Vanguard's overall AUM, which topped $3 trillion as of Dec. 31. The next-largest is Schwab's with $8.2 billion.The slowdown in AUM growth comes as Wells Fargo (WFC), the world's largest bank by market cap, said on Wednesday that it plans to start a robo-advisory service in 2017.And yet another big player in the mutual fund industry, Legg Mason (LM), just entered the robo-advisor field with its acquisition of an 82% stake in Financial Guard, which has $454 million in AUM.Legg Mason had $718 billion in assets under management as of May 31.The move gives Legg Mason a beachhead in the robo-advisor space. Despite robo-advisors' profitability woes, they've attracted investors largely with their offering of low-cost, automated, online investment strategies, which typically make heavy use of ETFs.In contrast to independent robo-advisors, the outlook may be easier for robos that get gobbled up. Financial Guard now gets access to Legg Mason's deep pockets and distribution channels. A Legg Mason news release said, ""The transaction expands Financial Guard's access to financial institutions that serve the needs of investors.""Does the slowdown in growth make robo-advisors less crucial for asset managers to have as an option for their clients? Big mutual fund shops and other asset managers that don't have their own robo-advisor still risk losing out on a meaningful number of clients and their assets. Robo-advisors' cumulative share of assets under management by advisors of all stripes should rise to 5.6% by 2020, up from 0.5% in 2015, research firm A.T. Kearney forecasts.Legg Mason said its Financial Guard deal would help financial advisors who partner with it to grow their practices and meet the new Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary standard, which is due to take effect in April.The DOL rule aims to prevent brokers who provide retirement plan advice from putting their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests. Brokers could meet the new standard by making use of low-cost robo-advisors, at least with some small-account clients. Otherwise, many advisors might avoid taking on small-account clients because it would not be profitable to provide them with service without charging higher fees. But by avoiding smaller accounts, an advisor would risk losing a client whose account could grow over time.Reflecting this concern, Legg Mason noted that there is about $845 billion in small IRA accounts holding less than $25,000 each at U.S. wirehouses, independent broker-dealers and regional brokers that may be impacted by the new DOL rules.""Legg Mason will offer the Financial Guard platform to firms who are looking for technology solutions to assist them in meeting expanded compliance requirements in a holistic, cost efficient way,"" the release said.The DOL deadline has helped drive a wave of acquisitions similar to the Legg Mason move in the past 18 months. BlackRock (BLK) took over FutureAdvisor last summer. Invesco (IVZ) grabbed Jemstep early this year. UBS (UBS) bought a stake in SigFig in May.Other key players in the mutual fund industry have created their own robo-advisory services:Legg Mason announced its move earlier this month.

431,UPS,"The nation's progress in getting more people covered by health insurance slowed significantly this year, the government confirmed Wednesday in a report that tempers the Obama administration's signature achievement.About 1.3 million fewer people were uninsured the first three months of this year, driving the uninsured rate to a new record low of 8.6%, according to the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, that progress is a fraction of the earlier gains seen under President Barack Obama's health care law. When the law's big expansion got underway in 2014, the number of uninsured people went down by nearly 9 million.The uninsured rate has been cut by nearly half under Obama's law, but that hasn't been enough to overcome political divisions. The survey estimated that 27.3 million people remained uninsured in the first three months of this year, about 21 million fewer than in 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.The law offers subsidized private insurance for people everywhere who don't have access to job-based coverage, along with a Medicaid expansion geared to low-income adults in states that opt for it. Although a growing economy should also be contributing to coverage gains, experts say the law deserves most of the credit.The uninsured estimates are based on a first-quarter survey and may not fully reflect the extent to which the ObamaCare exchanges have seen a steep drop off in enrollment as the year progresses. As of early February, 12.7 million people signed up for the exchanges, but there were only 11.1 million paying customers. By the end of June, reports from major public insurers including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and Molina (MOH) suggest enrollment fell to about 10.5 million.Premiums are expected to surge in 2017 as UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana all dramatically scale back their exchange presence. That could keep a lid on enrollment going forward, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies.In another notable finding, the report said the share of working age people and dependents with high-deductible health insurance has increased and now stands at 4 out of 10. Such plans require patients to pay a sizable share of their medical bills before insurance kicks in. The survey defined that as at least $1,300 annually for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for a family.The trend toward high-deductible plans started before Obama took office but advanced during his tenure as employers sought to limit their costs. In 2010, only about 25% of people under age 65 were in such plans. Policy experts credit rising deductibles for helping to restrain overall health care spending, but employees generally see that as a cost shift to them. Polls suggest the trend has undercut support for Obama's health care overhaul.The administration accentuated the survey's positive finding that the uninsured rate hit a new low.""Our country's march toward improving access, quality and affordability in health care goes on, and today's numbers show that the Affordable Care Act is continuing to drive historic progress,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement.The slower progress registered in the CDC report echoed recent findings from a major private survey, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.The government survey found 8.8 million fewer uninsured people in 2014. The following year, 2015, there was a reduction of 7.4 million. That compares with 1.3 million fewer uninsured people in the first three months of this year.The numbers for 2014 and 2015 are for full calendar years. But the new figures for the first three months of 2016 are considered a reliable indicator for the rest of the year. That's because the health care law's open enrollment deadlines drive sign-ups early in the year.The upcoming 2017 sign-up season looks tough, with sharp premium increases in many communities and a dwindling choice of insurers. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has promised to help the health care law regain its momentum, while Republican Donald Trump would make good on the GOP's vow to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a new program yet to be defined.Some independent experts said the survey suggests that the health care law is approaching its limits, absent a change.""The share of the population without health insurance is lower than it's ever been ... but further gains are getting harder and harder to achieve,"" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The pace at which people are getting newly insured has noticeably slowed.""""Low-income adults have come the farthest, but still have the farthest to go — nearly 25% of this population is uninsured,"" said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Covering more low-income adults is hindered because 19 states are still refusing the law's Medicaid expansion.""Multiple initiatives are needed to have a major impact on further reducing the uninsured population,"" said Paul Hughes-Cromwick of the Altarum Center for Sustainable Health Spending, a research and consulting group.

432,UPS,"Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer by revenue, but its Thursday earnings call hinted that its focus is on e-commerce, amid the looming presence of Amazon (AMZN) and Alibaba (BABA).The discount giant reported that Q2 earnings per share dropped for the sixth straight quarter but still topped Wall Street estimates. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1.6%, their eighth straight advance and exceeding forecasts for a gain of about 1%.Wal-Mart earned $1.07 a share excluding items, down a 1 penny vs. a year earlier. Revenue edged up 0.5% to $120.9 billion. Analysts expected Wal-Mart EPS of $1.02 on a revenue of $120.16 billion.Sales rose 2.8% to $123.6 billion, excluding currency shifts.The home, toys, sporting goods and over-the-counter segments were strong performers, Wal-Mart said.""The ongoing modest comp and traffic gains at (Wal-Mart's operations in the) U.S. speak to the benefit of the company's investments in labor and technology, as well as increased spending power of the lower-income consumer,"" wrote Buckingham Research Group analyst John Zolidis early Thursday.Wal-Mart has raised wages, introduced a mobile-pay app nationwide and expanded its online grocery business and fulfillment capabilities.The company reported accelerating e-commerce sales growth after posting a deceleration in recent quarters. Wal-Mart, trying to keep pace with Amazon.com (AMZN), recently announced a $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition.Management spent some time discussing its digital initiatives on the conference call early Thursday.The takeover of Jet.com is just one of the strategic decisions that Wal-Mart has made to ""position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China,"" said CEO Doug McMillon in prepared remarks during the call.Wal-Mart also nearly doubled the number of markets where its online grocery pickup service is available, meaning that the feature is now offered in more than 60 markets and almost 400 stores, it said.He also touched on Wal-Mart's deal with China's JD.com (JD). Wal-Mart in June said it was acquiring a 5% stake in JD.com in exchange for its struggling Yihaodian marketplace. JD has a strategic alliance with Alibaba archrival Tencent (TCEHY), which owns messaging dynamo WeChat.In Q2, constant-currency e-commerce sales and gross merchandise volume increased 11.8% and 13%, respectively, with both stronger showing gains than in the first quarter. Its U.S. segment outperformed its key international markets during the quarter, the company said, citing growth in U.S. marketplace offerings and in-store pickup services, plus the continued roll-out of its online grocery unit.""We continue to see proof that our customers enjoy a seamless shopping experience,"" said McMillon. ""The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pick-up, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers.""Wal-Mart raised its full-year EPS target to $4.15-$4.35, up from a prior target of $4-$4.30. Analysts have expected $4.27.For Q3, Wal-Mart expects 90 cents to $1 in per-share earnings vs. views for 94 cents. Wal-Mart earned 99 cents a year earlier.Wal-Mart shares rose 1.9% to 74.30 on the stock market today, hitting a 14-month high of 75.19 in the morning. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Wal-Mart stock fell intraday below its 50-day moving average, but it managed to close above that support line on both days.On Wednesday, rival Target (TGT) topped earnings forecasts but slashed its full-year EPS outlook to $4.80-$5.20, down from $5.20-$5.40. Analysts expected $5.13.IBD'S TAKE: While Wal-Mart has struggled in recent years, dollar stores -- and their stocks -- have taken off amid shifting consumer preferences. Read this recent Industry Snapshot to see how dollar stores are changing the retail landscape.Wal-Mart's report adds to the mixed picture of consumer demand and sentiment. While some retailers and consumer-related stocks have topped forecasts, sales growth has generally been sluggish.RELATED:Wal-Mart Pushes Amazon-Style Pass; Could It Up JD.com Stake?

433,UPS,"The market has seen some big winners since Brexit. Who are they, and what clues do they offer for how to play the market?The three sectors that did the best following the post-Brexit pullback were technology, financial services and industrials.Tech sector funds zapped ahead 13.34% on average. Financials rebounded 12.30%. Industrials got pumped up by 8.34%.Each of those topped the S&P 500's 7.24% rally. The big-cap bogey had sagged about 6% during the two trading days following the U.K.'s June 23 vote to get a divorce from the European Union.One sector actually lost ground post-Brexit. Utilities funds retreated 2.78%. Their return for the third quarter through the end of August was a negative 6.61%.The four top-performing tech sector funds since Brexit with at least $100 million in assets are $1.7 billion Fidelity Select Electronics (FSELX), $140 million Victory RS Science & Technology (RSIFX), $1.5 billion Fidelity Advisor Technology (FADTX) and $680 million Columbia Seligman Global Technology (SCGTX).Their post-Brexit gains ranged from 14.70% for Global Technology to 18.77% for Select Electronics. Which stocks were some of their big drivers?Applied Materials (AMAT), a recent top holding of Select Electronics, is up 34% off its post-Brexit closing low. It's up 60% so far this year.The company supplies fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD and solar PV cell manufacturers.Earnings per share growth is speeding up. It went from -4% three quarters ago to 17% and 52% in the past two frames.And the stock has a 99 Composite Rating from IBD.The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.IBD'S TAKE: You can see what makes Applied Materials the No. 1 stock in the electronics-semiconductor equipment industry group with IBD's Stock Checkup.Victory RS Science & Technology was among the funds that held Facebook (FB) as of its latest disclosure. In fact, 3,328 funds of all stripes held the social media giant as of June 30. That was up from 2,950 as of Sept. 30, 2015.Facebook is up 16% off its post-Brexit closing low. EPS grew 16%, 33%, 46%, 83% and 94% the past five quarters.It has a 99 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Is Facebook perfect? Colleague Paul Whitfield takes the mystery out of the popular stock's many ups and downs in this IBD report.Fidelity Select Brokerage & Investment Management (FSLBX) was the top financial services stock since Brexit. It gained 13.47%.Cohen & Steers (CNS) is a top-20 holding. The asset manager specializes in high-income securities, focusing on U.S. REITs, global real estate, preferred securities and large-cap value stocks.In a yield-starved world, that makes Cohen & Steers mutual funds and other investment vehicles popular. Shares are up 8% since the Brexit closing bottom. They've drifted lower since mid-July, but have round technical support at their 50-day moving average line. The stock is up 37% so far this year.Cohen & Steers, which has IBD's 81 Comp Rating, finally returned to positive EPS growth in Q2 with a 26% increase. That followed four quarters of EPS declines.The $604 million Fidelity Advisor Industrials (FCLAX) was one of the top industrials sector funds.Among its top holdings was Danaher (DHR), which is up 11% since Brexit. It's up 16% so far this year.The company makes water treatment and vapor recovery systems. EPS grew 13%, 19% and 17% the past three quarters.Danaher is the No. 2 stock in IBD's electronics-scientific measuring industry group. But the group is now ranked 74 out of 197. Its ranking is down from the 34th position it held eight weeks ago.It has a solid 95 Comp Rating.The maker of instruments last month completed the spinoff of its industrial products businesses. That company is now called Fortive (FTV). That left Danaher with environmental and health care instrumentation.Jeff James, manager of $314 million Driehaus Micro Cap Growth (DMCRX), which is a U.S. diversified stock mutual fund, says the post-Brexit rally occurred amid an improvement in U.S. macroeconomic data after a soft patch earlier in the year. The outlook for corporate earnings was also improving, and a growing number of investors felt earnings were likely to be stronger in the second half of the year.James' own outlook is fueled in part by the fact that much of the post-Brexit gains were in smaller stocks. And smaller stocks tend to be less followed by institutional investors and Wall Street analysts. That makes it relatively easier to find underappreciated stocks among small caps, especially micro caps, says micro-cap manager James.RELATED:Stock Outlook Shines For Managers of Top Post-Brexit Mutual FundsTop Stock Holdings Of Hottest Growth Mutual Funds Since BrexitTop Stocks Held By The Hottest Mutual Funds Since BrexitInvestors Jump On Buy Opportunities Opened By Brexit

435,UPS,"""Borders are the worst invention ever made by politicians."" Those were the words of Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Union's European Commission, at the Alpbach Media Academy last Monday.Nonsense, most readers will surely think, in numbers going far beyond the legions of Americans dismayed with the choices they face in this year's presidential race. But it's worth thinking a bit more about where Juncker is coming from, and the implications of his statement in what is, in Europe as well as America, a fraught political year.Literally, Juncker comes from Luxembourg, a 998-square-mile country wedged between France, Germany and Belgium, where he served as prime minister from 1995 to 2013. If you look up Luxembourg in lists of world economic statistics, you'll find it rated No. 2 in gross domestic product per capita.That's thanks to what Juncker called politicians' worst invention ever, borders. For Luxembourg is a financial haven and headquarters of the world's largest steel company, ArcelorMittal. Without their borders and national laws, the 576,000 Luxembourgers wouldn't be as affluent as they are.But Juncker, having moved on from a big post in a small nation to the unelected leadership of a league of most European nations, is thinking farther back, to 1914 and 1940, when Luxembourg as well as Belgium and much of France were overrun by German troops in two horrifying world wars. Recalling a warning from former French President Francois Mitterrand, who played an ambiguous part in the second of those wars, Juncker said, ""We have to fight against nationalism, we have the duty not to follow populists but to block the avenue of populists.""Such is the faith of the Eurocrats: The EU exists to prevent another war between France and Germany. Never mind that the chance of such a war has been zero since 1945, 71 years ago. Never mind that Hitler did not respect borders, but erased them.Juncker was denouncing Austria and other nations for erecting border controls to keep out Muslim refugees. Evidently he believes that World War III will somehow break out if they are kept out.In a similar vein, Hillary Clinton opposes deportation of the bulk of the 11 million illegal immigrants in this country who haven't been convicted of felonies. That would put out a welcome mat to millions of other potential migrants who might come here in violation of U.S. laws. And curiously, Donald Trump has pivoted to suggesting he might not deport all that many illegals either.Denigration of borders is an example of what Nico Colchester in a famous 1988 Economist leader (editorial, in Britspeak) called sogginess. The opposite was crunchiness. ""Crunchy systems are those in which small changes have big effects leaving those affected by them in no doubt whether they are up or down,"" Colchester wrote. ""Sogginess is comfortable uncertainty.""Borders are crunchy, or ought to be. But those inclined to sogginess don't like them that way. Wouldn't refugees from Syria -- or young men from Libya or Bangladesh or Eritrea or Honduras -- be better off in Europe or the United States than where they are? If so, then why should we let a dotted line on a map stand in their way? So let's replace crunchy restrictions with soggy benevolence and let as many come in as they want.To Jean-Claude Juncker's dismay, European voters are recoiling against this, not least in Germany, whose chancellor Angela Merkel declared open doors to 800,000 newcomers -- 1% of pre-existing population -- in September 2015. Earnest editorialists argued that incoming young men would supply the labor force low-birth-rate Germany needs. None of the great and good figured they wouldn't blend soggily in.Those prognostications proved wrong. Refugees asked to work say they are guests of Angela Merkel. Despite government and media cover-ups, voters found out that ""refugees"" have been assaulting women by the thousands and setting off bombs and wielding axes against innocent bystanders.Borders, it turns out, are not the worst inventions ever made by politicians. They operate most of the time to protect a citizenry that, in Europe and North America, is for the most part productive and tolerant and observant of common moral norms and cultural behaviors. Inviting in unlimited numbers of young men who share none of these traits is generosity turned to sogginess -- and is being met with crunchy rejection.America's plight is less dire than Europe's. But Clinton's sogginess on borders could face crunchy rejection too, depending on what Donald Trump's position turns out to be.

436,UPS,"It's the science-fiction nightmare we've all dreaded -- perhaps the rogue computer from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" somehow joins forces with the brutal robots from one of ""The Terminator"" movies to seize your job.In more realistic terms, you might fear your company's bean counters finding any excuse they can to automate you out of employment. Maybe these manic cost cutters end up cooking a gourmet recipe for a robot economy -- that seemingly inevitable era where inefficient humans are rendered useless by hyper-efficient cyborgs.Well, something resembling that day may already be here. But it's not as dreary as you or Hollywood has envisioned. At least not yet.Robotic and artificial intelligence systems being developed by IBM (IBM), Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Tesla Motors (TSLA) and others are sophisticated and cheap enough to spread rapidly through the economy. As a result, more systems will be put to work, drastically altering the job landscape.""Virtually every industry in existence is likely to become less labor-intensive in future years as new technology is assimilated into existing business models,"" wrote Janus Capital Group lead portfolio manager Bill Gross in a May 4 Investment Outlook report. He added: ""Millions of jobs will be lost over the next 10-15 years.""Routine tasks such as data entry and research could be increasingly automated. But they're the tip of the iceberg, and some professions that could be hit might surprise you.Among the vulnerable: truck drivers, attorneys, nurses and even nuclear technicians.IBD'S TAKE: Artificial intelligence seems like a smart bet for many companies. Alphabet and Facebook are in buy range. Nvidia, whose chips are being used in many AI systems, soared to a fresh high Friday after reporting another quarter of blowout earnings. ""Medicine, manufacturing and even service-intensive jobs are at risk,"" said Gross. ""Investment managers too! Not only blue-collar but now white-collar professionals are being threatened by technological change.""Oxford University researchers studied the future of employment and how susceptible jobs are to computerization. They concluded that a staggering number of jobs are at risk.""According to our estimates, about 47% of total U.S. employment is at risk,"" the researchers said.Others see no need for knee-jerk paranoia.""While automation will eliminate very few occupations entirely in the next decade, it will affect portions of almost all jobs to a greater or lesser degree,"" according to a McKinsey report released in July.At-risk doesn't necessarily mean gone. New technologies generally improve productivity, creating higher-value, higher-wage jobs, experts say. They also create fields of work that didn't even exist before.By one popular estimate, 65% of children entering primary school today will end up working in jobs that don't exist now, according to the World Economic Forum.Still, the number of jobs in certain fields will likely dwindle in coming years, affecting many people in the workforce. A Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report last December projected overall U.S. employment will grow about 6.5% from 2014 to 2024. That compares to labor force growth of 5.1%.Here are some middle-class jobs that will be affected by automation in that time frame. Some will grow despite the incursion of automation, some will decline and others will expand at a slower than average rate.Truck drivers are one of the most endangered blue-collar jobs. In May 2015, autonomous trucks began rolling down U.S. highways for the first time after Nevada licensed a new Daimler (DDAIF) Freightliner 18-wheeler called Inspiration. For now, a human has to be in the cab during the prototype phase.Tesla Motors is working on plans for self-driving, all-electric heavy trucks, CEO Elon Musk wrote in his recent ""Master Plan.""Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford says all leading trucking companies are experimenting with autonomous truck technology.""UPS would be the most logical. I know they have looked at the possibility,"" Hartford told IBD.UPS already employs driver-assistance systems on many trucks, but says full autonomy is further off, with regulation being a key issue.Truck drivers are in short supply now, and self-driving trucks would fill that gap. But if large numbers of self-driving trucks roll out -- with no human in the cab -- Teamsters and other unions would likely resist.""That will be a potential issue,"" Hartford said.Overall, jobs for truck drivers are projected to grow at a slower-than-average 4% rate through 2024. And for light-truck delivery services such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX), jobs will grow at just a 3% clip.Modest employment gains could look great next to the longer-therm outlook. Trucks are expected to lead the push for autonomous vehicles on American roads, which could drastically shrink employment among the estimated 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the U.S., starting in the 2020s.""Improved routing through GPS technology can make existing light-truck drivers more productive, which may limit the demand for additional drivers,"" the BLS said.Ross is an artificial intelligence system that does legal research using IBM's Watson supercomputer. It searches through mountains of case files for data points that attorneys can use in court. IBM says Watson can read 40 million documents in 15 seconds, replacing some entry-level attorneys.The system's inventor, Ross Intelligence, rolled it out in early 2016. It's at work in a few law firms today, including BakerHostetler, which employs more than 900 attorneys across the nation. Users ask spoken questions and Ross reads through ""the entire body of law"" and returns a cited answer and topical readings from legislation, according to the startup's co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Arruda.Machine learning, which gives computers the ability to learn rather than having to be programmed, will make robo-attorneys even more useful.""Artificial intelligence is going to be included in all software,"" Arruda told IBD. ""It will learn and get better and do a lot more with less as we move away from programming systems to teaching them.""As Ross handles more of the grunt work, it will free experienced attorneys to tackle more cases and do more in-depth research. The BLS estimates that the number of jobs for lawyers will grow 6% by 2024, a bit lower than average. But if more law firms employ AI systems like Ross, that could grow at a slower rate.Alphabet's Google recently said its Deep Mind technology research unit is harnessing artificial intelligence in its work with Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. The goal is to develop treatments for ailments such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness among the elderly.""By allowing earlier detection and treatment of AMD,"" Google says on its website, ""machine learning has the potential to help save the sight of many of these people.""Rising numbers of aging baby boomers requiring more health care, however, will offset productivity gains from AI and robotics. BLS projects the number of jobs for licensed vocational nurses and registered nurses will grow 16% by 2024.Underwriters evaluate the risks of insuring specific potential clients to determine how much coverage to provide and the right premium to charge. Automated underwriting software is enabling underwriters to process applications faster.""As the technology improves, more underwriting decisions can be made automatically,"" the BLS says. As a result, 11% fewer underwriters will be needed by the mid-2020s.Employment of surveying and mapping technicians is projected to fall 8% by 2024.""Advancements in surveying technology, such as robotic total stations, let surveyors complete more work in less time, reducing the demand for surveyors,"" the BLS said. Still, some surveyors will be needed for tasks that haven't been automated yet, such as certifying boundary lines and reviewing sites for construction.By studying the Earth and its land features, geographers create and modify maps and analyze geographic data to create reports. They use tools such as satellite-based global positioning systems.More than half of all geographers work for the federal government. Advances in computer technology that create a faster, more efficient work process, combined with government budget cuts, are expected to reduce employment by 2%.Public safety communications operators help keep communities safe. But jobs are projected to fall 3% by 2024.""Consolidation of emergency communication centers, enabled by advances in technology, is expected to reduce the employment of dispatchers,"" the BLS said. ""Still, job prospects should be good because the stressful nature of the jobs results in many workers leaving the occupation,"" and this turnover opens up positions.When ATMs came into wide use in the 1970s, some observers predicted the number of bank tellers would fall. That didn't happen.""Job growth for tellers was driven by the expansion of bank branches, where most tellers work,"" the BLS said.But as online and mobile banking have grown more common, the number of branches has shrunk. According to market tracker SNL Financial, U.S. banks finished 2015 with 92,997 branches, 1,614 fewer than a year earlier.""It extended a continuous branch reduction trend that dates back to 2009,"" SNL said in a Jan. 12 report. The BLS forecasts the number of teller jobs will fall 8% by 2024 to 480,500.According to the Nuclear Power Institute, nuclear power accounts for 19% of the electricity generated in the U.S. today. Nuclear power plants have gained greater acceptance in recent years and are seen by some as a cheap, clean energy source. They face tough competition, however, from lower-maintenance renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, both of which are gaining popularity. Some technicians will be needed to maintain and upgrade existing nuclear plants, but employment of nuclear technicians is expected to fall 5%.Drafters use software to convert designs of architects and engineers into schematics and technical drawings. The BLS says computer-aided design and other automation tools ""allow engineers and architects to perform many tasks that used to be done by drafters."" As a result, employment is forecast to fall 3%.---Despite job losses in these fields and others due to advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, the economy should benefit overall from productivity gains and creation of new jobs, according to Matt Anchin, who heads communications and content development as senior vice president for Monster Worldwide's (MWW) Monster.com job site, which lists roughly 5 million jobs.The jobs market continues to evolve rapidly, Anchin said, and he's optimistic about the overall outlook""Mobile technology is creating nothing but opportunity,"" he told IBD. ""We see it as a ripple effect.""Think of transportation, Uber and Lyft, part of the sharing economy,"" he said. ""Humans are remarkably good at adapting as new technologies emerge.""

437,UPS,"The first delivery jet for Amazon (AMZN) will likely go into service ""soon"" this quarter, said Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW), which in May agreed to provide air delivery via Boeing (BA) 767 freight jets.But Atlas, a provider of outsourced aircraft services, said startup costs associated with the Amazon deal would weigh on profits this year and said full-year EPS would be ""lower than our adjusted EPS in 2015 by a high-single-digit percentage."" A Cowen & Co. research note said those costs could weigh on results through much of next year as well.""We believe the Amazon relationship will ultimately prove to be very profitable, but the startup will be slightly disruptive in the near term,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote Wednesday.Atlas Air shares gapped down 6.9% to 38.25 on the stock market today. Amazon dipped 0.8% to 754.64. UPS (UPS) tacked on an incremental gain to 108.29 while FedEx (FDX) edged up to 160.61. Both UPS and FedEx have benefited from the growth in e-commerce.IBD'S TAKE: Air-cargo servicers Atlas Air Worldwide and Air Transport Services Group have benefited as Amazon tries to take more control of its deliveries. But the e-commerce giant's moves could mean more difficulty for UPS, for whom Amazon is a huge customer. See how the Transport-Air Freight segment is performing in IBD's Stock Checkup.In the second quarter, Atlas Air's earnings per share fell 46% to 80 cents, missing analyst forecasts for 93 cents. Revenue fell 3% to $443.27 million, short of views for $473.05 million.The Amazon deal is part of Atlas Air's plan to shift more toward express and e-commerce delivery. Under the terms, an Atlas subsidiary will operate 20 Boeing 767s for Amazon for at least seven years, and Amazon has an option to acquire as much as a fifth of Atlas Air's common stock over a five-year period. Over a seven-year period, Amazon can acquire an extra 10% of Atlas shares.Atlas Air's stock spiked 27% after the deal was announced. The company at the time said the deal would be ""meaningfully accretive to Atlas Air Worldwide's earnings and cash flows over time.""Amazon, which has tried to assert more control over how its products are delivered in an attempt to control shipping costs, also announced a similar deal this year with Air Transport Services Group (ATSG).

440,UPS,"The first day of the Morningstar Investment Conference kicked off with a raft of presentations, almost all by Morningstar's own analysts and experts, serving as the warm-ups for prime-time opening remarks by Kunal Kapoor, Morningstar's CEO, and the day's keynote speech by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of online encyclopedia Wikipedia.To close out the opening day's session, the conference was scheduled to feature a roundtable discussion featuring Morningstar managing director and former CEO Don Phillips, CEO Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management and Rohit Mahna, VP and GM of financial services at Salesforce.com (CRM).Kapoor's remarks were a hybrid of comments meant to welcome the financial advisors who form the bulk of the conference's audience and to introduce those advisors to new products and services from Morningstar.""Morningstar is privileged to share the same mission as you,"" Kapoor told the financial advisors.He lauded financial advisors for having shepherded their clients through the Great Recession and years of sluggish market growth and anemic interest rates that followed.He told the advisors that in the intervening years technology at the disposal of the industry has become as powerful as ever and advisors have become as good as ever. He added that it's an amazing time to build relationships with clients, and of course his organization stands ready to offer services to assist in those endeavors.To help accomplish that, Morningstar is about to debut new data for fixed-income investors and the financial advisors who assist them. ""We are spending our time to make you, the advisor, look good and valuable,"" Kapoor said.Wales told his audience that he has launched Wikitribune, which he described as a hybrid effort using professional and citizen journalists. One of its key goals will be to combat fake news.It will rely on subscriptions, which he called a superior business model to advertising for news sites.After graduate school, Wales worked as a research director of Chicago futures and options firm.

442,UPS,"Edwards Lifesciences (EW) stock rocketed to a six-month high Wednesday after the medical tech player reported ""particular strength"" in U.S. heart-valve-replacement sales, following several quarters of ""ups and downs.""On the stock market today, Edwards soared 10.5% to 109.30 after earlier rising as much as 14.3% to a high last achieved in October.U.S. sales of transcatheter aortic heart valves, or TAVR, grew 38% to $299 million, Edwards said Tuesday during its first-quarter earnings conference call. That beat the consensus by $28 million, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said in a note to clients.""An unexpectedly strong quarter for U.S. TAVR sales, coupled with an upward revision to revenue and (earnings) guidance, sent Edwards shares up about 10% in after-market trading,"" Novarro said after Edwards' late-Tuesday report.TAVR is a method of replacing a diseased heart valve via catheter. This process has become more popular in recent years as it's less risky and requires a shorter recovery period than surgery. Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Sciences (BSX) are also working in this realm.For the quarter ended March 31, Edwards reported $883.5 million in sales, growing 26.7% and topping the consensus for $777 million, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills wrote in a research report. Edwards reported 94 cents adjusted earnings per share, up 32.4%, and beating by 12 cents.Mills is pounding ""the drum again on the three primary reasons to own Edwards,"" including the $5.3 billion total addressable market in TAVR by 2021. Edwards outgrew the market this quarter, increasing TAVR sales by 38%, vs. 26% for other companies.Edwards has about a 67% share of the TAVR market, Mills estimates.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific made an acquisition in December that could rattle Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic. Will it pay off? Head to Sector Leaders for the deep dive.""(The first quarter) validated our bullish view of the U.S. TAVR market in which we estimate a 575,000 target population in the U.S., penetration into which we model 21% by 2021 when we estimate a $3.3 billion U.S. market of which Edwards will hold a 64% share,"" he wrote.He also notes Edwards' strong earnings leverage and growing opportunities in transcatheter mitral-valve repair. The portfolio ""could positively surprise investors earlier than (2019)"" when its acquisition of CardiAQ is expected to drive material profit and loss contributions.Also Tuesday, Edwards boosted the low end of its yearly sales guidance and now sees $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2017 revenue. The company also raised its adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 to $3.43-$3.55 from $3.30-$3.45.For the second quarter, Edwards models $810 million to $850 million in sales, excluding Germany stocking sales, and adjusted earnings of 82 cents to 92 cents per share.Mills kept his 140 price target and buy rating on Edwards stock. Novarro boosted his price target to 120 from 116 and maintained his outperform rating on Edwards.RELATED:Which Medtech Stocks Should You Buy Ahead Of Q1?Boston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, EdwardsMedtronic Does Heart-Valve Study, And Rivals Reap The Benefits

444,UPS,"Thrice-elected Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker endorsed Ted Cruz Tuesday, a week before that state's GOP primary that will reveal Donald Trump's springtime staying power amid dubious public behavior by the billionaire and aides.Polls there currently show a close race with Trump and Cruz jostling on top and Ohioan John Kasich not that far behind.The endorsement by Walker, who's saved his taxpayers billions driving a conservative fiscal agenda, could make the difference.Or it might not matter at all if Trump's deaf and blind blue-collar supporters combine with disaffected Democrats and independents and turn out in droves for the Badger state's open primary. Trump has done well in those so far.Trump's outbursts and behavior have not appeared to hurt him yet as he builds a still surmountable delegate lead over Cruz for the July convention.In fact, in a quietly significant way the incidents help Trump by drawing heavy media coverage away from any sustained vetting focus on the Trump campaign's policy void or his often incoherent remarks.President Obama, in a self-serving analysis of the political media this week, appropriately blamed reporters for being so easily distracted by trivialities, a mis-direction tactic he's used effectively himself.However, veteran pollster Paul Mirengoff writes on the influential Powerline blog that Trump's winning margins have been slipping of late, not what you'd expect if a genuine bandwagon to the front-runner was developing on the GOP side.After Wisconsin comes New York, which you'd expect to heavily favor Trump. Then Pennsylvania where Trump leads but Pittsburgh native Kasich has closed some recently.What's not been good for Trump recently are the hypothetical head-to-head match-ups for Nov. 8. He boasts regularly about defeating Hillary Clinton. Alas, like Obama proclaiming ObamaCare or his anti-ISIS strategy a success, saying something does not make it true.The RealClear Politics poll average shows either Clinton or socialist Bernie Sanders easily trumping Trump by double digits currently. Cruz does get within three points of Clinton.The only Republican currently capable of defeating the former first lady is Kasich, who does about seven points better than she does.This seeming anomaly appears confirmed by a new Fox News national poll that finds Kasich surpassing Clinton by a whopping 11 points.One significant problem: Kasich has no conceivable or mathematical way of reaching the 1,237 delegates necessary to capture the Republican nomination in Cleveland come mid-July.He can only tacitly help Cruz deny Trump the majority. And perhaps use his delegates as leverage for something, now or during a contested convention.Gallup did produce some good news for Trump. It found his supporters are by far the most enthusiastic behind any candidate in either party.Nearly two-in-three Trump-backers (65%) describe themselves as extremely or very enthusiastic about their guy.That far exceeds the enthusiasm of Cruz backers (39%) and Kasich (33%). Another 31% of Kasich ""fans"" describe themselves as ""not at all enthusiastic"" about him, by far the largest of ""mehs"" of the five candidates.On the Democrat side, 54% are very or extremely enthusiastic about Clinton, believe it or not. While 44% say that about Bernie Sanders.RELATED:

"
446,UPS,"Worried by looming terrorism threats from abroad, a president who doesn't seem to take their fears seriously and a fractious domestic political cycle where would-be leaders feud over trivialities, Americans seem to be seeking increased comfort in religious faith.Polls before both last Christmas and this Easter confirm church attendance is up significantly, plus anecdotal evidence. It's a time-tested human behavior in uncertain, frightening days. Even Barack Obama, more often a chronic weekend golfer, showed up at religious services Easter Sunday at Alexandria's Alfred Baptist Church in Virginia.""As long as Christ is alive, I have hope,"" Pastor Howard-John Wesley told more than 500 worshipers, including the first family and the president, who left early.Hope can seem hard to spot these days. From overseas come images of innocent tourists, including Americans, slain by terrorist bombs in Brussels. After San Bernardino. After Paris. Word that hundreds more jihadists are enroute to European countries that seem paralyzed addressing deadly threats from within their resident Muslim populations.Obama tends toward the delusional when, for instance, hyping the professed success of ObamaCare and his reluctant fight with ISIS.In the Mideast, Obama's anti-ISIS 'strategy' could be generously described as half-hearted, more of a quarter-hearted holding action until the Democrat is out of office in 298 day with ample time to devote to golf and his multi-million-dollar memoirs.So desperate is his administration for signs of war progress that the Pentagon holds a news briefing on the death of one single ISIS officer. He'll be immediately replaced, of course. But the overlooked good news is he was ambushed by U.S. Special Ops troops waiting inside Syria. That means the apocalyptic cult now has moles within willing to give up higher-ups. That should tighten some ISIS sphincters.No one doubts the ability of the U.S. professional military to defeat ISIS -- eventually.Hopefully, the next president will ease the restrictive rules of engagement, increase the number of air sorties from the token 15 or 20 daily and raise Obama's threshold of acceptable collateral damage that allows ISIS fighters to hide among civilians with impunity.And hopefully (again, with the hope) the next POTUS will be more cognizant of presidential optics that the American people -- and allies -- see. It's one thing to be cool under pressure. It's quite another to be willfully ignorant or arrogant about what the people who elected you think.When, for example, the Obamas decorated the White House with 54 Christmas trees during the worst of the recession and hosted glitzy parties for celebrity donors, that might seem minor. However, golfing with fist-bumping NBA pals right after an American is beheaded on international TV is just cold-hearted, especially when contrasted against Obama's sympathetic portrayal of a convenience-store robber killed by Ferguson police.Obama declined to attend last year's world leader unity march against terrorism in Paris. This week another deadly terrorist attack struck the capital of the European Union. Obama was on his gratuitous stop in Communist Cuba, until recently classified a state sponsor of terrorism by Obama's own State Department.The president proceeded to frolic at an exhibition baseball game with dictator Raul Castro, even as forensics collected blood splatters to ID vaporized victims. Then, in Argentina as Belgian funerals began, Obama was photographed doing the tango at a state dinner.Some witnesses said he wisely appeared initially reluctant to accept the female performer's insistent invitations. But he caved, more concerned about how his hosts would take a refusal than what folks back home -- and in Europe -- would think. Actually, Obama's inability to say No even to an Argentinian tango dancer reveals much about this president's diplomacy. Think Iran, Putin.As Obama explains Obama thinking, to alter his presidential travel schedule, even just to delete the appearance of inappropriately enjoying himself at the ballpark, would somehow be giving in to terrorism and ISIS. Yes, of course, it's self-serving and excuses himself from admitting a mistake.But it also indicates Obama places more value on how ISIS views him than on what his own people see. A president who seems unbothered by, even diffident about something so clearly a threat as terrorism becomes in itself frightening.Obama's own words: ""It is very important for us to not respond with fear. As I said, that's hard to do because we see the impact in such an intimate way of the attacks that they make. But we defeat them in part by saying, you are not strong; you are weak.""We send a message to those who might be inspired by them to say, you are not going to change our values of liberty and openness and the respect of all people….You do not have power over us. We are strong. Our values are right. You offer nothing except death.""And then -- no comfort to terrorism's past victims in Benghazi, to its latest victims in Europe or the ones yet to come at home -- Obama utters his favorite aphorism to inaction and impotence: ""We're on the right side of history.""RELATED:

448,UPS,"Amazon (AMZN) doubled down on its quest for fast and reliable service -- and perhaps more -- by confirming Wednesday a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA) 767 jets from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG).The e-commerce giant has sought more control over distribution and logistics amid rapid growth in its Prime service, which promises speedy delivery and which saw membership jump more than 50% last year.""Moving inventory from Kansas to Oklahoma -- that's probably easy to do by truck,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""Portland, Maine, to Portland, Ore., is harder. This is the first or second step in a very bold strategy.""Reports have been surfacing of Amazon's growing interest in building its own air cargo operation, and a 2013 document prepared for senior management, recently leaked to Bloomberg, envisioned grander ambitions.It called for the creation of a new business that eventually would allow merchants to bypass FedEx (FDX), UPS (UPS) and DHL and book cargo space directly through Amazon, which would be at the center of a global logistics operation competing against the shippers.Shares of Amazon closed down 0.1% on the stock market Wednesday. Air Transport Services Group jumped 16.7%. FedEx dipped 0.4%, and UPS slid 1%.For now, Amazon says its latest move is meant for the Prime service.""These planes provide critical capacity expansion to support the growth of Prime in the U.S.,"" Amazon representative Kelly Cheeseman told IBD via email. ""At our scale, supporting growth requires adding some of our own logistics capabilities.""The duration of the 20 leases on the Boeing planes will be five to seven years, while the contract governing the operation of the aircraft will be for five years. ATSG will fly the aircraft and will hold responsibility for gate and logistics services.The air cargo company also granted Amazon warrants to acquire up to 19.9% of ATSG's common stock over a five-year period.Amazon's push to take more control over delivery follows troubles with shippers in 2013, when FedEx and UPS struggled and sometimes failed to get packages delivered before Christmas, citing overloaded systems, poor weather and a shortened holiday shopping season.Amazon is now reducing its dependence on them. It has plans to roll out thousands of branded trucks in an effort to shuttle inventory between its facilities.The company also has a deal with the U.S. Postal Service to deliver packages on Sundays, and it is developing drones to make deliveries within an hour.They would help serve a sprawling web of merchants, warehouses and customers.Amazon has working relationships with more than 3 million businesses, including third-party sellers, advertisers and cloud computing services.Currently, Amazon has 167 distribution facilities worldwide, including 92 facilities in North America. But they're typically not located a short trek down the road from each other.""If there were any doubt before whether Amazon would compete with those (shippers), I think they’ve answered those questions today,"" said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.

449,UPS,"A couple of weeks after the new year began, shares of the otherwise staid WebMD Health (WBMD) suddenly shot up 6% on Jan. 13, hitting a new 52-week high.WebMD shares were starting to make an upward push, but this jump was out of character for the health information website. The reason for the jump: Reports circulated that Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH) were bidding to buy the company.It was a rumor that would be short-lived. The next day WedMD's stock fell 8% after the company squelched the merger talk, saying in a written statement that it is ""not currently in any negotiations to be acquired.""""We've been around a long time,"" WebMD Chief Executive David Schlanger told analysts recently on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""Our content is highly valued by consumers, by physicians, and also highly ranked by the search engines, and we don't believe that situation is going to change.""Although it may eventually choose to merge with a deep-pocketed company such as longtime marketing partner Walgreens, the fact that WebMD isn't seeking a merger should come as no surprise. The company's finances seem fit as a fiddle without the aid of a larger partner.When the New York-based entity reported a 67% jump in fourth-quarter earnings per share to 60 cents on Feb. 23, it kept alive a string of strong reports in which WebMD posted quarterly profit growth of at least 39% for the last three years. At times that growth has gone as high as 600%.Also in the quarter, sales grew 18% to $192.13 million from advertisements on 3.97 billion page views, up 7% year over year. Both earnings and sales topped analyst projections.WebMD's 2015 revenue of $636 million was nearly three times that of the next-largest publicly traded health site operator, Everyday Health (EVDY), which operates its namesake site and several others. Another rival is Time's (TIME) Health.com. WebMD also competes with nonprofits like the Mayo Clinic, which takes paid ads, and the American Heart Association, which doesn't.The health advertising market in general is large and growing, and there are glimmers of optimism, even in negative news. Schonfeld & Associates last year forecast that the global pharmaceutical industry will cut advertising spending by 1.7% in 2016 amid consolidation and growing emphasis on affordable health care. Still, spending will top $21 billion, the market research firm said.WebMD is taking advantage of that, as well as an uptick in new drug approvals. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved 45 new drugs in the U.S., significantly more than the 28 the agency averaged in 9 of the last 10 years, officials say.""There is a historically strong pipeline of new drugs coming to market, a 40-year high,"" Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Donald Hooker told IBD. ""The Food and Drug Administration has been accelerating drug approvals, establishing the fast-track program and speeding the process for breakthrough therapies. And all of those new drugs need ads.""Perhaps best known for its flagship consumer-oriented WebMD site, the company operates a variety of other health-related sites that have enriched its coffers. In fact, one contributes more to the top line than even WebMD, and that is Medscape.A resource for physicians and other health professionals, Medscape has accounted for 60% of the company's total ad revenue each of the last three years. It's a free one-time registration site that provides personalized medical information and education tools to doctors and other health professionals. WebMD says its Medscape Journal of Medicine is the Internet’s first primary-source medical journal.""Drugmakers want to reach both physicians and consumers. But they want to reach physicians more, and they will pay more to do so,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Steven Wardell.Wardell expects Medscape will continue to contribute more to total revenue than WebMD. In the fourth quarter, Medscape averaged 7.3 million physician sessions a month, a 9% increase over the same quarter a year earlier. Other WebMD sites include MedicineNet, eMedicine, drug info site RxList and theheart.org.Figures indicate there's room for growth as drug ad spending is skewed toward old school media such as print magazines and newspapers.Leerink's research shows that just 4% of consumers reach for print media for health news, but the print industry gets 18% of health ad revenue. Meanwhile, 48% of consumers get health info from digital media, but just 31% of ad revenue goes there.""I would call this one of the best macro trends available to investors because pharmaceutical companies will re-index spending to where the audience is -- to digital spending,"" Wardell said.WebMD also is pushing deeper into video health presentations, which could further boost ad sales. Currently, WebMD is launching more than a dozen new video series that range from short, social-friendly episodes like ""how to's"" to in-depth features hosted by well-known TV journalists.Schlanger admits there are hurdles.""Starting in the third quarter of 2015, we began to experience a decline in the rate of growth of our overall traffic, which has continued into the current quarter,"" he said on the conference call. ""We are working to understand the reasons for this change.""Leerink's Wardell said he's not concerned about the slowdown in growth of overall page views because the highly-focused Medscape site for physicians generates the bulk of the company's revenue, and it's growing at a rapid clip.Keybanc Capital's Hooker agrees.""I think the decline in page views (growth) is misleading,"" he said. ""WebMD Health is ultimately a platform for drug ads. And there is a massive flow of new products coming into the market.""

450,UPS,"Shares of Sturm Ruger (RGR)  fell sharply and Smith & Wesson (SWHC) tested a recent buy point in Thursday afternoon trading amid regulatory pressure and signs of slipping firearm sales.The sell-off for firearms makers may have been partly triggered by concerns that gun sales may be slowing at Sportsman's Warehouse (SPWH). Sportsman's Warehouse said late Wednesday that fiscal Q4 firearm sales shot up 33%, but that demand softened in February. The outdoor sports retailer, which topped Q4 estimates, gave weak guidance for the current fiscal year.Sportsman's Warehouse stock tumbled 11.3% to 12.23 in the stock market today, two days after breaking out of a consolidation. However, rival Cabela's (CAB) rose 3.9%.In an open letter to the SEC on Tuesday, New York Public Advocate Letitia James accused Sturm Ruger of failing to tell investors about financial risks related to gun violence. James said in part in the letter, ""We can and will use every tool at our disposal to address the devastating impact of gun violence in our country.""Gun rights advocates have consistently argued that private ownership of firearms increases personal safety, rather than decreasing it. James filed a similar action vs. Smith & Wesson on Dec. 15. The SEC had not taken any formal action vs. Smith & Wesson as of Thursday.Smith & Wesson shares fell 8.7% to 26.52, closing just below a 26.64 buy point cleared early this month following quarterly earnings.Sturm Ruger lost 8.6% to 69.75, still above a 67.03 entry point. Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger are both on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks after strong run-ups this year, prior to Thursday's action.Firearms sales are highly cyclical, spiking after violent events such as the Dec. 2 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead and 22 seriously injured. Such events spur consumers to buy more guns for personal protection. Sales fall off in times of relatively low crime and lower gun violence.Earlier this week, a New York official asked the SEC to investigate the company for allegedly failing to reveal investor risk.

452,UPS,"Nike (NKE) rival Adidas ramped up its full-year forecast for the fourth time this calendar year, once again citing ""strong brand momentum.""Ahead of its second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 4, Adidas said it now expects a sales growth rate, minus currency impacts, in the ""high teens,"" up from prior guidance for 15% in revenue gains for the year. And it sees net income from continuing operations growing 35%-39%, vs. its earlier outlook for 25% growth.The company also reported preliminary Q2 revenue growth of 21% and basic EPS that doubled from the prior-year quarter.The quarter got a positive bump from the early termination of its sponsorship of Chelsea Football Club. (Nike was quick to pick up that endorsement deal, thought to be worth about $87.5 million a year.)Adidas has been enjoying something of a comeback. The Ultra Boost shoe is said to be selling well, and the retro appeal of footwear like the Superstar is making the Three Stripes a fashion favorite once again. The reportedly calculated disappearance and retail return of Stan Smith court shoes also helped drive demand.By contrast, Under Armour (UA) isn't exactly considered a style influencer -- although that hasn't stopped the much-maligned ""Chef Curry"" shoes from selling like hotcakes.Under Armour shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today, finding support at their 50-day average. Nike shares slipped 0.6%, closing just below their 50-day average.IBD'S TAKE: Nike may be king of the court, but its shares are off about 19% from their late December high of 68.19. And Under Armour's stock sliced support at the key 200-day line on Tuesday despite meeting expectations and announcing several new offensives.Experts say Adidas shoes are also performing solidly on the secondary, resale market, where exclusivity matters and limited-time-only collaborations with celebrities like Kanye West and Pharrell Williams translate to demand. But the Swoosh remains on top.""Despite losing dollar share to Adidas, Nike/Jordan still retains close to 90% share of the sneaker volume transacted through StockX, whereas Adidas' share is more like 6%-7%,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Edward Plank following a meeting with Josh Luber, the head of sneaker resale exchange StockX.""As the far and away leader in volumes, we think this is a clear indication of strong demand for Nike's products,"" he said.On the manufacturing side, each of the three athletic apparel brands has been working to improve their supply chains, toying with 3D printing and less-wasteful product creation. In the long term, the moves are expected to cut costs and bring product to shelves more quickly.And BB&T Capital analyst Corinna Freedman pegs Adidas as being ahead of its peers.""While both Nike and Under Armour have also unveiled plans to innovate their supply chains over the past year, we believe that Adidas appears to be the farthest along in rolling out these initiatives on a commercial basis,"" she wrote on July 19.

Earlier this month, Delta Chairman Richard Anderson disclosed a sale and options exercise of 758,000 shares for a total transaction value of $30.37 million.The company has said it wants to be the first network carrier to reach positive growth in unit revenue by the end of the year.

455,UPS,"UPS (UPS) announced plans Monday to ramp up its Saturday activity as FedEx (FDX) invests in more ground operations to deal with growing e-commerce shipments from Amazon (AMZN) and others.UPS said it will expand Saturday ground pickups and delivery to New York, Chicago, Boston and 12 other metro areas this month, after testing the service in Atlanta, Philadelphia and Los Angeles last year, and has plans to expand the service to 4,700 U.S. cities by the holiday season.The increased activity will create 6,000 jobs once the plan is fully implemented in 2018, but UPS said it won't be investing more in buildings or vehicles.UPS shares slid 0.8% to 106.40 on the stock market today. FedEx shares rose 0.1% to 195.36.IBD'S TAKE: E-commerce is soaring, but don't count out brick and mortar stores at malls just yet.Amazon and e-commerce has fueled UPS and FedEx revenue for years, but the volume and need for ever-faster delivery has strained the shipping giants, especially around the holidays.FedEx reported a surprise earnings decline on March 21, its first in four years. But FedEx was upbeat that heavy investments will pay off. FedEx shares have been up and down and up following its Q3 results.UPS said e-commerce was a major factor in its decision to ramp up Saturday shipping, saying in a press release that: ""Online retailers stand to benefit from fewer lost sales due to abandoned online shopping carts, enhanced ship-from-store options and fewer items being out of stock.""Amazon and the increase of two day shipping with its Prime membership has helped UPS and FedEx volumes but the e-commerce giant is expanding its own shipping operations and has plans to use drones for smaller-package, same-day deliveries.Amazon shares edged up 0.6% to 891.51 after hitting a fresh all-time high of 892.76 earlier.RELATED:FedEx Delivers Two Surprises Late: Earnings And Stock Reaction

456,UPS,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Cytomx (CTMX) could be working on a less potent version of Yervoy and have data as early as 2018, an analyst said Thursday — a month after the two announced a deeper tie.Though neither has commented specifically on which types of cancer they'll target in their deepened partnership, Bristol-Myers recently filed its plan to begin a three-year study of 531 patients with melanoma.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat called the filing with ClinicalTrials.gov ""intriguing."" The trial will be a head-to-head comparison of a new immuno-oncology drug vs. Yervoy and look at a combination with Opdivo.Although the filing doesn't identify whether the new immuno-oncology drug is Cytomx's, the pairing would make sense considering Bristol and Cytomx announced a deeper tie on March 20 to explore up to eight additional targets in oncology.Their goal, Raffat says, is likely to find a less potent version of Yervoy, an immuno-oncology drug. Yervoy belongs to a class of drugs called CTLA-4 antibodies, which work to help the immune system identify cancer cells hiding behind CTLA-4 proteins.Yervoy is effective, but it's also toxic. Its label includes warnings of ""severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions"" including inflammation of the small intestine and colon, hepatitis, skin disorders, nerve damage and endocrine gland damage.Cytomx is working on what is calls ""probody"" technology. These therapeutics are activated by certain conditions in the tumor environment. The goal is to limit the toxicity to the affected tissue and improve or create a therapeutic window.""In simpler words, the intention is to develop a safer anti-CTLA-4 which delivers its effect at the tumor site and avoids the systemic tax elsewhere (which we see a ton of with Yervoy),"" Raffat said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Other team-ups have been particularly strong for the smaller biotechs involved. Incyte (INCY) is pairing up with Dow component Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb in a number of tumor trials. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of why Incyte might be the true winner.Bristol's main goal of the trial is to reduce the incidence of adverse/serious events. The firm hopes its drug will operate as a more effective monotherapy vs. Yervoy in improving objective response rate, median duration of response and progression-free survival.It will also combine the new CTLA-4 with Opdivo. Opdivo works similarly to Yervoy, but instead works to block the interaction between the immune system and the PD-1 proteins a tumor cell uses to hide. Opdivo rivals Merck's Keytruda.Raffat expects to see early results in 2018.""(The) focus will clearly be on whether the (toxicity) profile is materially better than Yervoy,"" he said. ""In addition, it will also be interesting to see if there is an improvement.""Bristol-Myers stock closed up 0.45% at 53.44 on the stock market today, and Cytomx stock jumped 5.8% to 16.14.RELATED:Step Aside, Merck And Bristol: These Are Your Future Rivals In Cancer DrugsBristol-Myers 'Holding Up Better' But Dow's Merck Still Gouging ShareCould Bristol's Drug Help Biogen Take AbbVie In Alzheimer's?

""There will be ups and downs, wins and losses, stuff like that.""JPMorgan and Citigroup beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, while Wells Fargo's EPS was above views. Trading results were strong for JPMorgan and Citigroup, helped in part by the outlook on interest rates.But JPMorgan's consumer and industrial loan growth was roughly flat quarter-to-quarter. Management said some of the slowdown might be due to past big acquisitions and because companies have other options, such as bonds, for financing.Citigroup also tempered its expectations for loan growth.

News that China deployed 150,000 troops to the border with North Korea seemed to spark the selling. The Trump administration is heightening its rhetoric against North Korea's nuclear program. But after noon ET, indexes started bouncing back.The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 also was up 0.2%. Volume was lower on the NYSE compared with the same time Friday, but higher on the Nasdaq.Steel, banking and fiber optics stocks were down the most.

460,UPS,"Yes, Friday is almost here.But first comes today's shipment of discouraging news about the nation's political situation 229 days out from the presidential election.It's an understandable, if dispiriting, national reality worsening in recent years as both parties moved farther apart on a strident partisan scale, and an incumbent president saw no political or fundraising benefit in bridging the divide. The gaping fractures exist within even the same party.For example:Nearly two-out-of-three registered voters say the nominee front-runners for either major political party are not honest or trustworthy -- 64% do not trust Democrat Hillary Clinton and 65% do not trust Donald Trump.Only 34% say Clinton is honest, a new low for her; only 32% see Trump as honest. And neither one is from Chicago. No, wait! Clinton was born there.Fully 54% of voters say they would definitely not ever vote for Trump.And 43% say they'd definitely never cast a ballot for Clinton. (Fox News Poll.)Nearly half of all voters (49%) and one-quarter of Republicans would feel ""scared"" if Trump walked into the Oval Office as commander-in-chief.One-third have that feeling about Clinton.As an explanation for the generally high ratings of this cycle's TV debates, especially for Republican talk-fests, 74% of all voters are ""very"" or extremely"" interested in the campaigns -- for Democrats it's 76%, for Republicans 80%.Interest runs especially strongly among very conservative, middle-aged Republican men and women with college degrees.Clinton and Trump easily stand atop their primary competitors, according to the new Quinnipiac University Poll. Trump earns 43% support to Ted Cruz' 29% and John Kasich's 16%.Clinton easily leads Bernie Sanders 50% to 38%.However, in hypothetical head-to-head November match-ups, there's dramatic change to believe in.Clinton trumps Trump 46% to 40%, contrary to the billionaire's frequent claims. She also tops Cruz, 45% to 42%.Sanders beats Trump by even more, 52% to 38%. Sanders also defeats Cruz, 50% to 39%.But -- Wait for it! -- little old, aw, shucks John Kasich beats Clinton 47% to 39%. Kasich even edges Sanders 45% to 44%. Standby for the immediate Kasich for America news release!But Ohioans shouldn't get too excited about the outlook for Kasich, who has only won the Ohio primary.That's because it is now mathematically impossible for the governor to reach the 1,237 delegate majority to cop the nomination in Cleveland come July.That's barring some kind of extraordinary deal which, of course, is what the governor is counting on. Kasich still holds fewer delegates than Marco Rubio had when he quit the GOP race after losing Florida to Trump.In an open-ended question, the Q-Poll asked voters for one word to describe how they feel about a Trump or Clinton presidency.""Scared"" was the most frequently offered word about a President Trump. Then came ""disaster,"" then ""frightened,"" then ""terrified"" and ""horrified."" The first good word mentioned was, well, ""good.""As for President Hillary Clinton, ""disaster"" was the word that came most frequently to voters' minds. Then followed ""good,"" ""scared,"" ""disappointed"" and, finally, ""hopeful.""Taken together, all of this makes us ""sad.""RELATED:

It's designed for things such as paying a friend back for a cab ride, or sharing a restaurant bill.The new feature Square announced Monday is called Cash Drawer, and allows anyone who has the Square Cash app -- sending or receiving money doesn't require the app, just email -- to store money and use it to pay people back at a later date.Square stock was up more than 3%, near 11, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The San Francisco-based firm had a strong first day after making its IPO, with its stock rising 45% that day and touching its still-record high of 14.78, after prices shares at 9. But the stock has mostly fallen since as many bigger companies compete in payments.The new feature makes Square Cash look a lot more like rival PayPal and its peer-to-peer payments subsidiary Venmo, which is popular among millennials. Both PayPal and Venmo already have the capability that Square added Monday.Square Cash is outside the company's core business, which is a set of digital cash registers and transaction processing, marketing and financial services, which it sells mostly to small businesses.Square CEO Jack Dorsey is also the top boss at microblog Twitter (TWTR).Visa (V) has a sizeable investment in Square.

465,UPS,"Election analysts at Cook Political Report see at least a narrow opening for Democrats to seize back control of the House with Donald Trump or Ted Cruz at the top of the ticket.The independent analysts just gave a boost to Democratic chances in 10 races, citing their assessment that either potential nominee would be ""extremely polarizing.""Here's the state of the battle for control: The GOP has a solid lock on 205 seats, Cook Political says. A dozen other seats are ""likely Republican,"" meaning the races aren't competitive now but could be close under certain circumstances -- in other words, a wave election, like that enjoyed by the GOP in 2014.Add it up and Republicans can now feel fairly comfortable about 217 seats -- one shy of a majority. Beyond that, another 13 races lean toward the GOP, but the competition is serious.Districts with large Hispanic populations would be harder to hold, and that may also hold true of ""high-education"" and ""high-income"" districts, wrote Cook Political analyst David Wasserman.The analysts shifted several races in California and Florida toward Democrats. One district in Iowa and one in New York shifted from the GOP column to toss-up.""So many assumptions have been wrong this cycle that it's difficult to be definitive about another: that the House majority won't be in play in 2016,"" Wasserman wrote.The GOP always was expected to face a tough battle to keep control of the Senate, since it has to defend six seats in states won by President Obama. With a 54-46 majority, Cook Political sees four GOP seats as toss-ups and three others as ""lean Republican."" Democrats have just one toss-up, the seat being vacated by Nevada Sen.

466,UPS,"Since 2007, Masimo (MASI) founder Joe Kiani’s employment contract included a combination of benefits that most chief executive officers can only dream of.The contract guaranteed him 300,000 stock options annually, and he could trade the options for full-value shares in some scenarios. He’d get a golden parachute if his company were bought, even if his employment wasn’t terminated, and the Irvine, Calif.-based medical-device maker would pay his taxes on that windfall.After three years of negotiations, Kiani finally relinquished those benefits in 2015, according to the company’s proxy statement, filed this week. After 2017, Kiani will no longer be entitled to the guaranteed grants of stock options. In return, Masimo awarded him $112 million in stock and $35 million in cash that it would pay out if it terminates his employment before 2018. The company also paid $1.4 million in legal fees that Kiani accrued during the negotiations.The removal of the rare perks from Kiani’s contract may placate investors who have rejected the company’s pay plans the last two times it’s held votes on them. For Kiani, the agreement assures a payout if any acquisition were to result in his termination.""It looks like he had good lawyers negotiating quite well for him,"" said Jeff Visithpanich, managing director of compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates.The new arrangement would shrink payouts to Kiani if Masimo is acquired, according to the company’s March 16 statement.“I am happy that we were able to reach a new agreement that we believe will save Masimo shareholders millions of dollars,” Kiani said on Thursday.In the last five years, investor support for Masimo’s pay practices has averaged 47%, even though Kiani controlled 13.7% of the medical device-maker’s shares as of March 7. Investors had “concerns regarding our CEO’s prior employment agreement,” the company said in its proxy dated March 16.Typically, investors are happy to leave compensation decisions to boards. The average support level for pay practices at companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is 92%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The combination of single-trigger vesting, tax gross-ups and highly dilutive option awards typically would not pass the say-on-pay vote,” Visithpanich said. “You can’t have multiple failing votes. At a certain point, the whole thing starts to blow up. They had to do something.”Since Kiani’s contract was renegotiated, Masimo said that it had reached out to 22 large investors representing 53% of shares. The new agreement removed many issues that had troubled them, the company said.“Under any number of somewhat reasonable change-in-control scenarios, this new agreement would save Masimo and Masimo shareholders at least $100 million,” Chief Financial Officer Mark de Raad said in a Wednesday phone interview.Masimo shares have lost 6.9% this year through Thursday, paring their 12-month gain to 22.2%.Craig Reynolds is the chairman of Masimo’s compensation committee, which negotiated with Kiani. Tom Harkin, the former U.S. senator from Iowa, and Sanford Fitch, who previously served as the CFO of recruiting firm Cruel World, also sit on the committee.Payout of the restricted stock grant isn’t probable, the company said. It will reduce both the stock award and the cash payment by 10% annually, beginning in 2018. The award wouldn’t pay out in event of death, disability or cause such as gross misconduct or violation of trade secrets, the document shows.Kiani’s pay totaled $119.2 million in 2015, according to the summary compensation table disclosed in Masimo’s proxy statement. It includes the $112 million stock grant but not the $35 million potential cash payout. Excluding the special awards, according to the table, Kiani’s compensation was $7.3 million. It includes the legal fees, $883,518 in salary, $3.82 million of stock options and a $1.05 million cash bonus.

467,UPS,"Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results early Thursday, but it continues to face declining sales overall and in key categories, and its guidance missed Wall Street estimates.Best Buy stock was up 2%, above 32, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, as investors cheered the announcement of a special cash dividend and higher quarterly dividend.Best Buy said it will pay a special dividend of 45 cents a share, or about $145 million, related to the net after-tax proceeds of certain legal settlements and asset disposals. The retailer also boosted its regular quarterly dividend by 22% to 28 cents a share.Plus, Best Buy announced a new $1 billion share-repurchase plan expected to be completed over the next two years.Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said the company aims to be a “premium dividend payer,” with a non-GAAP dividend payout ratio between 35% to 45%.In its fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, the Richfield, Minn.-based company earned $1.53 a share excluding items on sales of $13.62 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Best Buy to earn $1.39 a share on sales of $13.61 billion. On a year-over-year basis, EPS rose 3% and sales fell 4%.Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Best Buy's earnings per share fell 5% to $1.39.Best Buy's same-store sales slipped 1.8% in Q4. But the company's e-commerce sales jumped nearly 14% to $1.95 billion, accounting for 15.6% of total U.S. revenue. In its online sales segment, Best Buy competes with industry powerhouse Amazon.com (AMZN).

468,UPS,"Growth in health and wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by “significant declines” in mobile phones, tablets and digital cameras, Best Buy said in a press release.For the current quarter, Best Buy expects to earn 31 to 35 cents a share, vs. 37 cents a year earlier. The midpoint of 33 cents a share would represent a year-over-year decline of 11%. It sees sales falling 3% to $8.3 billion based on the midpoint of guidance.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were modeling for Best Buy to earn 38 cents a share on sales of $8.4 billion.Best Buy Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam said the retailer expects to see sales decline in the first half of the fiscal year, followed by growth in the back half. Best Buy is targeting flat domestic revenue for the full year. Appliances, home theater and connected home products are likely to be the top growth categories, she said.Best Buy said it will counter soft overall-sales growth in consumer electronics by focusing on market share gains and by making operational improvements to boost profits.On a conference call with analysts, Joly spoke about the product categories that will drive Best Buy sales. Household appliances, connected home products and large-screen ultra HD or 4K televisions are bright spots, he said.Virtual reality headsets are a new category that Best Buy is “very excited about,” Joly said.“This is an interesting category,” he said. “It will be small this year. It may help in the computing category with (sales of) higher-end computers because you’re going to need that computing power. But from a financial perspective, it’s going to be limited.”Three VR platforms are coming to market this year: Facebook’s (FB) Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation VR.

469,UPS,"SunEdison (SUNE) yield company TerraForm Power (TERP) slipped from Nasdaq compliance Wednesday, when SunEd's constrained finances forced the duo to miss a March 15 deadline to submit their already delayed 10-K year-end financial statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.In midday trading on the stock market today, SunEdison stock was down 6% and TerraForm Power stock down 5%. Shares were down a respective 59% and 16% for the year as of Tuesday's close.TerraForm Power now has until May 16 to either submit the 10-K or a plan to regain compliance, and until Sept. 12 to become compliant or face delisting. The SunEd yieldco blamed its parent for the holdup.""Due to our management services arrangement with SunEdison . . . our financial reporting and control processes rely to a significant extent on SunEdison systems and personnel,"" TerraForm Power said in a press release.If there are inefficiencies in SunEdison's reporting system ""it is necessary for us to assess whether those deficiencies could affect our financial reporting,"" TerraForm Power wrote. On Feb. 29, SunEdison delayed its 10-K as it finalizes an audit into its liquidity standing.Late last year, former SunEdison executives alleged the firm lied about its liquidity stance. SunEd shook up its executive staff in November 2015, terminating former Executive Vice President Carlos Domenech. At the time, Domenech was also CEO for TerraForm Power and another SunEd yieldco, TerraForm Global (GLBL).SunEdison Chief Financial Officer Brian Wuebbels was immediately tapped to head up the yieldcos. But Wuebbels recently opted to leave his SunEd role to focus entirely on the TerraForm pair. Ilan Daskal will succeed Wuebbels on April 4, SunEdison said.It's only the most recent in a series of SunEdison shake-ups.Last week, residential installer Vivint Solar (VSLR) backed out of a deal to be acquired by SunEdison, saying that, despite cutting its bid in December, SunEd still couldn't afford to buy it. This month, rumors rumbled that banks financing the M&A had pulled their funding after SunEdison first delayed its 10-K.On Wednesday, SunEdison blamed the twice-delayed 10-K on ""material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting,"" saying its newly implemented IT systems are deficient. But no material mistakes have been found in the audit thus far, SunEd said.

471,UPS,"UPS (UPS) has acquired a stake in same-day delivery startup called Deliv, shifting it into competition with e-tail giant Amazon.com (AMZN).Palo Alto-based Deliv delivers products from brick-and-mortar retailers to shoppers at their nearby homes -- attempting to figure out an efficient solution to the most expensive part of delivery: the last mile.The $28 million of announced funding brings Deliv's total haul to $40.5 million from funders such as Upfront Ventures, RPM Ventures and mall operators such as General Growth Properties (GGP) and Simon Property Group (SPG). The Wall Street Journal reported that its valuation was unavailable.Deliv has struck deals with Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google for its Express delivery service, among other clients including several startups.""Same-day is absolutely the new standard. That’s exactly what’s happening in the market. Look what Amazon is doing,"" Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli told IBD.As part of the funding arrangement, UPS will gain a seat on the Deliv board -- an opportunity to gather intelligence about a business and market it doesn't operate in.Currently UPS only offers same-day delivery for high-margin sectors such as health care. Next-day delivery is available for evening pickups -- customers generally place orders online in the evening when returning from work.“I struggle to understand what it is that I need in less than a few hours,” Rimas Kapeskas, head of UPS’s Strategic Enterprise Fund, told the Wall Street Journal. UPS is specifically interested in Deliv's software that connects it directly with a retailer's website.UPS and Amazon have an uneasy relationship. At the moment Amazon.com is UPS's largest customer but as the e-tailer's delivery costs continue to soar, the company has begun to seek alternatives and is widely rumored to be building its own freight operation.Amazon.com offers free two-day shipping and other perks via it's loyalty program Amazon Prime. The e-tailer offers same-day delivery service via its Prime Now app.On the company's Q4 earnings call, executives characterized the speedy delivery options as very difficult and expensive but said customers love it.To support its various shipping options Amazon has entered the ocean freight shipping business, is rumored to be flying several flights a day from an airfield in Ohio to locations near its fulfillment centers, has bought a fleet of truck trailers, and is leasing a number of Boeing 767 cargo aircraft.But, it's still unclear who is going to crack the code on same-day delivery. It's a complex and expensive business with low margins. Others, such as San Jose-based eBay (EBAY) tried to launch in the U.S. but ultimately ended the pilot program. CEO Devin Wenig said at the time the company had ""mixed results"" for the delivery service.

473,UPS,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
474,UPS,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

475,UPS,"There is a classic Latin epigram about double standards that resounds in the aftermath of the FBI's surrender this week to the corruptocracy:""Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi.""Translation: ""What is permissible for Jove is not permissible for an ox.""Jove is the Roman god Jupiter, untouchable ruler of the skies, wielder of the lightning bolt. The ox is a servile beast, sacrificial animal for elites in power, bearer of the heavy yoke.FBI Director James Comey told us Tuesday what many of us have already known and long suspected: Hillary Clinton serially lied about her homeland security-jeopardizing home-brew email server, and the Obama administration is letting her get away with it.After Comey hammered the final nail in the classified-information coffin, the enabler in chief promptly whisked Clinton out of D.C. on his taxpayer-subsidized winged chariot for a joint campaign event in North Carolina and plopped her in front of a lectern carrying the presidential seal -- where she stood and hurled her invective against GOP presidential rival Donald Trump, whom she called ""unqualified and temperamentally unfit"" to occupy the White House.Unqualified pot, meet unfit kettle.This is the smug sociopath who led a treacherous State Department team that lied to the public about the deadly Benghazi, Libya, terror attacks, who lied and continues to lie about her Clinton Foundation favor-trading money machine, and who lied repeatedly about compromising U.S. secrets.Clinton's campaign audaciously calls the systemic circumvention of transparency and security a ""mistake"" -- like when Grandma butt-dials you accidentally or your toddler tweets out his ""Fruit Ninja"" high score on your work phone.But this is what a bona fide mistake looks like: ""Oops.""A one-off. A slip-up. A goof.And this is what serial subversion of the law looks like:""Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops.

The same wide-open servers the FBI told us Monday were possibly hacked by ""hostile actors.""Speaking of hostile actors: Last week, as Clinton's slimy husband was yukking it up with Attorney General Loretta Lynch in advance of the Teflon prima donna's absolution, the Obama Pentagon announced that nine Navy officers had been punished after the humiliating ""capture"" of American sailors in Iranian waters in January.One commodore was relieved for cause; the others face disciplinary measures that could effectively end their careers. Extreme carelessness and gross negligence, to borrow the euphemisms du jour, led to a ridiculous chain of events culminating in lost sailors giving up sensitive ship data, laptop passwords, cellphone access and even their military IDs to armed Iranian forces.For demonstrating ""poor leadership and judgment,"" failing to maintain ""proper communication with higher authority"" and failing to show ""appreciation of the threat environment,"" the Navy screw-ups may well and should lose their jobs.For her shoddy leadership and dangerous lack of judgment, along with her utter indifference to the threat environment that her evasive actions pose to America, Hillary Clinton has the backing of Barack Obama to take his place at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.One standard for Jove, another for the ox. So it was in the fallen civilization of ancient Rome. So it is in corrupted America in 2016.

476,UPS,"""He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our People, and eat out their sustenance."" In the wake of Independence Day, these words from our Declaration of Independence could just as well have been said by Speaker Paul Ryan about President Obama, as our Founders said of King George.Indeed, in the just released report of Ryan's House Republican Task Force on Regulation -- ""A Better Way to Grow Our Economy"" -- Ryan's Republicans did say about regulation, especially regarding energy, what our Founders said: Our nation is being strangled by bureaucracy, especially today by the EPA and others ""policing"" the environment.America's proven energy reserves can make us the world's leading producer of oil, leading producer of natural gas and leading producer of coal.

And more than twice our national debt, which can be paid down with the resulting increased royalties and tax revenues.As the world's leading producer of energy, the U.S. would experience tidal waves of new, high-paying jobs and growth. Plentiful, low-cost, reliable energy is also key to restoring American manufacturing, which means millions of high-paying, blue collar jobs are at stake.The Democrats used to be the party of blue collar working people. But no more. Elitist Democrats are increasingly rallying around the left wing extremist slogan ""Leave it in the ground."" The Obama Administration from the president on down has embraced precisely that policy with religious fervor and extremism.The report of the Republican House Task Force on Regulation supports the opposite view. That report notes, ""With regard to global warming, H.R. 3880, the Stopping EPA Overreach Act, would repeal all climate change regulations under the Clean Air Act. Bills were also introduced to repeal specific global warming rules such as EPA's two rules under the Clean Power Plan targeting new and existing electric generating units.""Thousands of pages of objective, peer-reviewed science in the Heartland Institute's ""Climate Change Reconsidered II,"" drawing on the work of the best climate scientists in the world, demonstrate that we have no reason to impoverish America out of fear of ""Climate Change.""Carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by burning fossil fuels is not pollution, as global warming alarmists claim, but a natural substance essential to the survival of all life on the planet. Without sufficient CO2, plants would die, and without plants, there would be no food to support animal life.Increased atmospheric concentration of CO2 supports photosynthesis, which makes plants grow faster. That is why the only documented effect of increased CO2 is enhanced agricultural output, a veritable greening of the planet.Global temperatures do not follow the pattern of increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2. They follow the cyclical ups and downs of natural causes, as they have for thousands if not millions of years.U.S. satellites measuring global temperatures 24/7 show no increase for nearly 20 years now. During those years, mankind produced one-third of all CO2 emissions since the start of the industrial revolution in 1750, which made mankind so much richer and more prosperous.Soon that period of no global warming will be longer than the period of actual global warming, which lasted only 20 years, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s. Before that was 30 years of global cooling, which seems to be the next cycle already underway.Putting behind us bogus ""climate change"" claims that might interdict development of our energy resources, and unleashing our energy industries to produce massive job creation and rapid national economic growth, America will be on a new road to National Independence and World Leadership. That is the bottom line message of the Ryan/House Republican Task Force on Regulation report this Independence holiday.

477,UPS,"ESPN parent company Walt Disney (DIS) has agreed to purchase one-third of Major League Baseball's digital business and take a four-year option to increase its stake to two-thirds, sources told Bloomberg.The reported deal would provide the media giant with access to an online streaming platform at a time when Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and other web-based programming have eroded its subscriber base.MLB Advanced Media, which handles online services from digital ticketing to sponsorships to live streams, says on its website that it distributes ""25,000 live events annually and 10 million streams daily,"" and that it has the resources to support ""millions of multi-platform subscribers and processes."" Paid streaming subscription services like MLB.tv and the WWE Network are MLB Advanced Media partners.The transaction with Disney is said to value the MLB company at $3.5 billion or so.Disney CEO Bob Iger has frequently been put on the defensive in recent quarterly earnings calls since last year's media market maelstrom, spurred by concern over the health of the pay-TV environment.But Disney, which also owns Marvel, Lucasfilm and the TV network ABC, appears to be exploring its online options.In the company's May earnings call, Iger told listeners that streaming service Hulu -- which it jointly owns with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal -- was an ""important investment"" and that Hulu's newly announced live-TV package was a ""best of cable approach"" between a skinny bundle and mega-cable package.ESPN has been bleeding subscribers, but its inclusion in streaming bundles -- such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and others -- could be linked to some ""very encouraging sign-ups,"" Iger said in May. Prior to that, he alluded in February to partnering ESPN with ""new platform providers.""Disney shares were up 0.2% on the stock market today. Netflix shares surged 5.7% on bullish analyst comments. Fox added 0.8%, and Comcast edged up 0.1%.

478,UPS,"An ambitious plan by Amazon (AMZN) to procure a fleet of 40 airline freighters and lessen its dependence on FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS) could lead to $440 million in savings, says Pacific Crest Securities, which raised its price target on the e-commerce leader.“We estimate Amazon can save an average of $5.82 per shipment,” wrote Pacific Crest analyst Edward Yruma in a research note. ""On an annualized basis, and assuming 40 planes, this could drive $440 million in savings,” wrote Yruma, who raised his price target on Amazon stock to 820 from 800.Amazon stock closed Thursday at 717.51, up a fraction. Amazon hit a high of 722.45 on May 12 and is an IBD Leaderboard stock.Yruma said that Amazon is one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology today and that it will take further market share and benefit as e-commerce continues to grow.Amazon previously announced it is leasing 20 Boeing 767 converted cargo planes from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) and another 20 from Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW).The agreement with Air Transport Services includes the opportunity for Amazon to purchase up to 19.9% of company shares over the next five years. The agreement with Atlas Air includes the opportunity to purchase up to 20% of its shares over the next five years.Yruma said Pacific Crest had ""pinpointed seven active airliners that are already in service and mapped out the 'Air Amazon' route structure.""Amazon plans to have all 40 cargo airliners fully operational by 2018, which will enable it to bring as much as 30% of its current delivery volume in-house, according to a research report by Moody’s Investors Service analyst Jonathan Root. The report said Amazon’s fleet would be 21% the size of UPS’ and 14% the size of FedEx's. In terms of payload capacity, Amazon’s fleet would be 26% the size of UPS’ and 17% of FedEx’s, excluding their largest freighters that fly mostly long-haul routes for those companies, Root wrote.

479,UPS,"Wal-Mart (WMT) wants you to know that it, too, has speedy two-day shipping. The big-box retailer is offering a 30-day trial membership of its Amazon (AMZN) Prime-style ShippingPass in a likely bid for consumer dollars ahead of the e-commerce giant's second expected ""Prime Day.""Piloted last year, ShippingPass costs $49 annually, which -- Wal-Mart makes sure to point out in its release -- is ""about half the price of similar programs out there."" Amazon Prime membership costs $99 a year, but that also includes access to its library of movies and programming.The timing likely isn't coincidental. Amazon is expected to host another Prime Day, a one-day shopping event that echoes Black Friday or Cyber Monday, though a date hasn't yet been confirmed. (Last year's first-ever Prime Day took place on July 15.)Wal-Mart's ShippingPass previously shipped orders out to customers in three days, but in May the company began testing a two-day timeline more comparable to Prime.Meanwhile, more terms have emerged from the mega-retailer's deal with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (JD), a little more than a week after Wal-Mart said it had acquired a 5% stake in JD.com in exchange for its Yihoadian marketplace. JD.com is the No. 2 e-commerce retailer in China; Alibaba (BABA) is the largest.Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Wal-Mart could also nab the rights to become a board observer at JD.com if it ups its stake to 10%.Wal-Mart shares rose 1.3% to 72.46 in the stock market today, its best close since August 2015. Amazon stock rose 1.1%, JD.com added 0.3% and Alibaba rallied 2.3%.RELATED:Wal-Mart Sells China E-Commerce Unit To JD.com, Takes 5% Stake

480,UPS,"Amazon.com (AMZN) will invest $3 billion in India this year, on top of a previous $2 billion investment, as it looks to challenge local e-commerce players such as Flipkart and Snapdeal and expand its international sales overall.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced the investment in Washington on Tuesday at a business event attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""We have already created some 45,000 jobs in India and continue to see huge potential in the Indian economy,"" Bezos said at the event, as reported by CNN. He said Amazon continues to see “huge potential” in India, surpassing the company’s most ambitious goals.Regulations in India prevent foreign retailers from selling directly to customers, requiring Amazon to operate as an online marketplace for third-party vendors. Amazon is also opening numerous small distribution centers around India to handle local deliveries itself. In the U.S., it is more reliant on the FedEx (FDX), UPS (UPS) and the U.S. Postal Service.Amazon's investment in India comes as it looks to boost growth in international markets. Sales overseas rose 5.6% to $35.4 billion in 2015, compared with North American sales growth of 25%, to $63.7 billion. Amazon reported an operating profit in North America of $2.75 billion but an operating loss of $91 million internationally.Amazon stock rose a fraction, to 726.64, in the stock market today.The IBD Leaderboard stock, which touched an all-time high of 731.50 on Monday, is within buy range from a 722.55 buy point out of a three-weeks-tight pattern.

481,UPS,"The U.K.'s surprising and historic decision to leave the European Union overshadowed all other news this week, roiling global markets and raising doubts about the European economy and post-war order.But it was a busy week for business news. In a well-timed release, the Federal Reserve said JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other giant banks passed their ""stress test"" scenarios. Elon Musk's bid to merge Tesla Motors (TSLA) and SolarCity (SCTY) raised doubts, even among long-time devotees. Wal-Mart (WMT) and JD.com (JD) teamed up. Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT) and FedEx (FDX) gave weak guidance, and the Federal Aviation Administration finalized drone regulations.Gloom overtook world markets after Britons voted to leave the EU amid a wave of nationalist sentiment. The vote will begin a long process of negotiations to determine what parts of the existing business landscape will stay or go for a range of industries that operate in the region. JPMorgan Chase, American Airlines (AAL) and their global peers were hit hard. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said he would step down, while right-wing populists elsewhere on the Continent called for similar referendums in their nations, potentially expanding financial and cultural fissures within the bloc. The Federal Reserve said it is ""prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary,"" but questions remained about how much left was in its arsenal to ward off any coming market turmoil.U.S. stocks had rallied through Thursday, in large part because polls got it wrong and predicted that the U.K. would stay in the EU. Stocks suffered huge losses Friday after the Brexit results pushing the major averages into the red. The Nasdaq lost 1.9% for the week while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials closed off 1.6%. European markets suffered deeper losses. Big losers included carriers such American Air, while Tesla Motors tumbled on its ill-received SolarCity bid. Treasury yields hit four-year lows. The dollar skyrocketed vs. the pound but tumbled vs. the yen.Tesla made a surprise offer to buy solar energy company SolarCity in a stock swap valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman of SolarCity, which is run by Musk's cousins.Analyst reviews of the deal hit a negative tone, calling it a fundamental change to Tesla's business model that could thwart its aggressive efforts to expand production of its all-electric vehicles and add to cash flow and financing concerns. Tesla shares tumbled 10.45% on Wednesday, its worst one-day loss since May 2014. Tesla  fell 10.4% for the week. SolarCity initially spiked on the deal, but closed up just 4.1% as investors doubt a deal will happen. Musk, the top shareholder of both companies, said he won't vote on any merger agreement.The Federal Reserve passed all 33 banks -- including majors JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) -- in the first round of its annual stress tests, as expected. Investors will now focus on the second round of results, set for release Wednesday, that will determine whether banks can carry out their submitted plans to return capital to shareholders. But just because banks can weather a storm doesn't mean it will be fun: Bank stocks were among the biggest losers Friday on the Brexit fallout, erasing gains from earlier in the week.Adobe reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share on in-line sales for its fiscal second quarter ended June 3, but investors focused on its disappointing sales guidance for Q3.The maker of digital media and marketing software earned 71 cents a share excluding items, 3 cents above views, on sales of $1.4 billion. It was Adobe's fourth straight quarter of 20% or greater sales growth and its seventh straight quarter of double-digit gains in adjusted EPS.For the current quarter, Adobe is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 72 cents on sales of $1.445 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. Analysts had been modeling 71 cents, up 31%, on sales of $1.47 billion, up 21%.Adobe shares were down 3.55% for the week, undercutting a buy area.Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) announced a deal to buy an 84% stake in mobile video game company Supercell for $8.6 billion. The transaction values the Finnish game developer at $10.2 billion.Helsinki-based Supercell makes free-to-play mobile games such as ""Clash of Clans"" and ""Clash Royale."" It makes money by selling virtual goods that help players advance in its games. Supercell's games are played by more than 100 million people each day.Tencent is a leader in online games. It owns ""League of Legends"" maker Riot Games and distributes games in China for Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and others.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced an alliance with China's JD.com (JD), with JD taking ownership of Wal-Mart's Yihaodian marketplace, its China e-commerce business, in return for an approximate 5% stake in JD.com in the form of newly issued shares. The move may help both Wal-Mart and JD compete against Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA).JD.com is the second-largest online retailer in China after Alibaba. Wal-Mart has struggled to build its China business.Wal-Mart rose 1.4%, hitting a 10-month high. JD closed up 2.5% for the week.Twitter (TWTR) expanded its push into machine learning with the acquisition of Magic Pony Technology, a London-based startup that specializes in visual processing.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the price tag was reported to be $150 million.Magic Pony's technology ranges across computer vision, machine learning, high-performance computing and computational neuroscience.Also, Twitter gave its users more room to unleash their creativity, expanding the length of its video play to 140 seconds from 30, as it battles for viewers with the likes of Facebook (FB) photo and video sharing site Instagram, which has now grown to 500 million subscribers.The Twitter change is designed to help video creators boost their audiences and make money in the process.Existing-home sales rose 1.8% in May to an annual rate of 5.53 million, the highest in nine years, the National Association of Realtors said. But new-home sales fell 6% to 551,000, the Commerce Department said. April new-home sales were revised down sharply to 586,000 from the initial reading of 619,000. Tight supply has limited purchases of new dwellings. But homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Meanwhile, new jobless claims fell 18,000 in the week ended June 18 to 259,000, the Labor Department said. That was a bigger drop than expected, and put the total back near a 43-year low set in March. It's a good sign for the June employment report after May's surprisingly weak payrolls gain.The Transportation Department and FAA finalized regulations for the commercial use of drones, which officials say could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. The rules are seen as less restrictive than expected. Under the new regulations, the unmanned aircraft must be kept within the pilot's line of sight and cannot be operated at night, but those restrictions could be lifted under a waiver. Among the publicly traded companies impacted by the new rules are Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart, GoPro (GPRO) and AeroVironment (AVAV).Red Hat reported fiscal Q1 revenue and billings slightly above views, as well as in-line earnings. But it forecast full-year profit that was a bit light, citing a new planned acquisition. Some analysts said larger enterprise deals were a bright spot. The open-source Linux software company increased a stock buyback program to $1 billion from its earlier $500 million authorization. Red Hat is expected to update its public cloud strategy at an investor day slated for June 30.Red Hat stock tumbled 4.8% for the week, falling below a recent buy point.FedEx reported strong fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue growth, both topping analyst estimates. But the company forecast adjusted EPS of $11.75-$12.25 for the current fiscal year. The midpoint of $12 was below consensus of $12.05. FedEx also didn't say how its recently acquired European shipper TNT Express would affect results. Shares fell 4.5% on Wednesday, a day after it issued Q4 results. Shares are off 7.2% this week, undercutting the 200-day line.The No. 2 U.S. package shipper plans to spend about $5.1 billion this year for ongoing expansion of the FedEx Ground network, as well as for planned aircraft purchases to support the FedEx Express fleet modernization program. Rival and No. 1 shipper UPS (UPS) crept out to a 17-month high on Thursday before tumbling Friday to fall less 1% for the week amid the Brexit turmoil on the market.

482,UPS,"As usual, everyone's talking about the rumored new iPhone. The wrinkle? They're not talking about the very next model, the iPhone 7 due out in September, but instead are looking out a distant 15 months or so ahead -- a lifetime in the tech world -- at the following iPhone.Next year's iPhone 8 is shaping up to be the most exciting smartphone release from Apple (AAPL) since the original iPhone in 2007.And for Apple that's good -- and bad.The buzz around the 2017 model iPhone is so great that it threatens to put a damper on sales of this year's model, analysts say. The iPhone 8 has been written about extensively in the tech and mainstream media, with journalists and analysts getting their information from leaks in the supply chain.""As more and more is written about the iPhone 8, the average consumer will start to become aware of what's coming from Apple,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Mike Walkley told IBD.People who have paid off their current iPhones ""might wait one more year for what they think is going to be a bigger release,"" timed with the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone, Walkley said. ""Certainly everything in the supply chain points to next year having a much more differentiated device than this next one.""Apple observers expect the iPhone 7 will be a relatively minor upgrade to the current iPhone 6S series handsets. The 7 is expected to be thinner, faster and have a better camera, but nothing too earthshaking is seen. It will look pretty much like any iPhone from the past couple of years.By contrast, the iPhone 8 could sport a radical redesign thanks to its use of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen, instead of the current LCD screen.The iPhone 8 could make Apple's smartphone sexy again and prompt long lines to form outside Apple retail stores, like in the good old days.But rumors about the 8, which will be the 11th-generation iPhone, could inspire people to extend the life of their existing handsets and wait to upgrade, Wall Street analysts say. That could lead to soft sales of this fall's 10th-generation handset, the iPhone 7. And those soft sales would be on top of weaker-than-expected sales of the current iPhone 6S.One huge factor could alleviate much of this concern, though -- the way service providers are altering their business models.Apple and its carrier partners such as AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) probably will use the iPhone 7 launch to promote upgrade plans that let customers get new iPhones every year, says Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies and a longtime Apple watcher.""More and more people are going to move to that, because everybody knows that Apple does a better phone every year,"" he said.Most of the excitement over the iPhone 8 concerns its rumored use of an edgeless OLED screen. OLED displays boast richer colors, deeper blacks and a faster refresh rate than LCD screens. Since OLED screens don't have a backlight, they can be much thinner and more power efficient. Plus, OLED displays are flexible, allowing them to be used on curved screens.Mock-ups of possible iPhone 8 designs circulated by tech enthusiast websites illustrate dramatic new form factors for the device. From iPhones with secondary screens along their sides to all-glass handsets in which the display covers the entire surface of the phone, front and back.For years, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has expressed a desire for the iPhone to appear like a single sheet of glass, the Wall Street Journal reported recently.But don't put a lot of stock into those artists' conceptions of the iPhone 8, Bajarin says.""The kinds of designs you're seeing now are more pie-in-the-sky than reality,"" he said.The iPhone 8 could be so fresh-looking that it could cause new-model envy among current iPhone users, something that hasn't happened since Apple moved to larger screen sizes in 2014.One big question is whether Apple will limit the OLED-screen iPhone 8 to a premium model and keep selling LCD models as well.Another is whether any use of a curved display or wraparound screen will be truly useful or perceived as a gimmick.Apple's OLED iPhone wouldn't be the first such smartphone on the market. Samsung already uses OLED displays in its flagship Galaxy smartphones. Samsung itself, in fact, is the top maker of OLED displays, including for its TV sets, and Apple likely would have to buy its OLED screens from Samsung until other vendors could ramp up production.Sharp, Japan Display, Joled, AU Optronics (AUO) and LG Display (LPL) all plan to add either pilot or production capacity for OLED screens in 2017 or 2018. Plus, at least five Chinese companies are preparing OLED production lines.Apple enthusiasts, however, will think the OLED iPhone is a ""big deal,"" even though Samsung and others already use them, says Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates and another longtime Apple watcher.Roughly 10% of smartphones use OLED displays today, and that figure could reach 100% after 2020, Goldman Sachs said in a May 23 research report.But the OLED screen could be just one selling point of the iPhone 8. Another major change is that next year's iPhone could feature wireless charging, according to media reports. Instead of plugging in a power cord, users would place the device on a charging mat. Again, Samsung and some others, such as Motorola, already offer such a feature, but it would be another big change for the iPhone.In addition, Apple also could eliminate the physical home button with the iPhone 8. That functionality would be incorporated into the pressure-sensitive touch screen. Removing the home button would allow the display to cover more of the iPhone's front panel.For the iPhone 7, Apple is expected to eliminate the audio jack, forcing users to switch to a Bluetooth headset or a Lightning-connected headset. A rumor circulating at the Computex Taipei 2016 trade show claims that, with the iPhone 7, Apple plans to bundle a Lightning adapter with its standard EarPods headphones.With the removal of the audio jack in the iPhone 7 and wireless charging in the iPhone 8, Apple could then offer a smartphone with no holes to plug in chargers and cables. The device could be completely wire free and rely on the internet cloud for data backup.Apple shares fell 2.8% on the stock market today as Brexit fears hit worldwide.

483,UPS,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 with the largest amount spent on stock buybacks in the first quarter, which in total set a nine-year high as companies sought to boost their stock price in a slumping market, according to the S&P Dow Jones Indices.Gilead spent $8 billion, up from the $3.1 billion it spent in the prior quarter. Apple spent $6.7 billion, slightly down from its prior quarter's $6.9 billion.Companies in the S&P 500 spent a total of $161.4 billion in stock buybacks in Q1, up 12% from Q1 2015. It was the second-largest expenditure on record, following the $172 billion spent in Q3 2007, as reported by the S&P Dow Jones Indices.The information technology sector continued to dominate buybacks. Following Apple in the IT sector were Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Microsoft spent $3.85 billion, with Oracle at $2.2 billion and Alphabet at $2 billion.Following Gilead and Apple as the biggest spenders, General Electric (GE) was No. 3 at $6.3 billion, then came Pfizer (PFE) at $5 billion and McDonalds (MCD) at $4.3 billion. Microsoft was No. 6 overall.For the ninth consecutive quarter, more than 20% of the S&P 500 companies reduced their year-over-year diluted share count by at least 4%, thereby boosting their earnings per share by at least 4%.""The pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn of the year, which coincidentally started in early February when many earnings lock-ups ended,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a statement announcing the Q1 tally.""The upswing in both expenditures and participation appears to persist in the market, meaning that the upturn in Q4 was not a single-shot,"" he saidAccording to Silverblatt, cash reserves set a record, increasing 1.6% to $1.347 trillion. That topped the prior record $1.333 trillion set at the end of 2014. Silverblatt adds that the current cash level is 86 weeks of expected 2016 operating income, giving corporations leeway in their expenditures.Among the two buyback leaders, Apple stock rose 3% in Q1, ending the quarter at 108.99, Apple stock was down a fraction to 95.55 at the close on the stock market today.Gilead shrank 9% in Q1, ending the quarter at 91.86.

484,UPS,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Chief Executive Mary Dillon made clear Tuesday that while prestige brands are enjoying a period of growth, the specialty beauty retailer has no intention of straying from the high- and low-end assortment of cosmetics, skin care and hair care products that has made it so popular.When asked at Oppenheimer's 16th Annual Global Consumer Conference about potentially adding more prestige brands to stores, Dillon replied, ""One might ask, 'Why would we do that?' """"We really believe the magic of our proposition is we're not going to be shifting and becoming so predominantly prestige,"" she said, emphasizing the strength of Ulta's curated mix of prestige and mass brands.While not explicitly naming Sephora, Dillon said that Ulta might add slightly more prestige products, but it is ""important to know that we won't ever dramatically continue to shift"" Ulta's product mix toward a more heavily high-end assortment. LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora, Ulta's main competitor in the specialty beauty space, does not carry mass brands like Revlon or L'Oreal.The company also touched on its real estate strategy, with Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten telling investors that a ""theoretical perfect co-tenant mix"" largely includes off-pricers like TJX's (TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx and shoe seller DSW (DSW).""We love to be near Target (TGT) stores, historically, but we've seen our stores in all types of different environments,"" he said.The sluggishness of the broader retail space hasn't extended its tendrils to buyers of cosmetics and beauty products, and Ulta's e-commerce numbers are hopping. First-quarter e-commerce sales alone grew 38.8%, and overall same-store sales rose 15.2%, year over year.""(E-commerce) is clearly very fast-growing for us, (a) small percentage of our business today,"" said Dillon.

486,UPS,"We Americans have a confused and contradictory relationship with vacation. In theory, we love it; in practice, we often dread it. So much expectation is heaped on a few weeks of free time that disappointment, if not inevitable, is common. Worse, our escape from the job and daily routine fills us with anxiety that, somehow, this interlude will inflict a gruesome revenge once we return to work.Nevertheless, we go forth.We hustle to beaches, mountains, national parks, theme parks, unfamiliar cities or (best yet!) the backyard. The democratization of recreation is one of the 20th century's quiet upheavals. Leisure travel spending in 2015 totaled nearly $651 billion and involved 1.7 billion person-trips, says the U.S. Travel Association.In the 19th century, only the rich could abandon sweltering cities for cooler resorts: Saratoga, N.Y.; Newport, R.I.; Cape May, N.J.But some of us have trouble letting go. Millions of Americans aren't taking all the vacation time they've earned -- and that's a commentary on America's new work culture.Here are the numbers. Among full-time American workers, about 90% receive some paid vacation, says the Labor Department. From 1978 to around 2000, these workers earned -- and took -- an average of 20 days a year of vacation, according to studies done by a travel industry group called Project Time Off. In 2015, full-time workers actually earned almost 22 days of vacation but took only 16. About half of workers leave some vacation days unused.This amounts to 658 million unused days, worth about $223 billion in spending, the study says. Naturally, the travel industry tends to describe this as a crisis. It would prefer to see all that money going into the coffers of airlines, restaurants, theme parks and other tourism businesses.It regards people who don't use all their vacation time as slightly deranged or worse. The industry's term for employees who don't exhaust their vacation days is ""work martyr.""You might think that this allergy to pleasure reflects the unsteady state of the U.S. labor market. People don't spend too much time away from the office for fear that their jobs will have disappeared when they return. There may be something to this. After all, the gap between vacation-earned and vacation-taken first appeared around 2000, just as the tech boom was ending, and has gotten worse ever since.Some survey data are consistent with this view. When asked why they don't take more vacation, respondents to the Project Time Off study cited the following: fear of returning to a ""mountain of work"" (37%); a belief that ""no one else can do the job"" (30%); a decision that ""I cannot financially afford a vacation"" (30%).But if the business cycle's ups and downs mainly caused these anxieties, then the economy's recovery (today's unemployment rate: 4.7%) should have reversed them. It should encourage workers to use more of their vacation time. It hasn't.What truly unnerves workers, argues study author Katie Denis, is growing Internet ""connectivity,"" from email to smartphones. The boundaries between work and home have blurred; the office is ""omnipresent,"" she says.There is a new work culture. Americans increasingly check email on vacation or limit their time away from the office. Interestingly, these attitudes are strongest among millennials (born 1981 to 1997) and, says Denis, disprove the common notion that younger Americans are ""slackers"" who feel entitled to jobs. To the contrary, she cites figures -- destined for a future report -- showing why millennials are more fearful than most others of taking longer vacations:Probably most Europeans regard Americans' obsession with work as lunacy. In Europe, vacations are a right. Countries in the European Union must provide at least a month. In 2014, average French employees worked one-fifth fewer hours than their American counterparts, reports the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.In some ways, the European system is superior to ours, and in other ways it isn't. Encumbered by regulations, their labor markets are not especially flexible, and long-term unemployment, especially among the young, is a persistent problem. Americans' focus on work reflects ambition, insecurity and personal identity.These old values survive and infuse the new work culture. It's worth remembering that our disregard of vacations also affirms that the American work ethic -- often declared dead -- endures.

490,UPS,"In 1981, Toro Co. (TTC) flirted with the prospect of bankruptcy. Thirty-five years later, it’s reporting record results.It's safe to say the Bloomington, Minn.-based maker of lawnmowers, snow blowers and other outdoor equipment -- a mainstay in superstore retailers like Home Depot (HD) -- has persevered. Founded in 1914, Toro has been through two world wars, the Great Depression and countless recessions.But it was the company's rebound from near death to surging growth that provides a case study in sustained innovation.""It was unleashing the power of our people to understand we needed to innovate and drive performance,"" Mike Hoffman, Toro’s chairman and chief executive, told IBD.Hoffman, 61, joined Toro during a heady period. In the 1970s, the company grew from $200 million to $400 million in sales.""We were flying high,"" he recalled. ""It was an exciting time.""By the second half of 1980, though, years of steady expansion dissolved into a crisis. Though it already survived a number of economic downturns, Toro was hit hard by the recession that ushered in the Ronald Reagan administration. At the time, it was reported that the company made a series of missteps and was stuck with large inventories due to lack of rain and snow.Instead of declaring bankruptcy, Toro began retrenching and cut production. It also drastically reduced its employee ranks, trimming staff by more than half and eliminating virtually all management positions.The company turned to Ken Melrose as its new CEO, and he initiated a concept called ""servant leadership."" Melrose determined that rank-and-file employees were the real strength of Toro, so he kept stock options for higher-ups to a minimum and gave all workers a share as a symbolic act. From there, he created a 401(k) that rewarded employees annually with new shares of stock. Names on employee badges were followed by the word ""Owner.""""If we did have to cut wages and salaries, we started with the officers, and then the management (e.g., no bonuses first, then salary reductions, and so forth),"" Melrose would later say. ""Our plan was to protect the lower-paid employees as long as we could.""The strategy worked, said Hoffman, who joined the company in 1977 as a 22-year-old service representative and took over for Melrose as CEO in 2005. He has kept Melrose's corporate philosophy intact to this day.Toro now commands more than $2.4 billion in annual sales and has roughly 6,000 employees. In addition to commanding shelf space at Home Depot, Toro has a presence in 90 countries, making irrigation and outdoor lighting gear in addition to lawnmowers and snow blowers. Toro also makes professional gear for golf courses and sports fields.For Hoffman, employee engagement and innovation go hand in hand. With his strong technical background, Hoffman thrives on finding fixes to thorny problems. He asks his assistant to schedule ""MBWA time,"" or ""managing by wandering around."" He likes to chat with employees at all levels.When he visits with engineers or technicians, he often asks what they're working on and encourages them to share problems that they’re trying to solve. In some cases, he’ll roll up his sleeves and explore solutions with them.""Sometimes, there’s more than one right answer,"" he said. ""There are alternative ways to solve a problem.""Toro also has grown largely through a series of internal initiatives that often span three years, though not always.""Prior to each initiative that we’ve launched, we’ve engaged employees to get input,"" Hoffman said. ""We pick a group of people across the enterprise and ask, 'What should we consider next?' and 'What learning needs to happen?'""The first was a three-year program called ""Five-By-Five"" from 2001-03 designed to get after-tax profits up to 5%. Then there was ""Six Plus Eight,"" geared to up profits to 6% and boost revenue growth by 8%, from 2004-06.The one program that didn't accomplish its goals, ""Grow Lean,"" ran from 2007 to 2009, through the heart of the recession. That was followed by a one-year plan, ""Five In One,"" designed to restore profits to 5%. The focus shifted in 2011 to a four-year plan, ""Destination 2014,"" to boost organic revenue growth and operational earnings. Toro's current three-year program, ""Destination Prime,"" has similar goals and began in 2015.""They’ve set these three-year specific targets for employees on where they expect their business to be,"" said Jim Barrett, managing director at C.L. King & Associates in New York City. ""By and large, they’ve met those targets.""How? Toro employees test ideas to improve product quality and solve customers’ problems. In 2008, for example, customers sought to conserve water. So Toro rolled out its Precision Series spray nozzles that cut overall water use by as much as 30%.Two years later, the push to reduce emissions and boost energy efficiency led the company to introduce the industry’s first push mower powered by a lithium-ion battery for golf greens called the Toro Greensmaster eFlex.""Toro has a history of innovation,"" said Barrett, who has followed the company since 2008. ""In areas such as golf (course) irrigation and turf maintenance, they continue to innovate to reduce customers’ labor expense or improve their overall efficiency.""Shares now are near an all-time high, and ended trading down slightly to 86 on Monday. Shares fell as much as 4% on a rating downgrade to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" from Sidoti on Friday, falling below their 50-day moving average, but close to their high. But the company remains tops in its industry in terms of stock performance and getting a 93 composite rating out of a possible 99 by IBD.Despite that, Barrett lauds Toro’s commitment to frugality and controlling costs.""In 2009, Toro was the only company that I follow to take a management pay cut,"" Barrett said. ""They didn’t have to do it. No one made them. But its leaders sent a signal to employees that management was tightening its belt.""In Toro’s biggest businesses such as commercial landscaping and golf course maintenance, the company has established strong customer loyalty. And demographic trends bode well for its future.""An aging population means more people are outsourcing lawn mowing,"" Barrett said. ""Commercial landscaping is a much healthier segment growth-wise than golf.""He adds that as long as landscaping crews continue to mow lawns and maintain golf courses, their machines will run hard and wear down over time. That’s good news for Toro.""If Toro has a better mousetrap to offer, the temptation to invest in a new machine with new features will be stronger than fixing the broken one,"" he said.

491,UPS,"It’s an ambitious plan by Amazon (AMZN), to procure a fleet of 40 airline freighters and lessen its dependence on FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS).The 40 aircraft that Amazon plans to have fully operational by 2018 will enable it to bring as much as 30% of its current delivery volume in-house, according to a research report Monday by Moody’s Investors Service analyst Jonathan Root.In terms of short- and medium-haul aircraft, Amazon's fleet would be 21% the size of UPS' and 14% the size of FedEx's, says Root. In terms of payload capacity, Amazon’s fleet would be 26% the size of UPS’ and 17% of FedEx’s, excluding their largest freighters that fly mostly long-haul routes for those companies, Root wrote.“As significant as that sounds, the business that UPS and FedEx will lose may not be as bad as it sounds,” Root wrote. “Revenue and average daily volumes at UPS and FedEx will be hurt, but there’s plenty of opportunity for them to replace that lost business with growing volumes from higher-yielding customers” and growth in e-commerce.Root also says that Amazon is one of the least profitable customers for UPS and FedEx, because Amazon's size enables it to negotiate considerable discounts.“The extent to which UPS and FedEx can offset volume declines from Amazon with new business from other customers will determine how beneficial or detrimental Amazon's plan will be to the companies' segment operating margins,” Root wrote.Amazon stock was down 0.9%, to 696.75 in the stock market today, after touching a record high above 722 on May 12. It's an IBD Leaderboard stock. UPS stock was down 0.4% to 101.09, while FedEx ticked up a fraction to 162.04.The threat would grow if other large retailers follow Amazon’s lead, which he says is possible.“We understand that Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is investing to improve its e-commerce positioning by building eight e-commerce warehouses,” Root wrote.Wal-Mart already offers free shipping on orders of more than $50, and it might broadly offer an e-commerce membership that includes free shipping, as Amazon does with its Amazon Prime membership service.Still, it's not clear how deeply Amazon will dive into transportation services.“We estimate that Amazon could build a competing U.S. ground network for between $8 billion and $15 billion,"" Root wrote. ""We believe the company has the financial capacity to continue adding fulfillment centers, pickup locations and local and regional delivery operations, it if chooses to do so.”More than that, Amazon could offer its delivery services to the many third-party sellers on its site.“Such an offering would be more problematic for UPS’ and FedEx’s longer-term financial performance,” Root wrote.

492,UPS,"Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google are gobbling up companies with a Pac-Man-like ferocity, evoking comparisons to the conglomerates of 50 years ago -- and Apple (AAPL) could join them. Should you worry?Consider: Facebook snapped up shopping search engine TheFind this spring and virtual reality startups Pebbles Interfaces and Surreal Vision last year, building on the social networking leader's 2014 purchase of Oculus VR. E-commerce giant Amazon nabbed cloud computing startups Amiato, 2lemetry, Elemental Technologies and Italy’s Nice, as well as chipmaker Annapurna Labs, which brought it new data center technology. Google and its parent Alphabet acquired at least 15 small companies last year, many with mobile technologies.Conglomerates of the 1960s and '70s such as IT&T overreached. By the 1980s, many were dismantled. Some tech pundits fret that Google, Amazon and Facebook could stray too far from their core businesses as well.But the digital-age conglomerate is a different animal than the classic conglomerate. Gulf & Western and others like it cobbled together diverse, mature businesses that churned out free cash flow. Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook are focused on innovation. For them, there's risk in missing out on the next big thing.While stumbles are possible, smart deal-making -- or maybe just placing enough bets for some to hit the jackpot -- could pave the way for continued growth and share appreciation for years to come. By this reasoning, some analysts say, Apple may not be diversified enough as the smartphone market matures and could become a more ravenous acquirer itself.“In a world where innovation is coming regularly, where you don’t know what’s coming next or what might eat your lunch, it may make sense to be diversified or make some crazy bets and hope that some are going to pay off,” said Gerald Davis, a University of Michigan management professor and co-author of “The Decline and Fall of the Conglomerate Firm.”Unlike the classic conglomerate, new-age digital ones are often looking for synergies with a core business. “Something that looks like a conglomerate on the surface might be a lot more coherent underneath,” said Davis.Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, augmented reality and the Internet of Things are some of the most sought-after technologies.Facebook’s 10-year plan includes artificial intelligence and drone-delivered internet service, as well as virtual and augmented reality. While virtual reality immerses a user in an imagined or replicated world (like video games), augmented reality overlays digital imagery onto the real world.The company looks to leverage its social networking platform by pushing into live video and e-commerce. It's been buying mobile software startups and app developers.Facebook made a big bet with its $21.8 billion purchase of mobile messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. The jury is still out on whether that investment will pay off. But Facebook's $715 million purchase of Instagram in 2012 is widely acknowledged as a winner. The photo- and video-sharing site now has 400 million users and 200,000 advertisers. The site boosts Facebook's engagement with young consumers, creating opportunities to advertise to them.Amazon, once mostly an online bookseller and now an e-commerce giant, has placed big bets on cloud computing and warehouse-sized data centers. To keep the momentum going for its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business, where Q1 revenue surged 64% to $2.57 billion, Amazon has purchased at least five startups.Its interests don't stop there. Amazon is building a fleet of drones to deliver products. It has also expanded from e-commerce to making its own home electronics and streaming video to customers. Amazon even appears to be building a UPS-type shipping company.Then there’s Alphabet-owned Google, which over the years has bought the likes of YouTube, DoubleClick, Waze and Nest Labs.Google bought online video website YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006. Analysts estimate YouTube will have $9 billion in 2016 revenue. Though its profitability is unclear, Bank of America Merrill Lynch last year estimated YouTube's value at $70 billion or more.Another Google gem was buying Android, a mobile operating system software maker, for $50 million back in 2005. Google Android-based mobile phones now dominate the worldwide market in unit shipments.Google’s experimental businesses span life sciences, self-driving cars, internet services provided via fiber or balloons, and more. Besides its many buyouts of mobile technology companies last year, Google in November purchased business software developer Bebop for $380 million to beef up its cloud business.The diversification and far-flung investments of Facebook, Google and Amazon may put them in a better position to keep growing profitably than Apple, which has remained focused on iOS software products. With smartphones maturing, Apple's Q1 marked its first year-over-year revenue drop since 2003.The Apple Car may be the next big thing, but it will take investment. CEO Tim Cook, on Apple’s fiscal Q2 earnings call in April, told analysts Apple had made 15 acquisitions in the past four quarters to speed up product development. He also said the company ""would definitely buy something larger than we bought thus far"" to help current efforts or its ""entry into a category that we’re excited about.”Apple has the biggest cash hoard of all tech companies, but it has made mostly small acquisitions. An exception was Beats Electronics, a music-streaming and headphones company purchased in 2014 for $3 billion.Under both Steve Jobs and current CEO Tim Cook, Apple has steered away from the “transformational” deal. After Apple's March quarter disappointed, speculation has resurfaced that it could buy Time Warner (TWX) or another media firm, such as Netflix (NFLX). Some pundits have asked whether a major deal could speed Apple's move into electric self-driving cars.There is more than meets the eye to the digital conglomerates' strategies.Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, says Amazon has zeroed in on its e-commerce and cloud businesses, while Google has ventured far afield.""The irony is that Amazon has become the most disciplined within what they do, despite investors' belief that they spend like drunken sailors on different things,"" said Munster. ""Google's goal with the 'other bets' is to solve real-world problems, and those can be outside of their core business, which is advertising.""Facebook is somewhere in between. Oculus may part of some future aspect of social. But the bigger driver is (CEO Mark) Zuckerberg's belief that there's a new competing paradigm and it's going to be augmented reality.""One thing that the new digital conglomerates have in common with the conglomerates of old is their strong-willed leadership. At IT&T, it was CEO Harold Geneen.At Amazon, Facebook and Google, controlling founders rule. Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Alphabet's Larry Page and Sergey Brin call the shots on what project to launch next, just as Apple's Steve Jobs did. In April, Facebook proposed a new class of nonvoting stock to be issued through a special dividend, but Zuckerberg will continue to control the majority of voting power. Google's Page and Brin have a similar structure that protects their control.With founders at the helm, the companies preach patience.Facebook, which paid $2 billion for VR company Oculus, rolled out its first virtual-reality headset in March. On Facebook's Q1 earnings conference call with analysts, Zuckerberg said VR investments might not pay off for years. ""This is early, and it's going to take a long time,"" he said.Google took a strong step to position itself to take new directions when it restructured last year into Alphabet to manage its far-flung investments.Google’s founders have praised Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), which in 2015 made its biggest acquisition ever, buying Precision Castparts, a maker of aerospace components, for $37 billion.When forming the Alphabet holding company, Google committed to a Berkshire-like management structure of giving the fledgling businesses autonomy -- though they financially depend on the core Google business.""Even if Alphabet is in a tech, venture capital-like space, it can take one page from Berkshire and not micromanage,"" said Lawrence Cunningham, a corporate law professor at George Washington University.Nest Labs, the smart-home device maker that Google acquired for $3.2 billion in 2014, had a strong CEO in Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive. Fadell was one of the main executives in charge of developing Apple's iPod, which led the way to the iPhone and iPad. Nest, though, has struggled in bringing new products to market. Alphabet on June 3 said Fadell would be leaving as CEO.Success is not assured for any of the digital conglomerates' new ventures. Amazon failed with the Fire Phone and with Destinations, a travel website.Google acquired smartphone maker Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2012 and then sold it off two years later for less than $3 billion, though it retained the company's patents.The Apple Car, if it ever happens, would be a significant departure from Apple's consumer electronics roots.And investors are keeping an eye on the operating losses for Google's “other bets,"" as it calls its new business investments. Alphabet reported that its other bets had a net operating loss of $802 million in Q1, up from a $633 million loss a year earlier. Revenue more than doubled but was still just $166 million, peanuts for a company with $75 billion in sales last year.But YouTube’s growth shows what’s possible, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Alphabet's Q1 earnings call.“What seemed like a moon shot a decade ago has grown into a booming community of engaged users, creators and brands unlike any other video platform,” Pichai said.

493,UPS,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is sitting pretty as its loyalty member program grew 25% from the prior-year Q1 to 19.4 million members, and CEO Mary Dillon sees the beauty sector as being ""insulated"" from factors hitting retail as a whole.While she didn't go into much detail about the specific factors impacting retailers, it's not news that Amazon (AMZN) and other online players are eating into brick-and-mortar market share.Ulta management told analysts on a call Thursday that the chain has about 3% of U.S. beauty market share, so there's ""certainly"" more room for growth. And it is banking on its expanding ULTAmate Rewards program to help, with over 80% of sales being fueled by loyalty program members.Ulta shares jumped 8% in late trading.Specialty beauty retailers like Ulta and LVMH's Sephora have been deemed un-Amazon-able by some analysts, and Ulta continues to outperform amid a grisly retail earnings season. Loyalty programs and the in-store test-and-trial nature of cosmetics help to fortify defenses against the e-commerce assault that has taken chunks out of many other areas of retail.Ulta crushed first-quarter expectations, with earnings up 39% to $1.45 per share, way above consensus views for EPS of $1.29 and the greatest earnings growth in more than three years. Revenue grew 24% to $1.07 billion, easily topping estimates for $1.03 billion in sales.Same-store sales rose 15.2% during the quarter, accelerating from Q4’s 12.5% gain and well above views for a 10.7% increase. E-commerce sales alone jumped 38.8%. Retail comps grew 13.9%, which included salon comp growth of 7.7%.Dillon said in a statement that the company was ""off a phenomenal start to the year."" During the call, management overall sounded pretty happy with the company's loyalty program, brick-and-mortar performance and growth potential.For Q2, the company sees EPS of $1.32-$1.37 on $1.041 billion-$1.058 billion in revenue — a mixed bag, given views for EPS of $1.40 and sales of $1.033 billion.For the year, Ulta boosted guidance -- citing the strong start to the year -- to low-20% EPS growth on high-teens percentage range sales growth, up from prior outlook for 18%-20% EPS growth and mid- to high-teens percentage range revenue growth.Current Wall Street estimates are for a 20% EPS increase on 17% revenue growth.Ulta also now expects 10%-12% in same-store sales growth, up from previous guidance for 8%-10%.

494,UPS,"With the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) set to meet this month, the focus among Fed watchers is on whether the central bank will, or won’t, raise the rate (Fed funds) at which banks lend to one another. What’s perhaps not discussed enough is why the Fed presumes to set this rate at all.Figure that an interest rate is a price like any other.  And as a price it should reflect the needs of the saver every bit as much, and perhaps more, than it does the borrower. What is referred to as “easy credit” may actually be a nominally high interest rate so long as the price brings savers with access to credit into the marketplace in order to fulfill the desires of borrowers.In a free economy, prices float up and down as a way of maximizing the possibility that those who have access to a specific good will transact with those who don’t.  Prices are regulation par excellence for them facilitating the trade that is the driver of all economic activity. No credible economist would express the need for a central planning authority to set the prices of cars, shoes, or computers, yet all this frenzied focus on the Fed suggests that the cost of credit requires a central decree. Something is wrong with this picture.Arguably the problem today is that money and credit are increasingly viewed as one and the same. Yet they’re not.  If money were credit, Haiti, Honduras and Peru would have as much credit flowing through their respective economies as the U.S., Germany and Japan presently do. In truth, credit represents real economic resources; as in goods like trucks, tractors, desks, chairs, computers, and most important of all, labor. When we borrow dollars, euros and yen, we’re not borrowing money as much as we’re in pursuit of the resources that money can be exchanged for.That’s why it’s so important that interest rates reflect the marketplace, as opposed to the perception inside the Fed as to what the proper rate of interest should be. In presuming to set rates of interest, central bankers are arrogating to the Fed the cost of accessing the actual resources created in the actual economy. Even more problematic is how central banks go about doing this.In its modern attempts to decree “easy” credit, the Fed has reduced the Fed funds rate to zero, and more recently raised the target rate to a range of 0.25-0.50.  At first glance the Fed has rendered credit rather cheap, but such a conclusion ignores that every transaction has a buyer and seller. In setting rock-bottom borrowing rates the Fed is plainly focusing on the needs of borrowers without regard to the desires of savers.A potentially good model for the Fed to follow is Uber, the highly popular transportation service. Uber’s simple genius is that it recognizes that it can best serve the needs of its customers by virtue of it pleasing the drivers that contract with the San Francisco-based company.With a keen focus on serving as many passengers as possible, Uber lets the cost of accessing drivers float up and down to ensure plentiful supply of its service when its customers need it most.  Uber creates “easy” access to its drivers by virtue of allowing the cost of transportation to rise to a level that appeals to its profit-motivated drivers.Contrast that once again with the Fed, which attempts to render credit easy by decreeing it cheap. If Uber followed the Fed’s interest-rate model, it would likely not be in business today.  Rare can a business stay open if its service is scarce when customers need it the most.Is the Fed similarly reducing total credit in the economy by ignoring savers who would prefer not to lend at near zero rates? Happily, the answer is no, and it speaks to the Fed’s increasing irrelevance as a factor in the health of the U.S. economy.While the Fed pursues easy credit with near-zero rates of interest, the cost of credit in the actual economy thankfully doesn’t reflect the Fed’s desires. In Hollywood, film financing for even the best movie producers frequently requires years of cajoling. Despite a production track record (Splash, Parenthood, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind) that is the envy of the industry, film producer Brian Grazer freely acknowledges that financiers reject his ideas for new movies “90% of the time.”And while Silicon Valley is presently enjoying a renewed surge of investment in its myriad technology start-ups, the on-the-ground reality there is that credit is similarly very tight. In order for entrepreneurs to secure investment for their endeavors, they must first sell a large portion of their businesses to venture capitalists. After that, more equity is offered in the form of stock options to attract the best and brightest employees.Real estate moguls dealing directly with banks have long been met with a lot of scrutiny too. As my new book, Who Needs the Fed? details, by the early 1990s a then top-of-his-game developer by the name of Donald J. Trump was already viewed by major banks as a serious credit risk such that they cast a skeptical eye on the net worth claims of the future presidential hopeful.  Whatever the Fed’s wishes about easy or tight credit, banks and investors judge each of us individually, and without regard to the Fed’s efforts to dictate the cost of credit.Though the Fed is often seen as the spigot from which credit flows, too easily forgotten is that Fed has no private stash of resources to unleash on the economy. What this should remind everyone is that in moving its Fed funds rate around the Fed isn’t increasing credit as much it’s distorting where a declining amount of it would otherwise flow. Thankfully the news here is very good, and getting much better.Indeed, the Fed’s channel for influencing credit access is a banking system that shrinks by the day as a source of loans. As of this writing banks account for 15% of total lending in the U.S. economy, but with more and more nonbanks filling the role of lender (think retailer Walmart, insurer USAA, LendingClub, and countless other businesses with credit arms), the ability of banks to influence economic activity is plainly on the wane. By extension, the Fed’s relevance is similarly deteriorating.So while economists and investors still hang on seemingly every word uttered by the Fed officials perhaps as a matter of habit, market forces signal that this won’t be the norm for long. The Fed once again interacts with banks that are the opposite of dynamic, and that are increasingly dated as sources of credit. Will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates next month, or next year. Soon enough we won’t even care.

495,UPS,"Markets finished the week in disarray after a shockingly weak jobs report upended what had been an increasingly clear case for another increase in benchmark interest rates -- just days before Federal Reserve policymakers meet.Meanwhile, the future of the auto sector came into focus as Tesla Motors (TSLA) offered clues to its ambitious production goals, and Uber got a massive investment that values the ride-hailing service at $62.5 billion.May's 38,000 net hires were the worst since September 2010. Even adjusting for the roughly 35,000 workers affected by the strike at Verizon (VZ), the payroll gain was still far below the 158,000 hires that economists had expected.The jobless rate fell to 4.7% from 5%, but that was due to a plunge in the number of people looking for work.The jobs shocker overshadowed more positive data earlier. Consumer spending in April jumped 1% from a month earlier, the biggest increase in six years. Personal incomes rose 0.4%. ISM's manufacturing index climbed to 51.3 in May from 50.8 in April, topping estimates for a dip to 50.6. The Fed's Beige Book noted modest to moderate economic growth in most regions, with tight labor markets pushing wages higher.The major averages ended the week mixed, giving up modest gains, as the dismal jobs report triggered a sell-off Friday. Economic data earlier in the week seemed to bolster arguments for a Fed rate hike in June or July, but Friday's report may now push back the timeline.Weekly losses by Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) further weighed on indexes. The S&P 500 finished flat for the week, after hitting a seven-month closing high on Thursday. The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, and the Dow industrials lost 0.4%.Shares of Apple closed down 2.4% from a week ago, and Nike fell 4.9%.Tesla Motors co-founder and CEO Elon Musk, speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, said he’s “absolutely convinced” that dramatic  manufacturing improvements can be achieved. Musk said he is completely rethinking Tesla’s current factory process and hopes to improve efficiency by “factors of 10 or even 100 times.” Many analysts are skeptical that Tesla can boost production to 500,000 vehicles by 2018.He also said future owners of the Tesla Model 3 could pay a premium for supercharging packages. ""It will still be very cheap and far cheaper than gasoline to drive long distances with the Model 3,"" Musk said at the meeting. “But it will not be free long distance for life unless you purchase that package.""Later, Musk said Apple would likely build a quality vehicle, but said the Apple car might be ""late"" to the autonomous rush.Tesla stock finished down 1.8% for the week.The Saudi Public Investment Fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber, following a stream of ride-hailing investments and alliances by automakers and tech giants.Toyota (TM) last week announced a strategic investment in Uber, which has teamed up with Baidu (BIDU) in China.As for China, Apple has invested some $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing app in that country. Didi is backed by Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY).General Motors (GM) previously invested in Lyft, Uber's top U.S. ride-hailing rival.Volkswagen (VLKAY) made its own investment in Gett, which operates  in Europe, Israel and New York City.Athletic apparel maker Under Armour (UA) trimmed 2016 sales guidance to $4.925 billion from $5 billion due to Sports Authority's liquidation (vs. a restructuring or sale), while Nike received downgrades from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.Under Armour also will reportedly be launching a fashion line -- Under Armour Sportswear -- in the fall, with Tim Coppens as executive creative director.Under Armour shares dropped 4% for the week.Broadcom reported fiscal Q2 sales of $3.56 billion, up 117% vs. a year earlier in its first report since its Avago merger. Earnings per share rose 19% to $2.53, ending a three-quarter string of decelerating growth, despite tumbling Apple iPhone sales.Sales edged the consensus view for $3.55 billion, but EPS topped by 15 cents.Broadcom sees current-quarter sales ex items for $3.75 billion, plus or minus $75 million, up 114%. Analysts expect $3.71 billion.Broadcom stock climbed 6%.GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) reported $57.2 million in sales and 34 cents earnings per share minus items, down 19.5% and 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected Q1 sales of $57.01 million and EPS of 28 cents. GoPro's Hero 5 action-camera release is expected in September.Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang acknowledged the wearables headwind and told investors to expect further hold-ups after an earthquake rattled Japan in April.Ambarella stock surged 13%. GoPro gained 5.1%.The oil cartel failed to agree on a collective production ceiling after a previous failed effort in December, as Iran insisted any OPEC-wide limit must also come with output caps on individual members. Top OPEC members, including de facto leader Saudi Arabia, had made a late push for a ceiling ahead of the meeting, but markets weren't surprised by the lack of action.Also, the Energy Information Administration reported U.S. oil inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels, the third decline in the last four weeks. Production continued to drop, falling to 8.735 million barrels a day, the lowest since September 2014, down from 8.767 million in the prior week.For the week, U.S. crude lost 1.4%, settling at $48.62 a barrel on Friday. Brent dropped 0.6% to $49.64 a barrel.Salesforce.com (CRM) agreed to buy Demandware (DWRE) for $2.8 billion, or $75 a share in cash, pushing into the e-commerce market. Demandware is viewed as a leader in the $5 billion digital commerce market, which Gartner expects to grow to $8.5 billion by 2020.“Similar to the ExactTarget acquisition, Salesforce.com is buying the best available asset to serve as the cornerstone of a new cloud offering,” said Steven Ashley, an analyst at R.W. Baird.Salesforce stock ended down 1.5% for the week, while Demandware shot up 61%.The human resources software maker delivered fiscal Q1 non-GAAP profit and revenue that topped views, but billings growth -- a key sales metric -- decelerated from the previous quarter. Workday (WDAY) CEO Aneel Bhusri signaled a greater focus on profitability in fiscal 2018. On the earnings call, he noted that software peers such as Salesforce.com experienced less volatility than Workday during the January market sell-off, which he attributed in part to Salesforce's profitability.Workday stock gained 5.4% for the week.Teen value retailer Five Below’s (FIVE) Q1 EPS leapt 50% to 12 cents, above views by 2 cents, as revenue gained 25% to $192.7 million, also topping. Same-store sales grew 4.9%. But Q2 and full-year guidance fell short of estimates. Shares rose 5%.Michael Kors' (KORS) Q4 earnings and sales topped forecasts. The luxury handbag, apparel and accessories maker and retailer said it would sell fewer products to wholesale department stores as mall traffic falls and discounting rises. That will likely weigh on sales, but it should boost profit.Shares jumped 15.9% for the week.Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI), which sells a variety of marked-down home goods, reported Q1 EPS of 20 cents on sales of $193.7 million, both topping. Full-year guidance missed. The company also warned that weather at the start of Q2 was “less than desirable for seasonal sales.” Shares fell 0.3%.Shares of Cracker Barrel (CBRL) popped 8.8% this week after the home-style restaurant chain declared a special dividend of $3.25 per share, hiked its quarterly dividend and reported Q3 EPS that topped views. Sales were shy of estimates. Cracker Barrel gave mixed full-year guidance.General Motors said May U.S. sales plunged 18% to 240,753, with retail sales down 13%. Ford (F) U.S. sales fell 6% to 235,997. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw a 1% sales increase to 204,452 vehicles, as Jeep sales climbed 14% to 90,545 units. The weak sales -- despite rising incentives and ever-longer and ever-larger auto loans -- added to fears that demand is slowing after several years of robust growth. Still, industry annualized sales for the U.S. were 17.45 million, according to AutoData, up from 17.4 million in April and above estimates for about 17.3 million.

496,UPS,"Adrian Lee is a man in demand. His phone is abuzz with questions on Britain’s European Union vote. Can he brief the board on the referendum, asks a U.S. client. How about later today?The founder of Adrian Lee & Partners, which oversees $9 billion of foreign-exchange investments for money managers, is quick to oblige. And after hearing him out, the company takes his advice -- and decides it doesn’t need any more protection on its sterling positions.Lee concedes this is a risk -- witness the pound’s slide the past two days after a jump in support for Brexit. Yet with just three weeks to go before Britons choose whether to quit the world’s largest trading bloc, he remains sanguine about the result.After wild swings earlier in the year, Lee is finding some support in foreign-exchange markets. While the pound is down about 2% versus the dollar this year, it has pared a drop of as much as 6.1% after a series of opinion polls backed the status quo. Long-term options also point to a calmer outlook, with a six-month gauge of risks now back at levels seen in February, when the date of the vote was set.“We don’t feel any sense of panic or urgency among our clients in seeking currency hedges,” said Lee, whose company has offices in London and Dublin. “Clients find our central-case view,” that a Brexit won’t happen, to be “reassuring,"" he said, ""and none has decided to take extra currency protection.""We’re slightly short-sterling in any case, but that’s driven by the U.K.’s fundamentals rather than political concerns,” he said. A short bet benefits when an asset declines in value.The pound fell 1.5% on Tuesday and Wednesday after two ICM Research opinion polls showed leads for those wanting to leave the EU. But the bulk of the news was good for the pro-Europeans in May -- a Brexit “barometer” from broker and spread-betting company IG Markets this week calculated a 77% chance of Britain staying in.“Economic and common sense will prevail and the odds suggest Britons will most likely vote to stay in the European Union,” said Lee.For James Wood-Collins, chief executive at Record Currency Management, sterling volatility, rather than weakness, is the main enemy.“We’re certainly not seeing any sense of panic,” said Wood-Collins, whose company oversees $54 billion of currency exposures for pension funds and other investors, from Windsor, near London. “A large majority of our clients are maintaining their programs as usual, with a focus on managing exposure, where possible, to volatile trading conditions. Very few of our clients -- nor Record -- are going to take a directional view over and above what the market has priced in.”It’s been a year of ups and downs for the pound, which has been buffeted not only by a stream of surveys on the EU vote, but also by interjections from business leaders and politicians on the prospects for -- and risks of -- a Brexit.Sterling was at $1.4422 at 12:39 p.m. in New York on Thursday, having climbed from this year’s low of $1.3836 in February. While it was the second-best performing Group-of-10 currency in May, year-to-date it’s still the worst. And though the price of protection against weakness and volatility remains elevated for the time of the referendum, the cost of hedging six-month declines has fallen.“The pound remains vulnerable despite the recent rebound as the vote remains highly uncertain,” said Lisa Scott-Smith, a money manager at Millennium Global Investments in London, which oversees $16 billion. “As witnessed this week, the market was very sensitive to negative news having so quickly priced out Brexit risk premium.”The danger is that a vote to leave the EU would push the pound into a drop against which investors aren’t sufficiently hedged. Lee predicts sterling would fall 20% on a vote to leave the EU over the course of two to three days, with much of it on Day One.It’s questionable whether such losses would endure.The extra cost of one-month options protecting against a sterling decline vs. the dollar, compared with those betting on an advance, has surged to 6.7 percentage points, the most in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2003. Anticipated volatility in a month’s time reached the highest since 2009 this week.Yet risk reversals also suggest waning concern in the longer term, with the six-month rate narrowing this week to 3.3 percentage points, the least since Feb. 22, the day after the date of the vote was set.Hedge funds and other large speculators have cut bets on a sterling decline vs. the dollar, known as net shorts, by 40% from a three-year high in April, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington show.“The general view is that, most likely, the U.K. will choose to remain in the EU,” said Stephen Jen, a former International Monetary Fund economist and the London-based co-founder of hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners, who predicted the sterling decline that started in mid-2014. “That creates asymmetrical risk for the pound because history suggests polls can be wrong.”
"
497,UPS,"Specialty drugmaker Akorn (AKRX) was up in early trading Tuesday after its belated Q1 earning report met Wall Street's expectations and a major investor tripled its stake in the firm.Late Monday, Akorn reported its first-quarter results just a week after it announcing Q4 and 2015 results, along with restated 2014 earnings, after a year-long repair of its accounting system. It also affirmed the 2016 guidance it issued last month, calling for at least 80% earnings growth over the previous year, with revenue up 8% to 10%.""Akorn's guidance continues to exclude new approvals, and to us the growth outlook here is going to be about two things: (i) converting the current pipeline of 86 ANDAs (generic-drug applications) in an environment where we are seeing accelerating FDA approval activity, and (ii) pursuing a strategy of targeting bolt-on deal opportunities,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a research note.Akorn said that adjusted net income rose 20% over the year-earlier quarter to 54 cents a share, in line with analysts' consensus. Revenue rose 18% to $268 million, also in line.The financial uncertainty cut Akorn's stock price by two-thirds between its April 2015 high and its March 18 low, but since then it's climbed nearly 70%. In the stock market today, Akorn stock rose 7.6% in heavy volume, to 29.91, and hit a four-month high.Bloomberg also reported that investment management firm Paulson & Co. has become Akorn's second-largest shareholder, with $219 million in holdings. The report said Paulson also bought into Endo International (ENDP), another specialty pharma that fell out of favor with Wall Street after issuing guidance this month that disastrously missed estimates, with a Paulson spokeswoman saying many specialty pharma stocks have been oversold.

498,UPS,"UPS (UPS) CEO David Abney on Tuesday said potential plans by Amazon (AMZN)  to expand its own shipping capabilities were unlikely to significantly affect the global package-deliverer's pricing, an announcement that comes as the e-commerce giant grapples with higher shipping costs to meet demand for faster service.Abney's remarks came in response to an analyst question on UPS' Q4 earnings call about what effect Amazon's reported plans to lease Boeing (BA) cargo planes would have on competitive pricing in the U.S. and European express market.""I didn’t read anything in the last quarter that we felt like is, on any kind of substantial basis, is going to affect our pricing in the market,"" Abney said.Amazon, UPS' biggest customer, has been trying to rein in shipping expenses and reduce its dependence on UPS, whose own delivery costs have risen over the years due to e-commerce growth and attempts to modernize its delivery system.The two companies have reportedly been at increasing odds with each other after 11th-hour Amazon holiday orders inundated UPS' delivery infrastructure, resulting in botched Christmas-season deliveries in 2013. UPS in 2014 placed volume caps on some retailers in 2014.While questions persist about the package deliverer's ability to handle surges in package volume, the company has expanded customers' abilities to track and reroute deliveries and choose where to pick them up. UPS' acquisition of Coyote Logistics also helped it manage transportation services and costs during the peak season.Shares of Amazon dropped after its Q4 earnings per share last week grew dramatically but missed analyst forecasts. Shipping costs rose during the quarter due as its Prime Now program, offering free two-day shipping, becomes more popular. Along with leasing jets, Amazon has taken a stake in at least one European delivery company and has begun using its own delivery trucks. And it wants, eventually, to deliver packages via drones.Still, Abney appeared to try to tamp down speculation of any tension between the companies.""Amazon's a good customer of ours, we have a mutually beneficial relationship,"" he said during the call. ""Our goal with Amazon or any other big customer is to continue to show our value though the integrated network and through our technologies and to have a value proposition that’s difficult to match. We do add capacity for large customers such as Amazon. We do it, though, when we’re sure we have the proper economic return.”And earlier in the call, he emphasized collaboration with customers and adjustments to its network to better handle holiday volume.“This year, our customers worked more closely with us than ever,"" Abney said. ""And I want to thank them for making adjustments and being flexible.”Besides, the company's fourth-quarter results were strong. EPS jumped 26% to $1.57, soundly beating estimates for $1.42. Sales edged up to $16.1 billion, slightly missing forecasts.And the company guided 2016 diluted EPS of $5.70 to $5.90, well above an outlook for $5.73. UPS also guided revenue growth of 6% to 8%, above analysts expectations for 5% growth.UPS, which some see as a bellwether for the economy, also said the outlook for the global economy remained uncertain.Abney said the U.S.' gross domestic product outlook was muted in 2016 but was expected to gain strength in the second half of the year. The company also said it expected ""slight improvements"" in Europe and Asia's GDP, but that emerging markets would still be shaky.“Although the industrial side of the economy has slowed,"" Abney said near the beginning of the call. ""The explosive growth of e-commerce continues to create great opportunity.”UPS shares rose 0.6% to 94.67  in the stock market today. Shares of rival parcel delivery service Federal Express (FDX) fell 1.6% to 130.15.

500,UPS,"Have you noticed all the senior Republican Party leaders -- the ones whispering worries to Washington reporters but, for pete's sake, not for attribution -- out campaigning in recent weeks to save their party from the destructive whirlwinds of the Trump tornado?We haven't either.Today, Donald Trump faces his biggest election test yet. He could all but lock up the GOP nomination with decisive wins in several states, especially winner-take-alls in Ohio and Florida.Trump claims he's doing an amazing job of drawing millions and millions of energized new supporters into the GOP tent for the anticipated electoral confrontation with Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8. That is, to put it so even Trump can understand, barnyard excrement.Like Obama, Trump acts as if he says something, that makes it true. He talks of dishonest media. In this case, the dishonesty is Trump's.Clinton kills Trump one-on-one. Here's the cunning woman not trusted by two-thirds of her own supporters, a woman facing possible federal indictment over national security and financial tricks, and she still defeats the Donald-come-lately-Republican in hypothetical match-ups.Don't expect Trumpsters to acknowledge any of this. They go deaf to facts undermining their celebrity infatuation. And their default response is name-calling.In fact, Clinton has topped Trump in 43 of the last 50 such polls going back almost one year.In the latest ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Clinton handles Trump 50% to 41% among registered voters and 48% to 39% among those crucial independent voters. There don't seem to be quite as many disaffected Democrats as the real estate baron boasts either; she beats him among D's 86% to 9%.Asked who would win in a head-to-head, 36% say Trump, while Clinton draws 59% support, up five points just since January.Here's how lopsided the data is. Trump wins male voters by five points; she captures women by 21 points. Trump gets barely one-in-five minority votes.He owns the ""poorly educated"" without college degrees, 57% to 33%. Clinton wins voters with diplomas 52% to 37%. And she walks away with the under-40 vote nearly two-to-one.Trump even captures a smaller percentage of white voters than did the man from 2012 he calls ""a loser,"" Mitt Romney.Almost two weeks ago, Romney finally echoed Marco Rubio, calling Trump an empty con man and a disaster for the Republican Party in this fall's election and beyond. But the former party nominee didn't back up that concern by campaigning with any Trump alternative until yesterday, the last possible day, with John Kasich of Ohio.It's understandable early in a nomination process for congressional and party elders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan to stay out of intra-party competitions. Former president George W. Bush campaigned briefly for his brother.But now? Now, with a few exceptions like Nebraska's Ben Sasse and with the future of the GOP brand   imperiled by a faux conservative stalking horse for Clinton, they go strangely silent.Also at stake: All those crucial down-ticket races in November that could cost the GOP control of the Senate and even the House if Americans figure out that ""Make America Great Again"" is just a hat.Excuse us if after seven years of the wily Obama and out-foxed GOP Hill leadership, we've moved beyond skepticism to cynicism on this.That's actually the sort of 'leading' from behind that got their party into this feckless mess.It resembles Obama's hasty troop withdrawal from Iraq that left a tempting vacuum for ISIS. So too, emerged a vacuum from the lack of principled, stiff-spined opposition to Obama's agenda by congressional Republicans who failed to deliver on their policy promises after voters did deliver their requested majorities.Guess what? A plurality of those once-loyal voters appear to be settling now for a standard-bearer on a bozo billionaire who can't utter a complete coherent sentence, but can voice their red-faced anger with promises of more change to believe in.This presidential cycle should have been a gimme for Republicans. A field of young, diverse, accomplished conservatives going against two Democrats averaging 71-years-old, advocating even more of the lame, dishonest Obama policies that chased record numbers from the workforce and produced the worst economic recovery since World War II.Then, there's Americans' proclivity to deny the same party three straight White House terms. No wonder the GOP began with 17 candidates, now down to four, maybe fewer tomorrow.Things look so dire nowadays that experts at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics are asking an excellent, if scary question:Is the Grand Old Party headed down the same road to political extinction as the 19th century Whig Party, whose mid-century collapse into disagreeable disunity produced the new Republican Party and its first president Abe Lincoln?RELATED:

"
504,UPS,"New exchange enrollment data released by the Obama administration on Friday reveal in multiple ways that ObamaCare is failing to live up to its goal of providing affordable care.That's no small problem when the law mandates that people buy coverage or face a fine. The fact that enrollment grew only modestly in the law's third year despite the ramping up of the mandate penalty underscores the reality that ObamaCare only offers poor options to far too many millions of people.No one is getting a worse deal than the people of Mississippi. Despite the fact that the state ranked near the bottom last year with enrollment of just 38% of those eligible for subsidies, the number of people signing up for subsidized exchange plans in 2016 was virtually flat from a year ago (97,943 vs 97,606 in 2015).IBD predicted last fall that Mississippi would be ""ground zero for ObamaCare's individual mandate"" because stagnant state sign-ups looked like a sure bet with after-subsidy premiums set to jump on the order of 60%, far more than in any of the 36 other states using HealthCare.gov last year.For 30-year-olds in Yazoo City earning about $25,000 (214% of the poverty level), the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan spiked by about $550 to just under $1,500, or 6% of pay. Because this plan from Ambetter, a unit of Centene (CNC), covers little before the $6,800 deductible is met, it may make the $695 mandate tax look like the best among bad options for someone who isn't expecting big medical bills.It's becoming clear that millions of working-class Americans face a choice between paying a penalty they surely can’t afford and buying a policy — if they can foot the bill — that may still wreck their finances if they land in the hospital.While this reality is pretty pervasive, it's especially harsh in some areas, Mississippi and Washington state among them, partly due to competitive pricing decisions made by Centene. While the cheapest bronze-plan premium (before subsidies) rose about $250 in Mississippi for a $25,000-earner, the subsidy fell $300, yielding the $550 increase. That came about because the subsidies are tied to the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan, and Centene cornered the market on low-cost plans in a number of states this year by attaching bronze-like deductibles ($5,500 and $6,500) to silver plans.Centene took the same tack in Washington state, with a similar result. This year, Washington's exchange signed up 140,000 people for subsidized plans. At first blush, the 10.5% growth over last year's 126,650 total looks good, but it's deceptive because last year, unlike this year, the state only counted paid enrollment. Once nonpayers are scrubbed from the total, the number of subsidized customers in 2016 may end up being equal to, perhaps even lower than, last year's.Centene, along with other Medicaid managed care players like Molina Health (MOH), moved into the individual market with the launch of ObamaCare and has been credited with navigating the market more adeptly than bigger players such as UnitedHealth (UNH).Still, Centene's subsidy-squeezing shift isn't widespread yet. Overall, the average HealthCare.gov subsidy rose 10.3% to $290 per month from $263 a year ago, as the average share of premiums paid by those eligible for subsidies rose just under 5%, to $106 a month from $101.The Department of Health and Human Services also revealed that the exchanges ended 2015 with just under 8.8 million paid enrollees nationwide, down 25% from the 11.7 million sign-ups to start the year. As of last March, once the unpaid total was culled, there were 10.2 million members.The data also indicate that the paid ObamaCare insurance pool gets older as the year progresses. Among the 5.6 million people who renewed their HealthCare.gov coverage this year (out of 6.3 million who held policies at year-end), just 1.35 million, or 24%, were in age 18 to 34. That's down from a 28% young-adult share of sign-ups in the 2015 enrollment period.It's worth recalling that the Obama administration and Kaiser Family Foundation both set a target of about 2.8 million young-adult enrollees in ObamaCare's first year, or roughly 40% of the total, in keeping with the young-adult share of the eligible population. It's clear that the exchanges ended the second year far below that initial target, with as few as 2.1 million 18- to 34-year-olds.  This year, 3.5 million of the 12.7 million sign-ups are age 18 to 34, though it remains to be seen how many fail to pay or later exit the exchanges if they get workplace insurance.A higher share of young adults could help keep down premiums because, under ObamaCare's age-rating limit, younger people are charged more than their expected cost to restrain premiums for older adults. This helps turn ObamaCare's market upside-down relative to pre-2014 markets, with a bronze plan now costing $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if both earn $25,000.Still, there is some evidence in the new data that the higher individual mandate penalty may be convincing people to enroll. About 38% of the additional sign-ups compared to a year ago chose bronze or catastrophic plans. Generally, people who are signing up to avoid a penalty can be expected to lean toward the cheapest plan available.The number of people with subsidized coverage via HealthCare.gov rose just 6.1% from a year ago. While a clear assessment won't be possible until we know how many people actually pay for their coverage, the weak sign-up total has left ObamaCare in much the same place that it was a year ago.Millions of people are benefiting from the exchanges, especially near-poor households that qualify for the most generous subsidies and people with pre-existing conditions that no longer have to pay an arm and a leg. But likely fewer than 1 in 3 people with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level are now getting silver coverage that will protect their finances if they land in the hospital.

505,UPS,"FedEx (FDX) got a lower price target Thursday following the news that Amazon (AMZN) will lease planes for air cargo, while Coca-Cola (KO) and CVS Health (CVS) had their price targets raised.RBC Capital Markets cut its price target on FedEx to 153 from 157 and maintained its sector perform rating on the stock. The delivery company, along with peers such as UPS (UPS) and DHL, might feel a little pain from Amazon’s decision to operate its own fleet of jet freighters to deliver its packages.On Wednesday, Amazon confirmed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA) 767 jets from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) as a way of grabbing more control over distribution and logistics amid rapid growth in its Prime service, which promises speedy delivery.FedEx shares closed down 0.1% on the stock market today. Amazon fell 0.1%, Boeing rose 0.1%, and Air Transport added 4.8%.Coca-Cola’s price target was raised to 55 from 47 by RBC Capital Markets, which maintained its outperform rating on the stock.In a Thursday morning note, RBC analyst Nik Modi said “we are at the precipice of Coca-Cola inflecting to a period of sustained outperformance, particularly among its consumer staples mega cap peers under our coverage.”Those peers include Proctor & Gamble (PG), Clorox (CL), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), PepsiCo (PEP), Altria Group (MO) and Reynolds American (RAI).Coca-Cola’s stock price touched a new stock high of 44.83 on Wednesday and moved 0.9% higher Thursday.

506,UPS,"A major expansion by Amazon.com (AMZN) into private-label goods, which could come this month, elevates its ability to further challenge legacy retailers across the board.Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates Amazon will be the No. 2 player in the $425 billion consumable market, excluding food and beverage, surpassing Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) and Target (TGT) but still lagging well behind market leader Wal-Mart (WMT).He defines consumables as four segments: personal care products, household products, baby products and pet products.Blackledge also estimates Amazon will be a top-10 player in the $785 billion food and beverage grocery market by 2019.“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption, given younger demos increasingly purchasing grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge wrote.The leader in the food and beverage category is Wal-Mart, followed by Kroger (KR), Albertsons/Safeway and Costco Wholesale (COST).Last week, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying Amazon is set in the coming weeks to roll out new lines of private-label brands that will include its first broad push into perishable foods.According to the Private Label Manufacturers Association, sales of private-label store brands in the U.S. topped $118 billion in 2015, with supermarkets and drug chains accounting for over $70 billion of the total.In the grocery and consumables market, Blackledge says, Amazon’s growth has come at the expense of Wal-Mart, Target. Walgreens and CVS. Amazon’s key competitive advantage is its multiplatform approach with Amazon Prime, which includes same-day delivery for many goods, “all of which should lead to rising number of consumers skipping the trip to the local supercenter, drug store or grocery market,” he wrote.Amazon has sold private-label products since 2009, primarily under the AmazonBasics brand, though that effort has concentrated largely on consumer electronics.Amazon stock rose 0.6% to 702.80 in the stock market today. Amazon stock hit an all-time high of 722.45 on May 12. It carries a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94, putting it among the top 6% of all stocks on key metrics such as revenue growth.Walgreens climbed 1.3% but CVS fell 1.5%. Target climbed 2.4%. Wal-Mart advanced 1%, hitting a nine-month high intraday, after spiking nearly 10% Thursday on strong earnings and same-store sales.

507,UPS,"Nike (NKE) may be king of the court (and the field, and the track), but it's also facing more brutal competition from Under Armour (UA) and Adidas -- which could weigh on top-line gains, says one analyst.The threat from Under Armour was underscored Tuesday when Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, who has an Under Armour endorsement deal, became the first unanimous winner of the NBA's Most Valuable Player award. It is his second straight MVP and came a day after a stunning late-game playoff performance.Nike shares closed up 0.8% in the stock market today. Under Armour added 1%.""(W)e believe the 10%-15% top-line growth NKE has achieved since the recession may prove more difficult to sustain going forward, now that previously-slumping peers (Adidas) are gaining steam and previously-small competitors (Under Armour) are now large enough to move the needle,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Tom Nikic on Tuesday.The Beaverton, Ore.-based athletic apparel maker is ""one of the strongest consumer brands in the world"" with ""one of the clearest paths to long-term margin expansion"" in its industry, he said.But the costs associated with the Olympics this summer could make for ""noisy"" near-term financials, and the renewed strength of Nike's competitors is noteworthy, prompting the bank to withhold a more bullish view for now.Wells Fargo is resuming coverage of the stock at market perform with a 58-62 price range.Adidas' U.S. resurgence has sparked much analyst chatter lately.

509,UPS,"From presidential candidates on down, everyone worries about economic inequality these days. In an era of stagnant job and wage growth, that’s a fair concern.But inequality is a poor measure of how people are really doing and what would make life better. Rather than measure the difference between a CEO’s salary and her lowest-paid employee’s, policymakers should focus on making the poor better off. The job for policymakers is to remove barriers to opportunity and job creation.Allow entrepreneurship and commerce to flourish. That requires adopting sound, pro-growth policies and ditching bad ones. In two new studies, we examine which policies can achieve those goals and which cannot.Instead of policies that merely redistribute existing wealth, people need new opportunities and a chance to growth wealth. Pro-growth reforms include expanding access to capital and removing barriers to entrepreneurship, such as occupational licensing and burdensome regulations.Those reforms are needed now more than ever. Many traditional forms of credit dried up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, despite near-zero interest rates. Banks severely cut back on loans, and mortgage and credit card issuance has plummeted due to regulations from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by the burdensome Dodd-Frank financial regulation legislation, and other big regulators.Meanwhile, only two new banks have been founded since the financial crisis. That’s particularly bad news since new banks are more likely to lend to small businesses and start-ups. So it’s time for lawmakers to step in and liberalize the chartering of banks.Lawmakers can also help increase access to capital by allowing entrepreneurs to offer new forms of lending and investing, such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, which promise to expand the market for capital beyond banks.Occupational licensing is another impediment to entrepreneurship and the development of job skills. Nearly a third of American workers require government permission to do a day’s work, including in occupations where safety isn’t an issue. That is ethically wrong and economically stunting. There is no legitimate reason for an interior decorator or a hair braider to be required to undergo hundreds of hours of training in something they already know how to do. It’s long past time to end those government restrictions.But policymakers must also take a harder look at the overall regulatory state. It imposes around $1.88 trillion in costs, an amount paid for by all Americans in dollars and lost economic opportunity. Congress could start by making regulators more accountable, such as by requiring Congressional votes on all new major regulations -- currently defined as those with at least $100 million in annual costs. For old and obsolete rules, Congress should appoint a regulatory review commission to comb through the Code of Federal Regulations, assemble a package of rules to repeal and agree to a no-amendment, up-or-down vote.Economic freedom is critical for prosperity. Nations that rank highest in economic freedom have a higher per capita GDP, which makes a huge difference in the living standards for people at the bottom of the economic ladder. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been slipping in that regard, dropping from No. 6 in the Fraser Institute’s annual Economic Freedom of the World Report in 2008, to No. 16 today.To turn around our misfortunes and help people escape poverty, it’s time to get serious about reforms that matter. We must give people the freedom to prosper and build a better life.

510,UPS,"Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) nearly tripled earnings during the first quarter, prompting the Miami-based company to raise its full-year profit guidance by a similar amount.Excluding items, the cruise operator earned 57 cents a share in Q1, up 185% from a year earlier and 26 cents better than forecasts of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 5.6% to $1.918 billion, roughly in line with views of $1.916 billion, and net yields rose 7% on a constant currency basis.Full-year EPS guidance was raised by 25 cents to a range of $6.15 to $6.35, driven by a more favorable currency environment and strength in North American products and onboard revenue. Analysts expect EPS of $6.09.Shares closed up 1.8% on the stock market today, after rising as much as 4.5% early then turning negative midday.Meanwhile, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) is scheduled to report Q1 earnings on May 10.

511,UPS,"In 2010, Amazon.com (AMZN) had 26 fulfillment centers in North America. By 2017, it will have 88, according to Cowen analyst John Blackledge.In a research report Monday, Blackledge said Amazon's rapid and massive delivery-system expansion -- costing the company more than $10 billion in capital expenditures -- is likely to continue for the foreseeable future and will not be matched by rivals such as Wal-Mart (WMT).Doubling down on the fulfillment business has meant continuing to innovate, especially in Amazon's ""sortation"" centers, he says. These centers facilitate last-mile delivery -- a notorious problem for any logistics company -- and, in conjunction with increased United States Postal Service shipments, improvements here could drive down the cost of shipping to $1.85 per order from $4 to $5, the analyst says.Though spending big bucks has depressed earnings, generating ire among investors, the strategy is sticking close to the philosophy Jeff Bezos laid out in his 1997 letter to shareholders, that the company will put customers before profits.Amazon stock was up a fraction in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 624. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, where 99 is the highest. After a low-volume breakout, Amazon is still in buy range from a 603.34 cup-with-handle buy point. Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock.The company, meanwhile, also is expanding its FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS)-like services. The company has acknowledged a widely circulated rumor that it was launching a fleet of jets -- which it is leasing and operating out of Wilmington, Ohio. Blackledge says this program has the potential to make every Amazon item deliverable within a day.The e-commerce leader is set to report Q1 earnings after the close Thursday. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a research note last week that the company will miss EPS expectations but beat sales estimates.

512,UPS,"A basket of top-rated chip stocks are making moves around buy points now, with several moving up Friday. And Apple (AAPL), a big user of semiconductors, just sent out press invitations for a March 21 event where it's expected to introduce a small iPhone and another iPad.So which chip stocks are highly rated by IBD and get at least some of their business from Apple? Broadcom (AVGO), IBD Leaderboard stock Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Mellanox (MLNX) and Nvidia (NVDA) make the list.All are at least somewhat diversified, with revenue streams in everything from data center and mobile networking systems to powerful graphics chips for virtual reality and gaming, to connected car technology and now even artificial intelligence.IBD 50 stock Broadcom closed up 3.1% in the stock market today at 148.82, now just above and out of buy range from a double-bottom base. Macom jumped 5.8%, similarly above its ideal buy range, with positive analyst comments coming out of its analyst day.Macom Leapfrogs Apple-Supplying Chip Rivals With Lasers, Radar https://t.co/Dfqju3Frkr pic.twitter.com/6FyFLs13c0— Investors.com (@IBDinvestors) March 11, 2016Broadcom and Macom Technology Solutions made IBD's Stocks on The Move screen Friday, heading up in high volume. Broadcom made Thursday morning's screen too. Early Thursday, Broadcom's management team had presented at a Susquehanna Financial analysts' conference.“It’s a great time to operate in the semiconductor industry,” CEO Hock Tan said there. “You have a substantial profit pool … compared to similar industries of the same size.” Broadcom had started giving up some of its gains as stock indexes dipped into the red with falling oil prices, but it ended up with a 1.7% rise Thursday.Several other top-rated chip stocks moved up Friday after declining Thursday. Cirrus Logic closed up 3.4%. Mellanox gained 2.2% and Nvidia lifted 1.7%.On Thursday, Mellanox had slipped to the bottom of buy range, as had Macom Technology Solutions, while Nvidia had edged down to about 4% under a buy point from a cup base.While the stock market's in a confirmed uptrend, much of the action is choppy with ups and downs in oil prices and economic concerns around the globe. Going into Friday trading, all five of these top-ranked chipmakers had fallen from a week ago, between 1% and 7%, with the S&P 500 index down 1%. Cirrus Logic and Mellanox were up 14% and 15% this year, respectively -- the only ones of the five with notable gains.Nvidia, an IBD 50 stock, has the strongest IBD Composite Rating of the bunch, a best-possible 99, taking into account earnings growth, stock price gains and several other metrics. The others range between 90 and 98 in Composite Rating.It will take awhile for teardowns to show whose chips go into whatever new products Apple introduces, and longer for those chips to translate into reported sales, and lagging iPhone sales growth lately hasn't helped the chips.Apple Sets March 21 To Launch Small iPhone, New iPad, Watch Bands https://t.co/MxIpxMFKvc pic.twitter.com/iPxQ1lTAFF— Investors.com (@IBDinvestors) March 10, 2016Other markets are driving growth, however.

514,UPS,"Equinix’s (EQIX) global footprint of data center assets and network connections to cloud services providers give it a growing edge over rivals, says Pacific Crest Securities, which raised its price target on the stock to 375.Equinix stock is about even for 2016 so far, after breaking out of a flat base with a 304.87 buy point at the end of 2015. It's been consolidating ever since. Shares of Redwood City, Calif.-based Equinix edged up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 302.Pacific Crest analyst Michael Bowen said the company's acquisitions of Europe-based Telecity Group and Japan-based Bit-isle in 2015 will expand Equinix’s reach.“The magnetic pull Equinix has been able to achieve by having a dense global footprint of data center assets cannot be ignored. No other data center company in the world can offer equivalent scale of interconnection services as Equinix,” Bowen wrote.Data center operators provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the warehouse-sized data centers with their own computer servers and other gear. Equinix also specializes in providing connections to high-speed, fiber-optic networks.Demand for data-center space has been driven by the rise of social networking, mobile devices, cloud services, online gaming, computer-based stock trading and more. Equinix’s customers include leading cloud computing services providers Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as other large companies.“Equinix  is the only company that can enable enterprise adoption of the cloud, since it has created an ecosystem in which service providers can connect with enterprises,” added Bowen. “The ecosystem should be very difficult to replicate, and interconnection is one of the keys to Equinix's success.”The data center market is divided among wholesale providers such as Digital Realty (DLR) and DuPont Fabros (DFT) and retail operators such as Equinix. Wholesale providers sell huge amounts of space over contracts that run several years, while retail operators sell less space over shorter contracts and provide more specialized services, such as hook-ups to high-speed data networks.Image provided by Shutterstock.

515,UPS,"It isn't just gold and gold mining stocks that are glittering on the ETF investing scene. Small caps have shown glimmers of a rebound too.Smaller companies, which tend to magnify the S&P 500's moves, benefited from the recent bullish turn in investor sentiment. However, it may be a little too early to call a big recovery for this asset class that's little-loved lately, say investing experts.""I'm not sure we're out of the woods yet from a broad index standpoint,"" says Simeon Hyman, head of investment strategy for ETF firm ProShares.Small-cap companies are a riskier bet on the market. They may have puny balance sheets or iffy prospects. In 2016's choppy market, ETF investors have dumped them for the safety of large-cap names.Investors yanked $927.7 million from iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), the bellwether small-cap ETF, in January.However, IWM has paced the broader stock market as it has rallied in the past two weeks. The ETF briefly regained its 50-day line Monday for the first time since early December, before reversing on the stock market today.A slew of its quality holdings have started to emerge from the downtrend in the most bullish way possible -- gap-ups. Among the breakouts: Stamps.com (STMP), a provider of electronic postage services that has grown sales 20% annually for the past three years, Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH).Each leapt over buy points last week.Andy Kapyrin, director of research at New Jersey-based RegentAtlantic Capital, has watched the bounce-back for small caps with interest. But for now, he's waiting in the wings.Kapyrin is wary of small caps' underperformance, not just so far this year but over longer periods of time. He also finds their valuations unattractive. Plus, he thinks they run a bigger risk than more stable large-cap peers in a wobbling global economy.""They might be a better buying opportunity sometime in the future,"" Kapyrin said, adding that his company has a 50% underweight to small caps in its portfolio.Still, Kapyrin describes small caps as ""a great example of a part of the investment universe where you can look further afield than cap-weighted indices"" for successful investing.Smaller companies tend not to be well-researched. Picking stocks one at a time could be a chore. With alternatively weighted ETFs, investors may get to buy quality stocks without overpaying for names that have run up in price, Kapyrin said.He likes Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company (FNDA). The relatively young ETF is down 5% year to date through Feb. 26, vs. an 8% fall for IWM. It has also held up better than its older peer over the past two years.FNDA selects and weights stocks based on fundamental measures such as adjusted sales, retained cash flow and dividends. Its top three holdings out of 873 stocks are First Solar (FSLR), Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) and Verisign (VRSN), at about 0.3% of assets each.ETF investors can also look beyond large caps for quality by focusing on dividend-growing companies.ProShares Russell 2000 Dividend Growers (SMDV) boils down the 2000 stocks in the underlying index to 56 high-quality names.Hyman compared small-cap investing to hunting for a needle in a haystack. ""A lot of hands-on work as an old-school stock picker may not be as effective (as SMDV) in picking out these names,"" Hyman said.He describes dividend growth as ""a signal that is telling you that there is an opportunity for the stocks to outperform.""Small-cap dividend growers enjoy robust balance sheets and favorable industry dynamics, as well as a stronger ability to withstand market turmoil, despite their size, Hyman told IBD in a phone call.SMDV invests in companies that have grown dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.SMDV launched in December 2015. It's up 4% year to date.

517,UPS,"United Parcel Service (UPS) fell after warning that it may have to take a charge of as much as $3.8 billion related to a potential pension-fund obligation.The stock dropped as much as 2.3%, the biggest intraday decline since Jan. 20. The shares later pared the loss, trading essentially flat intraday on the stock market today.The U.S. Treasury Department is considering approving benefit cuts to the Central States Pension Fund to keep the multi-employer plan solvent. UPS pulled out of the fund in 2007 but agreed to make up any losses its remaining members experienced.The Atlanta-based company may have to record a charge of $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion if the government approves the benefit cuts, executives said on a conference call after reporting earnings Thursday. UPS plans to oppose such a move by the Treasury.“The market is reacting to the size of the potential liability and concern about the unknown impact to future numbers,” said David Vernon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “I think it’s overdone. This is an issue that’s going to be resolved in the courts regardless of what Treasury decides.”UPS reported that earnings excluding items rose to $1.27 a share, beating the $1.22 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 3.2% to $14.4 billion, the Atlanta-based company said in a statement. Analysts had predicted $14.6 billion.Executives attributed the higher earnings in part to a 15% increase in operating profit in its European unit. A 6% gain in business-to-consumer shipments helped propel U.S. domestic revenue up 3.1%.UPS had fewer disruptions to its air and road network in the first quarter than in previous years that were plagued with costly storms. The company also has been partly insulated from a slowdown in U.S. freight volume because of a growing reliance on e-commerce, said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.UPS fared well during the peak holiday season in November and December, delivering its crush of packages ahead of Christmas. Chief rival FedEx Corp. (FDX) was criticized for failing to beat the holiday deadline in some instances.

518,UPS,"China's up and down stock market and scrutiny from regulators have slowed but apparently not soured China-based companies that trade on Wall Street from preparing to delist in the U.S. and head home in search of better stock valuations.The process, though, ""is a bumpy road, definitely,"" ITG Research analyst Henry Guo told IBD.Take the case of Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), a Beijing-based Chinese security software and Web search giant that is one of China's biggest Internet businesses on Wall Street.Just a few years after its 2011 IPO and the stock's nearly 800% run-up from August 2012 to March 2014, Qihoo is near the last phase of delisting from the NYSE. The company announced in March that its shareholders had approved a previously announced plan to be taken private by a consortium of investors, in a deal originally valued at $9.3 billion.China Internet billionaire and Qihoo 360 CEO Zhou Hongyi has backed the deal.And Qihoo has a lot of delisting company.Last year, 28 Chinese-owned companies that traded in the U.S. stock market reported plans to go private, according to research firm Dealogic. That group includes Trina Solar (TSL), which in December announced that it had received a go-private offer as its U.S.-based listing became less appealing compared with higher-value domestic markets back in China. CEO Jifan Gao and an investment group submitted a bid to buy out shareholders, in a letter filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The 28 proposed delistings of China-based companies is up from just one in 2014 and 11 in 2013, Dealogic found.This is so even though, after touching eight-year highs in June 2015 and April 2015, respectively, the Shanghai composite and Hong Kong composite indexes have plummeted 45% and 30%, respectively.The fact that so many companies are making the move has spurred the China Securities Regulatory Commission to review such businesses, Bloomberg reported this month, quoting a commission spokesman as saying the panel is conducting ""in-depth analysis and research.""And, separately, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the Qihu deal specifically was having trouble with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange on the issue of moving the acquisition funds offshore. Anonymous sources told Bloomberg that China wants to avoid encouraging too many buyouts of overseas-traded companies that could increase depreciation pressure on China's currency.This year, as of early March, eight Chinese companies listed in the U.S. had announced going-private plans, Dealogic's data shows.Then in April, Autohome (ATHM), which provides online content for car buyers in China, announced that it had received a nonbinding management-led buyout offer for $1.6 billion, or $31.50 a share, from a consortium including Autohome CEO James Qin, Boyu Capital, Sequoia China and Hillhouse Capital.And leading China real estate company E-House (EJ) announced that company management would take the Shanghai-based business private for $6.85 per share. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year.Mobile social networking platform and dating app Momo (MOMO), which was originally backed by powerful China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA), is said by observers to have strong prospects for success with its go-private plan. But the news from the China Securities Regulatory Commission has seen its U.S. shares fall from near 16.50 to near 11.50, and U.S. shares of other pending delisters YY (YY) and E-Commerce China Dangdang (DANG) have plunged by similar percentages.Momo got a $2.6 billion offer last June -- just six months after the company held its U.S. stock market IPO -- from a group that includes some of its top executives. In early April, Alibaba made a regulatory filing showing it had joined the group seeking to buy out Momo, support that is expected to accelerate Momo's privatization prospects. Momo says it is the third-most-popular social app in China, after Tencent Holdings (TCEHY)-owned WeChat and Mobile QQ.Will the go-private movement strengthen or fizzle? Analysts are torn.""The problem is that, first of all, the China capital market is not that stable,"" analyst Guo said.China's capital markets sizzled last year, especially in the first half, making it much easier to raise money at a good valuation in China than in the U.S., Guo says.After a frenzied stock market sell-off in January that jolted the globe, China's markets have settled down, despite slowing economic growth. But the recent calm is not expected to last, as China's rising debt and ineffective economic reform programs could contribute to more shake-ups, according to a Wall Street Journal report.""You can see that the capital market in China is not that stable,"" Guo said. ""And we see a lot of companies who announced they were going to have a privatization haven't really proceeded as planned.""I think the reason behind that is they have had difficulty raising enough money to go private. And secondly, after the privatization, I think they see some difficulty going public again in China. I have not seen that many other companies who have made huge progress.""In the meantime, the process of relisting in China after leaving the U.S. ""is not an immediate switch-over,"" said Clara Gillispie, director of Trade, Economic and Energy Affairs for the National Bureau of Asian Research, a Seattle-based nonprofit research group. ""There are a lot of regulations that you have to go through and approvals you must get from investors.""Even in normal times, you have this big queue lined up. When you see the successful, hot market that you did at the beginning of last year -- that really put a lot more (companies) onto that train.""Gillispie said observers consider Qihoo 360 to be ""a bellwether"" of what lies ahead on the China go-private front.She called Qihoo ""a very large, successful company. They have done well in the U.S. market. How they sustain this transition can say a lot about the (go-private) process.""In the past, the tide for China companies has washed in the opposite direction. Chinese businesses have wanted to come to the U.S. to gain access to foreign capital and for the cachet of being publicly traded in the U.S.Think Alibaba. The China-based Internet conglomerate made the biggest-ever U.S. IPO when it raised $25 billion in its New York Stock Exchange debut in 2014.Chinese companies, though, found that being on Wall Street ""was not always an easy ride,"" said Daniel Roules, office managing partner of the Shanghai office of law firm Squire Patton Boggs, which has assisted China companies interested in privatizing.""A general perception grew that the U.S. was a difficult investment environment due to the regulatory hurdles and threat of litigation,"" Roules told IBD via email.That apparently has helped fuel the current go-private trend, even in the face of tumultuous times back in the Chinese stock market.Though Chinese companies traded in the U.S. that have considered re-listing in China could be holding off on their plans, Roules said, ""We will likely see a number of companies going private in the next few months and then deciding whether to re-list in China"" later on.Guo says going back to China remains a logical move for many Chinese companies.""From the longer-term view, it really is in their best interest to go back to China because they've got higher valuations there and they're closer to their consumers, who know the company's products well,"" Guo said. ""For the long run, that's the trend.""In the near term, however, the process isn’t easy, he says. Going private takes a lot of money and the process can take three to five years, he says.""For now,"" said Guo, ""management really needs to think about how to implement everything, to make a choice that's in their best interest.""

519,UPS,"Philosopher Jacques Maritain once observed that the shortcoming of modern times is ""the primacy of verification over truth.""Many people determine what is true and then forget about it, rather than let it nourish their lives, Maritain said.So it is with investing.The hardest challenge of investing isn't learning all the probability-based rules discussed in the book by IBD founder William O'Neil, ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""With time and effort, you can learn the rules. The big challenge comes after you learn the rules.The challenge? You must follow the rules!It's human nature to look for loopholes, exceptions, excuses --  any reason to ignore a rule. But that's the road to investor hell: a portfolio filled with ""exceptions"" that turn out to be exceptionally efficient at losing your money.One rule some investors have trouble following is the rule against buying extended stocks.A fundamentally strong stock that breaks out of a base in big volume shouldn't be bought after it rises 5% past the ideal buy point.Eventually an investor will encounter a situation where this rule seems like a real party pooper.You miss the breakout and then watch the stock rise day after day.""Surely, IBD doesn't believe I should follow this rule all the time,"" you say. (We do, except for certain gap-ups that skip the 5% range.)There's a simple reality that makes violating this rule risky. Most winners will rise 20%-25% and then begin consolidating. That's why investors should take most profits at 20%-25%.If an investor buys a stock that is extended 10%, 15% or 20% past the buy point, the investor often will be buying just in time for a downturn.And remember, not all breakouts make it to 20%. So you might be buying extended shares from the investor who bought properly and is now cashing in. Does that sound like a winning strategy?Southwestern Energy (SWN) broke out of a double-bottom base on Feb. 1, 2005, with a 53.19 buy point (1). Seven sessions later, the oil and gas developer closed at 57.71, up 8% and extended (2).After a 19% gain, the stock began to form a base on base (3). Investors who bought at the peak faced the 8% sell rule two days later (4). Those who bought only 10% extended saw a fleeting 8% gain and faced the sell rule four weeks later.This story originally ran Jan. 19, 2012.

520,UPS,"Walt Disney (DIS) shares plummeted late Tuesday on a second-quarter miss, as the House of Mouse noted a decline in both ESPN subscribers and the sports network's advertising revenue.But CEO Bob Iger sees a ""very robust marketplace and a very strong upfront"" season ahead for both ABC and ESPN, he said during the post-earnings call.Shares sank 5% late, after closing the regular session up 1.2%.ESPN didn't consume the Q2 call as it did during the previous quarter, but Iger did say that the channel's inclusion in over-the-top bundles correlated with some ""very encouraging sign-ups.""Instead, focus drifted to Hulu, which has become an ""important investment for us not just as a distributor but as a buyer of original product,"" according to Iger, and he put Hulu's recently announced live-TV package as a ""best of cable approach"" that lies somewhere between a big, expanded bundle and lighter packages, such as those from Dish Network’s (DISH) Sling TV.Disney is ""fully aligned"" with joint Hulu co-owner 21st Century Fox (FOXA) on a strategy for the over-the-top platform, he said, and doesn't foresee Disney having issues related to being both a content distributor and a content creator.The lookout for a successor to Iger's chief exec spot also came up, as Wall Street tries to anticipate who will take the helm of the media titan.Iger was mum on the circumstances of Tom Staggs' recent exit from the COO post, but confirmed that he has no plans to extend his contract beyond June 2018, when he is currently scheduled to step down as CEO.The board is ""actively engaged in a succession process as it has been for some time,"" he said, and the board believes it has ""ample time"" to identify a successor.The media conglomerate's Q2 earnings per share grew 11% to $1.36, excluding items, and revenue rose 4% to $12.97 billion, falling short of expected adjusted EPS of $1.40 on $13.19 billion in revenue.Media networks revenue, which includes the cable networks and broadcasting units, was ""relatively flat"" at $5.8 billion. Cable networks revenue fell 2%, while broadcasting revenue rose 3%.ESPN revenue rose, but advertising revenue notably decreased, and the company said affiliate revenue growth was ""partially offset by a decline in subscribers."" Iger had said in a February call that ESPN had experienced a slight uptick in subscribers in recent months.Studio revenue shot up 22% to $2.1 billion, bolstered by the theatrical success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and the recently released ""Zootopia.""Parks and resorts revenue rose 4% to $3.9 billion. The anticipated Shanghai Disney Resort opens on June 16.Consumer products and interactive media revenues fell 2% to $1.2 billion.Notably, Disney shuttered its Infinity console games business, taking a $147 million charge during the quarter. While the company ""did quite well"" with the first iteration and ""OK"" with the second iteration, console gaming is a changing business that ""we didn't have the confidence"" to stay in, said Iger during the call, asserting that Disney was better off staying in licensing than publishing.RELATED:Verizon, Disney Bury The Hatchet Over ESPN, Skinny TV BundleWhat ‘Captain America: Civil War’ Means For Disney Ahead Of Earnings

521,UPS,"Ten years ago Amazon (AMZN) launched Amazon Web Services, one of the earliest experiments with cloud computing that Chief Executive Jeff Bezos recently described as the planting of a ""tiny seed.""That seed has turned into a giant beanstalk. Sales for the unit, known as AWS, now are on pace to reach $12.5 billion for the year, based on first-quarter results.And thanks to its early entry in the business, AWS is now the leader in cloud computing, with a market share of 31%. The next closest competitor is Microsoft (MSFT) with 9%, followed by IBM (IBM), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud unit, and Salesforce.com (CRM).""This year, Amazon became the fastest company ever to reach $100 billion in annual sales,"" Bezos said in his April 6 letter, reflecting on the 2015 fiscal year. ""Also this year, Amazon Web Services is reaching $10 billion in annual sales, doing so at a pace even faster than Amazon achieved that milestone.""AWS is a collection of services, including storage, networking, application services and other features businesses pay to use on an as-needed basis via the cloud. It's a business that Bezos says has been built organically without significant acquisitions.In the first quarter, the unit had sales of $2.56 billion, up 64% year over year, compared with 28% growth in total company sales. AWS comprises 15% of total sales for the period, up from 11.7% a year ago.""The reason to hold Amazon stock is AWS,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., which owns 41,802 Amazon shares. ""AWS is the gem in the haystack.""Microsoft and Alphabet, in particular, are being aggressive with increased investments in cloud technology, said Morgan, which could create some risk of future pricing pressure. But it’s not a big concern in that Amazon has demonstrated the ability to weather price wars in times past, he said.AWS was a big reason Amazon reported its highest sales growth in nearly four years when it posted first-quarter earnings on April 28. The e-commerce powerhouse swung to a first-quarter profit of $1.07 a share, which crushed the consensus estimate of 58 cents, and swung from a loss of 12 cents a share a year earlier.Revenue jumped 28% to $29.1 billion, ahead of the $28 billion view. Amazon sees total second-quarter revenue of $28 billion to $30.5 billion, with the midpoint 26% above Wall Street forecasts of $28.3 billion.""Amazon has, in a lot of ways, become a part of everyday life,"" said David Smith, a vice president and analyst at research firm Gartner. ""It’s not just through the purchase of goods and entertainment. Even with AWS, people are in contact with Amazon in ways they don’t even know.""Amazon stock broke out April 13 and is up 10% since then, despite a selloff in the Nasdaq overall. Shares slipped in mid-April, then jumped 10% the day after Amazon reported first-quarter earnings. The stock ended Friday trading up more than 2% to 673.95 in the stock market today.Amazon received several price upgrades following the earnings report. One came from John Blackledge, a Cowen analyst, who upped his price to 830 from 750. Another was from Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities, who raised his price target to 800 from 685, with a research note titled ""Hitting on All Cylinders.""""This was a very strong report from Amazon,"" Seyrafi wrote, which he said was the result of strong top- and bottom-line growth, strong gains with AWS and international growth, which rose 26% to $9.6 billion. There is ""ample room ahead"" for continued growth in its core retail business, he wrote.That primary source of Amazon's revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers through its Amazon.com website, both in the U.S. and abroad. Revenue from this category, referred to in its earnings reports as electronics and other general merchandise, rose 31% in the first quarter to $20.55 billion.Growth was fueled by the increasing number of annual subscribers to Amazon Prime. Initially a free-shipping service, Prime's membership base has been a source of extensive and envious consumer loyalty for Amazon. The membership now includes access to Prime Video, a Netflix-like service, Prime Music, which provides free music streaming, and unlimited photo storage with Prime Photos.Nomura analyst Robert Drbul says Prime has helped Amazon in several ways.""We believe Amazon has established significant brand equity here in the U.S. and that its leadership position remains quite secure."" Drbul said in a research note after first-quarter earnings. ""While the size of its Prime base remains undisclosed, we believe the loyalty rivals that of the Costco Executive Membership base.""A part of Amazon’s success is its willingness to experiment in many ways with new products and services, something that Bezos says has been essential to the company's success.""To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment,"" Bezos wrote in the shareholder letter. ""We want to be a large company that’s also an invention machine.""Some experiments have flopped, like the Amazon Fire smartphone, while others have become unexpected hits, like the Echo, an in-home, voice-activated device that connects to WiFi. On request it plays music, read books, provides traffic and weather, helps people order pizza or request service from Uber, among many other features.Eventually, some analysts think Amazon could elect to get into the shipping business, much as it entered cloud computing services business with AWS. Like Amazon’s growing delivery capacity, AWS began out of necessity as the company built up its infrastructure to fulfill its own growing needs and expanded to serve other companies from there.There's evidence already that Amazon is on the road to compete with the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). For one, the company has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between fulfillment centers. Plus, Amazon announced an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s from Air Transport Services Group, in an effort to expedite delivery of goods.Amazon has said the additional shipping capacity is especially helpful during peak delivery times, which other shippers are overloaded.“This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers,"" Phil Hardin, Amazon director of investor relations, said on the company's earnings call, ""and we think it makes sense over the long term.""

523,UPS,"Propelled by the overall market, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds notched a 0.78% gain on average in April. The month's modest gain was far better than the losses of January and February.But it lagged the 1.7% gain by the average U.S. taxable bond fund tracked by Lipper Inc.Going forward, mutual fund managers expect more volatility, and many are looking for stocks with stable earnings growth that can thrive without a tailwind from a robust economy.In the just-completed month, multicap value funds did best among the mutual fund market capitalization and style categories.The key impetus was the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rate hikes.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders In a late March speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank would ""proceed cautiously in adjusting policy"" in 2016. In its April meeting, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee stuck by Yellen's March outlook and declined again to raise rates.""Economic activity appears to have slowed,"" the FOMC said, adding that household spending had ""moderated.""Those statements told investors that the Fed thinks U.S. economic growth is slower than previously believed. Slower growth and slower rate hikes mean a weaker U.S. dollar.""That helps U.S. exporters, which is good news for many U.S. large-cap stocks,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management.And a weaker dollar lowers the cost of paying off debt for most emerging markets, making it easier for them buy goods and services from the U.S. and others.Putting it bluntly, the Fed did not want to break a fragile U.S. economy by raising the price of money. ""The more dovish tone by the Fed brought down market volatility and helped support all of the assets that have been hurt in anticipation of Fed rate hikes,"" said Mark Hamilton, chief investment officer for asset allocation at OppenheimerFunds.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance Jittery investors lifted precious metals funds 28.76% in April, best among sectors. Energy funds and natural resources funds, which had lost 41.45% and 20.54% respectively in the two years that ended March 31, were the next-best-performing April sectors, jumping 11.62% and 10.46% last month.World equity funds gained 1.33% in April, led by Latin American funds' 6.59% leap up.Taxable bond funds were paced by high-yield funds' 2.89% advance. With investors willing to take on risk, safe-haven general U.S. Treasury funds slipped 0.33%.""I expect mediocre returns and a fair amount of volatility going forward,"" Hamilton said. When the Fed finally does get around to its next rate hike, volatility is likely to rise, he said.Broadly, he expects the U.S. economy to outperform for several quarters. That should benefit U.S. large caps.James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of $158 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX), expects a reversal of the recent months' rotation into value away from growth.""Materials, energy, industrials and other cyclical sectors are likely to reverse,"" Abate said. ""So we've taken the opportunity to amplify our positions in stable-growth-type companies, Nifty 50 type names. Key stocks for us are names like Amazon (AMZN), PepsiCo (PEP), Exelon (EXC) and Carnival Cruise (CCL). We sold the one energy stock that we held.""Amazon is the epitome of what he's looking for. ""It is strong and has a unique business model that can grow regardless of the economic backdrop,"" he said.Exelon is a utility with low cyclicality, he said. Its current return on equity is about 9%. ""This is roughly half its 15 year median return on equity,"" he said. ""We see incremental ROE moving higher with plenty of room to expand. With the Pepco (acquisition) closing, we see an increased focus on cost-cutting and rate relief in the regulated utility units contributing to profit margin expansion, with a strong balance sheet to allow future dividend hikes and buybacks.""Equally good, the stock is virtually unaffected by economic developments in Japan or Europe, he said.He also likes the idea that Carnival has almost nowhere to go but up from its depressed profit margins and returns on capital.And he adds Merck (MRK), which he calls another low-cyclicality, defensive name. ""It's got a strong drug pipeline,"" he said. ""It's seeing improvements in return on assets. It can be another Nifty 50 name.""Abate has stayed underweight in energy, industrials and financials. ""In materials, our exposure is to companies that are capable of growing and are not dependent on an acceleration in the global economy,"" he said. In that area, his names include Vulcan Materials (VMC) and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF).Abate says value stocks are unlikely to add a lot to gains they've scored already this year. ""So I'm embracing companies that are more stable and less sensitive to the ups and downs of the economic cycle,"" he said.He also does not rule out a correction of 20% to 25% some time during 2016, and his fund has hedged that possibility with put options.""Profits are disappointing,"" he said. ""Profit margins are decelerating. And there's a poor top-line revenue outlook. It's hard to see price-earnings multiples expand further.""Like Aguilar, Abate expects volatility the rest of this year. The best gains should be confined to a narrow band of stocks, he says. ""With bond yields low and other asset classes disappointing, we'll see a new Nifty 50 do well,"" he said. ""Diversification is good, but over-diversification can be bad. We're down to 52, down from the mid-60s in 2013.""Polaris Capital Management's Bernard Horn, lead or co-manager of five funds totaling $3.4 billion in assets, is concerned about the impact of sluggish economic growth. He used volatility in recent months to buy shares in larger U.S. and foreign banks at depressed prices, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM). ""The valuation became compelling,"" he said.He also added to asset manager Franklin Resources (BEN). ""They have great long-term performance, but have slumped in the last three to five years. We saw an opportunity to buy into a good long-term franchise with a lot of cash on its balance sheet. They have a relatively low tax rate because they have managers who sit offshore, like Mark Mobius,"" who's based in Hong Kong as executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group.Horn also added to Web.com Group (WEB), which creates and maintains websites for small businesses. ""They help small businesses get onto social media sites,"" he said. ""A business they just bought does sophisticated marketing and lead-generation for customers.""Another he added to was electronics and technology distributor Avnet (AVT), a company which also assembles products for customers. ""They've got a good management team that squeezes out free cash flow and value-added services for customers,"" Horn said.In Q1, he added to Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. The investment may not ripen quickly, he says. ""The Thai economy is a little soft now, so this may take time to play out,"" he said.

525,UPS,"The rap on Donald Trump is he’s all bluster. The New York Times says he’s offering “incoherent mishmash.” GOP rival Ted Cruz claims Trump has “no idea” how to fix the economy.Don’t’ believe it. The Trump campaign is putting forward proposals to fix problems facing the nation, from the long waits for medical care at the VA to the impending collapse of ObamaCare.  Check out Trump’s economic plan, for starters. Unlike Hillary Clinton’s radical anti-business agenda, Trump’s plan would actually help unemployed Americans get back to work.Trump slashes the corporate tax rate to 15%, down from the current 40%, the highest rate in the industrialized world. Not all American companies pay that staggering rate, but even after deductions and accounting maneuvers, companies in the U.S. end up clobbered with taxes nearly twice the global average (24%). In Ireland, a magnet for tax-weary companies, the rate is only 12.5%, and their economy is growing about three times as fast as ours. Conversely, Japan and Argentina are stuck in the doldrums along with the U.S., partly because of their high corporate tax rates.Trump also proposes a one-time 10% repatriation tax on profits U.S. companies made overseas and kept there to avoid the 40% rate. That bargain could lure back as much as $2.5 trillion in capital urgently needed here.To promote investing in plant and equipment, Trump would allow companies to write off the purchases the year they’re made, rather than over several years, as current law requires.Economist Larry Kudlow predicts that if Trump’s corporate tax plan becomes law, you’ll see “a tremendous movement of capital and labor back to the United States.”Trump’s lower 15% rate business rate would also apply to small businesses that usually get taxed at individual income tax rates. That would give a break to mom-and-pop operations, start-ups and other small businesses that are the source of most jobs.Compare Trump’s blueprint with Clinton’s nightmare scenario: Higher taxes, more tax complexity and an avalanche of new regulations. Over-regulation has depressed growth for the last 15 years.  The Obama administration suffocated business with 81,000 pages of new regulations in 2015. Hillary is pushing for even more -- with controls on hiring, pay, bonuses and overtime to promote “fairer growth.” Translation: gender and racial preferences, plus meddling in how much you get paid.Remember Obama’s statement, “You didn’t build that.” Well, Hillary assumes “you don’t own that.” Government will run your business. Hillary wants companies to stop maximizing quarterly earnings for shareholders -- what she derides as “quarterly capitalism.” She wants “farsighted investments.” Companies that can get out of the U.S. will rush for the exits.She’s even promising an end to “the boom and bust cycles on Wall Street.” As plausible as ending rainy days.Trump’s “make America rich” plan targets impoverished cities like Baltimore with incentives for companies to move there. For African-Americans, whose unemployment rate is twice as high as the nation’s overall, Trump has a four letter remedy: JOBS.For young blacks with no job experience, he’s got plans. One is borrowed from the left-leaning Century Foundation. Every summer, the State Department brings about 100,000 young foreigners into the U.S. to work in restaurants, camps and seaside resorts under J-1 visas. Trump says convert the program into a jobs bank for our own inner city youth.Meanwhile,  Hillary is stoking racial hatred, telling black voters they’re victims of “systemic racism” and meeting with Al Sharpton. Hillary says public schools should stop disciplining and suspending black teenagers who misbehave. But self-discipline is precisely what’s needed to succeed at school and on a job. While Hillary panders, Trump offers specifics to get these young people on the job ladder.Clinton’s always been tagged the policy wonk, but she’s just a cynical politician. Trump, who’s rolling out serious policies to get Americans working, is the real deal.

527,UPS,"AT&T is not your father’s or grandmother’s telephone company.Just take a look at the company's most recent acquisition, the $65 billion purchase of satellite television provider DirecTV in July. It's part of AT&T's (T) vision for its future, which revolves around investments in high-speed connectivity in wireless, broadband and satellite.AT&T stripped off the ""Ma Bell"" nickname eons ago and has come a long way since its forced breakup in the 1980s. Its purchase of DirecTV has firmly pushed the company into a new age of electronic communications, a business where it's getting tougher to maintain a prominent role.“It has been the industry’s most open secret that one day AT&T would buy DirecTV,” said Roger Entner, the founder and lead analyst with Recon Analytics, a telecom research firm. “AT&T was squeezed in the middle of the market. Verizon (VZ) had a stronger network, and Sprint (S) and T-Mobile’s (TMUS) wireless services were cheaper. So if you’re in the middle -- neither the best nor the cheapest -- you die. So they had to differentiate with their convergence strategy, to provide something nobody else has.”But while DirecTV is a key part of AT&T’s new vision for the future, Chief Executive Randall Stephenson noted in the company's fourth-quarter conference call with analysts that “it all has to be integrated.”Video will be a big part of AT&T’s integration strategy. The company is expected to soon announce details of a new video initiative, which likely will include new offerings on mobile phones, and with DirecTV playing a prominent role. DirecTV subscribers already are able to view more than 100 channels over their mobile phones.AT&T’s vision for an integrated communications company “is very compelling and very logical,” said Recon's Entner. “It’s mobile, video and the Internet of Things (including connected cars) all coming together.”The grand initiative is still in its early days, but AT&T has started out this year on a high note. Its unlimited, bundled data plan that rolled out in January gained 500,000 sign-ups within a few days.Still, AT&T’s mainstay wireless business has struggled. It lost about 1.5 million post-paid monthly subscribers last year, Entner says. In prepaid, however, it gained about 1.3 million customers, thanks to its highly promoted Cricket brand, which came by way of its acquisition of Leap Wireless in 2014.“They refused to participate in a price war on the post-paid side,” Entner said. “They would rather see customers leave than lower prices.”Verizon was more promotional, which helped it win new customers, but it “subdued profit growth,” Entner said. T-Mobile and Sprint have been especially promotional.AT&T suggests that patience is in order. Investments in next-generation networks, products and services “are providing us with a platform to project revenue growth into the future,” Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told IBD.As examples, he pointed to Net Bond, which provides cloud services, Network on Demand for easily changing bandwidth as needed, and integrated video offerings.Beyond AT&T’s forecasted double-digit consolidated revenue growth for this year, which factors in a significant contribution from last year’s DirecTV buy, the firm has not given any other revenue guidance.While AT&T’s total year-over-year revenue grew 22% in the fourth quarter to $42.1 billion, rising nearly 11% in all of 2015, to $146.8 billion, a large part of those gains were from DirecTV. It also bought two wireless companies last year in Mexico: Iusacell and Nextel Mexico.“If you actually sort out what is organic year-over-year revenue growth, it would actually be negative 4% for (the fourth quarter),” said Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. And because of changes in accounting methods after the DirecTV deal, “earnings growth is nearly impossible to sort out.”“None of (the accounting) is inappropriate. It’s just tremendously misleading during the period of transition,” he said. “You won’t see (clear) year-over-year trends until 2017, when they’ve had a full year of DirecTV under their belt.”AT&T reported adjusted earnings of 63 cents a share in the fourth quarter, up 12.5% from a year earlier. And for the full year, it posted an adjusted $2.71 a share, up from $2.56 in 2014. Management forecast EPS growth this year in the mid-single digit range, or around 4% to 6%.Analysts expect 5% EPS growth in both 2016 and 2017, according to polls by Thomson Reuters, on revenue growth of 14% and 2%, respectively.AT&T has gotten better at managing costs, Entner says. “And in the end, Wall Street cares about profits. If you’re getting more customers and losing money, that’s not a good situation.”But Moffett told IBD: “Right now it’s very hard to find the growth pockets in AT&T. Their wireless business is shrinking. Their wireline business has been shrinking for years. And their DirecTV business is showing some signs of growth, but only because of migrations from their U-Verse platform. The only part of the business that is growing right now is their corporate wireless services.”Corporate wireless is part of the company’s business solutions segment, a new category that emerged as a result of new reporting segments put into place last year after the DirecTV acquisition. Other business units now include entertainment, consumer mobility and international.“Without DirecTV, we would still have revenue growth from strategic services,” Stephens said, referring to such examples as security, hosting and high-speed broadband. Revenue growth in 2015 and in the fourth quarter “would have been in the low-single digits.”AT&T is spending for future growth. Its capital spending in 2015 came to more than $20 billion, and it expects to spend around $22 billion this year. About half of this year’s investments are earmarked for business solutions, especially focused on mobility and cloud applications.Having spent a combined $4.4 billion on the two Mexican wireless acquisitions last year, AT&T also now plans to spend $3 billion through 2018 to upgrade its network in Mexico to 4G LTE.“Mexico has been a bright spot. Customer growth there is very strong,” Stephens said.But business in Brazil and some other South American countries has struggled as economies there slowed. South American business came with the DirecTV acquisition.Analysts are paying close attention to how AT&T’s new initiatives will shake out.“They need to show results in a year to 18 months,” Entner said. “Investors are not very patient folks.”

528,UPS,"Amazon.com (AMZN) shipping got more expensive Monday, as the company announced it was raising its free shipping minimum 40% to $49.The move, of course, only pertains to non-subscribers of its Amazon Prime loyalty program, since those subscribers get free shipping on any order. Orders that include at least $25 of books remain free-shipping eligible.Amazon's latest move is likely intended to drive more Prime subscription growth and also cut down on shipping costs.Amazon stock rose 4.6% to 559.50 on the stock market today, moving back above its 200-day moving average for the first time since plunging below that mark on Feb. 3.Rival Wal-Mart (WMT) has a $50 threshold for free shipping. E-tail startup Jet.com uses $35 as its minimum, while Target (TGT) has a $25 minimum. Wal-Mart stock rose 1.5% on Monday while Target edged up 0.2%.Amazon's shipping costs have been ballooning as the company offers increasing rapid delivery times -- including one-hour delivery in certain markets via Amazon Prime Now. Those costs rose 37% year-over-year in Q4, to $4.7 billion.Rumors continue to swirl about the firm's long-term plans for its shipping program, as investors and analysts speculate that Amazon is interested in competing with established delivery companies such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Internal documents seen by Bloomberg seemingly support that theory. And, there have been reports of Amazon getting into the ocean freight business -- which one observers said could generate upward of $100 million in free cash flow -- as well as leasing cargo jets and making a large purchase of trucks to haul packages between its fulfillment centers. The documents seen by Bloomberg suggest Amazon is gearing up to compete more with China e-com leader Alibaba (BABA).Besides delivery costs, Amazon has spent billions of dollars on its fulfillment and sortation centers, the last step in the delivery process.Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer says Amazon.com captured 51% of all retail growth in Q4 2015.Amazon's Prime loyalty program offers free two-day shipping, as well as free streaming audio and video, among other perks.Analysts in general peg Amazon's Prime customer count near 40 million, with some estimates coming in as high as 50 million. Prime members, on average, spend about twice as much on Amazon.com than regular shoppers.Prime members accounted for 57% of Amazon's North American sales in Q4, and Prime members spend about 12% more every year, according to ITG Investment Research analyst Steve Weinstein.Nemer has told IBD that Prime is the biggest reason for Amazon's growth, which during the past two quarters has exceeded 20%.
"
529,UPS,"Ad tech firm Criteo saw its stock slip last year on fears that it would lose sales after consumer electronics giant Apple opened the door to ad blocking on its iOS devices.After all, Criteo (CRTO) embeds browser cookies -- tiny text files that let websites recognize users and their preferences when they return to a site -- for 52% of the 100 largest retail and travel websites in the U.S.Criteo gets paid for serving ads only if a user clicks on them, and it collects a bigger cut if the user goes on to buy a product from or otherwise engage with that advertiser. But Criteo bucked those concerns after the Apple (AAPL) ad-block threat didn't play out.In mid-February, the Paris-based company posted healthy Q4 earnings that showed rising numbers of clients, a continuing advertising partnership with social media leader Facebook (FB), efforts to invent ""disruptive products"" and plans to beef up its business in China, one of the world's largest e-shopping markets.On other levels, Criteo still competes with Facebook and is also a rival of ad networks run by major Internet companies, including Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and Amazon.com (AMZN).IBD recently spoke with Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland about what it's like being a Facebook ""frenemy"" and where the company will direct its efforts and resources this year.IBD: Wall Street worried that ad blocking might hurt your company's revenue, which depends on people seeing ads and then taking action. But impact has been minimal so far. Why is that?Fouilland: There has been considerable talk about ad blocking over the last two months, and there has been some overreaction about that topic. But ad blocking has been here for quite a long time. It's not a new phenomenon, although Apple made the announcement that iOS 9 would enable the use of ad blockers. But in reality, a maximum of 10% of the users worldwide are using ad blocking, primarily within desktop, although there is some use in mobile.Why do people use ad blocking? It's a very simple reason -- because they can’t stand the very intrusive ads that some industry players are using, in particular the pop-ups or pre-roll video type of ads that are very annoying. But we are not using any of those intrusive formats for one simple reason -- our business model is to create engagement. We get paid only if there is engagement with our ads. So we don't want to annoy anybody with our ads. We want to create an incentive for people by showing them very relevant ads, non-intrusive ads, to give them an incentive to click on the ads.IBD: What is your company's ad partnership with Facebook?Fouilland: Facebook has been our partner for more than three years. They have a lot of advertising inventories that they wish to monetize. We were an early partner with Facebook when they launched their first initiative, which was the Facebook Exchange, which they created to monetize their ad inventory on desktop. More recently, Facebook has been developing a new solution to monetize its ad inventory within the mobile application, as Facebook is more and more used through mobile. We have been the first partner in that effort, as they publicly disclosed in Q4 2014.IBD: Could Facebook eventually start offering that service themselves and then not need Criteo?Fouilland: They do not have the predictive capability (we believe) to predict the behavior of the user based on all the integrations that we have with advertisers. They don't have all of the breadth of relationships with advertisers, with integration into the shopping data of the advertiser. All of that is what we bring to Facebook.But we are in an industry where very often your friends are sometimes also your enemies. But in this particular case, I think we have a very mutually beneficial partnership, where we bring to them unique capabilities with respect to performance-driven advertising demand.IBD: Can you talk about your company's innovation efforts?Fouilland: Out of 1,800 people in the company, we've got 400 people in research and development. That R&D team is divided between Paris and Palo Alto. In the U.S., we have about 100 people on the West Coast.The core of our technology is machine-learning technology, and those are mathematical algorithms that predict the behavior of users. So the core is research and constant improvement on those algorithms.We have a team of 50 people working on a proof of concept on search marketing. We have a small team working on another concept of what we call offline -- how can we make the link between what is happening within your store to what is happening online.That's a very interesting field. You see more and more people going online and then searching for items in stores and vice versa -- people who look at products in the store and then go online to buy them. If you are able to link information about purchase intent in-store or online, it could offer new opportunities.We also have a proof of concept going on in the U.S. and Europe where we capture shopping intent data within stores, thanks to using beacon technology.IBD: In your industry, there are so many companies right now. Do you see consolidation ahead?Fouilland: If you look at performance advertising -- and particularly display advertising -- it's an industry where scale matters a lot. Today, if you look at the competitive landscape, most of our direct competitors that have emerged after us have been somehow acquired over the last 18 months.They were not acquired as a consolidation movement in the industry, but more because it became very clear for those direct competitors that they were sub-scale, and they joined broader groups.For example, TellApart has been acquired by Twitter (TWTR), and you've seen that Tesco-Dunnhumby in the U.K. acquired Big Data tech firm Sociomantic, which was another competitor in Europe.I would not call that a real consolidation, though, because it's not that the market has consolidated and there are only a few players left now. It's more that with some players ahead of the game, like ourselves, it was difficult for the new entrants who were sub-scale in this very much ""winner-take-all"" type of dynamic in our industry.Most of the smallest competitors have been acquired by larger players -- not that those smaller competitors are out of the market, but they are now under the umbrella of larger players.IBD: Will Criteo be looking to make any acquisitions this year?Fouilland: We've made four acquisitions in the history of the company, so we are active at (surveying) the market for good companies that could bring us complementary technologies. We are considering making acquisitions only if there is a strong rationale from a tech standpoint to ensure that it would help us accelerate our development.IBD: What is your company’s strategy in China? Is Alibaba Group (BABA) one of your customers there?Fouilland: We opened an office in Beijing two years ago, and we are in the process of opening another office in Shanghai. We have roughly 25 people on the ground in China. We made a significant investment last year in setting up a data center in Shanghai, the reason being that we ultimately manage a lot of data in order to target users. We are one of the very few international companies with data-center capabilities within mainland China. We now have the foundation for developing domestic demand in China. That's certainly an area of focus for us in 2016.I can't make any comment specifically about Alibaba. We have partnerships with multiple large players in China.

530,UPS,"What does it take to own an IRA? Brass.That's a one-word summation of the answer that emerges from a new study of IRA ownership traits.""Like other investing households, the majority of IRA-owning households were willing to take some investment risk for financial gain,"" Sarah Holden and Daniel Schrass write in a new report for the Investment Company Institute (ICI).The portion of IRA holders willing to take investment risk inched up in recent years, their report says. Starting in 2012 and again in 2013, 28% were willing to take substantial or above-average investment risk. That edged up to 29% in 2014. It increased to 30% in 2015.The ICI found that IRA-owning households were more willing than Americans in general to take investment risk. In the same years, only 19% of all American households in 2012 and 21% in 2013 to 2015 were willing to take a lot or above-average investment risk.The correlation between risk-taking and IRA ownership is important for the overall retirement readiness in the U.S. because IRAs are widespread and reliance on them is increasing.More than 40 million households had an IRA as of June 30, 2015. That was 32.2% of households. Those people's IRAs held $7.3 trillion in assets at the end of the third quarter in 2015.That made up 31% of total U.S. retirement market assets. That was up from 18% two decades earlier.All together, 60% of U.S. households had retirement plans through work or IRAs by 2015. That includes the 28% of households that had only employer-sponsored plans, such as 401(k)s and traditional pensions.To many investors, risk boils down to the difference between the ups and downs they can expect from an investment in stocks in any given year and the typical lack of volatility of cash.Large-cap stocks averaged an annual return of 10.05% from 1926 through 2015, according to Morningstar Inc. Cash, in the form of 30-day Treasury bills, averaged 3.42% a year.""Not an investor on the planet wouldn't want the return on stocks,"" said Mark Chandik, president and chief investment officer of FDP Wealth Management, in Irvine, Calif. ""But can they live with the potential downside?""Since 1926, the worst annual performance by large-cap stocks was their 43.34% loss in the Great Depression year of 1931. Their best was a 52.62% gain in 1954.Those swings were much wider than cash's 0.02% setback in 1938 and its 14.71% gallop ahead in 1981.But investors also need to know how often an investment will deviate from its usual performance. One tool for figuring that out is standard deviation, which Chandik uses to explain risk to clients. You can find the measure for every mutual fund on the ""Ratings & Risk"" tab of its Morningstar.com page.The smaller the number is, the less a fund tends to veer from its average annual return. For example, $211 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX) has a 3-year standard deviation of 10.93. That means that in about 2 out of every 3 years -- or about 68% of the time -- the fund's return will be within 10.93% of its 11.13% three-year average annual return, based on month-end results.And about 95% of the time you can expect its yearly return to be within two standard deviations, or within 21.86% of its typical return.The more risk you're willing to take, the higher a standard deviation you'll be able to stomach for any fund you're considering for your IRA.So you can look at the standard deviation of a mutual fund, ETF or stock and decide if you're willing to accept the amount of price fluctuation indicated by the standard deviation.

532,UPS,"Amazon.com (AMZN) shares plunged in early trading Friday, after the e-commerce leader late Thursday fell well short of earnings estimates and also came up light on revenue.Earnings per share shot up 122% vs. a year earlier to $1 a share, excluding various items. But that didn't come close to views for $1.56 among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Sales rose 22% to $35.7 billion, ending two quarters of accelerating growth and slightly missing forecasts for $35.98 billion. Revenue would have risen 26%, excluding foreign-exchange swings.Amazon.com stock was down 9.5% after the opening bell in the stock market today, near 575.Shares had closed up 8.9% to 635.54 in the regular session. The stock more than doubled in 2015, though like much of the rest of the market, it has struggled in January. As usual -- CEO Jeff Bezos has said that he will always put the customer before profits -- Amazon is spending heavily on its business, logging a 20.5% increase in operating costs to $34.6 billion.Bezos said in the earnings statement that 2015 was the first year the firm passed $100 billion sales and 300 million customers.Memberships in Prime, Amazon’s customer loyalty program which offers free two-day shipping and free video streaming among other services, grew 51%. Prime is one of the key drivers of the company’s core e-tail business.Prime has more than 50 million members in the U.S alone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.Compared with Amazon's fast-growing sales, eBay (EBAY), the largest U.S.e-commerce rival, posted lackluster sales growth during the holiday shopping season. EBay also offered lower-than-expected guidance for 2016. Shares plunged 12.5% on Thursday, though Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer says that the sell-off was too hasty.In Q4 2015 Amazon said that Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, hauled in $2.4 billion in revenue, up 69% over the year-earlier quarter. In the earnings statement, the company said AWS is now available across 12 geographic regions around the world and that it launched 722 significant new services in 2015.Several analysts have upped their price targets in recent weeks because of AWS's strong performance and potential for growth. Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju believes that the company’s capital expenditures in cloud computing are going to begin to decrease in the near future.It’s worth noting that the firm faces vigorous competition from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which recently hired former VMWare (VMW) CEO Diane Greene to lead the consolidated team.Microsoft shares rose in after-hours action after the software giant reported better-than-expected results, led by its Azure cloud unit. Alphabet, which reports Monday, fell 1% late.Though many analysts are bullish because of AWS, others have begun to speculate that the company is going to get into the shipping business and compete with the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). Amazon has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between fulfillment centers. It's also rumored to be running a cargo-flight operation out of Ohio, leasing 767 jets, and it's even getting into the ocean-shipping business.The thinking, according to several analysts, is similar to how Amazon got involved in cloud computing: As a result of the firm's own needs -- holiday web traffic surges require enormous data centers -- it eventually realized that it could sell excess capacity at a substantial profit. It's possible in the future that people may be able to ""ship with Amazon.""""I would say that what we’ve found, that to properly service our customers at peak, we need to supplement our partners' services,"" CFO Brian Olsavsky said on the call. ""It’s not meant to replace them. Carriers are no longer able to handle it at peak. We’ve had to add some resources on our own.""Amazon sees Q1 sales of $26.5 billion to $29 billion, or growth of 17% to 28%. The company does not offer EPS guidance but expects operating income of $100 million to $700 million, compared with $255 million a year earlier.Wall Street has forecast Amazon will earn 77 cents a share non-GAAP on revenue of $27.7 billion.

533,UPS,"Once again, the emails gave the Environmental Protection Agency away. An EPA official was caught red-handed with full knowledge of the danger of an environmental spill at Colorado's Gold King Mine in emails discovered by the Denver Post, but the agency downplayed any knowledge of the hazard to the public. As 3 million gallons of lead, cadmium and other chemicals polluted the Animas River, the EPA pretty well tried to downplay the severity of that, too. The revelation, as John Hinderaker of Power Line points out, comes as news breaks of the EPA issuing a draconian, ruinous punishment for the owner of a company that didn't have a storm plan.At the same time, the EPA was caught knowing all about the lead-contaminated drinking water in Flint, Michigan, according to emails, but planned to just let the public keep drinking, never mind the toxin.So much for the agency's mission to protect the public from heartless environmental polluters. Apparently there's honor among thieves, and if the villain is government, the racket will be protected. Public safety is no longer the top mission -- protecting the bureaucracy is.Just as bad is the constant pattern of deception in communications -- not just in Flint or at Gold River but in largely unpunished transgressions of EPA officials, who used home emails and false names to prevent public scrutiny. Remember Richard Windsor?With so many caught-out efforts to deceive the public, it's pretty clear that the EPA has a pattern of criminality, a cultural problem stemming from corrupt attitudes, if not corruption itself, at the top.The emails all show cover-ups, false spin and evasion of public scrutiny, and point to one area badly in need of reform when the agency is eventually hosed out -- that of continuous access to public records.Would it be too much to require that all EPA communications from now on be revealed automatically to the public in a matter of months after they are released -- and penalties be increased for anyone deceiving the public through email?

537,UPS,"No precious metals portfolio is truly balanced without significant exposure to the benefits of silver. Silver is much cheaper per ounce than other precious metals, making it easily divisible for smaller hypothetical purchases and trades. For this reason, silver has a long history of both being currency and backing currency. Today, you can more easily take advantage of price swings, and we expect many of those, especially to the upside in 2016.The outlook for industrial applications of silver remains strong for 2016, especially domestically. The solar power industry is hitting new strides and is hungry for silver in its manufacturing process.Silver prices were hit hard in 2014 and remained low in 2015, artificially low in the opinion of many experts. It remains well below the all-in costs of production, and those forces are coming to a head in 2016. Mines are being forced to cut production or close, even as demand is through the roof! Is 2016 the year the price of silver explodes?Read on for some compelling reasons silver could be just the strength your portfolio needs in the coming years.There are five reasons why investors are flocking to silver in 2016.1 - The Supply SqueezeWe wrote in our 2015 Silver Report that:""Silver prices were hit hard in 2014, and as a result the mining sector had little capital to invest in exploration and quite a few mines were forced into consolidation. This sets the table for an impending supply crunch.""Sure enough, we are seeing the next step of this prediction play out. It is being reported now that silver mines are cutting production quite drastically. One of the major mines, Endeavor Silver produced 7.2 million ounces in 2015 and is cutting that by 25% in 2016. We pointed out that the price of silver, in spite of strong – you might say runaway – demand, was being manipulated to far below production costs, and this was going to create turmoil on the supply side. Well, it is happening. But prices are still low and the supply has not dried up so much that you cannot still get your hands on some silver. How long that will be the case, however, is anyone's guess.For reference, this chart shows Silver Eagle sales in 1996 vs 2015. What do you think a supply squeeze will do to price with this kind of demand?This insatiable demand for silver coins says something about economic expectations on the parts of consumers. Silver, like gold, is a contrarian asset that retains value when currencies are inflated away. Our central bank has done more than its fair share of money creation in the last several years. So far, those trillions are sitting on balance sheets like an avalanche waiting for a gunshot. When the next economic crisis is triggered, perhaps by continued low oil prices, or contracting China demand, war or something else, silver is one of those assets you will be glad you own.2 - The Gold-Silver RatioBoth gold and silver prices have had valuation struggles of late. Silver has had a rougher ride, however. Silver prices were hit particularly hard in 2014, falling nearly 20% while gold was down just 1%. Silver has remained below production costs through 2015 and the case can certainly be made that the price cannot remain this low much longer. Silver performance woes have pushed the Gold-Silver Ratio (GSR) to new heights.The GSR is a simple calculation that measures how many ounces of silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold, and it helps to establish the relative value of the metals to each other. When the ratio is high, silver is said to be a strong buy due to its lower cost and when the ratio is low, investors typically turn to gold. The ratio's historical average for the 20th century was 47. Thus far in the 21st century, the GSR is averaging about 60. At the time of this printing, it is alarmingly close to 80. It rarely reaches above the 80 mark and the last time it did was during the crisis of 2008.A GSR at this level suggests that silver is currently selling below its value and as the ratio has been pushed to its upper limits, a correction is likely to follow. Clearly the GSR must realign at some point and since silver prices are already tracking so low, that moment is drawing near. Buying silver while the ratio remains high and silver prices are trending low … could very well be the optimal investment move.3 - Coin Mintage Keeps Getting Better and BetterThe coin minting industry is benefitting creatively and artistically from booming demand for silver bullion coins. Every year the quality and beauty of the newly designed coins ups the bar and 2016 is no different. Coin design is no longer just about stamping a dead politician and a landmark on a silver round. There are fine silver coins commemorating historic events, dinosaurs, the aurora borealis, even comic book superheroes! And the designs are as breathtakingly beautiful as they are interesting to look at.Lear Capital is proud to be the exclusive U.S. retailer of several high quality coins. This year we are the exclusive U.S. retailer of the fourth coin in the continuing arctic animal series – the stunning and majestic 2016 Snow Falcon. Struck by the Royal Canadian Mint, this coin contains 1.5 ounces of 99.99% pure silver, making it IRA eligible. (It also comes in a ¼ ounce gold version.) The bird depicted on the reverse is the arctic gyrfalcon, prized since ancient times as a hunting companion. This largest of the falcon species is associated not only with falconry, but royalty and nobility as well. It also serves as an emblem for various governments and organizations, and is the official mascot for the United States Air Force Academy. The obverse is struck with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.The demand sparked by increasing designs and interests represented is evidenced in demand and sales numbers from mints around the world. 2015 and prior years were plagued with sales interruptions and delays because mints were selling out of their coins as fast as they could strike them. With prices as affordable as they currently are, 2016 is projected to be no different.If you'd like a copy of this full report with the other 2 reasons why investors are flocking to silver in 2016, please visit Lear Capital.

538,UPS,"Location, location, location.That’s the classic real estate mantra. And it’s one that has served Chicago-based Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS) well. ELS is a real estate investment trust that has an operating or ownership interest in 387 properties in the U.S. and Canada.It operates both manufactured home communities and RV trailer resorts (which once were known by the currently industrially incorrect name of trailer parks).ELS earns most of its revenue by renting sites that allow owners of manufactured homes and RVs to park their dwellings. ELS then provides electricity, water, sewer and cable hook-ups, along with a broad range of amenities that appeal to the retiree, second home and mobile sets it hosts.But the key is location. ELS sites are typically near enough to big cities to bill themselves as having urban as well as getaway appeal. And, as analyst David Toti of BB&T Capital Markets observes: “They like to be near water.” Near enough to the Pacific Ocean or Gulf of Mexico, for example, to have resort appeal beyond the basic amenities. Florida and California are leading ELS sites.“It’s a high quality portfolio that’s skewed towards retired customers,” noted Citi Research analyst Nick Joseph.Manufactured home, or MH, sites rent for an average $570 a month. MH communities might offer amenities including a clubhouse, swimming pool, tennis, bowling and shuffleboard.The trailer resorts are keyed to an active -- and somewhat younger -- demographic. Equity LifeStyle offers site rentals on an annual basis -- as well as passes that allow trailer owners to park at different sites for a limited period. The RV business has been ELS’ core growth driver. In the fourth quarter, RV revenues grew by 7.9%, Chief Financial Officer Paul Seavey reported in a January 26 conference call.Equity LifeStyle Properties' business has improved as the financial crisis has receded. Many consumers are looking for affordable and venturesome vacations. And aging baby boomers are looking for social venues where they can plant vacation and retirement homes. ELS management feels the demographic winds are at its back. “Our key demographic, the Baby Boom generation, is turning 65 at a rate of 10,000 people per day, and we are prepared to meet their needs,” CEO Marguerite Nader said on the January earnings call.For all of 2015, ELS reported normalized funds from operations -- a key metric for REITs -- of $3.04. That represented a gain of 9.7% over 2014, according to CFO Seavey. He offered guidance of $3.20 per share for 2016.After deducting expenses, REITs distribute at least 90% of net income to shareholders in the form of dividends. For 2015, four dividend payments totaled $1.50. The dividend will rise to $1.70 in 2016. The 2015 dividend amounts to a roughly 2.3% yield on a recent stock price around $64. The planned hike would bring the yield to 2.7%.That’s enough to attract many yield-hungry investors who might otherwise see ludicrously low returns on savings accounts, certificates of deposit and other savings vehicles annihilated by the Fed’s low rate policies.BB&T’s Toti describes the dividend as “very strong.” That’s the result of a relatively solid balance sheet and a business that has high barriers to entry. Zoning permits, for example, often are one high hurdle. And many current community owners are reluctant to sell what is often a stable business.Paul Adornato, analyst with BMO Capital Markets, estimates that rentals of manufactured home sites accounts for 55% of ELS revenue. Most homes are owned by ELS customers, but during the financial crisis the manufactured home distribution network wobbled and ELS had to step in and buy some homes itself. Rentals of ELS-owned homes account for 2% of ELS revenue. Meanwhile, ELS has been trying to sell its own home inventory, producing roughly 4.5% of total revenue, according to Adornato. ELS prefers not to own homes as they “tie up capital,” he observed.The leasing of RV sites brings in about 21% of revenue. ELS also has income streams from investments and from the utility services it provides.Some analysts see ELS as a stable investment vehicle with limited growth prospects. Toti describes ELS as a “slow and steady low-risk option.”“Nobody’s building new manufactured home communities,” he explained. As a result, “it’s very difficult to acquire new communities.”This pretty much confines ELS to organic growth. “ELS is the quintessential tortoise,” said Toti. But that’s not so bad. “Right now the tortoise is in favor in the investment community.”Apart from making its dividend more attractive, Fed rate policies have helped ELS by capping borrowing costs.  “The cost of their debt is low,” Toti said. ELS also has little exposure to the floating rate debt that weighs on some corporate balance sheets. Rising rates -- more an over-anticipated fear than a reality -- would likely hurt ELS less than more leveraged borrowers.After taking advantage of suppressed lending rates to refinance debt, ELS has lengthened debt maturities. Just 7% of ELS debt will mature by the end of 2017, notes Citi’s Nick Joseph.  “Overall, they have lower leverage than the average REIT.”

539,UPS,"Ray Charles had the odds stacked high against him ever becoming a musical superstar.He was reared by his mother in segregated Florida during the Great Depression without indoor plumbing.He was totally blind from age 7. To learn piano music, he’d feel the Braille dots with one hand while he played it with the other, then do the reverse and memorize the combination.After his mother died when he was 14, he acted up in school and was expelled.But Charles became a hit maker in genres from jazz and blues to country and pop, inventing the fusion known as soul music and winning 17 Grammy Awards.In Charles’ memoir, “Brother Ray,” co-author David Ritz recalled, “I never met anyone braver. He had no fears. He walked through the world like a lion. If anything, his handicap gave him an edge. … His mind was quicker than yours, his memory better, his instincts keener. Keeping up with him required resilience.”Charles (1930-2004) was born Ray Charles Robinson in Albany, Ga., and grew up in Greenville, Fla. At 3, he was fascinated by a cafe's boogie-woogie pianist, who put the kid on his lap and gave him lessons.But at 5, a thick mucous began coming out of his eyes, probably juvenile glaucoma, and he lost his sight. His mother was sick and knew her son needed to learn to be entirely on his own, so she told him to find his way around with a cane, listening to sounds and counting steps. By the time he was in his teens, he could cook and type.Sent to a school for the blind in St. Augustine, Fla., at 14, he played with two bands and learned how to get into sync with the other musicians. He worked hard at new songs, jammed offstage, listened to radio and records and improved how he sang. “Musically, I was raised during a time of absolutely no compromise,” he wrote. “I’ve always felt the need to perfect my skills.""After leaving school at 15, he moved around Florida trying to make a living with different bands. His skills progressed, but he didn’t like segregation, so he moved to Seattle.He was soon in demand there, and he met his lifelong best friend and occasional arranger, Quincy Jones, recording his first songs for an independent label. The producer changed his stage name to Ray Charles to avoid confusion with boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson.In 1950, Charles moved to Los Angeles, which would be his home base for the rest of his life. The next year he had his first national hit with “Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand.”Also in 1951, Charles wed Eileen Williams, but they divorced a year later. He married Della Howard in 1955, and they would have three children, Ray Jr., David and Robert, before their divorce in 1977.In 1952, his label was going broke and his contract was bought for today's equivalent of $22,300 by Ahmet Ertegun, co-owner of Atlantic Records, who was about to become an industry legend and make Charles famous.During the ups and downs of his early career, Charles kept himself emotionally stable by reading his Braille Bible and reciting the Lord’s Prayer, as his mother had taught him.In 1955, he had had a best-selling single with his own composition, “I Got a Woman.” A synthesis of rhythm and blues, gospel and jazz, it was the first example of what came to be called soul music. It was followed by the success of his blues song “A Fool for You.”By 1959, Atlantic was the top independent label, and Charles was reaching beyond blacks to a broader audience that now had him on the road 300 days a year. The same year, he had another smash with “What'd I Say,” which was highly unusual at eight minutes long and the result of improvisation at a concert. Later that year came the big-band pop sound of “The Genius of Ray Charles,” his first album to break into the pop Top 40.But ABC-Paramount Records made him an offer he couldn’t refuse: ownership of his master recordings, something few artists have ever had (Frank Sinatra had to create his own record company to get them). Charles was also made his own producer, unheard of for a singer, which meant he made a lot more if a record was successful but shared the risk if it wasn’t.In 1960, Charles had his first ABC hit, with “Georgia on My Mind” going to No. 1.Billboard said it “packs a powerful emotional wallop, with violins and chorus backing a big sound.” The next year, he was scheduled to perform in Augusta, Ga., but canceled after being informed that the dance floor would be for whites only. A year later, he performed at the same venue because it had been desegregated, and the state adopted “Georgia” as its state song in 1979.In the early 1960s, Charles had an album (“Genius Hits the Road”) on the pop charts for 82 weeks and two No. 1 songs with “Hit the Road Jack” and “I Can’t Stop Loving You.” The last was from his first country album, “Modern Sounds in Country and Western,” which ABC had strongly opposed because no black singer had ever had success in that genre. It was the label’s first album to sell over 1 million. He also created his own publishing firm to be able to collect royalties on his compositions and songs he purchased.“Today, many more artists own their songs and run their own companies, but few with Ray’s grasp of business or attention to detail,” Michael Lydon, author of “Ray Charles: Man and Music,” told IBD. “Ray was a true entrepreneur and took pride in the control he had over his work.”In October 1964, Charles was arrested in Boston for drug possession and was facing the horror of 60 years in prison. He decided to take a year off at 34, the first long break he had taken since he was 15. He reflected on all the musicians he had known who had died or gotten into big trouble with drugs and feared how his being in prison would affect Ray Jr. He checked into a rehab hospital to kick his habit cold and was put on probation.In December 1965, he had two songs in the Top 10 for the first time in two years. But as the pop music world was increasingly dominated by rock groups, Charles went his own way over the next four decades with innovative albums in a variety of genres that were critically hailed but sold modestly.Charles’ last album, “Genius Loves Company,” was recorded in 2003, after he was diagnosed with cancer. Between treatments, he sang duets with fellow stars B.B. King, Nora Jones, Willie Nelson and Elton John. It sold 7 million copies when it was released in 2004, making it the most successful album of his career, but he had died two months earlier at age 73.A film about his career, “Ray,” was finished in time for Charles to screen a rough cut, with Jamie Foxx winning the Academy Award for best actor.At his funeral, which drew 1,500 of his closest friends, the singers ranged from Stevie Wonder to Glen Campbell, a testimony to his influence.Charles' estimated net worth was $50 million, said Lydon, but that doesn’t include the real value of the master recordings. “They’re like Rembrandt canvases, truly priceless, and might be worth at least as much as the rest of the estate,” he said.Sinatra called Charles “the only true genius in the business,” and Rolling Stone magazine ranked him No. 2 on its 2008 list of “The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time,” behind Aretha Franklin.His former headquarters in Los Angeles is now the Ray Charles Memorial Library, which preserves his legacy and supports music teaching in schools.One of the greatest musicians and singers in the history of popular music.Overcame: Opposition by record labels to his innovations.Lesson: To make a real difference, sign on for big, calculated risks.“I never wanted to be famous. I only wanted to be great.”

541,UPS,"Well, which canary is it?After Big Data analytics software maker Tableau Software (DATA) disappointed investors with Q1 and 2016 guidance well below Wall Street expectations -- sending its stock crashing 49.5% Friday to an all-time low -- Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury questioned whether Tableau ""will prove to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.”Nandury was referring to Tableau and prospects for its growth. But later Friday, in a research report, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley posed the identical question: “We wonder if Tableau will prove to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.” Ashley's canary was much bigger.“With among the smallest deal sizes and shortest sales cycles in enterprise software, Tableau theoretically would be the first to see any downturn in new pipeline business due to a macro weakness,” Ashley wrote, questioning whether other enterprise software vendors might follow.Investors got the point. Tableau rivals Splunk (SPLK) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) fell 23% and 15%, respectively, and little Hortonworks (HDP) -- which may have been Big Data’s first canary with a 37% gap down Jan. 19 after a poor earnings report -- fell 17%, also hitting an all-time low.Closing Friday at 8.48, Hortonworks is not only below its December 2014 initial public offering price of 16, but is also below the 9.50-a-share price Goldman Sachs set Tuesday for an 8.425 million-share secondary offering. Hortonworks' Jan. 19 dive came after it filed with the SEC to raise $100 million in the secondary offering, coming after the worst opening two weeks of any year in the market's history. On Tuesday, Hortonworks said in its new SEC filing that it had raised only $77.19 million, before expenses.Evercore ISI analyst Bill Whyman told IBD on Friday, however, that he stands by his research issued Jan. 26, in which he acknowledged tech companies face continuing “weak” demand, but not so weak that stocks should be “falling off a cliff” like they have so far this year.“The harder question is: Are stocks anticipating that demand will fall off a cliff six months from now?"" Whyman said. ""The evidence to date does not make this our base case.”He expects 6% global tech revenue growth for 2016 vs. 2% in 2015, and offered a mixed bag when looking at sectors. He advises overweighting portfolios with software and Internet stocks, underweighting communications equipment and computing, and market-weighting (neither buying nor selling) semiconductor stocks.“We forecast ‘not-pretty-but-we’ll-take-it' overall,"" he said.Late Friday, however, his Evercore ISI colleague Kirk Materne, sang a tougher mine-canary tune, “as software officially enters the pain cave.""“If you wanted a cathartic event to wipe out any remaining optimism in the software space, (Tableau’s) earnings report was it,” Materne wrote in a research note. “Ironically, the idea that a license-based, visualization tool vendor (Tableau) that is facing growing pains would cause a 10% pullback in Adobe (ADBE) or 14% pullback in CRM (Salesforce.com (CRM)) would seem like a stretch, but welcome to the new reality.“While most of the major ‘blow-ups’ year-to-date in software have been more company specific (at least in my view) vs. a dramatic change in the fundamental backdrop, the reality is no one cares, and the broader de-risking in the sector is unlikely to end until we see a strong quarter from one of the higher-quality growth names like CRM or Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (and the stock actually goes up) and/or until some of the smaller names throw in the towel and M&A picks up.”Palo Alto Networks stock fell 12% Friday, part of the general downturn.Database leader Oracle (ORCL), which is still trying to accelerate its cloud business, fell 1.9% Friday, in line with Friday’s broader market decline. IBD's entire Computer Software-Database industry group fell 15%.Other big names in the enterprise software market tumbling Friday included SAP (SAP) (down 3.6%), Salesforce.com (13%), Workday (WDAY) (16%) and Manhattan Associates (MANH) (9%). IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group fell 8% Friday to a 2-1/2-year low.Qlik, CyberArk Software (CYBR), FireEye (FEYE) and Hortonworks are all scheduled to report earnings in the coming week, with the pressure on.

542,UPS,"Investors in income stocks typically hold for the long term. They're less interested in the daily or weekly ups and downs of a stock than whether it can deliver modest, but dependable, dividend increases year after year.So whether a stock is setting up in a base or not is of less interest that it would be to a growth investor hoping to catch the next rally.But on the theory it's good to get off to a good start with a stock, there are numerous stocks breaking out that are on IBD's dividend leaders list that are setting up in bases.Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG) is in the late stages of forming a cup base. It's New Jersey's largest provider of electric and gas service with 2.2 million electric and 1.8 million gas customers.It also owns a feet of power plants with more than 13,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.The company pays a regular quarterly dividend of 39 cents a share, which works out to an annualized yield of 3.7%. Earnings have not grown much in the past few years. The five-year annualized growth rate is a negative 2%.Duke Energy (DUK) serves 7.3 million customers in the Southeast and Midwest. It announced Thursday it's selling its international business, which consists of generating capacity in South and Central America.The stock has made a strong upward move the past two weeks and might be forming the right side of a base. The stock pays an 82.5-cent quarterly dividend, which works out to a 4.2% annualized yield.Another utility, Great Plains Energy (GXP) might be forming the right side of a base. It pays a 26.25-cent dividend, which equates to a 3.6% dividend yield.

543,UPS,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

544,UPS,"About 12.7 million people enrolled in ObamaCare plans this year, which is almost 9 million fewer than had once been expected and 1.4 million fewer than the upper boundary of its revised enrollment forecast.Nevertheless, Health and Human Services secretary Sylvia Burwell declared the year ""a success"" and claimed that enrollment ""exceeded our expectations.""""The marketplace is growing and getting stronger,"" she said, ""and the Affordable Care Act has become a crucial part of health care in America.""In reality, ObamaCare enrollment has hit a wall.At 12.7 million, total enrollment at the federal and state-run ObamaCare exchanges has ended up in the middle of range of the administration's sharply lowered enrollment forecast, which they said could be anywhere from 11 million to 14.1 million for 2016. The Congressional Budget Office had previously expected enrollment to hit 21 million this year.Sign-ups through the HealthCare.gov site -- which is where people from 38 states go to get ObamaCare plans -- climbed 828,405, hitting 9.6 million, in contrast with 8.8 million at the end of open enrollment last year. Enrollment in two states -- Arizona and Indiana -- actually declined.The administration says that just over 3 million signed up through the state-run exchanges this year -- which include New York and California. That's an increase of only about 224,000.All these numbers, it should be noted, are highly inflated because they include people who haven't actually paid their first premiums. Last year, the 11.7 million who the administration claimed had ""enrolled"" dwindled down to about 9 million by the end of the year.HHS says that this year, it has been subtracting cancellations during open enrollment, unlike previous years, and so the rate of decline going forward might be less than in the previous two years.Still, there's little evidence to support Burwell's other claim that the marketplace is getting stronger.Aetna just this week warned that the ObamaCare exchanges appear ""unsustainable,"" and UnitedHealth Group said last fall that it might bail on ObamaCare next year. Meanwhile, many of the biggest insurers providing coverage through ObamaCare have been reporting losses, and more than half of the nonprofit insurance co-ops that ObamaCare created have already failed.""Most insurance companies are losing money today under Obamacare because not enough healthy people have signed up. They were hoping that the 2016 enrollment would change that. It has not,"" noted industry analyst Robert Laszewski.He says that the reason for the flat enrollment this year is simple: ObamaCare costs too much.""If you are solidly in the working and middle class in this country, individual health insurance on the state and federal exchanges is anything but affordable,"" he explained.
"
545,UPS,"At the close of the third sign-up season for ObamaCare, 12.7 million people had selected plans, the Obama administration reported on Thursday. It's not yet clear how many of those are paying customers, though well more than 1 million will likely never submit a payment, based on last year's experience.While the Obama administration, as always, hailed the results as evidence the public insurance exchanges are working, it is clearly bad news. Even with an individual mandate penalty for going without coverage -- a minimum of $695 per uninsured adult in 2016 -- half or more of those eligible for subsidies still haven't enrolled.The news is bad for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), who had hoped to see a broader, healthier risk pool and are now questioning the sustainability of the exchanges. Above all, it's bad for millions and millions with modest or moderate incomes, who faced an unhappy choice between paying for a plan they couldn't afford or paying a fine and praying that they'd stay healthy.Supporters argue that the reason so few people are signing up is that they don't know enough about ObamaCare. Yet there's a much simpler explanation as to why people would spurn ObamaCare coverage as such a bad deal that they'd rather risk paying a penalty: Either the silver-plan premiums are too high for them to afford -- even with subsidies -- or the common $6,000-plus deductibles make bronze plans of marginal usefulness.While the Obama administration thinks it's a success when anyone signs up for a plan, it's hard to see why. Preliminary data suggest that many of the new enrollees may have opted for a low-cost bronze plan to avoid a fine -- even if the unrealistic deductible would torpedo their finances if they actually have a health emergency.The Urban Institute estimated that 24 million people would be eligible for exchange subsidies this year. The Congressional Budget Office had projected that an annual average of 15 million people would receive subsidies this year, but last month it cut that estimate to 11 million. The data released by HHS on Thursday suggest that 10 million or fewer subsidized customers will hold policies once payments are submitted, and that number is likely to dwindle as the year progresses.After three years of enrollment, it's now fair to say that the reality of the individual mandate penalty is much harsher than the way that the Obama administration advertised it. Back then, the White House described it as ""a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance -- even though they can afford it.""The lack of any sizable jump in enrollment from last year's 11.7 million signup total is sending a jarring message. Consider that HHS pushed enrollment this year by saying most people qualifying for subsidies could get a plan for $900 or less this year. So why would people risk throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash on a penalty? The message is that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.As insurers continue to have their earnings pressured by the individual exchange business, and as the backlash over the individual mandate builds, it will increasingly become evident that the individual exchanges can't be made to work well unless Congress rolls up its sleeves and fixes them. That would surely require a major rethinking of the law.Department of Health and Human Services officials explained that the 12.7 million sign-up figure understated the gains from last year's 11.7 million figure. That's true to an extent, because perhaps 300,000 people who haven't paid already have had their applications discounted. New York also steered about 200,000 people with income up to 200% of the poverty level from private plans into a government-run version of ObamaCare. That, in itself, was an admission of ObamaCare's affordability shortcomings.Officials continue to celebrate one enrollment data point: Four million ""new"" enrollees signed up for coverage in the 38 states using HealthCare.gov. If that were the case, why did total HealthCare.gov sign-ups rise by less than 1 million? There's a simple reason: ""New"" is defined to include anyone who had previously signed up but never paid, or stopped paying their premium by the fall of 2015. In other words, new enrollees include the usual suspects.

"
550,UPS,"That's the finding from global outplacement consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which said in a report issued Tuesday that after a strong start in October, holiday hiring among retailers slowed in November and December. Overall, seasonal employment gains slipped 1.2% from 2014, making it the second straight year in which holiday hires fell, the report said.
"
551,UPS,"Retail employment rose by 745,800 workers in the last three months of 2015, according to an analysis of non-seasonally adjusted government employment data by Challenger. The holiday hiring total for the last three months of 2015 was down from the 755,000 workers added in 2014. That was 4% lower than 2013, when nearly 787,000 seasonal workers were added to retail payrolls, the report said.

562,UPS,"Facebook’s (FB) capital spending boom is giving data center stocks a lift.Facebook last week said it plans to increase 2016 capital spending to $4 billion-$4.5 billion, up about 70% from 2015’s $2.52 billion. Facebook continues to be a bright spot for data center operators, as spending moderates somewhat at Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Apple’s capital spending in the December quarter, its fiscal Q1, rose 12% to $3.6 billion. Apple has forecast about $15 billion in current fiscal year spending, with some of that going to such areas as retail stores and manufacturing equipment, such as robotics technology. It spent $11.24 billion last year.Facebook reported Q4 earnings on Jan. 27 well above Wall Street expectations. Shares of data center players Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and DuPont Fabros (DFT) rose on Thursday and Friday, but Digital Realty stock was down a fraction in morning trading in the stock market today, while DuPont Fabros stock was down 3%.“Stock prices of data center wholesalers Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros increased meaningfully after Facebook reported Q4 results,” said Evercore ISI in a research report. “Facebook uses a combination of in-house and third-party development, and is currently the No. 2 customer of DFT and No. 5 of DLR, respectively.”Amazon, Microsoft and China-based Alibaba Group (BABA) are other key companies to watch for spending trends, says the report.The data center market is divided among wholesale providers, such as Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros, and retail operators, such as Equinix (EQIX). Wholesale providers sell huge amounts of space through contracts that run several years. Retail operators sell less space over shorter periods and provide more specialized services, mainly hook-ups to high-speed data networks.Both Digital Realty and Equinix are viewed as possible buyers of data centers that Verizon Communications (VZ) might sell, analysts say.Data center operators such as Equinix provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the warehouse-sized data centers with their own computer servers and other gear. Cloud computing -- especially whisking data to mobile devices -- has increased demand for data center space, which has also been driven by the rise of social networking and online gaming.Image provided by Shutterstock.

"
578,UPS,"Jihad: In the past three weeks, the president twice misled the American people about the terror threat. Now there appears to be a third strike: assurances the San Bernardino terrorists acted alone. That doesn't hold up, either.On Sunday, Obama told the public that the Muslim terrorist couple who shot 35 people in a government office Dec. 2 were not ""part of a broader conspiracy here at home."" That, like previous statements, is proving premature, if not bogus.We've since learned Syed Farook's mother is under FBI investigation for possible complicity in the attack, which killed 14. Rafia Farook, 62, was living in the terrorists' Redlands, Calif., home, where Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik made pipe bombs and accumulated a massive cache of ammunition totaling more than 7,000 rounds. A UPS driver said that he dropped off more than a dozen packages a day at the address in the week leading up to the attack.Investigators, moreover, found shooting targets, GoPro camera packaging and vise-grip tools inside a Lexus registered to the mother. ISIS terrorists have used helmet-mounted GoPros to capture grisly footage during their attacks. Rafia's daughter-in-law had sworn allegiance to ISIS.The FBI is also tracing large money transfers from Farook to his mother, including at least three transfers of $5,000 in the days before the shooting. The son received a mysterious loan of $28,500 before the attack.Investigators, who already have grilled the mother for more than 10 hours, are also looking into a certificate of membership made out in her name from a Pakistani-tied Islamist group — the Islamic Circle of North America. ICNA supports an Islamic caliphate and promotes teachings of a notorious jihadi preacher from Pakistan.Meanwhile, ABC News says that Farook's father ""has been placed on a federal terrorist watch list"" known as TIDES. The father told an Italian newspaper that his son supported ISIS and hated Israel, yet he never told authorities about his radicalism.Both he and the mother insist they knew nothing of their son's murderous plans. The more we hear about the Farook family, though, the more suspicious we get.Then there's Farook's long-time neighbor and friend, whom agents are investigating for purchasing the two assault rifles used in the attacks. Enrique Marquez — a Muslim convert who attended mosque with the Farook family — bought an M&P15 semi-auto rifle and an A-15 semi-auto rifle for his pal.Now investigators are also looking at a possible foreign connection to ISIS recruiter Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan, a Somali refugee who immigrated to Minneapolis before fleeing the country as a wanted terrorist fugitive. Farook is believed to have had contact with Hassan, wanted in connection with the recent ISIS-led terrorist attack in Garland, Texas.Other reports indicate that Farook's plot included other targets involving a larger cell. San Bernardino police are investigating suspicious behavior by two Middle Eastern men at a local movie theater less than 48 hours before the attack. And Los Angeles police are looking into reports of a man matching Farook's description and another man casing a downtown high-rise.So Obama has now fumbled the terror ball three times in just the last three weeks with claims that ISIS is ""contained,"" there are ""no credible threats"" to the homeland, and the San Bernardino attack was not part of a broader conspiracy.After he's created such a demonstrably false sense of security, how can an increasingly fearful American public trust this president when it comes to terrorism? With such gross incompetence, how can anyone have confidence that he can protect us and our families?

596,UPS,"New ObamaCare exchange enrollment via HealthCare.gov continued to lag behind last year's pace during Thanksgiving week. That's an unwelcome sign for the insurance industry and the Obama administration, which has been expecting the ramping up of the individual mandate to boost new sign-ups by as much as 30% this enrollment period.Comparing new enrollment with last year's sign-up period is tricky, because this period runs from Nov. 1 to Feb. 1, while last enrollment season went from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15. As the mid-December enrollment deadline for being covered on New Year's Day approaches, activity will pick up.So ObamaCare supporters needn't panic yet that HealthCare.gov has signed up only 714,000 new customers through the first four weeks of open enrollment, nearly 40% below the 1,176,000 through four weeks of enrollment last year.Still, even comparing the last two full weeks of November with the same period a year ago, new enrollment ran 6% below last year's pace.ObamaCare Stakes High In 2016The stakes are high for ObamaCare in 2016: UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, says that it may bow out of the individual exchange business if it can't turn a profit this year. Other insurers, including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM), marked down their expectations after seeing a big outflow of customers in the third quarter. While they're expressing patience, a weak enrollment year could lead to another big round of premium hikes for 2017.A ruling on the House lawsuit against the Obama administration for spending never-appropriated billions on cost-sharing subsidies will come during the spring, and a victory for Republicans would cast further doubt on ObamaCare's future.So far, the Obama administration is releasing data for only the 37 states whose exchanges are operated by HealthCare.gov. New enrollees include anyone who didn't hold an exchange policy when they signed up in the current enrollment period — even if they had signed up previously and dropped their coverage for whatever reason.New enrollment is only part of the equation. Getting current members to re-up also matters. So does getting people who sign up to pay for coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services expects up to 14.1 million people to sign up, including as many as 5.4 million new members, but it sees paid enrollment falling to a maximum of 11.4 million at year-end 2016.Some analysts see 11.4 million as a low-ball estimate. In any case, a total of 5.4 million new sign-ups doesn't look likely, since the pace of sign-ups is running behind last year's total, which ended below 4.2 million.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

(HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to the largest tech merger ever in Dell/EMC (EMC).""Dell offered $67 billion in October to buy EMC.""That said, it has been a tough road for many of these traditional tech stalwarts such as Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM), Cisco (CSCO) and HP, as investors have gotten used to seeing lackluster growth on a quarterly basis in light of the massive secular and company-specific challenges these mature tech vendors face,"" Ives said.""The lone bright star in this cloudy large-cap enterprise tech space has been Microsoft, which is gaining momentum into 2016, as (CEO Satya) Nadella has made some tough decisions ('ripping the Band-Aid' off Nokia, cost cutting, free Windows 10 download strategy) to put (Microsoft) on the yellow brick road to the cloud.""We believe the combination of the Dell/EMC deal, Amazon (AMZN) (Web Services') laser focus on the cloud and Nadella's 'golden child' success has put more heat in the kitchen for CEOs such as (IBM CEO Ginni) Rometty, (HPE CEO Meg) Whitman, (Oracle co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd), and (Cisco CEO Chuck) Robbins to change from their 'treadmill approach' heading into 2016 and to focus on M&A and/or organic growth initiatives.""FBR's top 10 merger-and-acquisition wish list for 2016, ""in no particular order,"" Ives said, are:• (1) Cisco and NetApp (NTAP),• (2) Cisco and FireEye (FEYE),• (3) IBM and Splunk (SPLK),• (4) IBM and Qlik Technologies (QLIK),• (5) HPE and Box (BOX),• (6) HPE and Qlik,• (7) Oracle and Verint (VRNT),• (8) Oracle and NetSuite (N),• (9) Microsoft and Imperva (IMPV), and• (10) Microsoft and Qualys (QLYS).""... we believe EMC/Dell has disrupted the landscape and will force many of these mature tech stalwarts to finally be more aggressive in 2016 instead of fretting about valuations, as they need to focus on putting fuel back in their near-empty growth tanks,"" Ives said.

599,UPS,"Monetary Policy: Fed Chair Janet Yellen thinks the economy is so strong that the central bank can start raising rates this month. So why are Democrats alarmed? Because they know that the ""Obama recovery"" is hollow.It's true there have been marginal improvements in key economic indicators since 2008, as would be expected following the worst downturn since the Great Depression.But the ""recovery"" that was touted so loudly by Democrats until last year has also been the worst ever — 2% average growth. Now they're worried about the prospects of even a tiny hike in interest rates by the Fed.""God's plan is that things rise in the spring, and so if you want to be good with the Almighty, you might want to delay (raising rates) until May,"" Rep. Brad Sherman, the California Democrat, joked after Yellen testified before Congress last month.Stand-ups aside, what really frightens Democrats is the political fallout of a rate hike imposed prematurely. As a Politico headline bluntly asked, ""Could An 'Accident' By Janet Yellen Derail Clinton?""Yellen doesn't seem to think so. ""I currently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market,"" she told the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday, implying that with unemployment near 5% and annual inflation close to the Fed's target of a 2%, a rate hike might come soon.Contrary to what the Democrats say, the recovery was never that good to begin with. And contrary to Yellen, it's not that strong now. When the nation's top central banker touts a 5% jobless rate, she does so knowing virtually no economist treats that number as real anymore. Most agree the ""real"" unemployment rate is 10% or so.Worse still, the economy is way below par. By our calculations, current GDP is $2.3 trillion less than it should be, based on median postwar recoveries. That's $19,000 less income for every American household.Speaking of which, median family incomes have fallen since 2007. How can this be called a recovery at all, especially after seven years of zero interest rates?As for the future, things may not be so rosy.• Banking giant Citigroup says there's a 65% chance of a recession next year.• The Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index has fallen to its worst level since 2009.• The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow index for the fourth quarter dropped to 1.4% this week, well below market forecasts of 2% to 3% GDP growth.• Brazil, Russia, India, China — the BRICs — have tumbled into steep slowdowns, recession or, in the case of Brazil, depression. Europe is barely growing, and Japan is contracting. Global recession, anyone?As global growth hits the skids, the European Central Bank is moving toward negative interest rates. Meanwhile, the Fed is set to begin raising rates.One of these central banks is very, very wrong.Given so much doubt, now is not the best time for the Fed to start ""normalizing"" interest rates. And, no, we don't worry about ""derailing"" Clinton's presidential campaign. Voters will do that. We do worry about derailing what remains of the post-Obama economy.

602,UPS,"Signet Jewelers (SIG) and Tiffany (TIF) reported disappointing third-quarter results Tuesday, reflecting regional slowdowns in luxury purchases and sluggish tourist spending amid heightened economic anxiety.Signet Jewelers missed on all key fronts, with weaker sales at its higher-end Jared stores weighing on results. It also sees Q4 EPS of $3.40-$3.60, below views for $3.59, and comp sales growth of 3.5%-5%.Third-quarter same-store sales rose 3.3%, aided largely by bridal sales, but that figure was shy of forecasts for 3.5% and a slowdown from a year ago. Same-store sales for Jared fell 2.7% but rose 7.1% at Kay.Revenue, as well, missed expectations, growing 3.3% to $1.22 billion, shy of views for $1.23 billion. Earnings per share jumped 57.1% to 33 cents, but that still came up short of estimates for 39 cents.CEO Mark Light said the company was ""currently experiencing an encouraging start to November particularly at Jared and Zales.""But shares closed down 4.1% on the stock market today on the disappointing results.Adjusted gross margin of 30.6% was flat from a year ago and was hurt by the credit mix resulting from softer sales at Jared compared with Kay.""As Jared typically has higher-credit-quality customers than Kay, this led to greater net bad-debt expense,"" Signet said. ""This mix shift unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately $4.5 million.""The company's e-commerce sales grew 12.7% to $50.5 million, even though the company has largely grown in spite of e-commerce, with most customers opting to buy expensive jewelry in person at stores.Meanwhile, the stronger dollar, broader consumer anxiety and weaker foreign tourist spending in the Americas cut into Tiffany's Q3 results, prompting the company to now see fiscal year EPS falling 5%-10%, worse than a prior forecast for a 2%-5% decline as well as consensus views for a 4% decrease.Q3 EPS dropped 8% to 70 cents, below estimates for 75 cents. Sales fell 2% to $938 million, missing, but rose 4% on a constant-currency basis. Same-store sales rose 1% on a constant currency basis, but fell 5% otherwise.Comps in the Americas region fell 9%, the company's largest by sales, dragged by ""sharply lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., which management attributes to the strong U.S. dollar"".Japan was the only segment to show a same-store sales increase on a GAAP reported basis, up 9%, on stronger tourism and demand from native shoppers, the company said.But investors and analysts seemed to be OK with those numbers. Shares reversed earlier losses to finish up 3.6% Tuesday.""3Q wasn't great and 4Q guidance was reduced but it is not the extreme weakness we believe many had been fearing,"" Citigroup analyst Paul Lejuez said in a note, according to Barrons. Cowen & Co., meanwhile, praised the company's ability to keep costs in line.Tiffany in general is more exposed to the ups and downs of foreign tourism spending than Signet. Tiffany gets around a quarter of U.S. sales from foreign tourists.Tourism spending on shopping in the U.S. was estimated to fall in the third quarter, RBC Capital Markets noted last week, with more Chinese tourists, whom by some measures account for a third of worldwide luxury spending, going to Japan and Europe.The terrorist attacks in Paris this month could also discourage spending, Cowen noted last week.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

(VFC) were more insulated.Under Armour gets 14.4% of its sales from Dick's, Piper Jaffray said, while Nike gets 2% of sales from the athletic retailer and VF Corp. likely draws less than 2%.Dick's said in its Q3 earnings release that inventory rose 13.1% during the quarter, and that it was ""working with its vendors to reduce its exposure to slow-selling merchandise by returning product, canceling orders and securing markdown allowances.""""While we note that this will throw yet another cautionary blanket on the athletic vendor group,"" Piper Jaffray said, ""we believe it is important to gauge exposure and risk appropriately. Not all brands are created equal.""Shares of Under Armour fell 5.6% to 85 on the stock market today, closing below its 200-day moving average for the first time since April 2013.Nike and VF Corp. didn't fare as badly, down 0.7% and 1.3%, respectively. VF Corp. has a variety of apparel brands, from Nautica to Vans to Wrangler jeans.Dick's gapped down 10.5% to 36.53 after tumbling as low as 33.42, the worst since January 2012. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) sank 4.8% to a 5-year low. Hibbett Sports reports earnings on Friday.Warm Weather Chills SalesDick's also said that its fourth quarter would be marked by a ""more promotional environment"" and that it will work to ""actively manage our inventory levels."" The rise in inventory, Sterne Agee CRT said in a note Tuesday, was likely in part due to ""slow selling cold weather product"".Dick's CEO Edward Stack said in the earnings release that ""record warm weather in more seasonal categories"" offset a stronger showing in athletic apparel, footwear and accessories. He also said that same-store sales growth in the quarter initially got a boost from the back-to-school season but that sales fizzled as the quarter progressed.Macy's (M) and other retailers also have warned of excess inventory due to warm weather.Dick's consolidated Q3 same-store sales grew 0.4%, well below expectations of 1.9%. Dick's earnings per share increased around 10% to 45 cents, missing views by a cent. Net sales rose 7.6% to $1.642 billion, just beating estimates.The company sees full-year EPS of $2.85-$3.00, well below Street forecasts for $3.20. Dick's said it expects Q4 EPS of $1.10-1.25, well short of views for $1.41.The results came a week after Piper Jaffray cut its price target on Under Armour to 97 from 105, citing the company's recent management shake-ups.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

659,UPS,"The just-started enrollment period for ObamaCare exchange plans in 2016 is likely to yield one of two dismal outcomes. In the first, enrollment soars as people sign up in droves for the cheapest plan available to avoid the individual mandate tax penalty, whose minimum bite will spike from $325 to $695.
"
660,UPS,"Although the law's strongest backers might celebrate this, it's not clear why: Millions of modest-income individuals who opt for bronze would get policies with deductibles as high as $6,850. Yet the Obama administration's own analysis reveals that among those still uninsured, 80% have less than $1,000 in savings.

"

"
665,UPS,"Why would people spurn coverage if the alternative is throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash? The jarring message would be that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for insurance — especially for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.
"
666,UPS,"It's hard to imagine that the Democratic Party, which rails against income inequality, is prepared to tax away about 3% of pre-tax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage which may be of little use to them.

"

672,UPS,"This Isn't RomneyCare
"
673,UPS,"Although the individual mandate was tested on a small scale in Massachusetts, that mandate actually bore little resemblance to ObamaCare's. In 2013, the Massachusetts penalty was a lot smaller: $240 up to 200% of the poverty level and $468 up to 250% of poverty. But the RomneyCare mandate didn't need to be as forceful because modest-income households were mandated to buy policies with $0 deductibles, so the coverage was likely to provide real benefits.
"
674,UPS,"ObamaCare silver plans provide extra cost-sharing subsidies that limit out-of-pocket health expenses for those earning up to 250% of the poverty level. Yet, so far, most modest-income individuals are forgoing that extra support by choosing bronze or going uninsured.

"
677,UPS,"There's some truth to that. But ObamaCare is having trouble making the sale to millions of people who have kicked its tires. In the 2015 enrollment period, 11.7 million sign-ups in late February dwindled to 10.2 million paying members at the end of March, with the biggest drop among those who selected bronze. At least another 3 million people registered for coverage but never chose a plan.

"
681,UPS,"Some in this group might envy the deal offered via the exchanges. In 2015, people earning $20,000 could get subsidized bronze coverage for $400 or less on the exchanges. But ObamaCare rules made those subsidies off-limits to $20,000-earners who were offered bronze-like coverage for no more than $1,900. The good news — well, not exactly good — these members of the working class won't face a $325 penalty at tax time in 2016 if the coverage they turned down cost at least $1,600, about 8% of income.The just-started enrollment period for ObamaCare exchange plans in 2016 is likely to yield one of two dismal outcomes. In the first, enrollment soars as people sign up in droves for the cheapest plan available to avoid the individual mandate tax penalty, whose minimum bite will spike from $325 to $695.Although the law's strongest backers might celebrate this, it's not clear why: Millions of modest-income individuals who opt for bronze would get policies with deductibles as high as $6,850. Yet the Obama administration's own analysis reveals that among those still uninsured, 80% have less than $1,000 in savings.Thus, landing in the hospital could torpedo the finances of many who buy bronze plans — exactly what ObamaCare was supposed to fix.The second scenario, in which enrollment sees only modest growth, as the Department of Health and Human Services projects, is even bleaker.Penalty Better Than 'Coverage'?HHS says that most exchange enrollees will be able to get coverage for no more than $900, meaning that it won't cost much more than the mandate penalty and for many it will cost less.Why would people spurn coverage if the alternative is throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash? The jarring message would be that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for insurance — especially for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.It's hard to imagine that the Democratic Party, which rails against income inequality, is prepared to tax away about 3% of pre-tax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage which may be of little use to them.Consider the options for single 27-year-olds earning $24,000 a year, or just over 200% of the poverty level, who live in St. Louis.The cheapest coverage available is the lowest-cost bronze plan from Coventry, a division of Aetna (AET), for $960.

698,UPS,"Alfred Hitchcock relished the cinematic equivalent of trick or treat. The legendary film director, called the ""Master of Suspense,"" was an expert at giving the audience what it wanted — and feared.In the process, Hitchcock became as big a star as the actors in his films. His mere name conjured up anticipation of intelligent, psychological cinematic suspense and mystery. Queen Elizabeth even saw fit to knight him for his contributions to film.""We all enjoy, shall we say, putting our toe in the cold water of fear,"" Hitchcock (1899-1980) said.In ""Hitchcock on Hitchcock,"" edited by Sidney Gottlieb, the moviemaker said he was influenced by Edgar Allen Poe, trying to put in his films what the poet/author put in his books: ""a perfectly unbelievable story recounted to readers with such a hallucinatory logic that one has the impression that this same story can happen to you tomorrow.""And how Hitchcock loved doing it. ""My purpose is, as I have indicated, purely sinister,"" he said gleefully. ""I find that the easiest way to worry people is to turn the tables on them. Make the most innocent member of the cast the murderer; make the next-door neighbor a dangerous spy. Keep your characters stepping out of character and into the other fellow's boots.""Hitchcock set the standard for fear, suspense and mystery with movies like ""Psycho,"" the 1960 classic. He didn't depend on explicit, bloody gore or gruesome scenes.Look Out""It's what you don't see that frightens you, what your mind fills in, the implicit usually being more terrifying than the explicit,"" he said, as quoted in ""It's Only a Movie"" by Charlotte Chandler.In 1963's ""The Birds,"" his signature mastery of building tension turned our innocuous flying friends into frightening villains.Hitchcock directed more than 50 feature films, including such other hits as 1935's ""The 39 Steps,"" 1954's ""Rear Window"" and 1959's ""North by Northwest."" His first American film, ""Rebecca,"" won the 1940 Oscar for Best Picture.Hitchcock received the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award in 1979 and a British knighthood a few months before he died in 1980.Eighteen years later, his likeness appeared on a U.S. postage stamp.Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, John Carpenter, William Friedkin and Martin Scorsese are some of the directors who have said Hitchcock influenced them.He directed huge stars: Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman, Laurence Olivier, Henry Fonda.The mystery meister also was mischievous. ""Suspense doesn't have any value if it's not balanced by humor,"" he said.Accordingly, one of his movie trademarks was to interject himself in cameos. It was all part of a larger intent. ""My cameo appearances were a deliberate move away from realism, reminding the audience it's only a movie,"" he said.He shared that perspective with Bergman as she stressed over a role. He aimed to settle her down and garner a top performance.On TV, he made his mark with the ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" anthology series, which explored his scary themes. The program ran from 1955 to 1962 and turned into ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour"" through 1965. Time magazine lauded it in 2007 as one of the best 100 shows of all time.Hitchcock was the creator and executive producer of ""Presents"" and directed some episodes.The series' iconic opening-title sequence featured a caricature of Hitchcock's profile and the theme music, ""Funeral March of a Marionette"" by Charles Gounod, as the camera panned to the genuine article saying, ""Good evening.""The host then introduced each episode with humor and irony.Actress Janet Leigh, the doomed heroine of ""Psycho,"" lauded his ""meticulous detail"" and perfectionist streak in her foreword to 1999's ""The Alfred Hitchcock Story"" by Ken Mogg. She added that the director ""was fearless in pursuing the unexplored, the unusual. . .. His genius will live forever.""Cinematographer Jack Cardiff told Chandler: ""Practically all of Hitchcock's energies were spent on preproduction. Everything was worked out in detail, every page timed.""That included the right actors in all of the roles. ""He was very particular about casting,"" daughter Pat Hitchcock recalled.Actor Karl Malden, who worked with Hitchcock on 1953's ""I Confess,"" called him ""the calmest director I ever saw, never ruffled, never any sign of being worried, never shouted, always in control.""When Malden eventually asked the director what he expected, Hitchcock answered: ""You're a professional, and I'm a professional. I simply expect you to do your job.""British Start Toward ExcellenceHitchcock saw his feats as ""a case of the cobbler sticking to his last. I think you have a sort of instinct which pushes you toward what you can do best, and once you have found it, it becomes a habit to keep on doing it.""Born in London, Alfred grew up with strict parents. He was pudgy, and other children belittled him.""I wasn't a popular type, so I was forced to live in my imagination, and I believe that helped me to develop my creative resources,"" he said. ""I don't need much stimulation from the outside world.""After losing his father at age 15, Hitchcock attended St. Ignatius College and then the University of London. He found his niche in art classes and later used his skill to draw the caricature for ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents.""After leaving college before graduating, Hitchcock worked as a clerk at W.T. Henley Telegraph & Cable Co. and found his way into the advertising department. That led to designing ads, brochures and the company's employee magazine, for which he later wrote.On To The Big ScreenPassionate about movies from childhood, he entered the film industry in 1920, working at Famous Players-Lasky, the forerunner of Paramount, in London.His first duty was designing title cards for silent films. He moved up to stage setter, art director and assistant director within a few years.""I did whatever odd job had to be done around the office while spending as much time as I could in the studio watching the films being shot,"" he said.Hitchcock is officially credited with directing his first film in 1922, the unfinished ""Number 13.""He spent the next few years as co-director and scriptwriter.His directing career took off in 1925-27 with three films, including the suspenseful ""The Lodger.""Meanwhile, he married his assistant, Alma Reville. Known as Lady Hitchcock, she became his confidant and helped with screenwriting. Pat was their only child.For a film to be effective, he said, ""it must blend two things which seem almost mutually exclusive: It must hang on one single central idea, which must never get out of the mind of the audience for one single solitary minute, either consciously or subconsciously; and it must offer scope for the introduction of a number of elements, which you have read about every single picture that has ever been produced: glamour, suspense, romance, charm, drama, emotion.""He also had formulas for promoting his movies and making money. ""Hitchcock was ... mischievous,"" Leigh said. ""Mr. H deliberately wove a web of mystery and speculation about ('Psycho'). Always the quintessential salesman, he had rumors flying by the first week of shooting. The set was closed, which always aroused interest.""For ""Psycho,"" he deferred his standard $250,000 salary for 60% of the film's profit. It amounted to $15 million, worth $120 million today.In an interview near the end of his life, Hitchcock reiterated his love for filmmaking: ""I need to go on. I could never retire. That seems to me the most horrible idea. What would I do? ... I have no outside interests. ... I have always needed to do things."" One of which was always ""to give the public good, healthy mental shake-ups.""

716,UPS,"Some things just don't feel right in the stock market. It's not easy cutting a loss when a trade doesn't go right, taking profits when a gain reaches 20% or averaging up in price with a top performer in your portfolio.You know what else doesn't feel right? Buying a stock when it gaps up in price.Few have the courage to do it, but market precedents show that it can be a profitable endeavor.When a high-quality stock gaps up more than 5% past a buy point, it's easy to say that it's extended in price and too late to buy. But if the stock has the look of an emerging leader, with outstanding fundamentals and a bullish chart, it's OK to buy. Just try to buy as close to the opening price as possible.The forces of supply and demand govern a stock's price movement every day. Buyers and sellers are always matched, but when a stock gaps up in price, buyers overwhelm sellers. Buying on a gap-up might seem counterintuitive, but all you're doing is swimming with the market's current, riding the coattails of institutional investors and others.Priceline Group (PCLN) gapped up powerfully on Aug. 4, 2010, just a few weeks ahead of a follow-through day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 that marked the start of a market uptrend. Strong earnings and a raised outlook were the catalyst. The online travel firm opened at 281.30, well above a cup-with-handle buy point of 234.55. Volume was at 6.8 million shares, well above an average daily volume of 1.5 million. Clearly, big investors were buying.The monster gain triggered IBD's eight-week-hold rule for handling fast movers because it rallied 20% within three weeks after the breakout.Plenty of other stocks show how a gap-up in price can be a good time to buy. Starbucks (SBUX) did it on July 22, 2009, also on strong earnings. LinkedIn (LNKD) did it on July 25, 2013, and J2 Global (JCOM) did it on Feb. 14, 2013. The moves marked the start of lengthy uptrends for all.A common myth on Wall Street is ""all gaps must be filled."" When a stock gaps up powerfully in price, the thinking is that the stock must trade down to the pre-gap level before resuming its advance. The above three examples show that this is not always the case. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.Investors shouldn't buy gap-ups when a stock has already made a major run and is well extended in price. Such price action can often flag a stock's top.

"
719,UPS,"Medical Overhaul: Open enrollment for ObamaCare plans starts in less than a week, and the administration is seriously downplaying what to expect. And for good reason, since the program is in worse shape than ever.When the administration announced that the enrollment in 2016 will end up being 10 million, it was an admission of failure. Just this March the administration was claiming 11.2 million were signed up, which means it expects an enrollment drop of nearly 11% by the end of next year.Ten million sign-ups is also less than half of what the Congressional Budget Office projected for 2016 in its most recent forecast.ObamaCare's troubles only start there.Customers going into the exchanges when they open in November are likely to be shocked by double-digit premium increases for the plans they want to keep, requiring them to switch into a cheaper plan with more restrictions, pay a big increase or drop coverage altogether.Even those getting subsidized coverage could be in for unpleasant surprises. Under ObamaCare, the subsidy amount is based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in any market. If that price drops, so do the subsidy amounts, which can create huge swings in the net cost of insurance.In Washington state, for example, the premium for the second cheapest silver plan dropped 10.4%. But the biggest ObamaCare insurer in the state — Premera Blue Cross — put in for increases of 10% or more.As a result, someone who gets subsidies and wants to stick with Premera could see a 30% hike in their after-subsidy premiums.These hikes will only make ObamaCare more unpopular with the young and healthy and with those who aren't eligible for subsidies.This year, more than three-quarters of eligible enrollees who earn less than 150% of poverty income enrolled in ObamaCare. But only 16% of those making three to four times the poverty level did so, even though they, too, are eligible for ObamaCare subsidies.Overall, only 40% of eligible enrollees have signed up. This is a major problem, says industry analyst Robert Laszewski, because ""the industry standard for achieving a risk pool with a good spread of risk is 75%.""Meanwhile, one of ObamaCare's ""reinsurance"" programs is faltering. Because insurers can't charge the sick more than the healthy under ObamaCare, the law created a ""risk corridor"" program to transfer money from insurers that had a healthier-than-expected pool to those who ended up with more sick enrollees.The idea was that the two sides of the equation would balance. But the administration's calculations were way off. The amount insurers asked to be paid for 2014 was eight times more than the amount of money other insurers had paid in.So a few weeks ago, the administration said it would pay just 13 cents for every dollar insurers had asked to take out of the pool — which has, for some, proved a catastrophic financial hit.The failure of this reinsurance program is one reason so many of ObamaCare's nonprofit co-ops have imploded. This week, in fact, the ninth co-op announced it was closing shop, leaving just 14 of the original 23 running.President Obama might think ObamaCare is ""here to stay."" But all of these developments — flat enrollment, a bad risk pool, the lack of bailout money and skyrocketing premiums — will make it more unpopular, and make repeal that much easier.

724,UPS,"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Tuesday that 8.25 million people signed up in time for Jan. 1 coverage via HealthCare.gov.Despite the upbeat tone after a last-minute rush led officials to push back the Dec. 15 deadline by a few days, the total so far trails the 8.8 million who signed up during open enrollment for 2015 coverage.At this point a year ago, HealthCare.gov sign-ups already had eclipsed its first-year total, so the news may be a sign that there's no great untapped ObamaCare demand. HHS touted 2.4 million ""new"" enrollees, but that includes people who previously signed up and dropped their plans.When the Obama administration projected that national enrollment would end 2016 at 11.4 million — at best — most analysts figured the estimate was intentionally way too low. Yet that's beginning to look plausible. Certainly, the Congressional Budget Office estimate of 21 million exchange enrollees in 2016 looks divorced from reality.Only 5.8 million people of the 7.2 million who held policies in June renewed coverage via HealthCare.gov, which operates exchanges for 37 states. An apparent auto-renewal snag means that this figure will rise slightly.Bad News For Insurers?People are automatically renewed if they don't visit the exchanges to select a plan. Though data from the other 13 states and D.C. haven't yet been compiled, the implication is that national enrollment in 2015 plans dived between June and December to roughly 9 million, down nearly one-fourth from the 11.7 million initial sign-ups. Big insurers, including Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH), reported losing an average 8% of exchange members in Q3.Tuesday's news may not be a great sign for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) that have been losing money in their ObamaCare exchange business. While the jump in 2016 premiums and deductibles will make a difference in insurer bottom lines, making plans less affordable may be taking a toll on consumer demand.UnitedHealth warned that it would exit the exchanges after 2016 unless things turned around. So far, at least, there's no clear evidence of a turnaround.Even the same kind of surge in January and February as last year would only put sign-ups roughly in line with HHS' modest target.Bronze Age, ContinuedHHS predicted that national sign-ups could rise as high as 14.1 million but end the year nearly 20% lower as people drop out, either because they get coverage from another source (employer, Medicaid or Medicare) or go uninsured.Another datapoint may be just as important as the overall gain in enrollment: How much of the sign-up rush is really a surge of people selecting bronze plans. That's key when it comes to modest-income households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, since they qualify for extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. The catch is that the extra subsidies are only available to those who buy silver plans.For a 30-year-old couple in Richmond, Va., earning 200% of the poverty level ($40,000 for a family of three), buying a silver plan cuts their family deductible to $1,500, while the cheapest bronze plan has a $12,900 deductible. Yet, at $2,500, the silver plan may be too much of a stretch, leaving bronze as the only realistic option for a family that doesn't expect massive medical bills. If a hospital trip could still torpedo their finances, does it really count as a success if the couple pays $1,000 for a bronze plan so that they don't have to pay a combined $1,390 fine?The Kaiser Family Foundation says 3.5 million uninsured could buy 2016 bronze coverage for less than the mandate penalty.
"
725,UPS,"The ObamaCare exchanges have added so few customers in the past three weeks that it almost seems like there must be some kind of glitch. With less than three weeks left to enroll, the exchanges still have fewer customers than signed up in 2015, yet the rate of new sign-ups now appears to be slower than it has been since the glitch-filled launch in the fourth quarter of 2013.That's worrying news for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). Without an infusion of fresh blood during this final sprint, the exchanges will tilt a bit older and not much bigger than 2015's make-up that prompted double-digit premium hikes and UnitedHealth's threat to exit the exchanges if losses don't end.It's also troubling for ObamaCare's supporters who have hoped that a jump in the individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695 for going without coverage in 2016, more than double 2015's minimum hit, would result in a big increase in enrollment rather than a big jump in the tax penalty millions of people will have to pay. Since there's no glitch holding down enrollment as the individual mandate penalty spikes, the problem must be in the marketability of the plans.Just 74,000 Sign-Ups Last WeekIn the past week, HealthCare.gov, which handles operations for 38 states, added just 74,000 customers, or less than half the 163,000 customers added in the same week a year ago.In fact the totals in each of the past three weeks are the three slowest weeks since the Obama administration began breaking out weekly HealthCare.gov totals at the start of 2015 enrollment. The three-week total of 231,800 new sign-ups is likely the worst stretch since late 2013 because the weakest month since then (February 2014) still saw close to 700,000 sign-ups.So far there's no hint that activity is accelerating as the clock winds down on 2016 open enrollment. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell made no mention of a pick-up in her statement announcing the latest figures, referring only to a burst of activity in mid-December. One leading indicator of sign-up activity also has lagged. Over the past two weeks, 451,000 customers submitted applications, a necessary precursor to selecting an exchange plan. That's down by nearly one-fourth from the 579,000 application filers in the same period a year earlier.The drop in applications provides confirmation that sign-up activity is genuinely slow, rather than just an illusory effect of a shift in accounting for plan cancellations. Like last year, the HealthCare.gov states are subtracting customers when people cancel their plans, and each week's total represents the net addition of customers.In addition, insurers in HealthCare.gov states will strip out customers who never pay as their deadlines for monthly payments pass, rather than waiting until the end of open enrollment to do so.An example of what that culling of nonpaying customers looks like comes from Rhode Island, which operates its own exchange. This week, the state reported 30,015 paying and nonpaying customers, down 15.3% from the prior week's 34,627.There's no indication of any similar purging of nonpayers in the HealthCare.gov states. Two states did report that their sign-up totals edged lower last week. Montana sign-ups fell by 78, or 0.1%, from 55,555, and Pennsylvania's slipped by 1,239, or 0.3%, from 412,914. It's not clear whether those mild declines are just related to stripping out plans actively cancelled by consumers or whether an insurer here or there has started to winnow nonpayers.Aetna, Humana Signal Enrollment WeakFurther suggestions ObamaCare enrollment is weak have come from Aetna and Humana (HUM) recently. This week, Aetna told investors that its first-quarter individual market enrollment will be at least as high as at the end of 2015. That's a pretty low bar considering that Aetna's exchange enrollment shrank by more than 100,000, or 11%, in the third quarter as customers dropped coverage and likely continued to fall in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, Humana reported that its individual enrollment will shrink by 200,000 to 300,000 by the end of 2016. (Aetna has agreed to buy Humana, but regulators have yet to approve it.)While Medicaid insurers such as Centene (CNC) that have been more aggressive in pricing premiums lower may be stealing customers from the competition — often with high deductibles — the size of the pie is likely to be smaller than companies were expecting.In 2015, 11.7 million sign-ups dwindled to 10.2 million paying customers by March and likely fewer than 9 million by year-end. The Obama administration's estimate of 11.4 million enrollees at the end of 2016, which had seemed shockingly low compared to the Congressional Budget Office's projected annual average of 20 million paid enrollees, now looks on the money and possibly optimistic.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.Related:ObamaCare Employer Mandate Is Worse Than Feared.

Incoming institutions pick up shares on the dip and build positions, gradually constraining the float, or the available supply of shares.While the fundamentals of the stock provide the basic magnetism luring large investors, the gradual reduction of supply in the basing process sets the stage for a breakout and rally.Meanwhile, a stock's chart sends many minute signals on the status of that process.One positive sign is gap-ups in strong volume within the base.Sometimes these take place at a weekly level, but generally you need to look over price-and-volume action on a daily chart to get such cues.A gap-up is when one day or week's trading begins at a higher level than the highest mark posted in the previous session or week. This distance leaves a gap on price-bar charts and generally shows enthusiastic support for a stock, although in some cases that gap in price gets filled by the day or week's end.Gap-ups within bases are especially hard to come by on weekly charts. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) gapped up in a base prior to a breakout during the week ended Dec. 19, 2014. Daily charts are a different story, offering a granular read on the stock-basing conversation.In a 19-week cup base begun in mid-October 1997, Nokia (NOK) staged multiple gap-up moves. On the base's left side, the stock gapped up 4% in huge trade on Dec. 4 (1), then jumped 6% in light yet rising trade on Dec. 29 (2).The Finnish cellphone maker also scored a 7% gap-up on Jan. 14, 1998, and jumped 6% in heavy trade on Jan. 28 (3). The piece de resistance was an 11% surge in massive trade on Feb. 12 (4).That sharp rise could have prompted a buy point for aggressive traders. But the base was 38% deep, so one could have waited for the stock to gain more ground and round out its base. In mid-March, Nokia cleared a handle at 52.10 in rising volume and ran up 931% to a June 2000 peak.

756,UPS,"Office pressure can squeeze vitality out of executives. How to counteract hazards of a frenzied pace: Face the beast. Stress is a fact of work life. But few realize the true danger: Ongoing fatigue speeds up aging.""You don't just feel older than your age, you are older. Your capacity to regenerate the cells in your body and brain falls off sharply,"" said Marcel Daane, author of ""Headstrong Performance."" Recognize its danger.  Ongoing stress causes neurodegeneration, a shrinking in brain size that typically happens when we're years older.That decline hinders memory, strategic thinking and anxiety management. ""Mental sharpness and the ability to innovate, collaborate and connect are the price of admission in today's world,"" Daane said. ""The deficiencies can knock you out of the game."" Reverse the damage. Effective execs counter daily pressure with practical remedies. Research at King's College in Britain shows that the brains of elderly people practicing healthy habits were the same as people decades younger.""The lesson is clear: Overworked executives can go a long way toward keeping their brains young and high-performing,"" Daane said. ""We may not be able to control our workload, but we can control our lifestyle choices."" Improve your approach. Make a point to reduce unhealthy behaviors — sitting too much at the office and couch-lounging after work, skipping meals and eating junk food, drinking too much alcohol, skimping on sleep and skipping opportunities to socialize.Small changes can boost your competitive edge. ""Anyone can become an energizer in the workplace,"" Daane said. ""It just requires making a commitment to stop some bad habits before they stop you."" Squeeze in action. The busiest executive can add little exercises throughout the day. These five moves stave off mental degeneration while offsetting the physical effects of desk-sitting:Push-ups strengthen the core, reducing back and neck pain.Squats pump calm-inducing oxygen into the brain.Retractions — pulling back a resistance band with your hands — counteract the rounded back that comes from keyboard hunching.Overhead lifts — raising arms 90 degrees and pressing them parallel to the wall — also reverse that slouch.Lunges loosen connective tissues around muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments that thicken and become tougher to move when sedentary. Take it along. Corporate travel is no time to stop exercising, even if you're jet-lagged or your hotel lacks a gym. ""When you press the pause button on exercise, it's tough to get back into the routine, and many people never do; they just fall back into their old sedentary habits,"" said Warren Honeycutt, author of ""Get Lean for Life."" The championship bodybuilder, Southern Classic physique champion and six-time Mr. America finalist developed a 20-minute exercise routine for executives on the go. Adjust. To turn that hotel suite into a private workout facility, pack some handy equipment.A small set of dumbbells or wrist weights can intensify squats.A resistance band can be used for strength exercises, such as bicep curls and tricep presses.To get the maximum benefit, pay attention to technique. ""Your on-the-road workouts might not be the same type of exercise you're used to at home, but the important thing is that you don't drop your fitness routine while traveling for work,"" Honeycutt said. ""Remember, your goal is progress, not perfection.""

757,UPS,"Shares of both EMC (EMC) and VMware (VMW) dropped Tuesday as investors and Wall Street struggled to understand the complexities of the deal in which privately held tech giant Dell would swallow up the two enterprise computing companies.After a fall of 8.1% Monday, when Dell announced its pending acquisition of VMware majority owner EMC, VMware stock was down another 4% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, putting it at a more than two-year low near 69. EMC stock was down 2%, near 27, after climbing for nine straight sessions. Dell and EMC early Monday announced their merger, valued at $67 billion, the biggest pure-tech merger ever.But at least three investment banks downgraded EMC stock Tuesday as Wall Street parsed the transaction.The Byzantine deal involves issuing of a VMware tracking stock that lets Dell retain EMC's control of VMware — which some consider the most attractive part of EMC — with minimal capital outlays, analysts say. The terms also enable Dell to pay down $20 billion in debt that it needed when it went private in 2013. Analysts expect that the deal will lead to more industry consolidation.""Apparently they want control over VMware without paying for it,"" analyst Rajesh Ghai of Macquarie Securities told IBD. ""They want their cake and to eat it, too.""A complete VMware spinoff would have been better for VMware shareholders, Ghai says.""The stock's kind of taking a big hit because of the (deal's) stupid structure,"" Ghai said.A spinoff was what activist investor Elliott Management had been advocating for VMware, though Elliott came out in support of the Dell-EMC deal on Monday. Elliott executives could not be reached for comment on VMware's continued fall Tuesday. Neither Dell nor EMC responded to requests for comment.Dell Keeps Voting RightsThe terms of the deal allow Dell to pay $24.05 in cash and 0.111 share of a tracking stock linked to EMC's 81% control over VMware. The other 19% are traded on the NYSE. VMware had been trading above 80, and so the deal was estimated to be worth 33.15 a share of EMC. With VMware stock dropping, the value has fallen below 32.Ultimately, Dell will outright own 28% of VMware shares, 53% of shares will go to the tracking stock, and the other 19% will remain on the open market. Shareholders can freely trade the tracking stock, but the voting rights will remain in the hands of Dell.Some analysts, however, say that the deal at least solidifies VMware's future.""Overall, we view this as net positive for (VMware), as the deal removes future uncertainty, which has been the biggest overhang on the stock,"" UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a research note. ""Management noted that (Dell CEO) Michael Dell is aligned to driving shareholder value and committed to increasing economic interest over time, via buyback of either (VMware) tracking or common stock.""But Thill lowered his price target on VMware stock to 90 from 97. ""Our biggest concerns are around VMware management having to deal with a new owner as well as how the other strategic partners react to Dell building out a more complete stack,"" he wrote.Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher downgraded EMC stock to hold from buy.""During a post-announcement conference call, executives of EMC, Dell and VMware stated that the potential for revenue synergies rather than cost synergies (was) driving the deal,"" Kelleher wrote. ""EMC (Chief Executive) Joe Tucci also acknowledged that amid unprecedented technology industry disruption, EMC's older products were tailing off more rapidly than earlier anticipated.""That may have given further impetus to this transformative deal, which comes amid shake-ups in other leading (information technology) companies such as the coming split-up of (Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) into two companies.""Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt and on Facebook.

Effective executives hire and coach others to lead and respond to opportunities and challenges as they arise.
"
762,UPS," Cross-train them. A solid way leaders at all levels become more agile, Meyer said, is to regularly seek out new opportunities and assignments: ""UPS (UPS) and many other organizations have a recruit-from-within policy that is designed to ensure their leaders rotate through a wide range of experiences, from package delivery to leading a team in another country. Such experiences build competence and capacity to be effective when things don't go as planned.""
"
763,UPS," Get smarter. Meyer suggests creating a web of relationships and resources to respond to unexpected challenges. When they arise, ""there is not always time to gather and analyze complex data,"" she said. ""It is through their relational web that agile people tap their wider resources, knowledge and expertise to respond effectively. The time to discover and build this relational web is not in the midst of crisis, but through their day-to-day interactions.""

772,UPS,"Sure, Uncle Angelo doing push-ups with your cousins straddling his back is one sort of relative strength. But relative strength in the market is a whole other thing.One gauge of relative strength you can find in IBD is the RS line, a vital investor tool. The line generally runs along stock charts just above the vertical volume bars, and just below the stock's price bars in blue on the charts available at Investors.com.The RS line shows how a stock's price action is performing vs. the S&P 500. A rising line shows the stock outperforming the broader market. A declining line indicates the stock is a laggard.IBD's SmartSelect ratings take the concept of relative strength a step further via the RS Rating. The highest score of 99 shows a stock has outperformed 99% of all other publicly traded U.S. stocks over the past 12 months. A score of 1 shows it is underperforming 99% of those stocks.In the search for leading stocks, you'd like to find one with an RS Rating of at least 80. At the start of a new bull market, an 85 or 90 or even higher is better.The RS rank can dip as a stock is basing, particularly if the base is deep and long. Some excellent bases may form over one year or longer, but that can push down the stock's RS to 60 or lower.So far, that's not the case for Ellie Mae (ELLI), No. 15 in Friday's IBD 50 (see the list daily at IBD Leaderboard). A base has been brewing since August, yet Ellie's RS is still quite strong at 88.You would like to see the RS line move into new high ground just ahead of, or alongside a highly rated stock's breakout. The combination of a rising RS Rating and the RS line jumping to new highs corroborates the strength of the breakout.While sorting through candidates for your watch list, focus on all of the SmartSelect categories in search of broad-based strength. Study the number of bases that have already formed. You want to catch a leader early in its run, not late. A strong RS Rating alone means little.Amazon.com (AMZN) started 2015 weak on most IBD ratings fronts. But just ahead of its July 13 breakout (please see a daily chart), its RS Rating had climbed to a 93 (1) .On Oct. 15 (2), when the stock began a strong move out of a new cup with handle at 549.88, the RS advanced to a 98.The e-commerce titan's RS line had also steadily advanced to new highs since July.

789,UPS,"Full text of the Barack Obama State of the Union AddressMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union.  And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it shorter.  I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.I also understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we’ll achieve this year are low.  Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.  So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again. (Scroll down for C-SPAN video of this speech.)But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients.  And I’ll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing.  Fixing a broken immigration system.  Protecting our kids from gun violence.  Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage.  All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.But for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to talk just about the next year.  I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond.I want to focus on our future.We live in a time of extraordinary change — change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world.  It’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families.  It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away.  It’s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality.  And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.America has been through big changes before — wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights.  Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control.And each time, we overcame those fears.  We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past.”  Instead we thought anew, and acted anew.  We made change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people.  And because we did — because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril — we emerged stronger and better than before.What was true then can be true now.  Our unique strengths as a nation — our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law — these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.In fact, it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.  It’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.  It’s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.But such progress is not inevitable.  It is the result of choices we make together.  And we face such choices right now.  Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people?  Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?So let’s talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer — regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us — especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s worst?Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of America, right now, has the........strongest, most durable economy in the world.  We’re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history.  More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever.  Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years.  And we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.  What is true — and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious — is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven’t let up. Today, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated.  Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition.  As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise.  Companies have less loyalty to their communities.  And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing.  It’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to.  And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody.  We’ve made progress.  But we need to make more.  And despite all the political arguments we’ve had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job.  The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering.  In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no......===============================================RELATED STORIES:Why won't Obama let Americans compete?In his final act, Obama makes Clint Eastwood's dayThe Obamas' $70 million vacation getaways you pay forLand mines along Hillary Clinton's path to the White HouseThe State Department's deceitful cover-up for Hillary===================================================........hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower's income. Now, we've actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year.Of course, a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it’s not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber.For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.  Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain.  But they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build.That’s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn’t weaken them, we should strengthen them.  And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.  That’s what the Affordable Care Act is all about.  It’s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we’ll still have coverage.  Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far.  Health care inflation has slowed.  And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.Now, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon.  But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security.  Say a hardworking American loses his job — we shouldn’t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him.  If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.  And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.  That’s the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.But there are other areas where it’s been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years — namely what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.  And here, the American people have a choice to make.I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there’s red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.Food Stamp recipients didn’t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.  Immigrants aren’t the reason wages haven’t gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.  It’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.  The rules should work for them.  And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.  This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country:  how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there.  We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget.  We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.That spirit of discovery is in our DNA.  We’re Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.  We’re Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.  We’re every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world.  And over the past seven years, we’ve nurtured that spirit.We’ve protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.  We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.But we can do so much more.  Last year, Vice President Biden said........====================================================Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.

Tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done.  And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I’m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.  For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the family we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.Medical research is critical.  We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.  You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.But even if the planet wasn’t at stake; even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest year on record — until 2015 turned out even hotter — why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.  Here are the results.  In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.  On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal — in jobs that pay better than average. We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy — something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.  Meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either. Now we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future — especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.  That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.  That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.  But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll save, and the planet we’ll preserve — that’s the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that’s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all........=====================================================

790,UPS,"We’ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future — especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. =====================================================........the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.  The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.  Period.  It’s not even close.  We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.  Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.  No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin.  Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead — they call us.As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that’s not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today’s world, we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.  Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition.  Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria — states they see slipping away from their orbit.  And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.It’s up to us to help remake that system.  And that means we have to set priorities.Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.  Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today’s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage.  They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies. But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped.  But they do not threaten our national existence.  That’s the story ISIL wants to tell; that’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.We don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world’s largest religions.  We just need to call them what they are — killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.That’s exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL’s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons.  We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of........===============================================Even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world — in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks.===============================================........military force against ISIL.; Take a vote.  But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.  If you doubt America’s commitment — or mine — to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden.  Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit. Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can’t stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world — in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia.Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.  That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage.We also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis.  That’s not leadership; that’s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us.  It’s the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq — and we should have learned it by now.Fortunately, there’s a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That’s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.That’s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.  It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs.  With TPP, China doesn’t set the rules in that region, we do.  You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this agreement.  Give us the tools to enforce it.Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That’s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.  You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere?  Recognize that the Cold War is over.  Lift the embargo.American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world — except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.  Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right.It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity.When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change — that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children.  When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon.When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.  Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria — something I’ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.That’s strength.  That’s leadership.  And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.  That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo:  it’s expensive, it’s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.That’s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion.  This isn’t a matter of political correctness. It’s a matter of understanding what makes us strong.  The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.  His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.”When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn’t make us safer.  That’s not telling it like it is.  It’s just wrong.  It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.  It makes it harder to achieve our goals.  And it betrays who we are as a country.“We the People.”  Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together.  That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.The future we want — opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids — all that is within our reach.  But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.It will only happen if we fix our politics.A better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.  This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests.  That’s one of our strengths, too.  Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.  It doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic.  Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us.  Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention.Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels........====================================================It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency — that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.  There’s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.====================================================........their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest. Too many Americans feel that way right now.  It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency — that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.  There’s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task — or any President’s — alone.  There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected.  I know; you’ve told me.  And if we want a better politics, it’s not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around.  We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections — and if our existing approach to campaign finance can’t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution.  We’ve got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now.  And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.But I can’t do these things on my own.  Changes in our political process — in not just who gets elected but how they get elected — that will only happen when the American people demand it.  It will depend on you.  That’s what’s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.What I’m asking for is hard.  It’s easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn’t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter.  But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.  Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.We can’t afford to go down that path.  It won’t deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen.  To vote.  To speak out.  To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us.  To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.It won’t be easy.  Our brand of democracy is hard.  But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I’ll be right there with you as a citizen — inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far.  Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word — voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.They’re out there, those voices.  They don’t get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board.I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting over — and the business owner who gives him that second chance.  The protester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him ‘til he can run a marathon, and the community that lines up to cheer him on.It’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught.I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.That’s the America I know.  That’s the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That’s what makes me so hopeful about our future. Because of you. I believe in you. That’s why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. ####

791,UPS,"In 2012, the Chilean government invited a group of journalists to the South American country to show off its innovations — language programs, new uses for llama fur, greenie aquaculture, microfinance, quake-proof skyscrapers and the world's most powerful telescope.But there was one thing missing amid all these new ideas: recognition for Chile's most spectacular innovation, the one that made the country's development into a first-world country possible.That concept? Chile's 35-year old private pension program, which a new report confirms is working spectacularly well.The tour took us to Santiago's Catholic University, where I found myself looking around for evidence of recognition of the university's role in igniting the free market revolution that transformed the country in the 1970s. Most of the economists who designed, created and implemented the new economy for Chile had gone to the Catholic University, the country's most prestigious, before getting additional instruction from the University of Chicago, where their Chicago Boys moniker comes from.The dean of the school's economics department, Sergio De Castro, was named Chile's finance minister in 1976, at which time he led a group of economists to create the original blueprint of the free market revolution from something he helped devise in the 1960s, known as El Ladrillo, or the little brick.Was there a picture of De Castro among all the storied paintings on the school grounds? Was there a plaque honoring the 20 or so economists whose training at this school led to the mother of all economic innovations in the free market revolution? Was there any acknowledgment of the role played by Jose Pinera, who designed and implemented the profoundly innovative private pension system, which up until then had never been tried — and which was copiously praised Milton Friedman?No, there wasn't.I actually pointed out to the university solons that for all their talk about wanting to be leaders in innovation, they were already leaders in innovation, yet any recognition of it was nowhere in sight. They didn't quite know what to say.The incident points to the trouble with Chile: a lack of economic information among large groups of citizens. Pinera, who was Chile's labor minister in 1978, knew that the idea of private pensions would have to be sold to the public. Economic ignorance was widespread, and he utilized the most important media outlet of the day, radio broadcasting, to give five-minute talks for the citizens on savings, ownership, control, responsibility and wealth building — which are the pillars of the Chilean Model — and have as their ultimate reward a comfortable retirement, which Chileans now do.His daily broadcasts led to sign-ups for the new private pension option that went well beyond expectations. At the time, Chile's leaders had expected 4% of the population to sign up, but got 25% right off the bat.Pinera is no longer broadcasting from the airwaves (although he does have an excellent website demonstrating the success of the idea), and successive socialist governments in Chile have pretty well limited their recognition of the Chilean Model to criticism of it, many of them still unhappy that it's not a state model that's providing such high returns.A Wharton professor, Olivia Mitchell, recently went down to Chile to sort the complaints out, and found that there was nothing to complain about — the system worked exactly as advertised, creating wealth and providing a dignified retirement for millions of people well beyond what the state could accomplish and, in fact, a much better one than Americans get with Social Security.All the issues that had been called problems were largely the result of widespread public ignorance of economics, Mitchell found. In other words, with Pinera no longer on the radio to explain that private savings really do create wealth, the people who should know better aren't educating the public.It's relevant, because the U.S. Social Security system is going bankrupt, and this year none of the presidential contenders seem to have the courage to address the issue with voters. It's the same old economic ignorance seen in Chile.Mitchell has a terrific piece in Forbes about the experience, testing and validating every detail that anyone who follows the Chilean model already knows. It's well worth a read.

792,UPS,"Health Care: In the wake of last week's papal visit, Rep. Luis Gutierrez wants to extend the Affordable Care Act to 11 million illegal aliens. It's nothing but a taxpayer-financed rescue for the increasingly unsustainable program.The Illinois Democrat is known as a left-wing extremist who'd do anything to succor illegal aliens. So the ""Exchange Inclusion for a Healthy America Act of 2015"" that he introduced Wednesday to extend ObamaCare to 11 million illegal immigrants will be dismissed as a nonstarter.After all, when asked in 2012 whether illegals would have access to the new health care system that he was selling, the president explicitly promised, ""Those individuals will not be covered."" Nor should they.Last month, however, the Department of Health and Human Services warned that as of June, only 9.9 million Americans had purchased ObamaCare insurance through the state and federal exchanges, leaving a shortfall of 11 million in the collective insurance pool.That shortfall raises questions about the entire program's sustainability, given that citizens are shunning the detested system that has limited choices, drained pocketbooks and lowered the quality of health care for the people who actually pay for it.The Congressional Budget Office, which had projected 21 million sign-ups for 2016, not only got less than half of that but also learned from several states that enrollments were dropping by hundreds of thousands.With fewer people in the pool and more older and sicker enrollees in need of care at any cost, either the premiums go up for all, or the insurance pool goes bankrupt.What a coincidence, then, that the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. comes to — you guessed it — 11 million, according to the most conservative estimates.Gutierrez's idea is to take those 11 million and have them buy the insurance that Americans won't buy. Their insurance, he says, would be subsidized by taxpayers ""if they qualify."" With most illegals in low-wage, low-skill jobs, you can bet they qualify — in spades.So it seems that illegals are just doing the ObamaCare-buying that Americans won't do. A scheme like this may keep ObamaCare afloat, but it will be a budget buster and damage the economy.It will also serve as a magnet for more illegal immigrants, which of course is Gutierrez's main idea. Subsidies for the indigent are a Democratic bailiwick, and from the indigent they expect to reap votes. Everyone wins — except taxpayers who will pay for this bailout.

802,UPS,"At no time do politicians fare better in pre-election polls than before they announce a candidacy.But still, a new Wall Street Journal / NBC News Poll finds the unannounced candidate Joe Biden beating top-ranking Republicans who beat Hillary Clinton in hypothetical match-ups for next year's presidential election.The 73-year-old is not an announced 2016 candidate yet. He's presumably still anguishing over whether he has the fire, emotional strength and physical stamina for a third unsuccessful bid for the Oval Office.Against the top four Republicans right now the vice president easily wins. The new national survey finds Biden beating Jeb Bush 48%-40%, topping Carly Fiorina 47%-41%, defeating Ben Carson 49%-41% and demolishing Donald Trump by 21 points, 56% to 35%.Hillary Clinton retains her lead in the Democratic primary contest, even as questions continue to dog the campaign over her email scandal and resulting FBI probe.More trouble is likely to erupt late next month when the former secretary of State is scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi about the night of and weeks leading up to that deadly 2012 incident.However, Clinton has lost her dominating leads over three of the top four Republican candidates -- Bush, Fiorina and Carson. She now runs neck-and-neck with them when two months ago she was ahead of each by nearly double digits.The only Republican candidate Clinton now easily defeats in the survey's match-up is her friend and long-time supporter Trump, 49%-39%.The poll also finds that while Biden does better against Republicans, he appears at this point to be no direct party threat to a Clinton nomination victory. Remember back in September of 2008 when Biden admitted at a public town hall that Clinton would have been a better VP choice for Obama?A Biden candidacy this time would likely draw some minority voters away from Clinton, making it a tighter race with her closest rival now, Bernie Sanders, who isn't really a Democrat. But never mind, socialist is close enough.Biden is under no immediate pressure to announce or renounce a 2016 candidacy. The longer he waits the more of a party savior he could be. And state filing deadlines don't start occurring until late October. Of more immediate concern is Oct. 13, the first of four nationally-televised Democrat primary debates.CNN announced Monday it would make a debate podium available to Biden even if he announced as late as the afternoon of the debate.Two open questions remain: Do Democrats want to put all their candidate eggs in one basket containing two people so closely associated with Barack Obama and his failed programs at home and abroad?And with so many talented people offering themselves as potential chief executives, do Americans actually want one more who isn't really sure at this late stage that he wants to compete for the nation's highest office?RELATED:Joe Biden: Folks, here's more free stuffJoe Biden: Real Clinton challenger or mere geezer?Conflict?

804,UPS,"Payments startup Square plans to file an S-1 document for its initial public offering within two weeks, Fortune reported Friday, and what that could mean for microblog Twitter (TWTR) remains to be seen.Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is interim CEO at the microblog while also serving as CEO at Square, which he founded. But Dorsey has been the top pick of many on Wall Street to take on the Twitter post permanently.Should Dorsey be selected to become Twitter's permanent CEO, he wouldn't be the first to run two firms simultaneously. Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and of privately held SpaceX, while also serving as chairman of solar installer SolarCity (SCTY).And Steve Jobs ran Apple (AAPL) and Pixar at the same time.Twitter's directors have said the company would only consider as a full-time CEO someone in a ""position to make a full-time commitment to Twitter.""But Dorsey ""is rumored to be well respected inside Twitter, and he has a thorough understanding of the inner workings of the product,"" Chilton Capital Management analyst Sam Rines told IBD in an email Friday.""Square moving forward with an IPO may force Twitter's board to come to terms with having a CEO with two jobs. There are other tech companies with similar set-ups, and Dorsey has a proper team around him with Twitter's head of global revenue and partnerships Adam Bain and CFO Anthony Noto,"" Rines said. ""Dorsey may be able to handle both jobs, and the clarity would be a positive for internal Twitter sentiment and external perception of the company.""Dorsey took over in July as interim CEO following the departure of embattled CEO Dick Costolo.When tapped to step up at Twitter, Dorsey continued as CEO of San Francisco-based Square, which Bloomberg said submitted a confidential filing designed for companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue earlier this summer, paving the way for an IPO.Fortune's report Friday said Goldman Sachs (GS) will serve as lead underwriter, with Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also participating.Square's latest round of private funding valued the company at around $6 billion, Fortune said.Twitter stock fell 4.9% Friday to 25.29, below its IPO price of 26.Since hitting an 11-month high of 53.49 in April, Twitter stock has tumbled more than 50%.In July, Twitter posted a Q2 earnings beat, but investors focused on stalled user-growth.In Q2, the company's monthly active user base — including SMS Fast Followers who can get tweets on their phone without being registered users — rose 15% year over year to 316 million, below the 322 million that RBC Capital Markets had expected.Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook .

832,UPS,"For Dennis Lynch, investing is a family affair. The 45-year-old lead manager of $3.5 billion Morgan Stanley Growth is following in the footsteps of his father, who was a money manager and co-founder of Lynch & Mayer, starting in the 1970s.The elder Lynch (also named Dennis) can be proud. Morgan Stanley Growth was the 25th-best-performing U.S. diversified stock fund in 2015. It outperformed 95% of its peer mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years.And with a 9.4% gain in the fourth quarter that topped 97% of his direct rivals, Lynch was again among the top-performing mutual fund managers.With Lynch at the helm since mid-2004, the fund has focused on its managers' best ideas rather than on overdiversifying. It has aimed for securities in the stock market that benefit from competitive advantages such as a network effect among site visitors and from a steady flow of subscription-based revenues.And in an industry that employs battalions of analysts who are experts at diving into the details of earnings reports, a key member of Lynch's team is a futurist whose job is to spot emerging investment trends years before they generate revenues and profits.Lynch talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Manhattan.IBD: Dennis, your fund has outperformed in 2015 and long-term. But in 2012 and 2014 it was middle of the pack. What went against the fund's approach in those years?Lynch: We try to add value through stock picking and identifying what we think are mispriced or undervalued companies, companies that are undervalued because investors don't understand the quality of their business or how they can grow over time.Along the way, there can be periods when specific ideas are not working or the market is not in agreement with our ideas. We had a challenging period in 2012. In the back part of the year we did poorly, given a large allocation to Facebook (FB). It came public with a lot of public enthusiasm, then went through a vicious and challenging period when the stock price more than halved.We actually added to our position during that challenging period, then later on we benefited as the stock price rebounded.Generally, when we have ups and downs relative to the market or peer groups, sometimes it's because we're going through a period when the market thinks we're wrong. And we also make mistakes from time to time.IBD: Your concentrated portfolio is the flip side of your long-term approach, right?Lynch: Yes. Why we do well in any given year reflects decisions made in previous years rather than anything we do in the current year.Amazon.com (AMZN) is a company we've owned continuously for roughly 13 years. The reasons we got involved were a combination of the online advantages that made them tough to beat. They offer inventory that they don't necessarily possess themselves, but which they have access to.At the same time, they've slowly built a very large logistical infrastructure in the physical world.And they target increasingly technology through their Amazon Web Services.IBD: Is there anything that could disrupt a juggernaut like Facebook?Lynch: You don't have to worry that another social network will get bigger. That's highly unlikely.But is there something out there that can take people's attention away, like virtual reality or some other technology that still in its early stages now?In the absence of something like that, it's unlikely that Facebook's network effect will be challenged anytime soon.IBD: LinkedIn's (LNKD) third-quarter profit jumped 50%, a nice rebound from Q2. This is another network-effect play, isn't it?Lynch: Both holdings have strong network effects of users connected to each other.Both have users who cross-connect. It's hard to displace them. Even though both have that at their core, they make money in different ways. So we're not exposed to the same end markets or even the same spending patterns.Earlier in the year, LinkedIn made changes to its workforce that surprised people. But each quarter, results have seen the fruits of LinkedIn's longer-term thinking.IBD: The key to Monster Beverage (MNST) is how their deal with Coke (KO) gives them a shot at foreign expansion, right?Lynch: With Coca Cola becoming a substantial owner, it opens opportunities for distribution to become more efficient in the U.S. and increases chances of capturing more global share. They've had less success outside the U.S.IBD: Is Salesforce.com (CRM) one of those subscription-revenue companies you like?Lynch: They provide customer relationship management services that in the past were sold on a high license-fee basis. They had a novel approach of offering those services in a subscription format rather than requiring large upfront fees, which can be costly.It gives customers the ability to benefit from upgrades to the whole system rather than having to buy a new version of the software for each upgrade cycle.As a result, they built a high recurring-revenue business. On an annual basis, revenue renewal is over 90%. So that gives their revenue a lot of visibility.They are figuring out how to meet other important needs for large organizations. They're expanding into marketing.IBD: Why has Athenahealth's (ATHN) share price been choppy recently?Lynch: Athenahealth is the dominant provider for doctors to get reimbursed by insurers.And the way their system works, every doctor can learn (about methods for improving insurance reimbursements) from the experience of other doctors on the platform.Once Athena figures out how to apply new rules for one doctor, all doctors benefit.So it's hard for a doctor not to join the network. This is an inherent network effect. But their penetration is still less than 10% of the overall doctor market, so they've got a lot of room for growth.And they've diversified into electronic health records. Once you get a lot of doctors to join, you can provide other services, which draws in more doctors.IBD: After a rough patch,Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) earnings-per-share growth is accelerating again. Is this improvement for real?Lynch: That rough period was when they were transitioning from a first-generation platform to the next generation.And it's a razor-and-razor-blades model. There are a lot of consumables that need to be reordered each time.So it's a high recurring revenue model. It continues to take share.When a company has an upgrade cycle, customers wonder if they should order the old system or the new one. Sales can slow. It happened a couple of years ago. Now things are heading back in the right direction.IBD: Dennis, how does your team differ from its rivals?Lynch: One thing I try to emphasize when I talk with people who are thinking about whether to put money in the fund is what skin in the game do people running a product have?Here, we're not going to do well every quarter or every 12 months. There can be periods when things go badly, but through Morgan Stanley's deferred compensation program, the vast majority of team pay is deferred, and most goes into our products.We have significant personal exposure through co-ownership with our clients in the products we make for them.IBD: Tell me about the person on your team whose job is to scout ahead for emerging trends or disruptive new technologies.Lynch: Yes, in addition to our expert work, meetings with companies, looking at financial statements — those conventional activities — we've dedicated one person to research topics that have the potential to be disruptive in industries or sectors.IBD: What is your change researcher looking at these days?Lynch: More recently, he's been focused on Bitcoin and virtual reality. These are potentially powerful emerging themes and disruptive trends.IBD: Who is your disruptor expert?Lynch: Stan Delaney.IBD: How do you and the five other managers on this fund — David Cohen, Sam Chainani, Alexander Norton, Jason Yeung and Armistead Nash — divide your workload? Is each manager responsible for different industrial sectors, for example?Lynch: I act as a generalist. Outside of me, everyone has a sector and industry expertise. Sam follows the Internet and financials. David follows consumer, which sounds like one industry but is really multidimensional. Jason follow health care and some consumer staples. Armistead follows business services and software. Alex does technology — we think of technology differently than the Internet. Companies use the Internet to create. They are not selling semiconductors or software. Alex focuses on those kinds of business models and things like industrials.My dad managed large- and midcap growth stocks, starting in the 1970s in a time when managers tended to be generalists. Today people tend to be experts in a category but lacking the perspective of knowing multiple categories and being able to compare. We believe we benefit from taking the generalist approach, and we can leverage the experts.

The first new team-ups announced at CES — with General Motors ([STOCK[GM]]), Volkswagen ([STOCK[VLKAY]]) and maybe soon a third automaker — concern maps to guide self-driving cars, Mobileye said Wednesday.

An 11 a.m. Pacific Time DOT presentation Thursday at CES in Las Vegas detailed that whichever city wins its smart city transportation contest (with a $50 million prize) will get Mobileye's Shield +TM technology on every bus. The system is designed to avoid and mitigate imminent collisions and protect ""road users, including cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists,"" the DOT announcement said.More tech partnerships beyond Mobileye are likely to appear in conjunction with the DOT Smart City Challenge.""The funding and technology contributed by our private sector partners will assist the selected city in using data-driven information to make their transportation systems safer and more efficient and prepare for the future of transportation,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in the DOT announcement Thursday.Introducing the DOT smart cities contest in December, Foxx said the agency has been ""imagining connected and autonomous vehicles that can practically eliminate crashes and interact with wired infrastructure to eliminate traffic jams.""The DOT plans to announce five finalists for its Smart City Challenge in March, with the winning city unveiled in June.Foxx told IBD last month that ""we do have to have a city as part of an application"" but offered open arms to potential corporate tech partners, saying ""if there are other partnerships that become part of an application, that's encouraged. ... Many cities will probably want to take advantage of their local universities, as well as [PAGE[business]] and philanthropic communities"" in drafting their contest applications.Mobileye And GM, VW In MapsWednesday, Mobileye said it had agreements with GM and Volkswagen and soon expected a third big automaker to join its effort on crowdsourced maps created by cars on the road. In the deal, GM would integrate into upcoming auto launches the advanced mapping technology that Mobileye is developing, called ""Road Experience [PAGE[Management]],"" or REM. Volkswagen, too, will ""explore and integrate"" REM into its cars.With mapping a crucial part of the future of self-driving cars, Mobileye Chief Technology Officer Amnon Shashua spoke with IBD about how the company's approach to developing fully autonomous driving differs from that at Google and China's Baidu ([STOCK[BIDU]]). Those firms, he says, are in the ""somewhere group,"" trying to perfect self-driving in a single city first, while Mobileye is in the ""everywhere camp,"" he told IBD's Alissa Williams.""Once we figure out how to crowdsource the mapping process, we can see the next steps of ... fully autonomous driving, where we have stronger AI,"" Shashua said.Israel-based Mobileye carries an IBD Composite Rating of 70 out of a possible 99. Despite rising Wednesday and Thursday, the 2014 IPO is down 8% in 2016 after rising 4% in 2015.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED VIDEOS:Cars And Cities Of The Future: Sped By Feds.Will Mobileye Beat Google In Self-Driving Race?

843,UPS,"Stocks struggled yesterday as a weak US eco data point revealed that pending home sales fell by 0.9% vs. the +0.2% expectation and another decline in oil prices ripped thru the mkts.....sending the broader mkt a bit lower while energy stocks went into a tailspin...or at least that is what they want you to believe.... Look - the curtain is about to come down on 2015, volumes light, asset managers taking advantage of some last min window dressing - traders jumping in and out as they try to ring the register....and the mkt did not collapse at all.  We remain well entrenched in the trading range we have been discussing which will leave us essentially flat on the year - add in dividends and maybe the S&P registers a small gain of 2%.....Chalk it up and let's move on.  Yes...oil fell by 3+%, - ending the day at $36.60/barrel,  crude oil supplies rose by 2.9 mil barrels and the Saudi's re-iterated their commitment to keep producing oil at a record pace to try and choke out everyone else.....Ok..but this is getting a bit long in the tooth now, no?  This has the story and will continue to be part of the story in 2016, so there is nothing new here at all...... Themes for 2016......oh boy.....This is sure to set up for an interesting year.....First we have the US Presidential election - and while the Democrats seem to have already anointed their candidate - the Republicans are still trying to clear the field.  There are still some 11 GOP candidates in the race - it is time for them to bow out and coalesce around SOMEONE - my sense is that the longer this circus drags on - the weaker the party gets.....Someone needs to take control... Next up - the FED and Monetary Policy  - Do we need to discuss?  Third will be a continued focus on China and the role it is playing in the global economy..... Fears of a continued slowdown will permeate the analysis and chatter - How will the global economy respond? Next - Oil - is the worst over or will we see another leg down and if we do - what are the implications for the world economy?   Yesterday - the IMF's (International Monetary Fund) Chief - Ms. Christine Lagarde - warned us of 'disappointing global growth for 2016' -  How's that for a  'Happy New Year Toast!' And the list goes on..... Technically speaking - we continue to get mixed signals from the mkts - We have a long term signal  that is hovering on the edge.....suggesting the beginning of a pullback....  Add this to the range of other early warnings - indexes that have already entered bear mkts and you need to at least be aware of a broader mkt pullback.   This signal is nothing more than the simple 10-month exponential moving average on the S&P 500 Index.  Back in August - this signal flashed a HUGE warning as the mkt crashed........ The October rally  took it back up and thru resistance on the S&P - causing some to think it was just an aberration.....Since then, the S&P has gone mostly sideways, gradually turning lower again in December - bit still not sending the definitive signal....which is why we are 'hovering'....Next look at the DOW Industrials vs. the DOW Transports.  If we are to believe that the bulls remain in control then the Transportation Index should be mimicking the Industrial index, according to the DOW Theory - which it is NOT. Since November -  the transportation index has been in a harsh and steady decline - vs. the sideways pattern of the industrials.   The decline in the Transports reflects a lack of shipping demand. So, regardless of headline reports about how much Amazon shipped and the role that UPS and FEDEX played - raw materials and finished goods are in serious trouble — evidence of serious demand degradation. Now I am not screaming FIRE at all - I am just putting it on the table to consider....add in the  'unknown exposure'  in the derivative mkts and you can see how it could get a bit dicey. Think August 24th....... (and I say unknown for a reason - because it IS UNKNOWN - no matter what they tell you.... - think the housing crisis and all of the insurance products created to protect everyone from loss - REALLY???)  I'm just sayin.......   If - like in August - the mkt hits a pocket of air and goes into free fall - the additional pressure created by all of the varied 'synthetic products' - products that are highly leveraged -  will only exacerbate the move......and then we'll get another SEC report 8 months later -  that will try to explain the move.......it's fairly simple - They have allowed the level of complication and risk to rise beyond what is reasonably considered to be controllable.......what do we need to see next to wake them up?This morning we see global mkts under a bit of pressure and as the year ends here are the ytd numbers: Japan +9.9%, Hong Kong -7%, China +9.4%, ASX -2.1% FTSE -4.8%, CAC 40 +9%, DAX +9.5%, EUROSTOXX +4.1%, SPAIN -7%, ITALY +12.6%US Futures are flat this morning.....as the S&P  ended the day at 2063 yesterday - essentially flat on the year.  I suspect that they will work hard to close the mkt above 2058 and they may even try to rally it to 2100......(wishful thinking.). For us - the year looks like this:  DOW -1.2%, S&P +0.22%, Nasdaq +7%.Let me take a min to thank each and every one of you for being a Morning Thoughts reader.   I appreciate the comments that you send back as I try to respond to everyone that  offers opinion or analysis.  It has been my pleasure to both feed you financially as well as physically.  I hope you enjoy the 'boots on the ground' down home style.  I wish each of you - continued good health, prosperity and love of family and friends as we enter the new year.    Take Good CareKPKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

864,UPS,"Take some growth stocks, put them in with some value stocks, and what do you get? A core mutual fund. Some growth mutual funds own a few value stocks and some value funds own some growth stocks. But some funds own too much of each type to be classified as growth or value in Morningstar's eyes. So core makes a home for those funds.There are times when the stock market favors each style over the others. Value mutual funds hold stocks that in aggregate have below-average price-earnings and price-to-book values.Value investors see such stocks as having less risk and great potential for price appreciation. Their prices are already depressed, and so most of the hot money is out of them already. They could rise as investors discover the stocks' potential.Growth investors seek companies with above-average earnings and sales growth, and potential continued growth. The ability to grab market share or expand new markets is a hallmark of these stocks. They often have higher than average P-E and price-book values as growth investors tend to be willing to pay up for companies able to achieve rapid growth.John Hancock Large Cap Equity has both types of stocks in its recent top holdings. Sandy Sanders and Walter McCormick have managed the $3.7 billion fund since 2011 and Jonathan White since March this year.Facebook (FB) has grown earnings at a 70% annual pace for the past three years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that its earnings will climb 18% this year and 33% next year. By comparison, the S&P 500's EPS growth is expected to be -1.03% for 2015 and 8.90% for 2016, notes Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst at S&P Capital IQ.The stock has climbed 24% this year, near an all-time high, and is trading at about 51 times trailing 12-month earnings or three times the level of the S&P 500, a proxy for the broad stock market.Oracle (ORCL) used to be a growth stock, but its annual earnings growth pace has been a subdued 3% the past three years and 9% the past five years. Its stock is 21% off its 52-week high and is trading at 14 times earnings, or about 20% less than the S&P 500's P-E.

866,UPS,"While it has yet to ship a single 3D printer, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is in a strong position to lead the market, says UBS. HP expects to begin delivering its first 3D printers in late 2016 and will target sales to businesses and other enterprises.HP's timing is good, says the investment bank, after the early 3D printer leaders Stratasys (SSYS) and 3D Systems (DDD) encountered some big ups and big downs.""The market was overhyped, with the technology still immature, resulting in roller-coaster rides for the stocks of Stratasys and 3D Systems,"" wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research report. ""However, we think the market is real and could be about $20 billion in 2020.""Sales in the 3D printer market this year are estimated to come in at about $5 billion.Stratasys and 3D Systems are the two largest providers of 3D printers. The stock of both companies soared from early 2012 through early 2014. Then the stocks fell, on the reality that the industry had many mountains yet to climb.""We think 3D printing is a significant long-term opportunity, but the technology is immature in terms of speed, quality and reliability, which has caused problems for Stratasys and 3D Systems,"" Milunovich wrote.He says that HP has solved bottlenecks holding back 3D printing, such as speed.It is ""entirely believable that HP could become the leading 3D printing company,"" due to its current strength as a printing vendor, he wrote.""Our view is that 3D printing is in the early innings of commercial implementation, with the industrial greater than the consumer opportunity,"" Milunovich wrote. ""3D printing lacks economies of scale today for most applications. Over time, however, we believe 3D printing is on a path to overcoming its shortcomings in throughput, process stability, equipment life, post-processing elimination, materials know-how, production qualification and ease of use.""Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.

867,UPS,"In its September policy announcement, the Federal Reserve last week upgraded the attention placed on possible economic hang-ups in overseas economies.With a new earnings season fast approaching, researcher FactSet Research Systems took that cue and looked at companies in the S&P 500 to determine whether those with more overseas exposure were likely to face added challenges in the current quarter.A rudimentary measure of companies that see more than 50% of their revenue from outside the U.S., vs. those that see more than 50% from inside the U.S., showed a sharp contrast in consensus expectations.Total earnings per share among all S&P 500 companies are expected to slip 4.4% in Q3. However, earnings among companies that see more than 50% of their revenue from outside the U.S. are expected to fall a collective 14.1%. The combined earnings outlook for companies generating more than 50% of sales within the U.S. calls for a 3.1% gain, FactSet says.Revenue estimates show similar impact. Revenue for companies with more overseas exposure is forecast to fall 12.1% vs. a 1.4% gain for companies concentrated on U.S. sales. The overall S&P 500 revenue estimate is for a 2.9% decline.One caveat concerning those numbers: Many analysts may be in the process of altering their outlooks following the Fed announcement on Thursday.Analysts who made Q3 forecasts based on expectations for the stronger dollar and international bond, currency and commodity price fluctuations — which were likely to have followed a Fed rate hike — probably will shift those views outward into the fourth quarter.FactSet's numbers, generated on Friday, would not include the vast majority of such changes.FactSet did note that, before Friday, analysts had trimmed earnings estimates by a smaller margin in Q3 than in recent quarters.It also noted that energy-sector companies — hurt by weak oil prices — were the strongest contributors to the estimated year-over-year Q3 declines in both earnings and revenue.Stripping energy companies out of the equation, analysts expect overall earnings among S&P 500 companies to increase 3%. Companies that see most of their revenue from inside the U.S. are forecast to show a collective 8.8% earnings gain. For those focused outside the U.S., EPS are expected to fall 4.9%.Revenue estimates minus energy companies are similar: up 5.3% for U.S.-centric companies, down 3.9% for those with an overseas emphasis, and up 2.6% across the entire S&P 500.

868,UPS,"Luxoft Holding (LXFT) is making a strong comeback after committing a sell signal in August. The new issue hit a record high Wednesday in about average volume.The stock is within a hair of hitting a 20% increase from a 57.40 buy point, a level at which investors can consider taking profits.Like many stocks, Luxoft experienced volatility during the wild trading session of Aug. 24. That's when it tripped the sell signal, but it also found support at its 200-day moving average that day. In addition, it retook the 57.40 entry soon after that. In more recent sessions, the stock has bounced off support at its 50-day moving average. That can be considered an area where shareholders can add shares.While the market has had several weeks of ups and downs, Luxoft has rallied for three straight weeks. And so far, the stock is also up nicely this week.Luxoft's relative strength line has had a rapid rise and is holding near record levels.On another positive note, the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved sharply from a D- in late August.Overall fund ownership has grown to 264 funds owning 11.5 million shares in Q2, up from 183 funds owning about half as many shares in the same period a year ago.Headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, Luxoft provides software development and other IT services. It serves the automotive, energy, finance, telecom and other industries.Big multinationals such as Advance Micro Devices (AMD), Boeing (BA), Expedia (EXPE), Ford (F) and UBS Group (UBS) are some of its customers. Leading companies such as Epam Systems (EPAM) and Virtusa (VRTU) are some of its competitors.Luxoft has delivered strong double-digit gains in its top and bottom-lines recently. Earnings grew 23% to 50% in the latest four quarters, while sales climbed 28% to 32% over the same period.Business has been particulary strong from clients in financial services, technology, telecom and automotive. Sales in those areas grew between 21% and 59% in the latest quarter.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see profit rising 21% to $2.76 a share for its fiscal year ending in March of 2016.

872,UPS,"Health Reform: The public should know by now to discount the Obama administration's initial enrollment claims for ObamaCare, since they've always been wildly inflated. This year is no different.
"
873,UPS,"'ObamaCare enrollment spikes,"" says one news headline. It's ""outpacing last year,"" says another. And ""young people sign-ups nearly double.""
"
874,UPS,"The expectation is that some 12 million will have enrolled, once you add the state-run exchanges to the 8.2 million people who the White House says signed up through the Healthcare.gov site.
"
875,UPS,"Supporters of the law were, not surprisingly, quick to seize on these numbers as further proof that ObamaCare is working, just as they have at similar points over the previous two years.
"
876,UPS,"But even if enrollment tops 12 million, that's barely more than had signed up last year — when the administration said 11.7 million had enrolled.
"
877,UPS,"Whatever the number is, it's inflated, because the administration counts anyone who went through the process of selecting a plan, not those who have actually paid for it. It would be like Amazon counting anything anyone put in their shopping cart as a sale.
"
878,UPS,"Last year, the initial 11.7 million ""enrollees"" had dropped by 25% once the non-payers got subtracted out.
"
879,UPS,"That's why the White House figures that, by the end of next year, actual enrollment will have been whittled down to 10 million.
"
880,UPS,"That 10 million might seem like a lot, until you consider that it's only a small uptick from this year, and it's less than half what the Congressional Budget Office had projected. It is also far fewer than industry analysts say is needed to create stable insurance pools.

884,UPS,"On Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell may announce that more than 9 million people signed up in time for Jan. 1 coverage via HealthCare.gov. The national sign-up total could exceed 12 million.
"
885,UPS,"In medical terms, the HealthCare.gov enrollment surge being celebrated by the Obama administration means that the patient didn't suffer a massive heart attack but still needs a quadruple bypass.
"
886,UPS,"The news is decent enough that sighs of relief can be expected from ObamaCare supporters, including hospital operators like HCA (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) that benefit from its generous subsidies to low-income households. Insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) that have been losing money on their ObamaCare exchange businesses may be feeling a bit more encouraged, with another full month of open enrollment still to come.
"
887,UPS,"Yet the real measure of ObamaCare is whether it makes health care broadly affordable, especially for those who lacked affordable options before its launch. On that score, ObamaCare is failing, and compelling a few million more people to sign up for coverage that may be of little use to them but won't cost any more than paying a mandate fine hardly counts as a success.
"
888,UPS,"Will ObamaCare Sign-Ups Pay?
"
889,UPS,"Current enrollment in the exchanges has dwindled to about 9 million nationally, perhaps less, down by roughly one-fourth from the 11.7 million who enrolled for 2015 coverage. So the total of 2016 sign-ups isn't much more than the number who originally signed up last year. One obvious question is how many of this year's enrollees will follow up with payments. The number touted by HHS will include a few million people who were automatically renewed, and ""new"" enrollees include people who had coverage previously but dropped it.
"
890,UPS,"There's another datapoint that may be just as important as the overall gain in enrollment: How much of the enrollment surge is really a surge of people selecting bronze plans. That's especially important when it comes to modest-income households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, since this group qualifies for extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. The catch is that those extra subsidies are only available to those who buy silver plans.
"
891,UPS,"For a 30-year-old couple in Richmond, Va., earning 200% of the poverty level ($40,000 for a family of three), buying a silver plan cuts their family deductible to $1,500, while the cheapest bronze plan comes with a $12,900 deductible. Yet, at $2,500, the silver plan may be too much of a stretch, leaving bronze the only realistic option for a family that doesn't expect massive medical bills. If a trip to the hospital could still torpedo their finances, does it really count a success if the couple pays $1,000 for a bronze plan so that they don't have to pay a combined $1,390 fine?
"
892,UPS,"The Kaiser Family Foundation says that 3.5 million uninsured will be able to buy bronze coverage in 2016 for less than the cost of the individual mandate penalty.
"
893,UPS,"ObamaCare Often Increases Inequality
"
894,UPS,"The reality is that the program, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse. Take single 27-year-olds in St. Louis earning $24,000, whose cheapest option is a $1,000 bronze plan with a $6,850 deductible. In other words, they can pay a fine equal to 3% of their income or spend 4% of income on a plan that will be of little use.
"
895,UPS,"ObamaCare has succeeded in making health care much more accessible to people whose health conditions make them desperate for comprehensive policies to limit high out-of-pocket costs and for people with income below 150% of the poverty level for whom subsidies are especially generous. But most people with income above that level aren't being served well by the exchanges.
"
896,UPS,"An Urban Institute analysis estimated that just 35% of people eligible for exchange subsidies had purchased plans. Yet the reality may be even worse for two reasons: The figure includes low-income people who settled for bronze plans and it excludes some 3 million uninsured who would be eligible for subsidies based on income but work full-time for companies that offer ""affordable"" coverage.
"
897,UPS,"Those low-wage, full-time workers get the worst deal from ObamaCare. For example, in 2015, workers earning $17,500 a year — and their spouses — were ineligible for subsidies if their employer offered them bronze-type coverage for no more than $1,670. That's 15 times the $9 per month a bronze plan would cost via the subsidized exchanges.
"
898,UPS,"When you include low-income uninsured workers with an offer of employer care, only about 1 in 4 with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level got silver coverage in 2015 that would protect their finances if they landed in the hospital. Even if enrollment jumps in 2016, it's not clear how much the 75% with no coverage or bronze plans will decrease.

"
922,UPS,"An early Christmas present today: The Republican debates are over for the rest of this year. And even for the first part of 2016. They will return, however, with the holiday bills in mid-January.For now though, a quick pre-holiday look at the field after what turned out to be another substantive debate, thanks to the clear, meaty questions and follow-ups of CNN's Wolf Blitzer, and to the impressive field of  nine GOP candidates on the main stage.This debate was focused on national security and terrorism. Post-debate evaluations of candidate performances are largely subjective. No one made any great leaps or notable mis-steps, except perhaps Gov. John Kasich boasting of 18 years in Congress. If you liked Donald Trump going in, you most likely liked Donald Trump coming out.Not surprisingly, Trump arguably made the biggest news of the night: Finally shutting down speculation that he might run as a third-party candidate should he not win the nomination in Cleveland, a rogue step that would basically doom Republican White House hopes. Asked by Salem Radio host Hugh Hewitt if he was ready to commit to abide by the collective decisions of Republican primary voters, Trump said: ""I really am. I'll be honest, I really am....I've gained great respect for the Republican leadership. I've gained great respect for many -- and I'm going to even say -- I mean, in different forms for the people on the dais."" (Full debate transcript here.)That could be a recognition of Trump's slight slippage in Iowa, where Ted Cruz now leads. Whatever, there goes that mainstream media meme. For now, anyway.The field's two youngsters, both sons of immigrants, Marco Rubio, 43, and Cruz, 44, impressed the most with blunt-talking Chris Christie, 53, close behind. Rubio is one of the best political communicators in a long while. Genial, open, optimistic and bilingual, he never seems flustered or caught short on content, even when attacked, as he was frequently by Cruz and Rand Paul, two other freshmen senators.Cruz is likely the best debater, very intelligent, a quick thinker on his feet. He's stuck with a Senate reputation as no team player. His shrill, even combative style is perfectly suited for the party's angry conservative base these days. He'll need to soften that style somewhat and be more likable, if he wants those crucial independent voters in the general election.But that's why primary season competition is so important, as the pre-season run-up for the championship come fall. Cruz, the son of an evangelical, jumped ahead of Trump to lead now in Iowa, where evangelicals play an out-sized role.A lot can happen in the seven weeks before Iowa's caucuses. Are Trump's zealous newcomers sufficiently dedicated to turn out on a bitter February night for hours of political palaver about others?Cruz seems well-positioned for now to capture a winning plurality in that first contest, which attracts a tiny slice of Iowans; the record turnout for caucuses there is only 120,000 of the state's 3.1 million residents. Recent GOP caucus winners include non-presidents Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum.A week later comes the New Hampshire vote, also.....---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Who Talked the Most?Ted Cruz 15:58; Marco Rubio 13:33; Donald Trump 13.25; Chris Christie 10:45; Ben Carson 10:27; Jeb Bush 10:13; Rand Paul 9:46; Carly Fiorina 9:32; and John Kasich 9:00.  Source: NPR---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------..... snowy. Trump leads easily there now with Rubio second and a rising Christie third. Ben Carson (""I don't do a lot of talking. I do a lot of doing."") has slipped. Cruz and Jeb Bush are in single digits with Kasich not far behind and Carly Fiorina and Huckabee trailing.This is just a suspicion right now, but watch for Christie to surprise, especially if Trump stumbles to second or third in Iowa. The New Jersey governor has worked the state hard, spotlighting his straight talk and anti-terrorist experience as a U.S. attorney. He overcame his Obama hurricane hugs to nab a surprise endorsement from the influential, conservative Union Leader.New Hampshire voters are an ornery lot, who treasure their unwarranted limelight every four years. They reward those who campaign tirelessly town-hall by town-hall, living room by living room. That's what John McCain did successfully to upset George W. Bush in 2000 and next-door neighbor Mitt Romney in 2008. And it's what Christie, and to a lesser extent Kasich, have been doing.

923,UPS,"The nine candidates on the main Las Vegas stage Tuesday night, and the other four on the under-card (Lindsey Graham, Santorum, Huckabee and George Pataki), give the misleading impression of a large surviving Republican field. It's not really.Trump leads in national polls, which are irrelevant for now. Rubio and Cruz battle as hopeful heirs to the real estate mogul's supporters someday, mainly Cruz.Bush had a strong debate mostly, calling Trump ""a chaos candidate. And he'd be a chaos president."" It may be too late for the former governor to alter impressions from the first four talk-fests. Christie is perfecting his no-nonsense, look-the-camera-in-the-eye executive style, an appealing contrast to rhetorically pirouetting legislators.The next GOP debate is on Fox Business Network in South Carolina on Jan. 14, two nights after Barack Obama's final State of the Union address.RELATED:The Incredible Shrinking PresidentThe warped world of our delusional presidentObama to Americans: Stay gullible, my friendsNews Flash for Obama: Terrorism isn't scaring Americans; You are

928,UPS,"There is hope.There is Ben Sasse. We didn't know much about him either. He's a 43-year-old freshman GOP senator from Nebraska, an historian and father of three home-schooled children. Sasse's full bio is here.But let's get to the scary stuff asap.Have you been feeling the country is adrift right now, under serious threat from many directions at home and abroad, but rudderless?Have you felt frustrated, angered, maybe even frightened for yourself and family by the lack of credible leadership -- real stand-up, follow-me leadership -- from the so-called leaders of both political parties?Has the thought crossed your mind that the two parties' leading candidates for president are not really up to the deadly serious task of commander-in-chief, of keeping our country safe.Watch Ben Sasse in the video below here. He's not running for anything. He voices precisely what so many of us have been thinking and fearing and, occasionally, hoping. Many in Washington will not like what he says. Good!Sasse is not attacking either of the you-know-who's or the other over-sized narcissist who addressed the country Sunday night.He's a fellow American, simply laying out in clear, unvarnished candor the facts of where we as a nation are. In danger, serious long-term danger. From ISIS, from militant Islam, from jihadi extremists, from feckless domestic leaders and would-be leaders. And from our desperate selves, in a strange kind of way.Sasse's blunt words won't change our reality for the next 407 days. Or the next 407 months, for that matter.But they will calm your worried spirit and instill confidence that -- you know what? -- this nation can come together once more to successfully endure a life-threatening struggle and emerge victorious in this long, long war ahead against powerful forces that hate who we are and want to kill us all for the same reason.Regular readers here know that I rarely suggest Must-Reads or Must-Views. This is different, however. This is the Most Must-View I have ever suggested.I'm not going to pre-digest and hand-pick some of his words. We're grown-ups here. Here's a taste: “We are at war. The American people already know this. Our enemies obviously know this. It is only Washington that seems confused.”Once you begin watching this Tuesday Senate speech excerpt, you won't notice it's 17 minutes. You'll just be thinking. And nodding. And saying to yourself, Yes. Yes. Yes, this guy gets it. Finally. Someone back there gets it!

"

"
942,UPS,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.

946,UPS,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
947,UPS,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
948,UPS,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
949,UPS,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
950,UPS,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
951,UPS,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
952,UPS,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
953,UPS,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
954,UPS,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
955,UPS,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
956,UPS,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
957,UPS,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
958,UPS,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
959,UPS,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
960,UPS,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
961,UPS,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
962,UPS,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
963,UPS,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
964,UPS,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
965,UPS,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
966,UPS,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
967,UPS,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
968,UPS,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
969,UPS,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
970,UPS,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
971,UPS,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
972,UPS,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
973,UPS,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
974,UPS,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
975,UPS,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
976,UPS,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
977,UPS,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
978,UPS,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
979,UPS,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
980,UPS,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
981,UPS,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
982,UPS,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
983,UPS,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
984,UPS,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
985,UPS,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
986,UPS,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.
"
987,UPS,"A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.
"
988,UPS,"Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.
"
989,UPS,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
990,UPS,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
991,UPS,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
992,UPS,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
993,UPS,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
994,UPS,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
995,UPS,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
996,UPS,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
997,UPS,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
998,UPS,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
999,UPS,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
1000,UPS,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
1001,UPS,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
1002,UPS,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
1003,UPS,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?
"
1004,UPS,"Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.
"
1005,UPS,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.
"
1006,UPS,"Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance ReportSophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.IBD: How does each segment differ?Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas.

The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each added 0.2%.Volume was soft, down 12% on the Nasdaq and 17% lower on the NYSE, compared to action at the same time Monday.The stock market today has an eye on the Federal Open Market Committee, which is meeting in Washington but not expected to generate any news until the policy announcement scheduled for 2 p.m. on Wednesday.Other economic news began with home prices, which were effectively flat in May, according to a 4.9 reading for the Case Shiller 20-City Home Price Index. Economists had expected a reading of 5.6. April's number was revised a notch higher, to 5.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index also fell, dropping to 90.9 in July, down from June's 101.4 tally, which was revised lower to 99.8. Economist consensus projected a very slight dip, to 99.6, for July.A more positive note from researcher Markit reported the services sector of the economy improved in July.

Management held to its prior revenue guidance for the year, which is consistent with consensus views. The stock has been in a deepening consolidation since June last year.United Parcel Service (UPS) swept up nearly 4% as its earnings beat consensus estimates. Revenue stopped short of expectations, but management backed its prior EPS range of $5.05 to $5.30 for the year, and said it would come in near the top of that range.

1041,UPS,"2016: No wonder the Democrats put off their primary debates until Halloween. Last week's Republican double-debate is an impossible act to follow immediately. And the GOP has another come-one-come-all set for mid-September.Anyone worried about the vibrancy of the American political system and eagerness to contemplate the next POTUS, at least on the Republican side, must feel better today. A record 24 million viewers tuned in to the first debates Thursday, almost eight times as many as watched the first GOP primary debate in 2012.Most candidates provided substantive, informed and sometimes feisty exchanges and answers to the hardball queries of Fox pros Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. Good for them. You don't get ready for regular season match-ups by playing touch in preseason play. And voters benefit when candidates are forced off-script.Not surprisingly, the biggest news came from Donald Trump. He was the only candidate to refuse to rule out a crippling third-party campaign if he loses the GOP nomination fight in that same Cleveland arena 49 weeks from now.Perhaps channeling Newt Gingrich from 2012, Trump was the only debater objecting to panel questions. He later lashed out at Kelly, who had asked reasonably when the longtime Democrat donor became a Republican, calling her a ""bimbo"" on Twitter.Republican primary voters will decide if Trump's outbursts and less-than-loyal threat, a la Ross Perot in 1992, disqualify him from serious consideration as their 2016 standard-bearer. ""Why should I give up that leverage?"" Trump asked, as if a presidential campaign was just another business deal and party voters mere bankers lending him votes.For the other 16 candidates, most made an opening case effectively, introducing bios and stating their conservative bona fides. Detailed issue discussions come later. (Fox News has posted a video arcade of clips containing virtually every answer at foxnews.com.)Perhaps because she was among the least-known, Carly Fiorina left the largest impression with her broad subject knowledge and precision of language in the day's earlier debate. Bobby Jindal was among the most conservative socially. Rick Perry, one of only two veterans in the field, offered an impassioned and welcome presentation on border security and national defense.On the prime-time stage, Marco Rubio offered his optimistic vision for a renewed 21st century American Dream, hailed the quality of so many GOP candidates and pointedly noted: ""The Democrats can't even find one."" Mike Huckabee showed an unexpected and appealing mellowness.Ted Cruz, always eloquent, directed more fire at congressional Republican leaders than Democrats.Scott Walker, Jeb Bush and John Kasich did not hurt themselves, always an early danger for big names. And Chris Christie was — wait for it — combative.The next public confrontation comes Sept. 16 at the Reagan Library on CNN. Meanwhile, the real competition moves behind the scenes for money to sustain what's developing into a long, worthy competition.

1063,UPS,"Powered by rising home sales and prices, and lots of pent-up demand, the pace of remodeling spending is positioned to pick up. Industry experts expect remodeling spending to see a nice uptick this year amid strengthening housing market fundamentals, though they vary on just how much.
"
1064,UPS,"A recent flurry of good news on key housing indicators bodes well for remodeling:In June, existing home sales rose 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million from May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales are now at their highest level since February 2007 and are up 9.6% from a year earlier.The median existing home price for all housing types in June was $236,400, up 6.5% from a year earlier and above the peak median sales price of $230,400 set in July 2006, says the NAR.Suppliers Stand OutA rise in remodeling spending should aid high-rated companies such as giant home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD), top home improvement and building products makerMasco (MAS), and global flooring company Mohawk Industries (MHK). These companies stand to benefit from increased spending on home spruce-ups like new flooring and renovations such as kitchen redos, the type of projects that may have been deferred in the past.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Masco, Home Depot and Mohawk to see double digit year-over-year profit growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017. They expect Israeli quartz surface maker Caesarstone Sdot-Yam (CSTE) to see double-digit profit growth in 2016 and 2017.""We think by the end of the year remodeling spending nationally will reach an all-time high,"" Kermit Baker, senior research fellow at Harvard's Joint Center For Housing Studies, told IBD. ""It looks like it's almost fully recovered from the (housing) downturn, where new construction is still well below where it was before the downturn.""Broadly, we're expecting to see mid-to-low single-digit growth in remodeling this year and then it will begin to accelerate at the end of the year moving into 2016 for the next year or two,"" said Baker, who directs the Remodeling Futures Program at Harvard's housing center.Total home improvement and repair spending peaked at just under $325 billion in 2007, he says. The Joint Center estimates it will rise 2.5% in 2015 from a year earlier to $325 billion. Baker projects spending growth will probably get to the long-term trend of 5% until there's another downturn.Home-Price Gains Are PivotalThe single most important trend driving the Joint Center's forecast is recovering home prices, he says.""Seeing home prices recover is crucial to consumers having the confidence to undertake a remodeling,"" he said.Another driver, he adds, is the fact that homeowners who had deferred some projects during the downturn from 2008 to 2011 are now ""attacking the list of projects they put off.""Such projects include bath and kitchen remodels and room additions. Baker says these types of projects have seen the ""strongest recovery"" from the downturn and should continue to do so as the market continues to grow.The Joint Center's key metric for tracking the growth of improvement spending specifically on owner-occupied properties is the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA).The LIRA provides a short-term outlook of national homeowner improvement spending, estimating the annual rate of change in spending for the current quarter and prior three quarters. In Q3 that four-quarter moving total is forecast to reach $151.1 billion.The LIRA projects annual home-improvement spending growth of 2.8% in 2015 accelerating to 4% by the first quarter of 2016, says Joint Center research analyst Abbe Will.""Major drivers of this anticipated growth are the recent pick-up in home sales activity, sustained growth in retail sales of home improvement products and ongoing gains in house prices across much of the country,"" Will said.The biggest ""trigger"" for remodeling spending, says Baker, is the sale of a home, particularly an older one.Ken Fears, director of housing, finance and regional economics for the NAR, says there's a ""strong correlation"" between home sales and remodeling.""With an increase in home sales volumes, you're likely to see an increase in remodeling because people will have a source of funds from the sale to tap into to do the remodeling,"" he said.He expects remodeling trends to ""track the general trend"" for existing home sales.The NAR forecasts existing home sales will rise 6.6% this year, followed by a 4.1% gain in 2016.A Different ViewThe National Association of Home Builders calculates remodeling spending differently from how the Joint Center does it.NAHB senior economist Michael Neal says residential remodeling spending on owner-occupied properties fell by 24.3% from a year earlier in 2014 after it was hurt by harsh weather in the year's first half and kept falling in the second half.""However, because of the severity of the fall, the level of private residential improvement spending in 2015 will be below its level in 2014, by about 12%,"" Neal told IBD.""But beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015, private residential improvements spending will exceed its year-ago level, and year-over-year growth will continue into 2016 and 2017, by 13.2% and 3.1% respectively.""Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith says he expects to see a ""continued uptick"" in spending on larger-ticker home remodel projects such as kitchen and bath remodels.""I think we will see very strong same-store sales growth from the home improvement retailers,"" he told IBD.Keith notes that comments from both Home Depot and Lowe's Cos. (LOW) management indicate that sales volumes in certain categories such as lumber and concrete ""that are often utilized in larger-ticket projects are still well off their total previous highs in 2006 or 2007.""Large Projects Get UnderwayMorningstar analyst James Krapfel, who covers companies such as Masco and Mohawk, concurs that the mix of remodel and repair spending has ""shifted to more expensive projects, like full kitchen remodels, that tend to carry higher margins for the companies.""Daren Blomquist, vice president at property data tracker RealtyTrac, says due to rising home prices more people have equity in their homes than in the past. RealtyTrac research shows that people who have a mortgage and are ""equity rich,"" with at least 50% equity in their homes, have grown to 10.9 million this year, or about 20% of all homeowners with a mortgage, up from 9.9 million last year.""That puts more people in a good position to take out a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) and use (the funds) to remodel their homes,"" he told IBD. ""In the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, we saw a jump in HELOCs as more people regained their equity and felt comfortable enough to leverage that equity.""Current low interest rates may well prompt homeowners to take out some form of financing sooner rather than later, says Andres Carbacho-Burgos, associate director at Moody's Analytics.""Interest rates are so low now on whichever form of financing you look at, people may think if they're going to improve their homes and have to borrow to do so for large projects, now is the time,"" he said. ""They may think 'if I wait two to three years to borrow to pay for this I may have to pay higher rates.'""

1099,UPS,"Health Reform: ObamaCare enrollment has fallen sharply since March, and that's before consumers confront huge rate hikes for 2016. These are not the signs of a successful program.In its latest enrollment report, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says 9.9 million were still enrolled in ObamaCare exchange plans.That's almost 2 million fewer than the administration claimed in the spring, when it bragged that 11.7 million had signed up, and way below the Congressional Budget Office's earlier forecast of 13 million.And if this year is anything like last year, that 9.9 million will dwindle further as the year goes on.Year-over-year growth isn't terribly impressive, either. The CBO had figured sign-ups would almost double this year. Instead, they climbed 24%, when you compare the latest figures to those the administration put out in May 2014. Enrollment in big states like California and New York is virtually unchanged.It would appear ObamaCare isn't such a great product after all. And it's about to get much worse.Earlier this year, insurers started putting in rate requests for 2016, and in many cases they were gut-wrenchingly high — with some above 50%. Obama told the public not to worry, that state insurance regulators would knock them down to size.But like every other promise he's made about his namesake law, this one was phony.In state after state, insurance commissioners are approving huge rate hikes, based on the fact that the people who've signed up for ObamaCare are older and sicker than insurers hoped.By one estimate, the average rate hike in Oregon — a state that eagerly embraced ObamaCare — is above 24%. Average approved rates are 20% or higher in Alaska, Idaho, Iowa and Kansas.An analysis by Agile Health Insurance found almost a third of all plans being sold through the federal Healthcare.gov exchange — which covers 36 states — had double-digit rate hikes.Premiums for every plan offered in South Dakota, Delaware and West Virginia will be up by 10% or more.These premium increases — combined with narrow provider networks and big deductibles — are sure to drive down the already low enrollment rates among the younger and healthier, and those who aren't eligible for ObamaCare subsidies.The CBO expects 21 million will enroll in the Obama-Care exchanges next year.That's increasingly looking like a pipe dream.

1153,UPS,"Frederic Tudor knew the world would crave cold drinks if he could deliver ice during hot weather. But in the early 19th century, there was no easy way to cut ice out of ponds in winter and keep it frozen for fast delivery to warm areas.
"
1154,UPS,"Tudor was undaunted.
"
1155,UPS,"At 23, he bought a brig (a two-masted, square-rigged ship) to carry ice from Boston to the Caribbean. Insulating the ship with straw and wood shavings, he arrived to find no one interested.
"
1156,UPS,"Tudor lost $4,500 (equivalent to $90,000 today), and his next several tries were even worse disasters.
"
1157,UPS,"Over the next 15 years, he was repeatedly arrested for debt, paid bail and stayed one step ahead of creditors until he became one of the richest men of the era.
"
1158,UPS,"""No one had thought of harvesting New England wintertime ice and marketing it as a table necessity,"" Salvatore Basile, author of ""Cool: How Air Conditioning Changed Everything,"" told IBD. ""Up to that point, cold food and chilled beverages were very occasional treats in cold climates or where the rich had their own ice houses. More surprising, his first target markets were the West Indies, Havana, New Orleans — where the locals were so unfamiliar with the frozen stuff that Tudor had to give out printed instructions with each purchase to explain how to store and use it.
"
1159,UPS,"""To create demand, he gave out free samples and, as he predicted, eventually no one ever wanted warm drinks again.""
"
1160,UPS,"Boston Bred
"
1161,UPS,"Tudor (1783-1864) was the third son of a wealthy Boston lawyer and his wife. Frederic's older brother William would become a leading literary figure, founding the North American Review and dubbing Boston the Athens of America.
"
1162,UPS,"Frederic took another path. He refused a chance to go to Harvard, and at 13 he became an apprentice at a store. He and another older brother, John, also made money exporting furniture to Havana.
"
1163,UPS,"At 17, Frederic accompanied John on a voyage to Cuba, thinking that John's injured knee would heal in the tropical sun.
"
1164,UPS,"What Frederic soon noticed was the lack of iced drinks. His family had an ice house back in Boston and chipped away at blocks to make ice cream. He began thinking of a way to bring ice to the tropics.
"
1165,UPS,"When the boys returned to America, their father set Frederic up with friends at an import-export house, which helped the young man launch his wildly ambitious dream.
"
1166,UPS,"In November 1805, Frederic sent William and a cousin to scout Caribbean entrepreneurs who might want to buy exclusive rights to the use of ice. But when Frederic arrived a few months later with 80 tons that had survived the voyage, none of the prospects would pay what he wanted, so he held out for better offers until it melted away.
"
1167,UPS,"""The overwhelming majority of humans living in equatorial climes in 1800 would have literally never once experienced anything cold,"" wrote Steven Johnson in ""How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World."" ""The idea of frozen water would have been as fanciful to the residents of Martinique as an iPhone.""
"
1168,UPS,"Johnson added, ""(Tudor) assumed the absolute novelty of ice would be a point in his favor. ... Instead, (it) received blank stares. ... The bleak pattern of the Martinique voyage would repeat itself in the years to come, with ever more catastrophic results. ... For most of his early adulthood, he was an abject failure, albeit one with remarkable tenacity.""
"
1169,UPS,"In 1812, the Tudor family lost most of its assets thanks to the patriarch's bad investments and extravagant living. Frederic was sent to jail in March until he paid down some debt a month later. By June, the War of 1812 with Britain had begun, cutting off trade. Suddenly Frederic's plan of prospering in the Caribbean was put on ice.
"
1170,UPS,"""At 26, after seven years of struggle, when he tallied up his gains and losses, Frederic found his assets, including properties, came to $28,400, but his liabilities amounted to $38,772, owed to a variety of people, including his blacksmith and tailor,"" wrote Carl Seaburg and Stanley Paterson in ""The Ice King."" ""Although he wasn't able to ship, his busy brain was not still at all. Turning around the ship design conventions of the time, Frederic modeled a shallow, rounded hull deepest at the bow, with a pronounced keel at the stern.
"
1171,UPS,"""In maritime Boston, however, Frederic's novel concept attracted attention. ... By the spring of 1813, a new ship in his design had been constructed.""
"
1172,UPS,"But trouble kept following him.
"
1173,UPS,"As he was about to do a test sailing of what he called the Black Swan, Tudor was arrested for not paying a $300 debt. After posting bail, he took the ship on its maiden voyage, only to find that it wasn't likely to withstand the high seas.
"
1174,UPS,"He spent the war years experimenting with:
"
1175,UPS," Caskets that could keep ice frozen during voyages.
"
1176,UPS," Insulation materials like rice chaff and sheepskin.
"
1177,UPS," Designs for double-hulled storage depots at destinations.
"
1178,UPS," Iron boxes to sell to stores and people to help preserve their ice.
"
1179,UPS,"Peace And Opportunity
"
1180,UPS,"When the war ended in 1815, Tudor was able to negotiate cheap shipping rates; the barren soil of New England produced nothing of value to send to the tropics, leaving outbound vessels empty.
"
1181,UPS,"""Most of the trade in natural goods involves material that thrives in high-energy environments,"" wrote Johnson. ""Sugar cane, coffee, tea, cotton — all these staples of 18th- and 19th-century commerce were dependent on the blistering heat of tropical and subtropical climates. ... The cash crops of the tropics caused populations to swell in climates that could be unforgivably hot, which in turn created a market for a product that allowed you to escape the heat. ... That was Tudor's great insight.""
"
1182,UPS,"Underlying Tudor's challenge were the massive problems of slow transportation and communication, as well as the lack of financial liquidity and easy borrowing in the pre-20th century economy.
"
1183,UPS,"From 1816 to 1824, the Ice King had dramatic ups and downs:
"
1184,UPS," Tried to ship tropical fruit back under ice, but most of it rotted.
"

1201,UPS,"""Tudor changed the very nature of American consumer culture by altering not only what people ate and drank, but when they did,"" said Schweikart.Frederic Tudor knew the world would crave cold drinks if he could deliver ice during hot weather. But in the early 19th century, there was no easy way to cut ice out of ponds in winter and keep it frozen for fast delivery to warm areas.Tudor was undaunted.At 23, he bought a brig (a two-masted, square-rigged ship) to carry ice from Boston to the Caribbean. Insulating the ship with straw and wood shavings, he arrived to find no one interested.Tudor lost $4,500 (equivalent to $90,000 today), and his next several tries were even worse disasters.Over the next 15 years, he was repeatedly arrested for debt, paid bail and stayed one step ahead of creditors until he became one of the richest men of the era.""No one had thought of harvesting New England wintertime ice and marketing it as a table necessity,"" Salvatore Basile, author of ""Cool: How Air Conditioning Changed Everything,"" told IBD. ""Up to that point, cold food and chilled beverages were very occasional treats in cold climates or where the rich had their own ice houses. More surprising, his first target markets were the West Indies, Havana, New Orleans — where the locals were so unfamiliar with the frozen stuff that Tudor had to give out printed instructions with each purchase to explain how to store and use it.""To create demand, he gave out free samples and, as he predicted, eventually no one ever wanted warm drinks again.""Boston BredTudor (1783-1864) was the third son of a wealthy Boston lawyer and his wife. Frederic's older brother William would become a leading literary figure, founding the North American Review and dubbing Boston the Athens of America.Frederic took another path. He refused a chance to go to Harvard, and at 13 he became an apprentice at a store. He and another older brother, John, also made money exporting furniture to Havana.At 17, Frederic accompanied John on a voyage to Cuba, thinking that John's injured knee would heal in the tropical sun.What Frederic soon noticed was the lack of iced drinks. His family had an ice house back in Boston and chipped away at blocks to make ice cream. He began thinking of a way to bring ice to the tropics.When the boys returned to America, their father set Frederic up with friends at an import-export house, which helped the young man launch his wildly ambitious dream.In November 1805, Frederic sent William and a cousin to scout Caribbean entrepreneurs who might want to buy exclusive rights to the use of ice. But when Frederic arrived a few months later with 80 tons that had survived the voyage, none of the prospects would pay what he wanted, so he held out for better offers until it melted away.""The overwhelming majority of humans living in equatorial climes in 1800 would have literally never once experienced anything cold,"" wrote Steven Johnson in ""How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World."" ""The idea of frozen water would have been as fanciful to the residents of Martinique as an iPhone.""Johnson added, ""(Tudor) assumed the absolute novelty of ice would be a point in his favor. ... Instead, (it) received blank stares. ... The bleak pattern of the Martinique voyage would repeat itself in the years to come, with ever more catastrophic results. ... For most of his early adulthood, he was an abject failure, albeit one with remarkable tenacity.""In 1812, the Tudor family lost most of its assets thanks to the patriarch's bad investments and extravagant living. Frederic was sent to jail in March until he paid down some debt a month later. By June, the War of 1812 with Britain had begun, cutting off trade. Suddenly Frederic's plan of prospering in the Caribbean was put on ice.""At 26, after seven years of struggle, when he tallied up his gains and losses, Frederic found his assets, including properties, came to $28,400, but his liabilities amounted to $38,772, owed to a variety of people, including his blacksmith and tailor,"" wrote Carl Seaburg and Stanley Paterson in ""The Ice King."" ""Although he wasn't able to ship, his busy brain was not still at all. Turning around the ship design conventions of the time, Frederic modeled a shallow, rounded hull deepest at the bow, with a pronounced keel at the stern.""In maritime Boston, however, Frederic's novel concept attracted attention. ... By the spring of 1813, a new ship in his design had been constructed.""But trouble kept following him.As he was about to do a test sailing of what he called the Black Swan, Tudor was arrested for not paying a $300 debt. After posting bail, he took the ship on its maiden voyage, only to find that it wasn't likely to withstand the high seas.He spent the war years experimenting with: Caskets that could keep ice frozen during voyages. Insulation materials like rice chaff and sheepskin. Designs for double-hulled storage depots at destinations. Iron boxes to sell to stores and people to help preserve their ice.Peace And OpportunityWhen the war ended in 1815, Tudor was able to negotiate cheap shipping rates; the barren soil of New England produced nothing of value to send to the tropics, leaving outbound vessels empty.""Most of the trade in natural goods involves material that thrives in high-energy environments,"" wrote Johnson. ""Sugar cane, coffee, tea, cotton — all these staples of 18th- and 19th-century commerce were dependent on the blistering heat of tropical and subtropical climates. ... The cash crops of the tropics caused populations to swell in climates that could be unforgivably hot, which in turn created a market for a product that allowed you to escape the heat. ... That was Tudor's great insight.""Underlying Tudor's challenge were the massive problems of slow transportation and communication, as well as the lack of financial liquidity and easy borrowing in the pre-20th century economy.From 1816 to 1824, the Ice King had dramatic ups and downs: Tried to ship tropical fruit back under ice, but most of it rotted. Didn't have enough money to bribe every Cuban official necessary to build storage depots and kept having to start over. Set up partnerships with family friends in Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga. Withstood customer deaths when yellow fever periodically raged through warm regions. Saw his ships full of ice sink. Employed incompetent workers and crooked agents. Had to hire someone in a warm New England winter to go to Labrador, Canada, to cut up an iceberg and haul it to Martinique. Suffered through an economic depression in 1818-19 that dried up credit and customers. Found new investors through William's network, while a younger brother, Harry, helped establish the firm in booming New Orleans.Teamwork""The big turning point came in 1825, when Tudor met Nathaniel Wyeth, a hotel owner who patented an ice plow harnessed to a horse that cut deeply into the ice, allowing manual laborers to make the last cuts and pry up the blocks,"" said Larry Schweikart, co-author with Lynne Doti of ""American Entrepreneur: The Fascinating Stories of the People Who Defined Business in the United States.""

1205,UPS,"For prospective homebuyers in Brooklyn, an asking price is just a starting point. In the second quarter, half of the homes that sold in New York's most populous borough did so at or above their listed price as the supply of properties failed to keep up with demand, according to a report Thursday by real estate data website StreetEasy.com, owned by Zillow Group (Z) .The highest mark-ups were in the Prospect Heights and Park Slope neighborhoods, where half of buyers paid at least 4% more than what owners were seeking.""This is a highly competitive market,"" said Alan Lightfeldt, the data scientist at StreetEasy who compiled the report. ""Buyers are tripping over themselves to get these listings, and they are often outbidding each other.""Demand to live in Brooklyn — seen as one of New York's hippest locales and a cheaper alternative to Manhattan — has pushed property values to records. Previously owned homes sold in the second quarter for a median of $526,474, the highest in 11 years of data keeping, as buyers crowded open houses in a rush to make deals, StreetEasy said in its report.The median asking price of Brooklyn homes listed for sale in the quarter jumped 26% from a year earlier to $689,000. Properties spent an average 41 days on the market, three days less than homes in Manhattan.In all of Brooklyn, including the southernmost part farthest from Manhattan, a majority of sellers in the quarter got at least 90% of the price they sought, StreetEasy said.A two-bedroom co-op apartment in Park Slope sold on June 22 for $950,000, or 12% more than the $850,000 asking price, according to StreetEasy. In Prospect Heights, a 1,828-square- foot duplex condominium listed for $1.9 million was purchased last month for $2.04 million, a 7.2% increase.Other neighborhoods where sellers prevailed include Carroll Gardens, where half of buyers paid at least 2.7% more than the list price. In Brooklyn Heights, mark-up for a majority of sales was 1.8% or higher.""It really highlights the experience that buyers can expect to have,"" Lightfeldt said. ""Sellers are getting more bargaining power in their transactions.""

1206,UPS,"As a career and professional trader, I am often asked about my thoughts on trading options. The world of trading options seems mysterious and complicated if you have not been exposed to it. A lot of the strategies have strange names, like Iron Condors, Butterflys, and Calendars. What in the world do these have to do with trading? 
"
1207,UPS,"As you get more involved in trading options, you may hear vastly different stories from different people depending on their own trading experiences. If someone makes money, they will tell you trading options is the best thing in the world and you should certainly do it. Conversely, if someone loses money trading, they will tell you to stay away as you will most certainly lose all your money. Neither of these comments is entirely true and the more people that you ask the same question to, the more wildly the stories will vary. I wanted to take a minute to clear the air, and talk about some of the most common myths concerning options trading. 
"
1208,UPS,"1) Options are risky 
"
1209,UPS,"This is probably the most common myth and a blanket statement that options are too risky is simply not true. To me, this is the same as saying, ""a dog bit me one time, and so all dogs are bad"". 
"
1210,UPS,"So where did this myth come from? I think there are 2 primary reasons for this. First is the fact that people can and do lose money trading options. There is a possibility to lose money with options as with almost any other investment on the planet. Options pricing is tied to the underlying stock or index which can rise or fall quickly so there is a price risk element to trading options. The good news is that you can use options strategies to eliminate the price risk or take advantage of the risk. You can buy options or you can sell options, depending on which side of the risk you want to be on. The risk is not in the option itself, it is in HOW you use it. 
"
1211,UPS,"The second reason is that most newer traders try to use options in the wrong way. Options can give you a great deal of leverage which can be good or bad. If you are using options to speculate, you are greatly increasing your chances of loss. Options were developed to allow people to hedge their risk, not to take on more risk. 
"
1212,UPS,"2) Options are too complicated 
"
1213,UPS,"It is true that options are based on math and initially some of the concepts may seem foreign. However as you dig deeper, you will find that as with any ""complicated"" subject matter, options can be broken down to its basic components and it starts to make sense quickly. The point of learning the art of trading options is that you can use the option ""math"" to your advantage to protect and grow your portfolio. 
"
1214,UPS,"3) Options are expensive 
"
1215,UPS,"This is another argument that I personally don't really understand. Options are traded in contracts on most all stocks and indexes with prices ranging from low to high. As an example, you can buy or sell options on a stock priced at $500 or you could choose a stock priced at $50 or anywhere higher or lower. As you choose a higher or lower priced vehicle to trade, the price of the option itself will vary greatly. By simply selecting lower priced stocks you can greatly reduce the price of the contracts you want to trade. The other way to reduce the price is to simply buy or sell fewer contracts. You can buy or sell 1 contract as easy as you can buy or sell 10 contracts. 
"
1216,UPS,"4) You are better off just buying and holding 
"
1217,UPS,"This is an age old argument that may never be settled, however after trading professionally for over 25 years, I can say that in more cases than not, buy and hold is not as effective. There are always exceptions, however being proactive and managing your trades can add value in most cases. By using options to accomplish this, for example, one can sell cash covered PUT's to acquire stock at lower prices or use covered CALL's to sell stock at higher price. These are only 2 simple ways to enhance a portfolio and as you increase your knowledge of option concepts, a whole new world of potential strategies can open up to you. 
"
1218,UPS,"5) If you are not careful, you will get assigned 
"
1219,UPS,"Unless you have traded options before, you may not quite understand this one. When you have ""short"" options, there is an embedded risk of an early assignment. What this means is that when you use ""short"" options, you agree to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price. In some cases, you may have to buy or sell a stock earlier than you anticipated. This is called ""assignment"". 
"
1220,UPS,"While this is an argument, and is true, assignment is not necessarily a bad thing. Also, it is very rare that you will get ""assigned"". In fact, you can prevent this from happening all together if you are monitoring your positions. If you have a ""short"" option that is at risk, you can simply close the position at any time and eliminate your risk of early ""assignment"". 
"
1221,UPS,"So in summary, take the myths and other trader's personal experiences with a grain of salt. Everyone has different skill levels, time frames, risk tolerances, and goals for their portfolio. Remember that options are primarily used as a hedging tool and designed to ""save"" money. An option by itself is simply a tool and can be used in a variety of ways. Learn to use the tool and craft a portfolio of trades that can withstand the ups and downs of the market over time. The old saying, ""the more you learn, the more you earn"" is correct here. Learn how to use options the right way and use them to protect and enhance your portfolio rather than trying to use them to double your money overnight.

1243,UPS,"Tony Zinni is entitled to question conventional military thinking. As a Marine company commander in Vietnam in 1970, he was severely wounded.
"

1245,UPS,"During the 1991 Gulf War, he oversaw the Patriot missile defense batteries in Israel.

1246,UPS,"From 1997 to 2000, Gen. Zinni headed up U.S. Central Command.
"
1247,UPS,"He has been in charge of humanitarian and diplomatic missions from Kenya to the Philippines.
"
1248,UPS,"Tom Clancy was so impressed that he co-authored the story of Zinni's career, ""Battle Ready.""
"
1249,UPS,"""My generation learned bitter lessons in Vietnam and elsewhere and we swore never to repeat the mistakes, if we ever rose to high command,"" Zinni, who with Tony Koltz wrote ""Before the First Shots Are Fired,"" told IBD from his home in Williamsburg, Va. ""I vowed to speak the truth, even if it hurt my career.""
"
1250,UPS,"College And War
"
1251,UPS,"Anthony Charles Zinni, 71, grew up in Conshohocken in eastern Pennsylvania.
"
1252,UPS,"In 1965 he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Villanova University, near Philadelphia. All the while he was in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and graduated as a Marine second lieutenant.
"
1253,UPS,"With the Vietnam War raging, Zinni went to Camp Lejeune, N.C., for a year, rising to command an infantry training company.
"
1254,UPS,"After Army Special Warfare School at Fort Bragg, N.C., where he learned Vietnamese and was promoted to first lieutenant, Zinni headed for Vietnam in March 1967.
"
1255,UPS,"He left behind a new bride, Debbie. Their son, Anthony, is now a Marine major.
"
1256,UPS,"Zinni became an advisor to Vietnamese marines, calling in U.S. air and artillery firepower. He grew to respect their bravery and skills. He also recognized the dedication of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army regulars.
"
1257,UPS,"""I came to believe that we could have prevailed if our leaders had bothered to understand the South Vietnamese and had given them a government they were excited to fight for,"" said Zinni. ""We never emphasized winning hearts and minds, while the NVA convinced or coerced them.""
"
1258,UPS,"He rose to captain in July 1967, and when his 10-month commitment was up, Zinni wanted to extend his tour an additional six.
"
1259,UPS,"But he was so sick with a maze of diseases, he had to be shipped to a hospital in Guam. Recovering back in America, he spent two years as a Marine instructor at Quantico, Va.
"
1260,UPS,"In August 1970 he returned to South Vietnam as an infantry company commander, based in Da Nang. His battalion boss was Lt. Col. Mick Trainor, whom Zinni calls ""one of the smartest officers the Corps ever produced.""
"
1261,UPS,"In November, Zinni was conducting an operation that ran into strong resistance. Three AK-47 rounds went right through his flak jacket. An emergency operation removed a third of the muscle in his back before he was shipped to Guam for skin grafts from his legs.
"
1262,UPS,"By December, he had recovered enough to finish his yearlong tour commanding a supply battalion on Japan's Okinawa Island.
"
1263,UPS,"More Death
"
1264,UPS,"America's combat role delivered the Paris peace treaty of 1973.
"
1265,UPS,"But with U.S. troops gone, South Vietnam fell to the communists two years later.
"
1266,UPS,"Thereafter, Zinni pushed for combat command and training positions while sharing his analytical and management skills. ""Marines have always tolerated mavericks and encouraged officers to speak out, which has been a big factor in making the Corps an innovator,"" he explained.
"
1267,UPS,"While Maj. Zinni attended the National War College in Washington, D.C., in 1983, Muslim terrorists slaughtered 220 Marines in a barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon.
"
1268,UPS,"In short order, Lt. Gen. Trainor recruited Zinni to rethink anti-terror strategy. That led to the creation of the Marine Expeditionary Unit,which would go in harrowing spots meant for special forces.
"
1269,UPS,"As a colonel in 1987, Zinni took charge of an MEU on Okinawa and conducted security operations in the Philippines.
"
1270,UPS,"General On The Go
"
1271,UPS,"By 1990, he had his first star and was deputy director of operations at European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, a front-row seat as the Soviet Union came apart.
"
1272,UPS,"""But we didn't plan for the end of the Cold War to give stability to a world which had ignored or suppressed other problems for so long, from illegal drugs in Latin America and Islamic extremism to ethnic tensions in the Balkans and disease in Africa,"" said Zinni. ""We naively thought the main result would be a big savings on defense.""
"
1273,UPS,"After overseeing the Patriot missile defense of Israel during the Gulf War, he headed relief for the Kurds in Iraq and Turkey.
"
1274,UPS,"Then came a promotion to major general, plus missions in Somalia later in the 1990s. They helped him see the bigger picture of smart power, the full deployment of assets and skills to reach U.S. goals.
"
1275,UPS,"""The military can't go it alone anymore,"" Zinni said. ""We have to have integrated solutions to problems, and we have to stay involved in a closely connected world.""
"
1276,UPS,"His next big leap came in 1997, when he landed a fourth star and took over U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla.
"
1277,UPS,"His responsibility covered operations in what would soon expand to 25 countries, from East Africa to Central Asia, so he read 50 books to grasp their culture.
"
1278,UPS,"The big military operation during this tour was Desert Fox, a series of airstrikes in 1998 to batter Iraq's chemical weapons.
"
1279,UPS,"Zinni retired in September 2000 with 22 personal awards in addition to his Purple Heart, including a Defense Distinguished Service Medal and a Bronze Star.
"
1280,UPS,"A year later, on 9/11, Muslim terrorists struck again, this time killing 3,000 in New York City and Washington, D.C.
"
1281,UPS,"America soon hit back in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"
1282,UPS,"Zinni had already prepared a report for U.S. leaders in case of a fight in the Middle East, and he was shocked to learn no one read it.
"
1283,UPS,"""Regardless of their original positions on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, there's a consensus among the retired leaders I know that we relied too much on technology, didn't provide enough troops and didn't do adequate postwar planning,"" said Zinni. ""No one thought we would be putting $2 trillion on a credit card for the first time. Dwight Eisenhower came to the presidency from the strong planning culture of the military, and his presidency is known for its careful decision making, something we haven't seen in recent administrations.""
"
1284,UPS,"He thinks Eisenhower, who after winning World War II was president from 1953 to 1961, would endorse these ideas to revamp the Pentagon and overall defense:
"
1285,UPS," Because of conflicts between the advice the Joint Chiefs are supposed to give the president and their loyalties to their services, replace them with former service chiefs or combat commanders.
"
1286,UPS," Eliminate the unnecessary layer of bureaucracy of the service secretaries and their staffs. Instead, have the services report to the defense secretary through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as regional combat commanders do.
"
1287,UPS," Instead of having so many troops at forward bases, rely more on coalition partners and a rapid-deployment force.
"
1288,UPS," Fund a more robust staff in nonmilitary agencies to provide humanitarian and political aid after or in lieu of military action. Improve cooperation with countries on economics, energy and education to prevent flare-ups.
"
1289,UPS,"""If more Americans would listen to General Zinni, we'd have a better foreign policy and a happier country,"" said Thomas Ricks, author of ""The Generals.""
"
1290,UPS,"After retiring, Zinni served on corporate boards and in 2009 was CEO of BAE Systems' North American unit. He's now on the board of Michael Baker International, a Pittsburgh engineering and consulting firm. He also serves on the boards of many not-for-profits, including Colonial Williamsburg.
"
1291,UPS,"Meanwhile, he teaches at the Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Va., and in the executive program at Villanova University.
"
1292,UPS,"He's also a student, working on a master's degree in negotiation from Creighton University. If he doesn't ace that, you have a scoop; he's been on many diplomatic missions, from Israel to Indonesia.
"
1293,UPS,"""I practiced negotiation before, but now I want to understand the theory,"" he explained.
"
1294,UPS,"This would be his third master's. The others are in international relations from Salve Regina University in Rhode Island and in management from Central Michigan University.

1297,UPS,"This should have been the opening remark from Janet Yellen yesterday during her Congressional Humphrey Hawkins testimony....The song is right - it has been a bit confusing of late - BUT Yellen - as you might expect remains upbeat about the U.S. economy, citing an increase in consumer spending (forget the fact that retail sales declined by 0.3% in Tuesday's report) along with the improving employment picture (where exactly that is - is another question) as she prepares investors for the coming increase in rates.......
"
1298,UPS,"What I thought was interesting is the fact that she thinks that the chaos in Europe and China 'isn't threatening the U.S. economy enough' to cause her to veer off course. As expected - she did not get pinned down - she did though try to make clear that her preference is to move rates up sooner and slower rather than later and faster....I think most investors/analysts and strategists would agree with that strategy...and so the market did not panic.....Look - the Fed and every other central bank around the world will continue to do their part to stimulate and support global markets...(since elected officials are clearly impotent and are unable to perform as expected) .......so sit back and relax....no worries....the song says - ' I've come to give you a hand and lead you to the promised land' doesn't it?

1299,UPS,"Across the pond - a couple of things happened - just in case you missed it.....Greeks voted to accept the latest (and worst) bailout plan - but not without any drama.....late yesterday - images appeared of Athens under fire....Molotov cocktails being tossed about, police using tear gas to disperse the crowds, inside the parliament building - the room erupted into chaos - Greek ministers up in arms with Alexis - as the sense is he sold his country out....yet in the end - the measures did pass (was there really a choice?). If nothing else - the deal does provide some respite and will allow that country to return to some sense of normalcy. For the markets - yesterday's vote did represent a major hurdle and now that it is over investors can move forward and look ahead - this morning it is clear that the 'Risk On' mentality is alive and well as Global markets are all in relief rally mode.

1316,UPS,"E-commerce king Amazon.com (AMZN) has become the latest tech company to test a radical plan to enlist ordinary people, rather than professional carriers such as United Parcel Service (UPS), to deliver packages, according to a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday.

1317,UPS,"Amazon.com is developing a mobile application that would pay people to drop off packages as they're on their way to other destinations, according to the newspaper. Amazon.com ships an average 3.5 million packages a day, according to SJ Consulting Group.

1330,UPS,"For example, growth and core had been running close to each other at the end of Q3 2012. But then long-time laggard value funds started to outperform growth for a spell. As growth's ascent moderated, the value component in core funds pushed their performance ahead of growth funds.

"
1346,UPS,"BioMarin announced that the FDA had accepted its filing of drisapersen, the DMD drug it acquired with its buyout of Prosensa last year, and set itself a deadline to make a ruling by Dec. 27. Since that's a Sunday, the decision is bound to come before Christmas.
"
1347,UPS,"BioMarin also said the FDA plans to convene a committee of independent advisors sometime beforehand to evaluate the issues around the drug, which was generally expected on Wall Street, given the uncertainties on the clinical trials. Drisapersen failed to hit the primary endpoint of its phase three trial, which caused Prosensa's big pharma partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to bail out of their partnership. However, BioMarin says the totality of the data points toward long-term efficacy against the chronic disease, and the lack of any current treatments for this serious condition — along with patient advocacy — is putting pressure on the FDA to approve something.

The stock cleared a 117.42 buy point from a cup-with-handle base Jan. 10, but didn't move much after that (1).However, after the close Feb. 7, the company posted fourth-quarter earnings of 35 cents a share, up 192% from a year ago. It trounced views of 19 cents a share. It also marked a second straight quarter of triple-digit growth.The stock gapped 13% higher at the open the next day and surged 21% for the session. LinkedIn bolted nearly 73% by early May before consolidating gains (2).

1382,UPS,"Baidu (BIDU) and other China tech stocks fell on Monday on the heels of data showing the country's manufacturing sector is shrinking.Baidu, China's leading search engine, is slated to report Q2 earnings after the close Monday. Analysts expect the company to continue to feel pressure on its profit margins in the wake of a weak showing in Q1.Baidu stock was down 4% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 199, and is down 14% this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting Baidu to post Q2 revenue of $2.6 billion, up 38% year over year, and EPS ex items of $1.71, down from $1.73 in Q2 2014.For Q3, Wall Street is expecting Baidu to post revenue of $3.02 billion, up 37% year over year. Analysts are expecting EPS ex-items of $1.95, up 2%.Baidu stock fell sharply in April after the company reported Q1 revenue below Wall Street expectations and gave soft Q2 guidanceas it spent heavily to advance its mobile business in the face of competition from China e-commerce leader Alibaba Group (BABA)and others.In recent months, Chinese authorities have shored up the stock market and encouraged citizens to buy shares, even as economic growth looks to be flat or slowing. China's gross domestic product rose 7% in the first half of the year, faster than most countries but down from its double-digit growth rates just a few years ago. China's GDP rose 7.4% in 2014.The latest stock plunge comes as a host of China companies traded on U.S. stock markets have received offers from top executives and others to go private. They plan to delist in the U.S. and instead to go public in China, despite a crash in the Chinese exchanges that followed big run-ups that many analysts called a bubble.Even with China's stock crash, U.S.-listed China firms likely will still find that their valuations back in China will be ""five to 10 times"" what they're fetching on Wall Street ""even though the Chinese stock markets have been down more than 50%,"" wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang wrote in a research report on July 8.On Monday, the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 8.5%, its biggest single-day fall since 2007, casting doubts on stabilization moves from Chinese authorities, according to a report in Monday's Los Angeles Times.The Shanghai Composite lost 345.35 points Monday to close at 3,725.56, with about 1,800 listings falling by the daily limit of 10%. That's off more than 28% from Shanghai's peak in mid-June, but is still 76% higher than it was a year ago, the Los Angeles Times report said.The Shenzhen Composite fell 7% on Monday.Other China stocks that were down Monday afternoon include: Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), down 4%; Netease (NTES), down 7%; JD.com (JD), down 7%; and Sohu.com (SOHU), down 4%.Follow Michele Chandler on Twitter: @IBD_MChandler.

1395,UPS,"In Europe - markets are bucking the Asian trend and all moving higher. Yes - investors are watching the ongoing drama in China - but now seem to be putting all of that on the back burner - at least for today. The focus is on earnings and U.S. fed policy.....

1402,UPS,"Wireless phone companies aim to improve spotty network coverage and add data capacity by turning to ""small cell"" technology — a strategy that may also enable them to tap unlicensed, Wi-Fi-type radio spectrum in the long run.
"
1403,UPS,"Crown Castle (CCI) is the cell tower operator most likely to benefit, as it aims to play a large role in small cell deployment by wireless firms.
"
1404,UPS,"Crown Castle in April made its second major small-cell-related acquisition, buying Sunesys for $1 billion in cash. In 2011, Crown Castle bought NextG for the same price.
"
1405,UPS,"Verizon Communications (VZ), a Crown Castle customer, is leading the charge to small cell technology as data demand surges on its 4G LTE network. Wireless firms generally use large cell towers across the U.S. to whisk calls, video and email to mobile phone users. Wireless firms also use large radio antennas installed on building rooftops, church steeples, billboards, or even farm silos and fake trees.
"
1406,UPS,"But small cell technology is gaining ground in urban areas. The low-power ""base stations"" are located in shopping malls and outdoor public spaces. They're often mounted on lamp posts or utility poles, and are roughly the size of a suitcase.
"
1407,UPS,"There are about 150,000 full-size cell towers, operated by tower companies Crown Castle, American Tower (AMT), SBA Communications (SBAC) and others.
"
1408,UPS,"The number of small cell base stations is potentially much bigger, depending on whether AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) follow Verizon's lead. Sprint, amid a network upgrade, is expected to deploy small cell technology in 2016.
"
1409,UPS,"""We think there's an opportunity for small cells in most urban environments,"" Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's CEO, told IBD. ""It's a vast geography.
"
1410,UPS,"""When we look at maps that we're working on and the locations we're building out today, you can come to the conclusion that this is going to go in virtually every major suburban and urban area. We're talking about building out block by block.""
"
1411,UPS,"The rub for Crown Castle and its rivals is that rising use of small cells might mean wireless firms will need fewer big towers, which analysts say are highly profitable to operate.
"
1412,UPS,"Moreland, whose company operates 40,000 towers, disagrees.
"
1413,UPS,"""We can find no evidence, nor a carrier customer who is suggesting it's an either/or proposition,"" he said. ""It's complementary and additive.""
"
1414,UPS,"Cell towers aren't going away, but small cell technology is coming on strong, says Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.
"
1415,UPS,"""Carriers are going with small cells because they need to upgrade capacity in a particular spot, like an office building,"" Entner said. ""So instead of building a larger, more expensive tower site, they prefer to do a more topical solution.""
"
1416,UPS,"For smartphone users, small cell deployments should mean fewer dropped calls and faster video downloads. Mobile phone users share radio signals and spectrum capacity, with service degraded as more devices are connected.
"
1417,UPS,"Small cell technology also could help wireless firms tap a new source of airwaves, unlicensed spectrum.
"
1418,UPS,"As for licenses airwaves, AT&T spent $18.2 billion in the recent AWS-3 spectrum auction, the most of any company. Verizon spent $10.4 billion.
"
1419,UPS,"Those additional airwaves, however, won't be enough to meet long-term demand. Verizon is interested in augmenting its licensed spectrum with new airwaves that federal regulators plan to set aside for Wi-Fi-type networks.
"
1420,UPS,"The Federal Communications Commission in April voted to make 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz frequency band available for mobile broadband and other commercial uses. The FCC also is studying whether to open up nearly 200 MHz of spectrum in the 5 GHz band.
"
1421,UPS,"Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are among the cable TV firms interested in using 5 GHz airwaves to expand public Wi-Fi services, analysts say.
"
1422,UPS,"Meanwhile, Verizon is keen on using unlicensed spectrum, and it's been testing a 400-node small cell system in Boston.
"
1423,UPS,"Amir Rozwadowski, a Barclays analyst, says Verizon has focused on its small cell initiative for about 18 months. He says Verizon's interest in small cell systems goes beyond near-term data capacity needs and is related to the ""multiyear evolution of its network.""
"
1424,UPS,"Rozwadowski added in a research report that Verizon is already putting in the foundation for a shift to next-generation 5G mobile networks. Wireless firms globally are expected to deploy 5G networks after 2020.
"
1425,UPS,"To get small cell systems in place in urban areas, Verizon has been working with building owners and local regulators.
"
1426,UPS,"Verizon also has been in talks with suppliers of fiber-optic wiring that connects small cell systems to the Internet and long-distance phone networks, or the so-called backhaul system. The fiber hook-ups speed up mobile data performance.
"
1427,UPS,"Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO), which leases fiber connections to cell tower operators, has told analysts it's interested in the burgeoning small cell market.
"
1428,UPS,"As for Crown Castle, its April 30 acquisition of Sunesys, a unit of Quanta Services, boosted the wireless tower company's ability to provide fiber-optic hook-ups for small cell backhaul services.
"
1429,UPS,"Analysts say Crown Castle made the move in part to meet Verizon's needs. Sunesys owns or has rights to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metro markets. So, Crown Castle now can provide fiber services similar to the likes of Zayo. That's a new business for Crown Castle, notes Rozwadowski.
"
1430,UPS,"Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, likes Crown Castle's investments in small cell technology and its Sunesys acquisition.
"
1431,UPS,"""Small cells will be a central pillar of (4G) network architecture for Verizon and Sprint in the second half of 2015 and especially 2016 and for T-Mobile and AT&T moving forward,"" said Smithen, in a report. ""Sunesys allows Crown Castle to jump-start its business plan by several years by shrinking build-out time and spending for metro fiber networks.""
"
1432,UPS,"In 2014, small cell contracts accounted for 7% of Crown Castle's overall revenue, more than at American Tower and SBA Communications. As in the case of cell towers, Crown Castle expects small cell installations to be share-able among multiple wireless carriers, boosting profits.
"
1433,UPS,"""Crown Castle has the biggest potential for upside to consensus (estimate) forecasts if Verizon and Sprint small cells kick-in,"" Smithen added.Wireless phone companies aim to improve spotty network coverage and add data capacity by turning to ""small cell"" technology — a strategy that may also enable them to tap unlicensed, Wi-Fi-type radio spectrum in the long run.Crown Castle (CCI) is the cell tower operator most likely to benefit, as it aims to play a large role in small cell deployment by wireless firms.Crown Castle in April made its second major small-cell-related acquisition, buying Sunesys for $1 billion in cash.

That's a new business for Crown Castle, notes Rozwadowski.Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, likes Crown Castle's investments in small cell technology and its Sunesys acquisition.""Small cells will be a central pillar of (4G) network architecture for Verizon and Sprint in the second half of 2015 and especially 2016 and for T-Mobile and AT&T moving forward,"" said Smithen, in a report. ""Sunesys allows Crown Castle to jump-start its business plan by several years by shrinking build-out time and spending for metro fiber networks.""In 2014, small cell contracts accounted for 7% of Crown Castle's overall revenue, more than at American Tower and SBA Communications. As in the case of cell towers, Crown Castle expects small cell installations to be share-able among multiple wireless carriers, boosting profits.""Crown Castle has the biggest potential for upside to consensus (estimate) forecasts if Verizon and Sprint small cells kick-in,"" Smithen added.

MDC Holdings (MDC) stock rose 3.3% to 29.68 as volume lifted 217%. Lennar (LEN) shares were up 1% to 47.96, while KB Home (KBH) stock was up 0.5% to 14.99.The surging stocks come as homebuilder confidence hit a nine-month high, rising 5 points to 59, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo data released Monday. Results greater than 50 signal that homebuilders are optimistic about sales. It was the 12th straight month of above-50 hopes.Despite the optimism, the housing sector's recovery has been sluggish since the recession ended in June 2009. Slow job and wage growth, young buyers burdened with student loans and restrictive mortgage standards have been cited for the sector's tepid recovery.Ryland CEO Larry Nicholson, who will serve as CEO and president of the yet-unnamed combined company, told the Wall Street Journal: ""We expect to see slow, steady growth for the next couple of years.""The Standard Pacific-Ryland deal would result in the two Southern California-based companies controlling 74,000 home sites.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter: @IBD_CMcEvoy.

1454,UPS,"Shampoo tycoon Paula Kent Meehan chased silver-screen dreams. Then her star bubble burst. ""After painfully coming to the conclusion Hollywood wasn't going to make me the next Joan Crawford, I wanted to control my own destiny,"" she said.Meehan (1931-2014) ended up turning heads in the business world.With $3,000 earned from acting jobs — equivalent to $23,500 today — she launched hair-care startup Redken Laboratories in 1961. The shampoo firm lathered industry stalwarts like Clairol and took 20% of the U.S. hair-care market by 1980.In 1993, Meehan sold the firm — which tallied $165 million in sales that year — to a L'Oreal (LRLCY) American subsidiary for an undisclosed sum.""Although Paula Kent Meehan did not achieve her ambition to be a Hollywood star, she launched one of the most influential American beauty startups of the 1960s and 1970s,"" Geoffrey Jones, author of ""Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry,"" told IBD.Meehan restyled the industry by applying highbrow science to hair care products. The company's concoctions — formulated by partner and chemist Jheri Redding — promised to make tresses healthier.""Simultaneously, she decided not to compete with incumbents in department stores and drugstores, but instead sell directly to the professional salon channel,"" said Jones.That move elevated the role of stylists, whom Meehan trained to market her wares. Competitors rushed to copy the approach.Good Look""It's a model of how a crowded and quite mature market can be shifted and reshaped by a new entrepreneurial entrant,"" Jones said.As a businesswoman, Meehan shone. ""Paula Kent was a truly inspiring woman who transformed the hair care industry,"" said Shane Wolf, Redken Worldwide general manager. ""With her great passion and entrepreneurial spirit, she touched the hearts and minds of so many people.""Meehan led the firm for decades — partner Redding sold his stake in the mid-1960s and launched competing firms — and maintained a high profile in business and philanthropy until her death at age 82.""Like any company, Redken had its ups and downs but never once experienced a losing year, so we had a good reputation on Wall Street,"" she told the Beverly Hills Courier.She was born Paula Baer in that Los Angeles enclave to accountant Richard Baer and housewife Lois.The California girl began acting at age 12 and dropped out of school at 15 to marry beau Donald Slocum.A divorced mother by age 17, Paula made ends meet as a secretary, gas station attendant and actress. Her stage name: Paula Kent.She appeared in commercials and won bit parts in TV shows, peaking with a recurring role as a restaurant hatcheck girl on the 1960s detective show ""77 Sunset Strip.""""Like every actress, I had to spend many hours with studio makeup artists and hairdressers,"" she recalled.Unlike other actresses, she had allergic reactions to hair products. So she turned to a friend's husband, Redding, who owned a beauty salon in Van Nuys, Calif.""More than strictly being a beautician, he was actually a frustrated chemist who knew all about the ingredients contained in the products being put on people's hair,"" Meehan said.His formulations eliminated allergic reactions and made hair healthier because he matched the suds' pH — or measure of hydrogen vs. hydroxide ion levels — to the hair's acidic pH level, which made locks stronger and shinier.Hence the oft-marketed phrase ""pH balanced.""With Redding's concoctions, Meehan looked beautiful without breaking out in itchy bumps.On the hunch that other women would benefit, the duo launched Redken Laboratories — taking Red from Redding and ken from Kent — in 1961.""My primary motivation selfishly was not only to find natural and gentle products suitable for my own hair and skin, since what I'd come across wasn't doing the trick, but also be in a business that would help others,"" Meehan said.The first batches were mixed in a bathtub with a rowing oar and dubbed with lab-inspired names: Amino Pon and PPT S-77.The solutions seemed unconventional. Redken's shampoo didn't lather, and the conditioner would turn hair brittle if overused.The need to educate beauticians on how to properly apply the products turned into a marketing boon.""We began to pioneer the teaching of the chemistry of hair to stylists so they could be better equipped to serve their clients' needs,"" Meehan said. ""In effect, this served to elevate the art of hairdressing to a higher technical and professional standard.""Come On InThe in-salon retailing approach became the new style.""Salons began to realize that it was crazy not to sell a woman shampoo. She was going to buy it someplace,"" Meehan said in a 1984 interview with Forbes.Her pioneering paid off. Redken's sales hit $1.5 million in 1966, or $11 million in today's money.For a promotional push, Meehan pursued a big name to expound on her shampoos and conditioners. The one-time aspiring actress understood celebrity power and went after the biggest in hair: French stylist Vidal Sassoon.When he spoke, women listened.""I never thought I'd pay anyone what I paid Vidal,"" Meehan told Modern Salon magazine. ""I was shocked at the expense, but I was also shocked at the numbers of people who turned up to see him.""Meehan knew how to attract good people.She hired John Meehan as a vice president of sales in 1969 and married him in 1971.The opposites achieved professional balance.""John Meehan was a buttoned-down kind of guy with a very low tolerance for risk, and my mother was an entrepreneur who took a lot of risks,"" Michael Miller, Paula's son from a previous marriage, told Modern Salon. ""John was analytic; she was creative. But the two of them together were able to do great things for the industry and for themselves.""Great things were happening for the future Mrs. Meehan.In 1970, the company was operating out of a 20,000-square-foot building in Van Nuys, and she was invited to join a local bank's board.The experience let the entrepreneur rub shoulders with some of California's top businessmen and emboldened her to expand.ExpansionRedken's 1971 initial public offering raised $5 million, with which Meehan built a 250,000-square-foot headquarters, manufacturing plant and research facility in L.A.'s Canoga Park neighborhood. The added capacity helped the firm expand distribution to 35 countries.The hair care industry, meanwhile, became a scientific arms race as competitors vied to outformulate each other.""One thing we never scrimped on was research. It was an ongoing effort by a large staff,"" Meehan told the Beverly Hills Courier.Her company would hold more than 80 patents, and the enterprising executive who'd taken night classes in business became an evangelizing chairwoman who shared her enthusiasm with employees and distributors.""By 1988 and sales of $120 million, I had enough of being a public entity and decided to take the company private again,"" Meehan said.With a personally guaranteed $58 million loan, Meehan bought back the company's publicly owned shares in 1988. By 1993, sales had soared to $165 million.The company had long turned away suitors such as Revlon (REV) and Helene Curtis. But after 32 years of business, Meehan accepted a purchase offer from Cosmair, the U.S. licensee of cosmetics giant L'Oreal.Meehan didn't rest after the sale, instead remaining active in business and philanthropy.She helped launch an annual industry recognition event called the Global Salon Business Awards and purchased the Beverly Hills Courier a few months before her death.Meehan simply went after what she wanted, said son Michael: ""She had a drive and appetite that far exceeded her experience.""

1455,UPS,"Half the public now supports sending ground troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as support for President Obama's strategy deteriorates, the latest IBD/TIPP poll finds.This stunning finding highlights the growing concern about the recent successes of IS, including the fall of Ramadi in Iraq and Palmyra in Syria, both of which occurred before the survey started.The poll, which was conducted last week, found that 50% now back sending ground troops into Iraq and Syria, while 44% oppose it. Last September, just 42% supported ground troops to fight IS, while 52% were opposed.Even among Democrats, support has gone from 19% last September to 32% in the latest poll.These results come despite Obama's repeated claims that his strategy is working, his pledge not to send ground troops into this fight and the public's perceived war weariness with the Middle East.But the poll shows that Americans are deeply concerned about IS, with 75% saying the group poses ""a serious and direct threat to the American homeland."" That view is shared across all demographic, political and ideological groups.And 80% believe the Islamic State's use of social media to recruit Americans poses a real threat to the country.The majority also see the loss of Ramadi as an indication of ""a weak U.S. strategy"" — 69% say this. Just 21% buy the White House spin that it was just ""part of the ups and downs of warfare.""The poll also finds the public less convinced that Obama has a clear plan to defeat IS than previously: Just 17% say he does, down from 21% when the same question was asked in March. Nearly three quarters (73%) say Obama doesn't have a clear plan, up from 63% in March.In addition, just 26% think the U.S. and its allies are winning the war against IS, while 70% say they aren't. Those numbers have deteriorated slightly since February.However, two-thirds of the public remain upbeat that the U.S. will ""eventually succeed"" in defeating IS. While this belief is held more strongly by Democrats (73% of whom say IS will be defeated), more than half of the Republicans surveyed (59%) also have a positive outlook in this regard.

1456,UPS,"The stock market takes a lot of flak for being impersonal. Arguments for or against automated trading aside, stocks are bought and sold by people. People manage and staff publicly traded companies that sell goods and services to, you guessed it, other people.In the end, it's all very personal.Many times, successful investors are buying into visionary leaders as much as they are the actual companies. This is true for many when it comes to Facebook's (FB) Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla's (TSLA) Elon Musk or the omnipotent aura of Apple's (AAPL) Steve Jobs. In other cases, the leaders have less star power but carry a solid background with successful companies.That's why every investor's fundamental research regimen should include a look at a target company's executive management. It takes only a few minutes to get a general sense of who you are dealing with.Chase down a company's annual 10-K Securities & Exchange Commission filing. These forms, as well as profiles on the company's website, list executive management and detail their experience. If it's a young company, look for the 424b prospectus filed prior to the initial offering.Do quick searches of the executives by reading past articles in IBD's The New America and Internet & Technology sections. Get some sense of where the executives came from and what their accomplishments and failures are.A search for news on the Web is also important, because 10-Ks won't tell you an executive's failings.Brilliant inventors, creators and visionary thinkers often make lousy executives. In contrast, some of the best managers have climbed the ranks amid difficult circumstances. They understand a company and its markets from the customer level up.Are there any managers to watch today?Consider the new McDonald's (MCD) CEO, Steve Easterbrook. He took the management helm in March and announced a vast restructuring and turnaround strategy at the beginning of May.Easterbrook is a Brit who was an accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers before shifting to a management position with McDonald's in London in 1993. He earned the company's top management slot, first in the U.K., then in Europe. He left for several years to run London-based restaurant chains PizzaExpress and Wagamama.Easterbrook re-upped with McDonald's in 2013, earning the title of global chief brand officer.McDonald's shares jumped 5% in late January on news of Easterbrook's appointment, then rose another 8% over the next five weeks. They've been basing since early March as investors wait to see whether Easterbrook proves to be a genuine force for change.Yahoo's (YHOO) Marissa Mayer is not a brand-new CEO, but her task is no less Herculean.She joined Google (GOOGL) in 1999 as the company's 20th employee and first female engineer. She helped build the company, had ups and downs, and notched notable successes, but she had no real experience outside the Google cocoon or as the ultimate decider atop the management heap.Yahoo shares have risen 231% since Mayer took the CEO post in July 2012. But the stock is down 15% so far this year.

1476,UPS,"In an unusual move, Chinese nuclear scientists have warned their U.S. counterparts they have significantly increased their intelligence estimates of North Korea's nuclear weapons capabilities far past American figures.The ominous disclosure, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is alarming because, since North Korea's first weapons test in 2006, China's scientists have consistently produced weapons estimates far under those of the U.S.Now, however, the Chinese believe the poor hermit kingdom atop the Korean Peninsula may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads, according to the compelling Journal story. And possess the capability to double that number within the next year.The information could hardly come at a worse time for President Obama, who's currently leading talks with Iran over a controversial incomplete pact once designed to prohibit that country from developing nuclear weapons.Now, however, the evolving document reportedly settles for delaying Iran's development of such weapons of mass destruction, subject to contested versions of international inspections. But North Korea already has nuclear weapons.The implications for American diplomacy and security are serious globally and within northeast Asia, where South Korea and Japan, like Iran's Middle Eastern neighbors such as Saudi Arabia, could be expected to start a nuclear arms race in their own defense.Under existing treaties, an attack on South Korea or Japan would be considered an attack on the United States.And while Iran's nascent intercontinental ballistic missile development program is not part of the current negotiations, North Korea is already believed to have such a missile capable of delivering a warhead some 5,600 miles away.If operational, such a missile would put the entire Middle East with its vast energy resources, most of Europe and the northwestern third of the U.S. within range, including much of California.And, of course, such rogue nations might be tempted to sell or give a nuclear weapon to terrorists for use or blackmail.While Obama declares that all options, including military action, remain on the table regarding Iran, his actions and inactions, such as his empty red-line threat in Syria or vows to end Russia's annexation of Crimea, hold little credibility. He hasn't even permitted provisions of defensive weapons to the embattled government of Ukraine.According to the Journal's analysis, ""The (revised) Chinese estimates reflect growing concern in Beijing over North Korea's weapons program and what they see as U.S. inaction ... .""Of course, the Chinese estimates could also be designed as distractions from China's own aggressive military moves, for instance, constructing new offshore bases.The new estimates also have potential domestic political impacts as the U.S. presidential campaign gets underway.They would elevate the importance of foreign affairs in the GOP primary debate, which would play to the strengths of some candidates, like Sen. Marco Rubio of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while possibly hurting the arguments of others, including governors rarely as conversant in diplomacy and military affairs.Such legacy threats could also damage Hillary Clinton's bid to overcome history and win a third consecutive Democrat White House term. She was secretary of State for 65% of Obama's presidency, including the Benghazi murders and Libya's descent into terrorist chaos.A new CNN/ORC Poll published last Wednesday found Americans are also focused on the Middle East — but not Iran. The survey of 1,018 adults said 68% of them see ISIS as a very serious threat. This compares with 39% who say that about Iran, 25% about Russia and 18% on China.North Korea is seen as a very serious threat by less than a third of adults (32%). Malcolm is IBD's national politics columnist at Investors.com/Andrew Malcolm.

1489,UPS,"Waste: After spending billions on state-run ObamaCare exchanges, the federal government is only now writing clear rules on how that money can be spent, while half of the exchanges head toward bankruptcy.state-run exchanges were supposed to form the beating heart of ObamaCare. And the Obama administration dumped almost $5 billion in an effort to make it a reality.The results have been a disaster.Of the 37 states that received $2.1 billion in grants to establish an exchange, only 17 did so, and they got an additional $2.7 billion from the feds.Of those 17, two went bankrupt in the first year. One of them, Oregon, had received a $60 million ""early innovator grant."" Residents of those states now use the federal Healthcare.gov site.A memo from Health and Human Services' Inspector General Daniel Levinson warns that some of the remaining may be violating federal law in an effort to stay afloat.ObamaCare told the states that they'd get plenty of federal money to help them set up their exchanges — but not run them. And starting this year, the state exchanges had to be self-financing — they had to pay their own way out of exchange fees or other funding sources.Any federal grant money left over could be used only for things other than operations and maintenance.As the IG explains, the rules on what these states can spend federal money on are vague, and as a result the exchanges ""might have used, and might continue to use, establishment grant funds for operating expenses.""Washington's exchange, it found, has plans to spend $4 million of its remaining federal grant money on printing, postage and bank fees.The IG characterized this is ""a significant matter"" that requires ""immediate attention.""Responding to this urgent memo, Sens. Orrin Hatch and Chuck Grassley pressed the administration to respond to this issue, and were told the administration would do so ""soon.""Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that half of the remaining state exchanges face serious financial problems as they wrestle ""with surging costs, especially for balky technology and expensive customer call centers — and tepid enrollment numbers.""Minnesota's user fees, for example, will cover just a quarter of its cost next fiscal year. Washington state's exchange faces a $4.5 million deficit.Enrollment gains won't help.The 15 remaining state exchanges saw sign-ups climb 12% this year.But that includes huge enrollment jumps in Maryland and Massachusetts, both of which suffered massive technical problems and enrolled a tiny number in ObamaCare's first year. Absent those two state, sign-ups climbed just 7.5%.In California, which faces an $80 million deficit, enrollment barely budged.The federal exchange is hardly in better shape. The administration has poured more than $2 billion over the past four years into building the Healthcare.gov exchange, according to a Bloomberg analysis, and even now it remains half built.The SHOP exchanges ObamaCare set up for millions of eligible small businesses are failing as well.A Government Accountability Office found enrollment was ""significantly lower than expected."" Just 2,000 businesses signed up in California, for example, and only 72 did so in Washington.The Obama administration hasn't bothered to release sign-up data for the federal SHOP exchange.Obama sold his overhaul as a way to bring greater efficiency and discipline to the health care market. As evidenced by the exchanges it created, the exact opposite is occurring.Today, thanks to ObamaCare, there's more waste, more bloat and more needless bureaucracy in the health care system than ever.

1503,UPS,"With nine months still to go before actual nominee selection begins, the 2016 presidential field is still unfolding.Today, Mike Huckabee jumps in again, one day after Carly Fiorina joined the GOP contest and after Sen. Don Quixote, er, Bernie Sanders, announced he's taking on presumptive Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.Mrs. Clinton herself is back in Las Vegas today for another of her patented patent citizen roundtables, this one on immigration. (Watch the Huckabee kickoff from Hope, Arkansas on C-SPAN at 11a.m. and the Clinton Vegas event at 5:45p.m., both Eastern Time.) Perhaps more importantly, though, a new Wall Street Journal / NBC News Poll is out. Most polls this early merely reflect name recognition. But this one provides revealing insights to the evolving thinking of Republicans, Democrats and the most important group of all come fall 2016, independents.You can read the entire Journal poll story here. Our takeaways of the most interesting lessons follow:1) From a broad electorate point of view, Clinton's campaign roll-out since April 12 has been a disaster, thanks to all the negative attention to her family foundation's shady fundraising and ongoing questions about her illegal email server as secretary of State.Those with negative views of her jumped from 36% to 42% in just one month. While those believing in her honesty sank from 38% last summer to barely 25% now. Not a good trend coming after the tumultuous era of questionable ethics under Obama.2) But among Democrats, Clinton is Teflon. Fully 86% see her as sufficiently knowledgeable and experienced to take over the Oval Office, while barely 14% don't trust her. This is great in primary/caucus season.3) However, among swing voters, that vital segment necessary to capture enough electoral votes, signs of serious trouble for Clinton. Those independents with a negative view of her soared from one-third (34%) to nearly one-half (48%) -- in only a month.4) Clinton retains quite strong support among women, where in individual, hypothetical match-ups she outdraws four potential Republican opponents. You'll never guess who does best against her though? The eye doctor, Rand Paul, who did particularly well against her among independents.5) Among Republican primary voters, Jeb Bush retains his lead in the fractured field with 23% support, followed by Marco Rubio at 18%, the unannounced Scott Walker with 14% and Paul and Ted Cruz tied at 11%.But hidden in those responses is a revealing stat. The candidate whom most Republicans could see themselves eventually supporting, regardless of their current favorite, is Marco Rubio. Watch this one in coming months.Finally, a warning for any Wisconsin governor who didn't finish his studies at Marquette University. Walker may want to take those last few credits online in coming months. Because nearly two-thirds of voters say they'd have reservations supporting someone as commander-in-chief with no college degree.RELATED:How long can Hillary dodge media questions?Can Hillary Clinton survive her role in the Benghazi murders?The first backer of Hillary Clinton from 2008 dumps her this timeHillary Clinton wants constitutional limits on free speech of others

""They are very focused on the cost side of the business and they continue to invest in technology, which allows them to improve efficiencies across the board.""

1541,UPS,"Old Dominion focuses on less-than-truckload, or LTL, transport. This means that multiple shipments are usually contained on a truck, which then delivers the goods to one of its 225 service centers for distribution to clients. The firm operates in the national as well as regional markets. It also has been expanding its worldwide freight forwarding services.
"
1542,UPS,"Mover In The Market
"
1543,UPS,"The company's stellar business performance is reflected in its market performance. Old Dominion stock jumped 46% last year, while investors who had held on to the shares for a decade could benefit from a nearly 600% gain.
"
1544,UPS,"It's the highest-rated company in IBD's Transportation-Truck industry group, which includes 20 stocks. And it's second largest by market cap, after J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) . Swift Transportation (SWFT) is third in size.
"
1545,UPS,"Old Dominion was founded in 1934 by current CEO David Congdon's grandparents, with a single truck running between Richmond, Va., and Norfolk, Va. Congdon became president and chief operating officer in 1997. Currently, Old Dominion operates its service centers across most of the U.S. and runs more than 6,400 tractors and 19,400 trailers.
"
1546,UPS,"In addition to serving national markets, Old Dominion also set a goal of operating in the regional, interregional and long-haul markets, all under one corporate office and computer system, Congdon says.
"
1547,UPS,"The company has been successful in competing with small regional players as well as national carriers within the U.S. It also expanded its reach outside of the lower 48 states to Canada, Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii and the Caribbean. Partnerships in global freight forwarding have provided Old Dominion access to China and other international markets.
"
1548,UPS,"Old Dominion notes that it holds a 5% to 6% market share in the LTL industry, as estimated by an independent market research firm. The company plans to double this number within the next couple of years.
"
1549,UPS,"The carrier has one of the industry's lowest cargo claim ratios. ""Historically, the LTL industry has had a cargo claim ratio of 1% to 1.5% of revenue,"" Congdon told IBD. ""We have driven ours down this year to in the range of 0.3% to 0.35%.""
"
1550,UPS,"Several elements contributed to low claims. Those include logistics racks in all trailers to avoid shifting of shipment within the trucks during transportation, the use of airbags between cargo, the use of straps and more.
"
1551,UPS,"But the most important tool, said Congdon, is getting the employees to use these tools.
"
1552,UPS,"""You can invest all you want in all the tools,"" he said. ""But until you get employees believing in what they should be doing every day, that's the biggest key to the success.""
"
1553,UPS,"That said, the company has put a substantial amount of investment into its operations and infrastructure in the past decade. This trend is expected to continue in the next several years as it plans to take a larger slice of the LTL market.
"
1554,UPS,"""It's going to be a combination of growth capex, investing in technology and improving their existing infrastructure for when they get to bottlenecks or points that they've outgrown the existing infrastructure that they had in place,"" said Fowler.
"
1555,UPS,"What About Oil Prices?
"
1556,UPS,"Old Dominion also has a track record of effectively managing the expense side of operations.
"
1557,UPS,"With oil prices slashed to less than half of what they were just six months ago, analysts expect fuel-cost savings to be largely passed through to the customers.
"
1558,UPS,"The trucking industry has traditionally operated with fuel price surcharges that adjust on a weekly basis, and Fowler doesn't expect to see a big tail wind or headwind for the company from the changing price of fuel.
"
1559,UPS,"""What we're more focused on is the indirect impact of what's happening with changes in end markets from the standpoint that the oil and gas related to the drilling activity has consumed a lot of freight capacity,"" he said. ""If we see those end markets slow, that could free up some capacity overall in the industry.""
"
1560,UPS,"However, counterbalancing it would be the benefits consumers would receive from lower fuel costs, according to Fowler.
"
1561,UPS,"""Typically when we think about freight activity in general, it's probably two-thirds consumer oriented and one-third manufacturing,"" he noted.
"
1562,UPS,"Net-net, Fowler expects a modest benefit from lower fuel costs on the expense side.
"
1563,UPS,"Additional risks for the company include some increased competition. While the cost and barriers of entry to this business are quite steep for traditional players, the entrance of technology-based truck brokerages has created some competition by providing more favorable cost to smaller customers, explained Fowler.
"
1564,UPS,"Large companies such as FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) also have their own LTL business, which gives price advantages in bundling various services.
"
1565,UPS,"""One of the big industry issues is the driver shortage,"" said Congdon. ""There are fewer people growing up and saying 'Hey, I want to be a truck driver.'""
"
1566,UPS,"Drivers Wanted
"
1567,UPS,"Congdon estimates that today the industry is short about 50,000 to 60,000 drivers. This figure is expected to surpass 200,000 in the next decade.
"
1568,UPS,"""The good news for our company is ... we have a fertile soil to grow our drivers,"" he said.
"
1569,UPS,"Old Dominion offers competitive pay for people who can start working on its docks, without having to have college education. They can then transition into becoming drivers for pay topping $60,000 a year and sometimes as high as $100,000.
"
1570,UPS,"The company reports its 2014 fourth-quarter and year-end results on Feb. 5, before trading opens. Analyst consensus as polled by Thomson Reuters calls for sales of $717 million and $2.78 billion for each period respectively.

Analysts expect 19% EPS growth this year.For Old Dominion Freight Line, the less-than-truckload carrier, logistics and freight-forwarding company, 2014 turned out to be the proverbial perfect storm.Industry capacity constraints, supply disruptions, the growing economy and the company's strong execution all contributed to excellent results for the North Carolina firm, said analyst Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.One year of double-digit earnings and sales growth does not necessarily make a best-in-class operator, but Old Dominion's (ODFL) strength goes much further back. It has at least a decade of strong results under its belt with only one year of noticeable decline in profit and sales, as the recession's effects were being felt in 2009.

1572,UPS,"In the age of text messages, talking with someone over the phone seems as quaint as sending a fax.
"
1573,UPS,"Online and mobile food ordering company GrubHub (GRUB) is betting on the demise of the phone call.
"
1574,UPS,"""Ten years from now is anybody going to pick up the phone and order food?"" asks Adam DeWitt, chief financial officer of GrubHub.
"
1575,UPS,"GrubHub has a lot at stake in seeing the phone call's passing. It's the largest online and mobile food ordering company in the U.S. And it wants to keep it that way as people turn to smartphones to conduct their everyday lives.
"
1576,UPS,"GrubHub, based in Chicago, was founded in 2004 by two Web developers, one of them its CEO, Matt Maloney. In 2013 it merged with chief rival Seamless and in April 2014 went public, at an offering price of 26.
"
1577,UPS,"Hungry investors bid up GrubHub stock 31% from the IPO price on the first trading day. After some ups and downs, shares ended the year at 36.32. GrubHub stock is up 16% so far this year.
"
1578,UPS,"Restaurant Receipts Rack Up
"
1579,UPS,"GrubHub's platforms let Web and mobile users order takeout food from 30,000 restaurants in more than 800 cities in the U.S., plus London.
"
1580,UPS,"At year-end, more than 5 million active diners used GrubHub's platforms to order takeout food, 40% more than a year earlier.
"
1581,UPS,"""Once they've tried it, customers become very sticky and GrubHub becomes a way of life for them,"" DeWitt said in an interview with IBD.
"
1582,UPS,"On a typical day in the fourth quarter, GrubHub sent more than 200,000 orders per day to restaurant partners.
"
1583,UPS,"Analyst Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Co. notes that GrubHub has ""one of the best business models in local Internet and a powerful competitive lead.""
"
1584,UPS,"GrubHub figures that its addressable market for takeout food is around $70 billion. That includes food sales from independent restaurants and pizza parlors, but excludes large pizza chains, high-end restaurants and cafeterias and their like on the low end.
"
1585,UPS,"In Q4, GrubHub processed $508 million in gross food sales, up 37% from the prior year. That put the company on path for an annual run rate of around $2 billion. Even at $2 billion, GrubHub's market share would be only around 3%.
"
1586,UPS,"So there is still a lot of untapped potential, DeWitt says, even in its strongest markets, such as Chicago, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles. (In New York, GrubHub mostly promotes under the regional brand Seamless.)
"
1587,UPS,"""We're in most of the markets we want to be in. The question is how deep we're in them. We could easily double the amount of business we do without adding a single restaurant, by driving new diners to those restaurants,"" DeWitt said.
"
1588,UPS,"How? He ticked off everything from social media and search engine optimization to radio, TV and banner ads in buses and subways.
"
1589,UPS,"GrubHub spent $19 million on sales and marketing in the fourth quarter and $66.2 million for the full year, up from $12.4 million and $48.3 million, respectively, a year earlier.
"
1590,UPS,"How Does GrubHub Work?
"
1591,UPS,"GrubHub customers can choose from a list of popular takeout options near their homes or offices. Once they decide on what they want, GrubHub transmits their orders to restaurants for fulfillment and delivery.
"
1592,UPS,"GrubHub's average commission on an order is 14.5%. Restaurants can bid up commissions for better placement on GrubHub's search website.
"
1593,UPS,"When GrubHub looks to sign new restaurants, it goes ""neighborhood to neighborhood,"" DeWitt says.
"
1594,UPS,"""We can't sign up every restaurant right away because if we push the peddle too hard the restaurants won't get a lot of business from us. So we need to balance growth in each market.""
"
1595,UPS,"GrubHub's revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 50% from a year earlier to $73.3 million, and on a full-year basis it was up 49% to $253.9 million.
"
1596,UPS,"Earnings in Q4 came in at 13 cents per share, up from three cents a year earlier, and topping the consensus view of analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll.
"
1597,UPS,"The company guided revenue expectations for 2015 to between $335 million and $350 million.
"
1598,UPS,"""Our biggest competition is the paper menu in the drawer,"" DeWitt said.
"
1599,UPS,"But online rivals are circling. In early February, consumer-reviews website Yelp (YELP) acquired Eat24, viewed as GrubHub's closest rival, for $134 million.
"
1600,UPS,"The deal ""likely marks a more competitive era in U.S. food delivery,"" wrote Kopelman in a research note. Nevertheless, he added, ""GrubHub remains in the driver's seat.""
"
1601,UPS,"Analyst Ralph Schackart of William Blair thinks there could be some fallout for GrubHub longer term.
"
1602,UPS,"""If consumer habits change and users begin to view Yelp as a place to transact rather than review, Yelp will be well positioned to gain market share from GrubHub,"" Schackart wrote.
"
1603,UPS,"He noted that Yelp has 135 million unique visitors and 1 million U.S. restaurants listed on its website and mobile app. But he also noted that such a shift from reviews to transactions is not occurring at a ""meaningful pace"" and that Eat24's revenue is a fraction of GrubHub's.
"
1604,UPS,"Eat24 was already a partner of Yelp, so the deal will essentially allow Yelp to retain the full transaction fee rather than splitting it, Schackart said.
"
1605,UPS,"Meanwhile, GrubHub will be digesting two new acquisitions of its own, both delivery companies. One, Boston-based DiningIn, was acquired in early February and another, Restaurants on the Run, which is big on the West Coast, is expected to close soon.
"
1606,UPS,"Driving To An Uber Model?
"
1607,UPS,"Restaurant partners usually handle deliveries, but GrubHub has been testing in-house deliveries in several cities. But DeWitt says in-house deliveries remain a small part of its overall business.
"
1608,UPS,"Kopelman notes that GrubHub's expanded delivery logistics business could ""re-accelerate growth"" in the number of its restaurant partners by adding eateries that previously did not offer delivery. He noted GrubHub's restaurant additions slowed in 2014 vs. 2013.
"
1609,UPS,"The move into delivery logistics is also a defensive move in the face of up and coming food delivery operations in various local markets, he noted.
"
1610,UPS,"Among them are Delivery Dudes in South Florida, ride-sharing car service Uber's uberFresh in L.A. and San Francisco-based Caviar, which focuses on high-end restaurants in several major cities.

1618,UPS,"A breakout from a deep base is risky.
"
1619,UPS,"The deep base harbors more resistance — in the form of overhead supply — than a shallower pattern does. (Overhead supply is upside price resistance tied to prior purchases of the stock at higher prices by disgruntled investors hoping to break even.)
"
1620,UPS,"The deep base, though, is sometimes a necessary preface to a successful base.
"
1621,UPS,"For example, consider the first consolidation that forms after the lows of a severe bear market. The stock will rise off the bottom as a new bull market begins, then often retreat to form a shallower pattern within the larger consolidation.
"
1622,UPS,"How should an investor respond?
"
1623,UPS,"You don't want to try to buy off the bottom because it might not be the bottom.
"
1624,UPS,"Investors are better off buying the first or second base that forms after the bottom is established or, in more normal markets, the first or second base after a deep base fails. The new bases are often shallower and more likely to succeed.
"
1625,UPS,"Think about it in human terms. Traders who bought on the left side of the deep base probably are sitting on losses. As the right side builds, they either exit or lighten the position. If the stock breaks out, emotions may prod them to sell more.
"
1626,UPS,"The overwhelming emotions for these investors are regret and fear. They regret buying and fear that another decline is ahead.
"
1627,UPS,"In a way, they are right. Their selling naturally helps create a new decline.
"
1628,UPS,"The new decline, though, is less steep because there are fewer weak holders left.

1630,UPS,"OK, but how deep is a deep base?

1634,UPS,"From the May 2008 high, the stock corrected 86%. It began to rise off the bear-market bottom in late November 2008, along with the general market.
"
1635,UPS,"After rising sharply off its bottom, Mercado formed a 41% deep consolidation. In the context of the previous 86% drop, 41% was acceptable. The stock advanced about 70% from the 17.45 buy point.
"
1636,UPS,"The next two bases were 35% and 36% deep. They're slightly deeper than the textbook definition, but that's Mercado. Breakouts led to gains of 103% and 57%.
"
1637,UPS,"A 48% deep base completed in December 2011 failed. Success didn't come until a breakout in March 2013 from a 25% deep base. The gain was 42% to 61%, depending on whether or not the investor was willing to sit through pullbacks.
"
1638,UPS,"Mercado also formed a 46% deep base from October 2013 to October 2014 (1). A breakout past a 119 handle gained 21%, but the stock began consolidating again. If it can hold above its 50-day line and finish its current pattern, a new breakout may occur.A breakout from a deep base is risky.The deep base harbors more resistance — in the form of overhead supply — than a shallower pattern does. (Overhead supply is upside price resistance tied to prior purchases of the stock at higher prices by disgruntled investors hoping to break even.)The deep base, though, is sometimes a necessary preface to a successful base.For example, consider the first consolidation that forms after the lows of a severe bear market. The stock will rise off the bottom as a new bull market begins, then often retreat to form a shallower pattern within the larger consolidation.How should an investor respond?You don't want to try to buy off the bottom because it might not be the bottom.Investors are better off buying the first or second base that forms after the bottom is established or, in more normal markets, the first or second base after a deep base fails. The new bases are often shallower and more likely to succeed.Think about it in human terms. Traders who bought on the left side of the deep base probably are sitting on losses. As the right side builds, they either exit or lighten the position. If the stock breaks out, emotions may prod them to sell more.The overwhelming emotions for these investors are regret and fear. They regret buying and fear that another decline is ahead.In a way, they are right. Their selling naturally helps create a new decline.The new decline, though, is less steep because there are fewer weak holders left.New buyers harbor hope, not regret and fear. They are stronger holders, i.e., more willing to give the position time.OK, but how deep is a deep base?The textbook definition for a cup base is 20% to 30% deep (in normal markets). For a flat base or saucer base, a normal decline is shallower: No more than 15% for the flat base and 12% to 20% for the saucer.An individual investor, though, shouldn't set concrete around the definition. Different stocks have different histories.For instance, Latin American online retailer MercadoLibre (MELI) has a history of fairly deep declines — followed by one or more run-ups from subsequent, more shallow bases.

1659,UPS,"Valentine's Day is a time for love, and love happens for coworkers just as it does for anyone else. People spend more time at work than anywhere else, so romances are bound to crop up. Rather than prohibit them or look the other way, set up rules of the road so people know what's OK. Here's how: Deal with it.  Accept that relationships occur at work. Don't try to prevent them. Govern them so problems don't arise later. ""People being people, there's a lot of office romance,"" Clarence Belnavis, an employment law attorney in the Portland, Ore., office of Fisher & Phillips, told IBD. ""It's like stopping people from breathing. You can't prevent it. But you can manage it in an appropriate way to avoid problems later."" Get it out there. When two co-workers date, it's vital for a firm to disclose the fact. ""Then you can manage it,"" said Di Ann Sanchez, who runs her own human resource consulting firm in Hurst, Texas. Make the rules. You need guidelines. Many employers say that they'll treat people like adults and trust that everything will work out. Wrong move. ""That's a disaster, and it will get you sued,"" Belnavis said. ""If you don't have a policy or plan in place, it means you're reacting after the fact."" Be clear. Start with a policy that one co-worker in a romantic relationship can't supervise the other. Lay out other rules prohibiting public displays of affection, retaliation and harassment.Institute a ""love contract"" stating that the relationship is consensual and doesn't affect either person's work, Belnavis says. If the relationship ends and there's an issue, the affected person will report the problem to human resources. ""Get it in writing and, more important, enforce the policy that's in place,"" he said. ""Hopefully you can handle any issues on the front end."" Be inclusive. Love contracts shouldn't deal only with co-workers. Relationships with clients and vendors also should be disclosed, Sanchez said: ""That's where the majority of the dating is. It protects the company from potential sexual harassment claims."" Guard against trouble.  Potential problems aren't limited to the two who are dating. There's the risk of creating a hostile work environment by calling each other pet names or describing how good the other one is in bed. ""The contract says they are going to conduct themselves in a business manner at all times,"" Sanchez said. ""They are subject to discipline if other people become uncomfortable."" Set consequences.  Enforce the policies that you have and don't make exceptions, Belnavis says.In one case, a male employee and a female co-worker dated and broke up. Years later, he became her boss. He had to sign off on a disciplinary matter involving her. She argued that he was retaliating against something in their dating life. He had never mentioned their dating to higher-ups; he was fired.""Today's bad relationship breakup can haunt you for decades to come,"" Belnavis said. Educate. Train employees on sexual harassment, Sanchez says. A lot of misconceptions exist. Be consistent. Enforce the rules the same way for everyone. Make sure that all parties are heard when you investigate a problem. Take the tough steps.  If two co-workers are married to other people and you suspect they're involved in an affair, deal with it as you'd handle any other relationship. Have everyone sign a document stating that they understand the office policies. ""If you have good, updated policies and you train people and enforce them,"" said Belnavis, ""then you should not have violations.""

1696,UPS,"With the heavy scent of having been planted by the Obama administration, the New York Times ran a ""How About That!"" feature on how the Energy Department has built a mock-up of Iran's nuclear facilities at the atomic weapons laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.The Times describes it and similar mock-ups at Los Alamos and other U.S. nuclear labs as a ""reverse Manhattan Project,"" its peculiar mission being to prove how not to be able to build the bomb.Talk about having your yellowcake and eating it too; or as the Times says, to ""enable Iran to say"" a nuclear site ""was still open, and the United States could declare it was no longer a threat.""This Disney World Animatronics brand of non-proliferation has purportedly convinced the president that Iran's main 24/7 underground uranium enrichment plant at Natanz can operate over 6,000 centrifuges, while ""keeping Iran at least a year away from acquiring enough enriched uranium to make a bomb.""But the Institute for Science and International Security found that the construction of Tehran's Fordow enrichment facility, with thousands of centrifuges housed within a possibly airstrike-proof mountain not far from Qom, near a Revolutionary Guard military base, began as early as 2006. Yet it was 2009 before U.S. intelligence discovered it.Are there other nuclear bomb-making facilities within the country's over 636,000 square miles? U.S. intelligence has been unpleasantly surprised again and again — from the Soviet Union's first nuclear test in 1949 to India's and Pakistan's in 1998 to the shock discovery of Fordow during Obama's first year in office.Iran's hardware can be partially duplicated at Oak Ridge, but its duplicity cannot be underestimated.

"
1715,UPS,"Midterms: Considering how it's a fiasco or scandal every other week or so in the Obama administration, this year's congressional elections should be a total blow-out for Republicans. They won't be, and that is inexcusable.As of late last week, the Real Clear Politics assessment of U.S. Senate contests forecast that Democrats had 46 sure seats, Republicans had 45, and nine were toss-ups.Given Democrats' abysmal performance in public office, how can they be hanging on as well as they are? Even a cursory look at recent events and policies shows how poorly the Democrats have governed. Under their party's president, the Middle East is on fire in a manner unseen since the 1970s, with innocent Americans and Britons being beheaded by the Islamic State in slick videos designed to taunt the U.S. public; the post-Cold War Russian bear has been reawakened by obvious U.S. global weakness. ObamaCare, is now fully exposed as based on lies and has been wracked from its inception by mismanagement, bad design and incompetence. The economic ""recovery"" — over five years after the end of the recession — is the worst ever; global firms are sitting on perhaps more than $7 trillion, which under policies enhancing economic freedom could be generating tens of millions of new jobs.If Republicans can't win big under these conditions, they might as well fold up their infamous ""big tent.""Why could this be the most glaring under-performance since Roberto Duran told Sugar Ray Leonard ""No Mas!"" and gave up in the eighth round 35 years ago?A recent New York Times analysis suggests ""Democrats have an edge on the air with ads"" in almost all races, ""and a significant advantage on the ground contacting voters in some of the year's most crucial contests.""New York Post columnist John Podhoretz last week warned that the GOP may not gain control of the U.S. Senate on Election Day because ""Democrats are vastly superior when it comes to the mechanics of American politics, and have been for nearly a decade,"" especially in bringing out ""so-called 'unenthusiastic voters' — people who would, if pressed, pull the lever for the guy but who were unmotivated to do so.""But Podhoretz also put his finger on a bigger factor: ""This year Republicans decided this wouldn't be an issue-based election, in part because the party itself isn't sure where it stands collectively on a variety of issues — and in part because, having recruited a first-class team of candidates, it was thought they would do better making a case for themselves state by state.""Banker Mike McFadden in Minnesota, Rep. Cory Gardner in Colorado, and physician Rep. Bill Cassidy in Louisiana are among a number of good candidates.But that is not enough.As we have warned about previous congressional elections, Republicans must take their winning ideas national to win — and then govern with a mandate.As ex-Obama press secretary Jay Carney told CNN last week, Democrat candidates' ""goal has to be — in this cycle — to run local and state races"" rather than ""have their races be nationalized.""Carney warned Democrats, ""We haven't seen a national wave yet; there's still time for that to happen.""The latest IBD/TIPP Poll finds only 43% believing the GOP is ""better suited to handle the problems the country faces today,"" not too far above the 40% who favor Dems, plus 14% who are not sure.This indicates there is work to do.Republicans must stand heartily behind the solutions that have brought them to power in the past: fortitude and realism in facing our enemies abroad; a low-tax economic climate that lets entrepreneurs succeed; reducing costly regulations on job-generating businesses; and support for the rule of law over anything-goes radicalism.They still have time, but the hour is late.

1750,UPS,"""The greatest influence in the life of a boy are his toys.""
"
1751,UPS,"With those words, and some hands-on playtime, A.C. Gilbert saved Christmas for America's kids and salvaged the country's up-and-coming toy industry.
"
1752,UPS,"A.C. Gilbert Co. — best known for its Erector Set, chemistry kits and toy trains — would become one of the country's largest toy firms, with yearly sales of $20 million in the early 1950s.
"
1753,UPS,"But first it had to get through World War I.
"
1754,UPS,"In 1918, the U.S. Council of National Defense was considering banning toy production, since the nation needed manufacturers and raw materials for war goods.
"
1755,UPS,"Gilbert's toy firm was just gaining ground, and he'd co-founded the Toy Manufacturers of America trade association two years earlier.
"
1756,UPS,"Bull's-Eye
"
1757,UPS,"Gilbert had 15 minutes to convince the council that toys, too, were essential.
"

"
1759,UPS,"""It is because of toys they had in childhood that the American soldiers are the best marksmen on the battlefields of France,"" Gilbert said.
"
1760,UPS,"Secretary of Commerce William Redfield picked up a Weeden Manufacturing steam engine from the toys that Gilbert assembled for the meeting and made the connection. ""I learned the rudiments of engineering on a machine like this,"" the secretary said.
"
1761,UPS,"Swayed by Gilbert that the gadgets imparted important knowledge, the council let toy manufacturers continue producing playthings along with war essentials.
"
1762,UPS,"The decision was pivotal, says William Brown, director of the Eli Whitney Museum and Workshop, which collects Gilbert's products and studies their legacy.
"
1763,UPS,"""The rationing would have cut (Gilbert's) business off at the knees,"" Brown told IBD. ""It really was the beginning of the American toy business.""
"
1764,UPS,"The hero moment was one of many for an ambitious and competitive man who excelled at seemingly everything he pursued, from pole vaulting to big-game hunting.
"
1765,UPS,"""To me, business is a game, and I'm not the kind of man who can stand still and be satisfied. I've got to keep building and improving,"" Gilbert wrote in his autobiography, ""The Man Who Lives in Paradise.""
"
1766,UPS,"All his life, Alfred Carlton Gilbert (1884-1961) was serious about play. Born in Salem, Ore., he developed a passion for magic and athletics.
"
1767,UPS,"The youngster spent hours perfecting sleight-of-hand tricks and shows. After turning the attic of the family's barn into a gymnasium, he organized track-style meets with neighbor kids. Continuing to work out, he did an amazing 40 consecutive chin-ups in 1901.
"
1768,UPS,"Such energy and discipline propelled Gilbert to Yale University in 1904, where he studied medicine while lettering in three sports — gymnastics, track and wrestling — and landing a spot on the U.S. pole vaulting team.
"
1769,UPS,"Golden Olympian
"
1770,UPS,"At the London Olympics in 1908, Gilbert tied with another American, Edward Cook, for the pole-vault gold.
"
1771,UPS,"Before leaving for America, Gilbert landed a business opportunity. While sightseeing, he purchased a supply of bamboo poles from a Paris furniture store for $1.25 each and had them shipped home with his Olympic gear.
"
1772,UPS,"He promptly turned the endeavor into a company, Yale Bamboo Pole Vaulting, selling the sticks for $25 each. He grossed $1,100 — around $25,000 today — before sporting goods firms caught on and found their own suppliers.
"
1773,UPS,"Meanwhile, Gilbert continued with his first love, magic, and earned $100 a night putting on shows. With the cash he socked away, he and a college friend launched a turn-of-the-century startup: a mail-order business for magic-trick kits.
"

Gilbert saved Christmas for America's kids and salvaged the country's up-and-coming toy industry.A.C. Gilbert Co. — best known for its Erector Set, chemistry kits and toy trains — would become one of the country's largest toy firms, with yearly sales of $20 million in the early 1950s.But first it had to get through World War I.In 1918, the U.S. Council of National Defense was considering banning toy production, since the nation needed manufacturers and raw materials for war goods.Gilbert's toy firm was just gaining ground, and he'd co-founded the Toy Manufacturers of America trade association two years earlier.Bull's-EyeGilbert had 15 minutes to convince the council that toys, too, were essential.He started with a direct hit. Consider the air rifles that youngsters use to shoot cans and targets.""It is because of toys they had in childhood that the American soldiers are the best marksmen on the battlefields of France,"" Gilbert said.Secretary of Commerce William Redfield picked up a Weeden Manufacturing steam engine from the toys that Gilbert assembled for the meeting and made the connection. ""I learned the rudiments of engineering on a machine like this,"" the secretary said.Swayed by Gilbert that the gadgets imparted important knowledge, the council let toy manufacturers continue producing playthings along with war essentials.The decision was pivotal, says William Brown, director of the Eli Whitney Museum and Workshop, which collects Gilbert's products and studies their legacy.""The rationing would have cut (Gilbert's) business off at the knees,"" Brown told IBD. ""It really was the beginning of the American toy business.""The hero moment was one of many for an ambitious and competitive man who excelled at seemingly everything he pursued, from pole vaulting to big-game hunting.""To me, business is a game, and I'm not the kind of man who can stand still and be satisfied. I've got to keep building and improving,"" Gilbert wrote in his autobiography, ""The Man Who Lives in Paradise.""All his life, Alfred Carlton Gilbert (1884-1961) was serious about play. Born in Salem, Ore., he developed a passion for magic and athletics.The youngster spent hours perfecting sleight-of-hand tricks and shows. After turning the attic of the family's barn into a gymnasium, he organized track-style meets with neighbor kids. Continuing to work out, he did an amazing 40 consecutive chin-ups in 1901.Such energy and discipline propelled Gilbert to Yale University in 1904, where he studied medicine while lettering in three sports — gymnastics, track and wrestling — and landing a spot on the U.S. pole vaulting team.Golden OlympianAt the London Olympics in 1908, Gilbert tied with another American, Edward Cook, for the pole-vault gold.Before leaving for America, Gilbert landed a business opportunity. While sightseeing, he purchased a supply of bamboo poles from a Paris furniture store for $1.25 each and had them shipped home with his Olympic gear.He promptly turned the endeavor into a company, Yale Bamboo Pole Vaulting, selling the sticks for $25 each. He grossed $1,100 — around $25,000 today — before sporting goods firms caught on and found their own suppliers.Meanwhile, Gilbert continued with his first love, magic, and earned $100 a night putting on shows. With the cash he socked away, he and a college friend launched a turn-of-the-century startup: a mail-order business for magic-trick kits.Graduation from Yale with a medical degree in 1909 forced a decision point.His deft magician's hands seemed natural for surgery, but Gilbert had more playful ambitions.

1809,UPS,"Best ETFs 2015: April Performance UpdateSchwab ETFs are growing fast. In just over five years, Schwab's 21 exchange traded funds have captured $30 billion in assets and 1.5% of total market share. It's now the seventh largest ETF provider in asset size, up from 10th a year ago. John Sturiale, a senior vice president at Charles Schwab (SCHW) Investment Management (CSIM), helped craft the brokerage's target retirement date funds in 2002.More recently, he created fundamentally weighted, smart beta ETFs. Sturiale spoke to IBD about his firm's strategy, pipeline and philosophy in ETF investments:IBD: What sets your ETFs apart?John Sturiale: We want to provide investors with access to high-quality ETFs that form the foundation of their investment portfolios at an extremely low cost.We were the first to offer commission-free ETFs with the launch of our first products in 2009.A few years later, we drove down costs even further — and in a dramatic way — by slashing the operating expenses on all our cap-weighted ETFs. To this day, they are the lowest in their respective Lipper categories.In 2013, we expanded our ETF roster beyond cap-weighted funds with the launch of six Fundamental Index ETFs.We believe that cap-weighted and fundamentally weighted strategies have an important role in an investor's portfolio.IBD: What surprised you most in the past five years?Sturiale: I'd say it's the incredible pace at which retail investors and advisers alike have embraced ETFs. ETF assets at Charles Schwab & Co. have increased from $83 billion in December 2009 to $231 billion at the end of 2014 — nearly a 3X increase in five years — with a compound annual growth rate of 23%. Those assets are split roughly 50-50 between retail investors and registered investment adviser (RIA) clients.It is clear that investors love the benefits that ETFs can provide: access to broad or niche segments of the market in a low-cost, accessible, transparent and tax-efficient wrapper.IBD: Why invest in Schwab U.S. Broad Market (SCHB) or Schwab U.S. Large Cap (SCHX) vs. the more established Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI) or SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)?Sturiale: The bottom line is investors can access high-quality products at the lowest cost. Period.All 15 of our cap-weighted ETFs now have at least a three-year track record.IBD: Why offer both smart beta and traditional, cap-weighted ETFs?Sturiale: Market-cap strategies provide cost-effective exposure to a broad market or market segment. Fundamental strategies also can provide broad-based market exposure, but securities are selected and weighted based on financial metrics such as earnings, sales or dividends.Because the companies within the underlying indexes are weighted differently, market-cap and fundamental index strategies perform differently across market cycles. Used in combination, they allow investors to build portfolios with better results in the long term.Quite simply, these strategies are better together.IBD: Any plans for actively managed ETFs?Sturiale: We wouldn't rule anything out, and CSIM does have exemptive relief to offer active ETFs. But we have a terrific product set that meets our client needs right now.With just three of our cap-weighted ETFs, U.S. Broad Market, International Equity (SCHF) and U.S. Aggregate Bond (SCHZ), investors can create the foundation of a diversified portfolio at an approximate cost of just 7 basis points. If they were to add Emerging Markets Equity (SCHE), the cost would rise to just 11 basis points. (Editor's note: That's $11 per $10,000 invested.)IBD: Are exchange traded managed funds (ETMFs) and nontransparent active ETFs a good idea?Sturiale: That's a question more appropriate for the SEC. They sent some pretty clear signals with their decisions last year.The (ETMF) model that ultimately did receive an exemption looks more like a mutual fund than an ETF in its structure. It's unclear to us whether these products will capture investors' interest. We don't expect it will be the watershed moment that, at one time, people thought nontransparent ETFs had the potential to be.IBD: How has Schwab ETF OneSource affected the market?Sturiale: Schwab ETF OneSource extended our commission-free ETF offering beyond Schwab ETFs. Today, Schwab clients can access more than 200 ETFs spanning 66 Morningstar categories for zero commissions.The numbers tell the story best: At the end of 2014, Schwab ETF OneSource had $38 billion in assets under management, and flows into ETFs in the program represented 43% of the total ETF flows at Schwab.Its success demonstrates that costs really do matter to investors.IBD: Schwab Index Advantage targets the 401(k) market. Do ETFs have a place in retirement portfolios?Sturiale: ETFs represent less than 1% of the $4 trillion-plus 401(k) market. Our company sees that as a huge opportunity to bring value to employers and their employees.With the ETF version of Schwab Index Advantage, employers have a low-cost, high-quality alternative that embeds advice.We don't believe excessive trading is a risk, and we've seen zero evidence of it. Some in the industry expressed a similar concern more than 20 years ago when mutual funds became popular in 401(k)s. It's important to remember that since ETFs have three-day settlement, it's actually possible to trade mutual funds more frequently than ETFs in a 401(k). But we just don't see this behavior.IBD: Is money flowing out of equity mutual funds and into equity ETFs at Schwab?Sturiale: While it's true that our ETFs are growing at a faster rate than our mutual funds, both continue to grow. We don't see a lot of evidence of assets moving directly from one to the other. In fact, in Schwab's 2014 ETF Investor Study, we asked investors which assets they intend to use for future investments in ETFs. The top three responses were existing cash, new cash and stocks.IBD: Schwab has been a somewhat disruptive force in the ETF industry. What challenges did you face?Sturiale: We've been disruptive because our No. 1 focus is our clients. We've heard directly from investors that cost is king. Of course, we want Schwab ETFs to be a top choice for investors but, to do that, we have been and continue to be vigilant in meeting client demand for high-quality products at an extremely low cost.IBD: What's the best investment decision you ever made?Sturiale: From the start of my career, I've been investing in my 401(k) every month through stock market ups and downs, in a well-diversified investment strategy.

"
1821,UPS,"Accountability: A year ago, the VA scandal involving extreme wait times and cover-ups broke. President Obama pledged urgent reforms, and Congress gave him billions to fund them. But so far, nothing's changed.On April 9, 2014, the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs announced its findings that several veterans had died waiting for treatment at the Phoenix VA Health Care System and that the organization had kept two sets of books to conceal the long waits.Over time, the scandal spread, as chronic, systemic delays and attempts to hide them at other VA clinics came to light. By August, the head of the VA was canned, and Congress rushed through a $16.3 billion bill to fix the problem.The day Obama signed that bill into law, he talked about how his administration was ""moving ahead with urgent reforms,"" and ""instituting a critical culture of accountability"" at the VA.He said that the administration was getting 215,000 vets off wait lists, the funding bill would ""give the VA more of the resources that it needs"" and the new law would let vets who couldn't get timely care through the VA ""get the care they need someplace else.""Problem solved, right?Not even close. Obama — and the mainstream press — may have moved on, but the VA that he promised to fix is as bad as ever.An investigation by the Associated Press published this week found that ""the number of patients facing long waits at VA facilities has not dropped at all."" Not. At. All.It found that the number of vets waiting between 30 and 60 days hasn't changed and that the number waiting more than 90 days to get an appointment ""has nearly doubled.""From last August through this February, the AP found, 1 in 36 patients had to wait more than a month before getting an appointment with a doctor.And those numbers don't count the veterans who simply gave up waiting or went elsewhere.The AP also found that the Choice program that Obama touted ""has barely gotten off the ground"" and that few vets understand how it works.How about that accountability Obama promised?This week, House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller complained, ""The VA's chief problem — a widespread lack of accountability among failed employees — is as prevalent today as it was a year ago.""He noted, ""Not a single VA senior executive has been fired for wait time issues.""The Washington Examiner provides more evidence of Obama's failure to change the VA's culture.One of the investigators whom Secretary Robert McDonald tapped to look into a case of medical negligence at a VA clinic, Deborah Amdur, was herself caught lying to Congress about a scandal at the VA facility she directed in Vermont.""If the Department of Veterans Affairs is serious about cleaning up its own affairs,"" the Examiner said in an editorial, ""it should not put liars in charge of investigating its own shortcomings.""As to that promise of ""urgent reforms,"" Secretary McDonald is now urging only patience as the VA slogs along at adding new capacity and dithers over making needed reforms.Of course, anyone who thought that tossing billions more dollars into the VA system would solve anything hadn't looked at the numbers.As IBD reported last year, health spending at the VA climbed 193% between 2000 and 2013, while the number of veterans served went up just 68%.Obama promised vets that he'd use the extra $16.3 billion that Congress gave him to give vets the health care they deserve. In a speech to the American Legion a few weeks after signing the VA funding bill, he told vets, ""We are going to fix what is wrong. We're going to do right by you.""Veterans should demand to know when Obama intends to live up to that promise.

Those who bought at the entry still hold a high single-digit percentage gain, but anyone chasing the stock on its way up would now have a smaller gain, if not a loss.Mobileye's technology goes into camera-based advanced driver assistance systems. Its technology is used in cars by most major automakers, and is thought to be in some new Tesla Motors ' (TSLA) vehicles.

1840,UPS,"Corruption: Smoking-gun emails show how the administration sought to derail a CBS reporter's investigation of its ""gun-waking"" operation — a reporter whose computers were mysteriously and mercilessly hacked.Fast and Furious, along with Benghazi, is one of the two ""phony"" administration scandals that produced body bags, and former CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson is responsible for much of the truth-telling about both. That fact is enough to put her high atop the administration's enemies list.Attkisson, a casualty of liberal media bias, resigned from CBS in March after a series of clashes between her and her bosses over her exposes of administration wrongdoing and its subsequent cover-ups. An email thread obtained by government watchdog Judicial Watch show just how upset Eric Holder's Justice Department and the White House were over Attkisson's reporting and how hard they tried to undermine her.The email thread's topic was concern over news reports linking Holder directly to the Fast and Furious program that had resulted in the deaths of agents Brian Terry and Jaime Zapata at the hands of Mexican drug cartels. The killers used weapons funneled south of the border under the administration's program.The first email in the thread between Tracy Schmaler, who headed Holder's Office of Public Affairs, and White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Shultz, timed at 7:46 a.m. on Oct. 4, 2011, titled ""No stories,"" noted that media outlets such as the New York Times, Associated Press, Washington Post, Reuters and Bloomberg were ignoring Fast and Furious. There was one notable exception — Attkisson of CBS News.""I'm also calling Sharryl's (sic) and reaching out to (Bob) Schieffer. She's out of control,"" Schmaler said to Shultz, who responded: ""Good. Her piece was really bad for AG.""For the White House and DOJ, control of the press was a must. They couldn't have a ""mainstream"" reporter spilling the beans.That administration operatives would be pressuring a network to censor a reporter is something we find very disturbing, but not surprising, particularly considering it's CBS that's involved. As we've noted, Attkisson's boss was CBS President David Rhodes, whose brother Ben Rhodes was an assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser for strategic communications.It was he who had been tasked to prep U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on how to deflect blame from the Obama administration for the Benghazi massacre of 2012. That terrorist attack was also the subject of Attkisson's investigative reports.Clearly, it's advantageous for a White House aide to have a brother who happens to run a TV network quite willing to push the White House spin.What makes this episode particularly interesting is that shortly after the administration expressed concern over Attkisson's reporting, both her personal and work computers, as she details in her book ""Stonewalled,"" were hacked by someone in the government.Earlier this month, Attkisson appeared on Fox's ""O'Reilly Factor"" and said a computer forensics expert she contacted confirmed that sophisticated intrusions had taken place and that proprietary spyware had been placed on her computer of a type used by the NSA, CIA, DIA or FBI. Attkisson has released a cellphone video of her computer screen showing words being deleted outside of her control from an article she was working on.The spyware was discovered to have been loaded from a seemingly innocuous email sent to her in February 2012 after she had just written on Fast and Furious. Was this an effort by the government to get her under ""control""?After the IRS neutralized the Tea Party, the government seized Associated Press phone records, and the DOJ named Fox News reporter James Rosen as a ""co-conspirator"" in a leak investigation in order to seize phone records and emails, the targeting of Attkisson is something we shouldn't turn a blind eye to.

1851,UPS,"Aggression: Less than 48 hours after President Obama vowed to ""defend Estonia,"" Russian goons kidnapped an Estonian cop to demonstrate just what U.S. red lines are worth. Any questions as to the nature of the threat?The abduction of Internal Security Service officer Eston Kohver from Estonia was no ordinary criminal act.The Russians who took him jammed police radios, tossed a smoke grenade, seized Kohver and marched him into Russia at gunpoint. They then falsely claimed that he was caught spying on Russian soil.It was nonsense. Estonia's leaders have said it was clearly a targeted attack and very serious, coming as it did two days after Obama made his strongest-worded speech ever on U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance.""The defense of Tallinn and Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the defense of Berlin and Paris and London,"" Obama said. ""Article Five is crystal clear. An attack on one is an attack on all.""So if, in such a moment, you ever ask again, who will come to help, you'll know the answer: the NATO alliance, including the armed forces of the United States of America, right here, present, now.""Well, it's into the ""right here, present, now"" that Vladimir Putin has stuck his face.His swift effort to nullify Obama's words is no different from his immediate neutralization of Obama's red line in Syria, a chess move that left Putin the dominant player in that country.With this latest provocation, on the heels of his invasion of Ukraine, as well as new airspace incursions over the Baltics and even Finland, Putin has again made the promises of the leader of the Free World sound hollow.The message here is that Russia can do whatever it likes in the region that it considers its near abroad, and no NATO alliance is going to be effective in stopping it.The Kohver abduction will have a terrible effect on Eastern Europe, which has just seen a bullied Ukraine sign a ""peace"" treaty with Russia. Ukraine had no choice, since the U.S. and EU failed to do much to help it defend itself.Putin picked on Estonia because it had the gall to host an American president and to forge an alliance with NATO. No doubt, he wants to see if NATO is a real mutual defense alliance — or a paper tiger.

1886,UPS,"When nobody gave him a chance, Nolan Richardson grabbed one.First, there was Western Texas College — a junior college in tiny Snyder, Texas.When Richardson helmed the men's basketball team there in 1978, he was the lone black head coach amid 50 junior colleges in the Lone Star State.Two years later, his Westerners shot to a 37-0 record and the national junior college title.In 1980, Richardson bounced to the University of Tulsa, a school coming off a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference.The Golden Hurricane promptly stormed to 26 wins, with Richardson becoming the first black coach to win the National Invitation Tournament championship.More ground-breaking came in 1985, when Arkansas made Richardson the first black head coach at a major university in the South.It all culminated in 1994 with an NCAA title for the Razorbacks.""One of the great feelings,"" Richardson, 72, told IBD. ""It was amazing. All my work paid off my way, and that was the reward.""Texas StartStarting from the bottom and hitting the top was Richardson's forte, but there wasn't much to celebrate while growing up in the grim El Segundo Barrio section of segregated El Paso, Texas, in the 1940s.""There was a black side of town, but I lived in the Mexican side of town,"" said Richardson. ""We were the only black family in the neighborhood.""Richardson coexisted well — the kids in his neighborhood even taught him Spanish, in which he is fluent today — but other influences made for a rough start.Richardson's mother died when he was 3. With his alcoholic father in and out of his life, Grandma Rose stepped in to lend a hand — taking in Nolan and his two sisters.Richardson was a budding athlete in the 1950s, and Rose scored with lessons of another sporting pioneer of the era to keep her grandson on the straight and narrow.""She called it mother wits,"" said Richardson, ""teaching me about attitude, and that a bad attitude results in bad things happening. She was a big Jackie Robinson fan, and she would talk about him breaking down barriers because of his attitude. She made me believe that I could fit into that mold.""Richardson put the beliefs into play to stand out.As a baseball star — and the first black student — at Bowie High School, Richardson was prohibited from staying at the team hotel during an away tournament in Abilene because of his skin color.While he wanted to brood, Rose's principles forced Nolan to play. He wound up dominating as the best player on the field.Richardson loved the diamond, but basketball was his rock.And he learned from a gem.Richardson stayed local to play ball for Texas Western College — now the University of Texas at El Paso — and spent his last two years balling under future Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins.The forward left his collegiate career without any hardware, but armed with knowledge from his coach that would come in handy.""He taught me that hard work and discipline pay off,"" said Richardson. ""He gave me the attitude that you played for one another and that you bring that attitude to practice every day.""While Haskins' daily grind dictated a slow and arduous style of play, his pupil flipped the script and took a new approach to the game as a coach.""I took what was taught to me and expanded it,"" said Richardson. ""I wanted to change the game to give me the advantage.""The benefit showed in the results. Richardson's method involved his offense pushing the ball up the floor while his defense trapped, pressed and generally harassed the opponent all game.A nickname — 40 Minutes of Hell — for this frenetic, full-court attacking style was born during his years at Arkansas, but he rode the system to titles at every level.Richardson leapt obstacles, according to Rus Bradburd, who wrote ""Forty Minutes of Hell: The Extraordinary Life of Nolan Richardson.""""Getting 12 teenagers on the same page was tough, a real challenge,"" the author said. ""Nolan realized that X's and O's would only get you so far, but getting a team to play together and be loyal was the key to leadership.""In his 22 seasons coaching NCAA Division I basketball, Richardson guided those teams to the postseason in 20 of them.On TopThe peak came 20 years ago this past April. Duke — which had already won two titles in the '90s — was the opponent, and Arkansas willed its way to a win in vintage Richardson style.Trailing by 10 points early in the second half, the Razorbacks caused turnovers and nailed key shots to shave the gap and break a tie on a three-pointer by guard Scotty Thurman with 50 seconds left.It wrapped with a 76-72 victory for Arkansas' first national basketball championship.In addition to the 1994 title, Richardson's Razorbacks made the Final Four in 1990 and 1995.When he left Fayetteville after the 2002 season, Richardson did so with a record of 509-207, good for a .711 winning percentage.Toward the end, he stood his ground against what he saw to be a corrupt athletic administration at the University of Arkansas. The protest led to the buying out of his contract, and his lawsuit against the university two years later was dismissed, but he went out standing up for what he believed in.""There's got to be some of us that are going to fight,"" said Richardson, who went on to coach internationally and with the Women's National Basketball Association's Tulsa Shock. ""If you aren't going to stand up and fight, then what is the purpose of living? My grandmother said, 'You're gonna have to take some of those arrow shots to allow others an opportunity moving forward.' She made me realize that doors were going to open because of things I did, and if I failed, those doors would close. I was happy to have that pressure.""Since he left Arkansas, the Razorbacks have reached the NCAA tournament just three times in 12 years.No NolanCollege basketball has been saddled with the loss of a titan, said Bradburd, who teaches English at New Mexico State University: ""If you want to understand Nolan Richardson's impact in college basketball, just look at college football. We're still waiting for a Nolan Richardson there — someone who will win big and stand up for people of color in leadership positions.""Richardson towers for charitable causes. Since his daughter, Yvonne, died of leukemia at age 15, the former coach has helped usher over a million dollars toward organizations in her memory.Richardson also lost a son, Nolan III, in 2012, and a golf tournament is held each year in El Paso to raise money in his children's memories.Richardson's wife, Rosario, has been by Nolan's side through the ups and downs — going back to the days coaching at Western Texas.""Every weekend, she would cook for and feed the 17 kids on the team in the cafeteria — that's how dedicated she was,"" Richardson said of his wife of 39 years. ""She didn't have to do that, but that's the way she's always been. No matter what I did, she was right there beside me.""Now Richardson will stand beside the greats of his sport forever. In August, he entered the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which he called ""a personal award, something my family will enjoy forever. It's the ultimate goal of any coach or athlete — as high as you can go. I've been very fortunate, and there's no bigger award.""Bradburd went a step further with Richardson — who was elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 — when describing the coach's feats.""He is along the same lines as Jackie Robinson, Billie Jean King and Muhammad Ali — an outspoken leader who would tell the truth regardless of the consequences,"" said Bradburd. ""That puts him in the category of a historical figure, not only a sports figure. Nolan Richardson had a huge impact because of his fearlessness.""

1891,UPS,"The Obama administration's tally of 7.3 million paid enrollees in ObamaCare exchange plans as of mid-August increasingly looks like an artificial peak that hasn't been sustained.
"
1892,UPS,"The most telling data point since the Department of Health and Human Services announced exchange membership last month comes from California, where the 1.4 million sign-ups as of mid-April have dwindled to just over 1.1 million paying customers — a drop of 20.3%.
"
1893,UPS,"That decline is on the same scale as in Florida, where insurer rate filings in June showed 763,000 exchange plan members, down 22.5% from the 984,000 sign-ups reported by HHS.
"
1894,UPS,"California and Florida have seen their combined reported membership drop by 506,000.
"
1895,UPS,"If enrollment were still holding at 7.3 million, the combined 5.6 million sign-ups in every other state and D.C. through mid-April could have only dropped by about 200,000, or 3.8%.
"
1896,UPS,"Could California and Florida be such outliers? That doesn't appear to be the case based on the data available from a handful of states and one big insurer.
"
1897,UPS,"HHS Tally Full Of Grace
"
1898,UPS,"There is a possible explanation for why the HHS ObamaCare enrollment tally could have been accurate as of August, but somewhat overstated in September. Due to the law's 90-day grace period, those who last paid premiums for May could still have been deemed covered by the state exchanges as of mid-August.
"
1899,UPS,"So the HHS tally incorporated paying members who signed up after the end of open enrollment, but didn't exclude some members who stopped paying.
"
1900,UPS,"The next-biggest state with useful data is Washington, and its current tally has seen a bigger drop vs. open-enrollment sign-ups than Florida and California.
"
1901,UPS,"Washington is the only state that culled unpaid sign-ups from its reporting to HHS. Still, its current enrollment of 147,000 is off more than 10% from the official tally of 164,000 as of mid-April.
"
1902,UPS,"Yet, as of March 25, when the final enrollment surge was still going strong, Washington Healthplanfinder reported paid and unpaid sign-ups of 192,000. That means the current paid-up enrollment is down more than 23% from the sign-up total that is apples-to-apples with other states' reports from April.
"
1903,UPS,"According to an Arkansas Times report on ObamaCare, that state's paid enrollment (including those in a grace period) is 37,400, down about 14% from April's 43,446.
"
1904,UPS,"Minnesota's largest exchange player, PreferredOne, had 59% of total sign-ups through mid-April, or 28,600. But by July, enrollment fell 15.7% to 24,100. PreferredOne has chosen not to participate in Minnesota's exchange in 2015.
"
1905,UPS,"Aetna Sees Big Decline
"
1906,UPS,"The other significant piece of evidence that seems to suggest that enrollment is lower than HHS has said comes from Aetna (AET). The insurer, which is participating in 16 state exchanges along with its Coventry unit, has said its enrollment has fallen from 720,000 in May to ""a little under 600,000,"" a decline of more than 17%.
"
1907,UPS,"While double-digit-percentage enrollment drops seem to be the norm, some smaller ObamaCare markets have seen less attrition.
"
1908,UPS,"The latest data from Connecticut highlighted by ACASignups.net shows current enrollment of 74,300, down 6.1% from 79,200 as of mid-April.
"
1909,UPS,"In Oregon, where technical glitches led to a longer open-enrollment extension than in most of the U.S., current enrollment of 77,900 is actually above mid-April's level of 68,300. Still, that is off 5.3% since hitting 82,300 in the first week of August.
"
1910,UPS,"If that same 5.3% attrition had been seen nationwide since HHS announced the 7.3 million figure in August, overall enrollment would be 6.9 million.
"
1911,UPS,"In updating its exchange enrollment, California revealed that just 81% of the 1.4 million who signed up in open enrollment eventually paid. Since then, enrollment has dipped slightly, from 1.14 million to 1.12 million.
"
1912,UPS,"Aetna management noted in a Tuesday conference call that they expect declines in its public exchange members through December. (Previously, the insurer said it expects exchange enrollment to end 2014 a little above 500,000.) That may be, in part, because the grace period lets people skip payments at year-end without any lapse in coverage.
"
1913,UPS,"Despite a lack of transparency from the Obama administration about how enrollment has evolved, there are many reasons why a person might drop coverage, some of them positive, such as getting a full-time job with coverage.

1914,UPS,"Washington state said that of about 24,000 no longer enrolled, one-third shifted to Medicaid.The Obama administration's tally of 7.3 million paid enrollees in ObamaCare exchange plans as of mid-August increasingly looks like an artificial peak that hasn't been sustained.The most telling data point since the Department of Health and Human Services announced exchange membership last month comes from California, where the 1.4 million sign-ups as of mid-April have dwindled to just over 1.1 million paying customers — a drop of 20.3%.That decline is on the same scale as in Florida, where insurer rate filings in June showed 763,000 exchange plan members, down 22.5% from the 984,000 sign-ups reported by HHS.California and Florida have seen their combined reported membership drop by 506,000.If enrollment were still holding at 7.3 million, the combined 5.6 million sign-ups in every other state and D.C. through mid-April could have only dropped by about 200,000, or 3.8%.Could California and Florida be such outliers?

1918,UPS,"The Chinese company has done some U.S. M&A, but only with small companies that don't have near the heft of Amazon.com (AMZN) and other bigger e-tailers.
"
1919,UPS,"The most direct way Alibaba can build its U.S. presence, analysts say, is through a big acquisition or two. And some analysts suggest eBay (EBAY), which recently disclosed that it will split into separate e-commerce and payments (PayPal) companies, is a possible target.
"
1920,UPS,"While Alibaba has loads of cash from its record $25 billion U.S. IPO in September, a big acquisition could irk U.S. regulators and politicians at a time of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.
"
1921,UPS,"In the meantime, Alibaba has room to grow at home. Alibaba boasts 500 million registered users in China, a huge figure that nevertheless is still far less than half the country's population. But it faces mounting competition in China from rivals such as Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU), and Alibaba founder Jack Ma has his sights set on making Alibaba an international brand.

"
1924,UPS,"""This is only a beginning,"" Masayoshi Son, CEO of Japan's SoftBank, which owns a 34% stake in Alibaba, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television last month. ""Alibaba continues to grow inside China, but also globally. This IPO in New York makes a good entry to the global expansion.""
"
1925,UPS,"This week, Ma said at a conference that he's open to a partner with Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay mobile payments service.
"
1926,UPS,"Alibaba rules the world's fastest-growing and largest e-commerce market, but the company and its mercurial founder, Ma, must gain overseas to keep growing and satisfy investors. The long-term challenge Alibaba faces is similar to ones faced by U.S. counterparts such as Amazon, eBay and Priceline (PCLN), which turned to international markets to maintain high growth rates as U.S. markets matured.
"
1927,UPS,"But JG Capital analyst Henry Guo doesn't see international markets, including the U.S., becoming a driver of Alibaba's growth for three to five years. ""(Alibaba's) focus now is on China's domestic market,"" Guo said.

1931,UPS,"Two-Thirds Unfamiliar
"
1932,UPS,"One of Alibaba's biggest hurdles here is its little-known brand. A recent survey by online retail researcher Bizrate Insights found that 63% of online buyers, skewing toward younger consumers and women, aren't familiar with Alibaba's brand or website. Of the 37% that had heard of Alibaba, only 30% of them (11% overall) said they had browsed the site.
"
1933,UPS,"""Alibaba has to raise its brand awareness,"" Bizrate Insights Vice President Hayley Silver told IBD.
"
1934,UPS,"With no U.S.-based e-commerce operation, Silver says consumers have to order items from Alibaba's English-language Chinese website. She says shipping from China is slow and she questions how well Chinese customer service reps would handle complaints. Also, Alibaba's site features made-in-China items, a turn-off for shoppers here who prefer American-made goods.
"
1935,UPS,"In one of its biggest moves in the U.S., Alibaba has taken a 39% stake in San Mateo, Calif.-based ShopRunner, a smaller, members-only rival of Amazon. Headed by former Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Scott Thompson, ShopRunner offers free shipping for online orders in a program that resembles Amazon Prime.
"
1936,UPS,"ShopRunner is preparing a joint service with Alibaba that provides U.S. brands with a direct way to sell to China's consumers. When it's up and running, the 300 million-plus Chinese users of Alibaba's AliPay payments service will be able to order products directly from the U.S. websites of ShopRunner partners like Neiman Marcus (NMG) and Nine West, and have the goods delivered from the U.S. to China in 10 days.
"
1937,UPS,"The joint service reportedly will launch by year-end. A ShopRunner spokesperson declined to comment. But when it does launch, the China-centric Alibaba/ShopRunner partnership likely will do little to churn up business for Alibaba with U.S. shoppers.
"
1938,UPS,"Alibaba's only direct foray into U.S. e-commerce so far has more of a PR angle than scale. In June, it launched 11 Main, a small online retail website that touts distinctly U.S. goods and crafts from U.S. vendors.
"
1939,UPS,"With the motivation and the money, some observes expect Alibaba will make a big acquisition in the U.S. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said in an Oct. 1 report that eBay's Marketplaces businesses makes it a tempting target for Alibaba. Marketplaces is second only to Amazon in e-commerce sales.
"
1940,UPS,"But Carnegie Towers' Tang says Alibaba could get U.S. traction by acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, similar to what eBay does now and something it could do without acquiring eBay.
"
1941,UPS,"Tang says Alibaba could rely on the in-house inventories of U.S. brands and makers who sell on its site. He says it could rely on the existing facilities of these sellers and shippers like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) without building a fulfillment network like Amazon.
"
1942,UPS,"B2B Connection

1944,UPS,"Offering B2B transactions for U.S. companies is another hot area for Alibaba, according to Tang. He says Alibaba's connections with suppliers in China and other foreign markets could be useful for U.S. clients.
"
1945,UPS,"Still, a big U.S. acquisition wouldn't be a surprise.
"
1946,UPS,"""It's possible,"" said JG Capital's Guo, though he says eBay might be a bit large for Alibaba to digest.

But such a high-profile purchase might face scrutiny in Congress and possibly by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. CFIUS is an inter-agency government body that reviews transactions that could give control of U.S. companies to foreigners.

1981,UPS,"It's hard to think of anything more low-tech than a self-storage facility. Once you figure out how to open a door and work a lock, you've pretty much mastered it.Long before you've done that, however, chances are someone who works behind the scenes has spent years using high-tech tools to ensure the facility has the best chance of capturing your business.A tech-savvy self-storage company will make sure its facilities are among the first three or four names that pop up in an Internet search — a process that involves things like analyzing search algorithms to determine the most productive keywords to use on the website.In the case of Extra Space Storage (EXR), a real estate investment trust, it also means hiring a team of marketing and search engine optimization — or SEO — specialists.Gang of FourExtra Space owns and/or operates more than 1,000 self-storage properties in 35 states as well as in Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Its properties comprise around 715,000 units and 79 million square feet of rentable storage space.It is one of four major players in the self-storage industry, along with fellow publicly traded REITs Public Storage (PSA), CubeSmart (CUBE) and Sovran Self Storage (SSS).Outside of U-Haul parent Amerco (UHAL), which provides self-storage rentals as well as truck and van rentals, the rest of the market is dominated by the many smaller mom-and-pop operations.One reason the bigger players have put so much distance between themselves and the rest of the field is that they've done a better job at developing Internet marketing strategies, says Jeff Norman, Extra Space's senior director of investor relations.Just about everyone who needs a self-storage facility looks online to find one. Since a lot of companies are competing for business, search results often mean the difference between success and failure.""It's a very fragmented industry, and if you are not one of the top three or four terms that pop up after a search, no one is ever going to find you,"" Norman told IBD during a phone interview. ""If someone goes to Google (GOOGL) and types in 'self-storage Long Island' or 'self-storage Chicago,' you will consistently see the larger REITs come at the top of those searches.""That's mainly because the larger REITs have the resources and expertise to develop effective Internet search and marketing strategies, while many smaller ones don't.This has ""created a moat"" between the larger operators and the smaller ones, Norman says, and goes a long way in explaining why Extra Space trots out double-digit-percentage revenue and profit growth with astonishing regularity.""We have a lot of data points to track and analyze,"" Norman said. ""If we see that something works well in one market, we will roll it out in other markets. We are constantly trying to keep up with the evolving algorithms that search engines use to make sure we are getting a good return.""That has been a key internal driver of Extra Space's financial growth, he says.A key external driver is the self-storage industry itself, which has seen a shortage of supply nationwide since the early days of the financial crisis and recession in 2009.According to industry estimates, there are about 50,000 storage facilities in the U.S., Norman says. With the nation's population growing at around 1% a year, he reckons you could add 1% a year to the storage facility supply and ""still not upset the equilibrium.""Over the past five years, however, the amount of new supply has been ""virtually zero,"" Norman says. That's mainly due to a lack of financing for local developers, who handle the vast majority of self-storage construction projects.This lack of supply ratchets up demand for Extra Space and other self-storage operators.Go Where The People AreVery little alters that demand outside of the number of people living in a given area, Norman says. The ups and downs of the housing market don't seem to have a big impact, he says, and neither do the ups and downs of the economy.Since demand is primarily driven by population growth, Extra Space looks to buy properties in cities with dense and growing populations.""We try to focus on the top 50 MSAs (metropolitan statistical areas),"" Norman said. ""Our main motivation is places with high population density — not just because there is more demand, but also because there are stronger barriers to entry because there is less space to build new storage properties.""The strength of the self-storage market is reflected in Extra Space's financial results. The company has delivered 11 straight quarters of 21%-or-better revenue and funds from operations (FFO) growth.Solid ResultsDuring its second quarter, overall revenue rose 27% from the prior year to $160.2 million. Same-store revenue growth was 7.9%, flat with the prior quarter and up from 7.4% the previous year, according to a report from Citigroup analyst Michael Bilerman. FFO gained 26% to 63 cents a share.Extra Space paid a Q2 common stock dividend of 47 cents a share, up 17.5% from the prior quarter.""Occupancy continued to move higher year-over-year, up 160 basis points, and realized rent growth inched up to 5.2%,"" Bilerman noted. ""Acquisitions continue to ramp but at a slower pace.""Extra Space uses acquisitions to expand its business in existing markets and move into new ones.One of its biggest deals came in January, when it spent around $200 million to buy a self-storage portfolio of 17 assets located in Virginia.""We believe there are plenty of growth opportunities because there are a lot of properties out there to acquire,"" Norman said. ""The stereotypical storage owner is an entrepreneur reaching a point where he wants to capitalize on his investment and move on to another phase of his life, so you see opportunities pop up regularly.""Extra Space is due to report Q3 results after the stock market close on Oct. 29. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect FFO of 65 cents a share, up 41% from a year earlier. Full-year FFO is seen rising 27% to $2.49.The company's stock price touched a record high of 56.05 on Oct. 17 and still trades near there.

1991,UPS,"Public Health: Ebola is the media's top focus, but the White House seems to hardly notice at all. The president has canceled a fundraiser as a sign of good intentions, but he still won't order a travel ban. It's late, but not too late.President Obama could stop flights to and from the West African countries hit hard by the disease using just a phone. He might not even need a pen.Already more than 20,000 have Ebola, a disease that now has a 70% death rate, and by December as many as 10,000 new victims could be infected each week. Officials say that by January, as many as 1.4 million people worldwide could have the deadly virus.Yet Obama hasn't even taken the most basic action, though House Speaker John Boehner has suggested the president should ""absolutely consider"" a travel ban and even former Obama press secretary, Jay Carney, has gone on record as saying the right White House response ""may involve flight restrictions.""We said earlier this month that halting flights is the right strategy. And we're aware that some in the private sector have set their own travel restrictions.Near the end of August, more than one-third of the scheduled private flights to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had been canceled.Meanwhile, the U.S. government won't do what it should to protect Americans from the outbreak.Part of the problem is the Centers for Disease Control has acted as if travel restrictions to and from the most affected countries are somehow a moral failure that would actually increase the spread of Ebola.Outside the insulated walls of Washington and politics, Obama's unwillingness to institute a travel ban makes no sense to layman and expert alike.Kipp Branch, director of the medicines program at MAP International, a nonprofit health organization, has told the media that ""banning air travel until the world gets control of this outbreak"" has ""got to be policy or the virus will spread around the world.""Branch, whose nonprofit group has sent $12 million worth of protective suits and medical supplies to West Africa, sensibly says ""you have to isolate"" Ebola.And he points out what should be obvious to the White House: ""You can't isolate it (Ebola) with people coming in and out.""At a congressional hearing Thursday, CDC Director Thomas Frieden told lawmakers he was ""open to ideas"" to ""keep Americans as safe as possible.""Well, here's one: Shut down air travel between the U.S. and the contagious countries until they get a strong handle on the flare-ups within their own borders.That doesn't mean that we will stop fighting the outbreak and leave West Africa on its own. But West Africa is where the battle has to be. The more the disease slips out of the region, the tougher the fight will be. As of now, only 17 have been treated for Ebola outside of the region. The goal should be to keep it at that number.One would think the government's credentialed experts and high-status officials would understand that. Really, it's not a difficult concept to grasp.

1996,UPS,"the feds are doing enough.No one has a clue how the nurse became infected despite all the protective gear and procedures. Was there a splash of vomit? Is the virus perhaps mutating already to bypass existing precautions? Sherlock Frieden's line Monday was, ""Stopping Ebola is hard.""He admitted the CDC must rethink and double-check all its existing procedures. Design new ones. More infected Americans may show up from the same safety gap(s).It was inevitable 21 days from a midterm election that Ebola would also infect the nation's politics. The usual Washington suspects call for flight bans, as if no one can change planes in Europe. They call for an Ebola czar, as if another padded federal department would fix things right up.It's all just futile flopping for an anxious population detecting the spread of an even more virulent virus: Fear.Here's the real problem: There is no national leadership. We have a president. But he is no leader. He had no ISIS strategy until polls told him to get one. No problem, no screw-up, no scandal is ever his fault. But no one gets fired. Not Eric Holder. Not Kathleen Sebelius.He's spent most of his 2,093 days in office degrading faith in American institutions -- Congress, the Supreme Court, anyone who opposes him. Having promised to unify, he's divided instead. He's mislead and lied so often that millions of countrymen -- not to mention foreign leaders -- tune him out. Or turn cynical.He's built a trust deficit as big as his early budget deficits.Here's what Obama's been up to recently: As our brave military flew token air sorties against ISIS hordes and Ebola percolated inside no-one-knows-how-many other Americans, Obama spent most of last week out West at political fundraisers, wowing Gwyneth Paltrow and sucking in more money for the Democrat Party.He returned to D.C. Saturday late. Sunday Obama had a phone call with HHS Secy. Sylvia Burwell for a brief briefing on the Ebola situation. Photographers were herded to Oval Office windows to capture the moment.As you can see from his desk above, Obama was buried in work. And dressed for what he really had in mind: His 200th round of golf. It was a one-man photo-op.Monday Obama met with the same senior advisers who've given us healthcare.gov, no ISIS strategy and a failed Iraq withdrawal and ""urged"" them to draw new lessons from the unfolding medical crisis.""Urged"" them?

1999,UPS,"Here's how you can tell Barack Obama's 'war' on ISIS is merely a political salve to get him through the Nov. 4 midterm elections:The military campaign ""to degrade and destroy"" ISIS has no stirring name. No Operation Enduring Freedom label. No all-time classic Desert Storm.It might seem like a small PR matter, which it also is. But operational names go in military records and history books, on military ribbons and, most importantly, on specific congressional budget requests.Right now, there is no specific budget request for Obama's promised long-term effort to ""degrade and destroy"" ISIS. A tell-tale sign. Given Obama's record on veracity, this would seem to indicate ""long-term"" in his mind means at least through Nov. 5.Funds for this campaign are being borrowed from other Pentagon accounts. Can a president have a serious war with no budget and no name? Or will would-be coalition partners take the war's anonymity as confirmation of their existing suspicions about Obama's resolve for anything other than golf and fundraising?Perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that a president who publicly admitted he had no strategy to address the ISIS terrorist threat a year after being warned about it still has no name for the war he later half-heartedly announced. Even Obama's assault on Ebola in West Africa has a name already -- Operation United Assistance.Most military operations in recent decades have been given code names: Operation Overlord for the 1944 Normandy invasion. Operation Barbarossa for Nazi Germany's 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.Ubiquitous modern media prompted military planners to add a salesman-like PR element, starting with the 1989 ouster of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega -- Operation Just Cause.But more than two months into Obama's occasional Shock-and-Yawn bombing campaign against ISIS' fleet of machine-gun pickup trucks, plus U.S. Humvees and tanks abandoned by fleeing Iraqi government troops, Obama's latest war remains strangely anonymous.It's almost as if he doesn't want to own or recognize it. You know, he didn't build that.Julian Barnes of the Wall Street Journal pursued the name issue with military commanders recently. It seems they suggested Operation Inherent Resolve. But higher-ups nixed that as insufficiently Middle Eastern, whatever that means.Update: After weeks of Operation Indecision, Obama administration circled back and settled on Inherent Resolve.Also, it could be taken as a sarcastic comment given Obama's resolve-free bailout from his own red-line chemical weapons threat to Syria.Since Obama has vowed to deploy absolutely positively no U.S. combat troops in the ISIS fight, he's relying on bombing here-and-there to give the appearance of fighting ISIS. Thus, our favorite name would be Operation Silent Thunder.Of course, we're always ready to help this Democrat out. So, we've thoughtfully compiled a list of a few other Operation names for this bombing campaign and for Obama's consideration during his three-day West Coast political fundraising swing this week:Operation Enduring VacillationOperation Three-IronOperation Existing AuthorityOperation Nobel War PrizeOperation Resolute HesitancyOperation Choom BoomOperation You've Got MailOperation Hello GoodbyeOperation Relentless IndecisionOperation Sharia StopOperation Reluctant CommanderOperation Compassionate Drone StrikeOperation Feckless ConfidenceOperation Yes We Can (or Operacion Si Se Puede for Univision)Operation Here Catch ThisOperation Hello VirginsOperation Here Comes Harms WayOperation Kind KrusaderLeave your own operational suggestions for the commander-in-chief in the Comments below.

2010,UPS,"The enterprise group is the more likely takeover candidate, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities. ""Enterprise is where the M&A activity is going to occur, vs. the PCs and printing segments,"" he told IBD.
"
2011,UPS,"Others agree.
"
2012,UPS,"""The enterprise segment would likely be the first to go,"" said Bill Kreher, an analyst for Edward Jones. ""I think EMC is a takeover candidate, given the rumors of HP and EMC's discussions earlier this year.""
"
2013,UPS,"HP's combination hardware-software products that compete with rivals such Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) offer upside for EMC, says Kreher.

2029,UPS,"That could help a possible sale of that business, says analyst Kreher. ""The PC environment has improved markedly in the last 12 months,"" he said.Hewlett-Packard going splitsville could lead to a marriage down the road to EMC or some other suitors.The computer giant early Monday said it would split into two separate companies, one focused on PCs and printers and the other on products and services for companies and other enterprises.While each company individually would still be huge, at more than $50 billion in annual sales, cleaving HP (HPQ) into two halves clearly could help facilitate a sale, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.HP reportedly had merger talks with storage systems leader EMC (EMC) earlier this year.EMC wouldn't want the PC or printer business, says White, ""so now they have the flexibility"" to acquire the enterprise business.Enterprise M&A More LikelyThe enterprise group is the more likely takeover candidate, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities.

2033,UPS,"The year 1982 marked a turning point for S. Truett Cathy — and in the trajectory of the restaurant chain he founded, Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A had experienced nearly uninterrupted growth since its debut 15 years earlier.About 100 of Cathy's chicken sandwich restaurants dotted the country, mostly in the South.But that year, Chick-fil-A experienced its first (and only) decline in same-store sales.Fewer malls — where all of Cathy's restaurants were located then — were being built.And McDonald's and Wendy's were about to enter the quick-serve chicken market by offering chicken sandwiches and nuggets, which helped poultry prices soar.""All of that focus on chicken would be good for us in the long run,"" Cathy explained in ""Eat Mor Chikin, Inspire More People,"" his 2002 memoir, ""but the immediate effect was a double punch that caused me many sleepless nights.""Prudent InvestingCautious by nature, Cathy was also anxious about a corporate plan to double the number of Chick-fil-A's in two years and spend $10 million on a new corporate headquarters in Atlanta.Having grown up watching his mother struggle to run a boarding house in their home, Cathy hated the idea of carrying debt.So Cathy (1921-2014) invited his small executive committee on a two-day retreat.Instead of thinking up ways to cut costs, the execs reflected on why they were in the restaurant business to begin with.This discussion of first principles prompted Cathy and his team to articulate the following corporate mission statement:""To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.""That simple act worked. ""Wonderful things began to happen,"" Cathy told Philanthropy magazine. ""I felt confident in the future.""The company grew by 29% in the next year and would go on to become one of the nation's largest family-owned companies. From then on, Cathy also began to focus more of his resources on charity, launching several endeavors that improved thousands of lives.Samuel Truett Cathy was born in Eatonton, Ga., and was an unlikely candidate to become a restaurant mogul. Growing up, he was a slow reader and learner.""I didn't have much confidence in my ability,"" he wrote in ""How Did You Do It, Truett?"" another autobiography. He was a C student and never attended college.Cathy took on jobs — newspaper delivery boy, Coke (KO) stand operator — that instilled in him the importance of keeping the customer satisfied: ""The key to succeeding with a paper route — and the restaurant business, I would later learn — is to take care of the customer.""After high school and a stint in the Army, Cathy and his brother Ben borrowed $10,000 to open a restaurant in the Atlanta suburb of Hapeville in 1946.They called the restaurant Dwarf Grill because of its small size, later renaming it Dwarf House.Tragedy struck in 1949 when two of Cathy's brothers, including Ben, died when a plane they were flying in crashed. The year before, Truett had married Jeanette McNeil, with whom he had three children: Dan, Don (""Bubba"") and Trudy.Jeanette was instrumental in getting Cathy to recommit to his Southern Baptist faith. ""Her level of commitment showed me a new way to live,"" he wrote.Cathy built his business one satisfied customer at a time. But when he built a second restaurant, it promptly burned down.Cathy was philosophical about the loss. ""When I had two restaurants, I had one too many,"" he later reflected. ""So the Lord burned one down and gave me the chance to start Chick-fil-A.""With only one restaurant to manage, Cathy had more time to develop what would become his signature chicken sandwich.He took his time. ""I worked for years, adding this, taking away that,"" he wrote. ""I was up to more than 20 seasonings and breading ingredients — twice as many as Col. Sanders had in his secret recipe.""Southern StartCathy tested all of his variations on customers, gauging their reactions. It wasn't long before Cathy had trademarked the name Chick-fil-A and begun selling his chicken sandwiches to restaurants across the South. And in 1967, Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A restaurant, in an Atlanta mall.Chick-fil-A was unique in two ways. It was the first fast-food restaurant to serve a skinless, boneless-breast chicken sandwich, and the first to operate in shopping malls. It was an immediate success.Over the succeeding decades, Chick-fil-A grew to more than 1,800 locations scattered across 40 states. Chick-fil-A opened its first freestanding restaurant in 1986 and its first drive-thru-only location in 1993.At the time of his death at age 93, Cathy's net worth was $1.9 billion, according to Bloomberg.The year before, the company took in more than $5 billion, making it the country's largest fast-food chicken restaurant by sales.In 2010, Chick-fil-A became the industry leader in average sales in its restaurants: $2.7 million per.Chick-fil-A's massive growth was helped by its ""Eat Mor Chikin"" ad campaign. It featured hapless dairy cows trying to persuade the public to eat chicken sandwiches instead of hamburgers by, in one example, painting ""Eat mor chikin"" on a billboard. The amusing campaign has remained a core part of Chick-fil-A's ads for two decades, winning numerous industry awards.Cathy succeeded by following four key principles: 1. The main reason companies fail is their desire to grow too fast too soon. Cathy exercised caution and patience. He spent 21 years owning just one restaurant, learning the trade and saving enough money to try new ventures. He never went into debt and never took his company public, which made him accountable only to God, himself and his customers. 2. As restaurant consultant and marketing expert Aaron Allen told IBD, Chick-fil-A ""focuses on speed, accuracy, cleanliness. They're not showy. As other companies start to drift, it has remained focused on fundamentals.""Chick-fil-A offers a basic chicken sandwich and a small menu that rarely changes. By doing so, it can focus on quality. Result: In 2014, Consumer Reports ranked Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwich No. 1. 3. The company's faith-based corporate culture is most clearly seen in its policy of closing on Sundays. Cathy said the policy is the result of his desire that employees save at least one day a week for God and family. 4. The ""loyalty effect"" is something Cathy instilled in employees and customers.Denise Lee Yohn, author of the book ""What Great Brands Do,"" says that Chick-fil-A has engendered a deep devotion from customers by serving a high-quality product and through top customer service. Chick-fil-A ""really does go the extra mile to serve its customers,"" she said. That includes everything from community-building promotions to college scholarships for staffers. Many call Chick-fil-A's employees among the industry's kindest. They often respond to customer requests with a hearty ""my pleasure.""Tasteful Loyalty""In the past 60 years, no matter the ups and downs, I have learned that the number one thing to do is to please the customer and they will come back,"" Cathy once said.As he became wealthy, Cathy donated more of his time and money to charities and started one of his own, called the WinShape Foundation, which provides scholarships and foster homes to needy children. Cathy himself was a foster parent for more than 30 years. He liked to say that some 150 children called him Grandpa.""People ask me why I invest so much in the foster homes,"" he said. ""The one thing I take more joy in than anything else in the world is seeing young people develop. They grow and make good decisions. They want to be winners despite the odds against them.""That's an aspiration that Cathy helped thousands of people, including himself, realize.

2100,UPS,"When employees suffer, so do companies. How leaders find ways to elevate them:• Face it. A Journal of the American Medical Association study found that depressed workers cost employers $44 billion a year due to health-related productivity losses. One contributing factor? Presenteeism, or being at work but barely working.""The loss in productivity caused by depression is extremely difficult to track because it manifests via poor performance,"" says Graeme Cowan, author of ""Back from the Brink: True Stories and Practical Help for Overcoming Depression and Bipolar Disorder.""• Bring it forward. Cowan knows the lowest lows. Once a senior executive with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and consulting firm A.T. Kearney, he grappled with depression for 20 years and attempted suicide four times. While writing of his experience, he researched mental health issues. One of his findings: 86% of those struggling with depression would rather suffer in silence.""That's very bad news for employers, who may have a big portion of their workforce struggling along at reduced capacity,"" he told IBD.• Pick up signals.  Managers should watch for these harbingers of a problem: a dip in performance, calling in sick often, missing deadlines or meetings, and looking tired or overwhelmed.• Ask. To help someone, Cowan recommends a four-step process. ""Simply ask: Are you OK? Next, listen without judgment. Then encourage action. And finally, follow up,"" he said.• Extend a lifeline. Employers can encourage employees to get help by putting resources in front of them.A mental health policy, a wellness program and educational materials get the ball rolling.""A big regret for depressed individuals is that they didn't get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan earlier,"" said Cowan.• Get them moving.  Companies that encourage exercise, which elevates workers' outlooks, reap rewards. ""Employees with a positive mood are 31% more productive, sell 37% more and are 300% more creative,"" Cowan said.• Confront frustration.  Sometimes it's not depression but a feeling of disengagement that gnaws at professionals. That was the case for Bob Epperly, author of ""Growing Up After 50.""The former Exxon (XOM) executive took an all-too-common corporate hit after 29 years with the company. The C-suite cut his department in half and outplaced Epperly.His response? ""I stuffed my feelings and moved ahead,"" he said.• Explore. Over the next years, while working for startups, Epperly stopped stuffing his feelings and pursued inner goals. He delved into yoga, improved his diet and exercise habits, and attended seminars on personal growth.• Enhance. Where to start?Epperly suggested beginning an activity such as meditation, seeking out a teacher or therapist, and connecting with a group of like-minded individuals ""with whom to share the ups and downs of life.""

2127,UPS,"The younger crowd may be skittish about moving into the housing market due to sparse financial resources and lack of credit.But it's a different story for Americans age 55 and over. Those who can are jumping into homebuying — selling their existing houses to move into new ones aimed at their age group. Many are at or near retirement, while others are seeking a change in lifestyle — and at this age they can have financial flexibility.Some have reaped hefty gains from the stock market, adding to a nest egg saved over the years. Rising home values in the housing recovery have also given more of them the ability to finally sell, at an appreciated price or at least one that can cover the mortgage.Top homebuilders such as PulteGroup (PHM), Lennar (LEN) and Toll Bros. (TOL) report brisk sales for their active-adult homes and homes that appeal to the 55-plus crowd.Take PulteGroup, which builds the Del Webb brand of active adult communities for adults 55 and over.""Consistent with the overall housing market, we have seen sustained improvement in demand for our active adult homes for the past two-plus years,"" PulteGroup spokesman James Zeumer told IBD via email.Signing Up SalesThe company's active-adult sales lifted from roughly 4,100 homes in 2011 to about 5,300 in 2013. Zeumer says the recovery in active-adult home demand continued into 2014. Sign-ups in the first quarter were up 7% and in the second quarter they rose 11% over a year earlier.One gauge of demand in the single-family 55-plus housing market is the National Association of Home Builders 55+ Housing Market Index. In the second quarter the index increased three points from a year earlier to a level of 56. That's the highest second-quarter reading since the inception of the index in 2008 and the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year improvements.The prognosis for homebuying across all age groups looks improved this summer with Thursday's release of July data on contracts signed to buy existing homes, and that could further bolster the 55-plus group's prospects to sell their old homes.The pending home sales index rose 3.3% from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, though down 2.1% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported. It's at the highest level since last August and at 105.9 is above the level of 100 considered an average activity level.""One of the factors contributing to the positive signs in the 55+ housing market is the slow but steady increase in existing-home sales in the last three months,"" said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe in a press release. ""The 55+ market is strongly driven by consumers being able to sell their existing homes at a favorable price in order to buy or rent in a 55+ community.""Domino Effect AppliesAdds NAHB Director of Economic Services Stephen Melman: ""The best thing that could happen for new construction is that the existing-home market improves. Every prospective buyer, like the age 55-plus buyer, has to sell their existing home before they buy a new one. The real key (to the index rise) was the existing-home market.""Total existing-home sales lifted 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million in July, according to the NAR. Sales notched their highest pace of 2014 and have risen four straight months. But they remain 4.3% below the 5.38 million-unit level last July, the peak of 2013. ""Existing-home sales are continuing to move up,"" said Melman. ""But the one caveat is the first-time homebuyer's share (of those sales) was less than 29%. Typically that would be 40%. So existing-home sales are increasing, but the first-time buyer isn't in there full tilt. So it may be the 55-plus (group) buying homes that meet their demand.""Sales of new single-family homes fell 2.4% monthly in July, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales, at 412,000, marked the lowest level since March, although it was a 12.3% rise from last July.Demand for new homes by the 55-plus age group is on the rise.Toll Bros. Active Living is the luxury homebuilders' active-adult division, with single-family homes, condos and town houses. As of April 2014, it accounted for 8% of the company's revenue, says Toll Bros. Group President Chris Gaffney. He says all of Toll Bros.' homebuyers, including the 55 and over active adult group, have been motivated to buy in the past year or so.""During this recent downturn, so many people were out of the buying market,"" Gaffney told IBD. ""Now, they've seen their portfolios grow again, and they're extremely interested in making a move because interest rates are still fabulous.""Gaffney says there's ""plenty of pent-up demand"" on part of the active adult buyers following a pullback during the recession, and the ""affordability index is quite high when you look at history.""These older buyers, he adds, have gotten ""tired of putting their lives"" on hold in the wake of the recession. "" Generally these folks are extremely savvy and successful, they have tremendous FICO (credit) scores, they've built up their portfolios over the years and understand exactly what they want with their lifestyle and what they're looking to do as they move forward in life. .""Melman said by email: ""The stronger 55+ market could be put in context of the overall strength of the trade-up market/higher-income buyers, except this group is focused not on larger homes but new homes better designed for their needs. As existing sales slowly increase, more people who put plans on hold can now sell their existing home to finance what they really want for the next ten or twenty years: quality design, low maintenance, accommodations for family.""Homes Built To FitMajor homebuilders are luring this group with a raft of amenities.Besides its active adult communities, Lennar offers an option for multigenerational families living under one roof. The ""Next Gen"" home within a home features a suite with a separate private entrance, bedroom, bathroom, laundry, eat-in kitchenette and living room.Jeff Roos, Western regional president for Lennar, says many buyers want to let their children live in the suite. Since it started making these homes available at the end of 2011, Lennar has sold over 2,000. It has 120 Next Gen communities and more than 50 floor-plan options.""The Next Gen is growing every day as we expand across the country,"" Roos told IBD. ""This is the first time a homebuilder came out with a great solution for a multigenerational home. It's the first time (the different generations) can live together, but independently. We're seeing a big movement toward it. Our reception to the product has far exceeded our expectations.""Zeumer calls Del Webb homes ""perfect for empty-nesters who may be looking to downsize, but not necessarily downgrade the features and finishings of their next home.""Options can include big garages, flex spaces, wet bars, hearth rooms, raised dishwashers and sunrooms.

2142,UPS,"Just like last year's, the 2015 open-enrollment period for ObamaCare has been a success — if you ignore young adults and people who don't get subsidies.
"
2143,UPS,"The Congressional Budget Office expected 3 million people ineligible for subsidies to enroll in the exchanges this year, but fewer than 1.68 million signed up for coverage, and actual enrollment may drop once nonpayers are axed from the total.
"
2144,UPS,"Instead of the unsubsidized share of exchange members rising from 15% in 2014 to 25% this year, as CBO expected, the share paying full freight for ObamaCare slipped to 14%.
"
2145,UPS,"Just like last year, 28% of signups were age 18 to 34, far below their estimated 40% share of the potential exchange population.
"
2146,UPS,"If participation among young adults had matched their share of the population among the expected 12 million exchange members, then 4.8 million young adults would have enrolled — but just 3.25 million selected plans.
"
2147,UPS,"Those two categories, the young and unsubsidized, likely overlap to a significant extent. The Kaiser Family Foundation health subsidy calculator shows that a 30-year-old earning $33,000, about 285% of the poverty level, is ineligible for subsidies.
"
2148,UPS,"The huge shortfall among the young and unsubsidized may have obscured the fact that among everyone else — especially 55 and over — ObamaCare enrollment has gone pretty much as expected, if not better.
"
2149,UPS,"The sign-up total through Feb. 21 was 11.7 million, and perhaps one million of those won't pay based on last year's experience, leaving somewhere in the ballpark of 10.7 million paid enrollees.
"
2150,UPS,"Adults age 55 and up account for just 17% of the potential exchange pool, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That proportion would have meant just over 2 million of the 12 million enrollment goal, but just over 3 million signed up, or 26% of the total.
"
2151,UPS,"Just like last year, 54% of exchange sign-ups were women.
"
2152,UPS,"The lack of improvement for ObamaCare in any of these metrics in the second year appears to be a somewhat negative sign for the future of the exchanges. Women, older adults and lower-income (i.e. subsidized) enrollees all represent somewhat costlier groups than those which are under-represented: men, young adults and the middle class.
"
2153,UPS,"There was an expectation built into the law that a higher-cost group would sign up first, but things would balance out over the first few years. The 2015 signup data suggest slow progress toward achieving a balance and that's probably not great news for 2016 premiums.
"
2154,UPS,"ObamaCare included two programs, reinsurance and risk corridors, to limit the financial risk faced by insurers in the first three years, encouraging them to price premiums low. Yet reinsurance will offer very modest support in 2016 — covering 50% of a patient's bills between $90,000 and $250,000, after reimbursing costs starting at $45,000 in 2015 — and insurers face great uncertainty about whether risk-corridor funds will be available to offset at least 50% of their losses.
"
2155,UPS,"With federal supports unwinding, insurers will begin to set premiums based on the expected cost of their plan members, and the demographics of the exchange population may be improving too slowly to avoid big rate hikes.
"
2156,UPS,"Even before the new HHS data, CBO said this week that it expects premium hikes will average 8.5% per year over the next three years, based on the phase-out of reinsurance and the push-back (by either customers, providers or regulators) against narrow networks and low payments to providers.
"
2157,UPS,"Concern about next year's rates may have been on the mind of the Obama administration when it put in place a special enrollment period through April for people who are hit with an individual mandate tax penalty for lacking coverage in 2014.
"
2158,UPS,"Whether next year's penalty, equal to the greater of $325 per person or 2% of taxable income, will get many more people to sign up over the next eight weeks remains to be seen.

2216,UPS,"Shares of Arctic Cat (ACAT) sank on Wednesday after the snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle manufacturer slashed its full-year outlook, citing high ATV inventory and a difficult international environment, even though the company's third-quarter earnings per share topped expectations.The company now expects 2015 sales of $705 million-$715 million, down from an earlier forecast of $745 million-$755 million and far short of analyst expectations of $748 million. Arctic Cat forecast 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $1.24-$1.32, cut from the company's prior view of $1.55 to $1.65 and not at all close to analyst expectations for 1.97.Arctic Cat said it would take a $7 million charge this year to help reduce dealers' older inventory more quickly. The company also said international sales would fall this year due to ""macroeconomic headwinds"" and adverse foreign exchange in Canada, where Arctic Cat gets a third of its yearly sales.""Fiscal 2015 is a challenging year of transition where we are resetting our strategic priorities to deliver improved long-term performance,"" said CEO Christopher Metz, who assumed the post last month to turn the underperforming company around after the departure of Claude Jordan. ""At this time, we are lowering our fiscal 2015 full-year outlook for sales and earnings as we work through existing challenges. As we stated in the 2015 second quarter, one of our biggest challenges is rightsizing our core North America ATV dealer inventory levels. Bold actions are necessary to return to growth.""Shares fell 2.5% to 28.97 in the stock market today after hitting a three-year low of 26 early. The stock has tumbled over the past year after a series of disappointing earnings reports.Arctic Cat's EPS for the third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, slid 23% from a year earlier to 68 cents. But that soundly beat analyst estimates for 48 cents.Revenue fell 14% to $193.74 million, missing views for $198 million. Snowmobile sales fell 30% from a year ago to $81.5 million. That decline was largely the result of the timing of snowmobile shipments to an original equipment manufacturing partner. Those shipments were moved to fiscal Q1 and Q2, Arctic Cat says.Sales of ATV and side-by-side vehicles, however, rose 7% to $78.2 million. Sales gains in the company's Wildcat off-road vehicle did much of the heavy lifting, as core ATV sales fell, the company said.Sales of parts, garments and accessories fell 4%, weighed by sales snow-related parts, which suffered due to less snow, the company says.The results come a day after Polaris (PII), Arctic Cat's much bigger rival, said in its Q4 report that snowmobile sales rose 2% to $138.1 million due to an earlier winter in North America. Polaris, which also manufactures off-road vehicles and motorcycles, reported estimate-topping Q4 results but guided 2015 cautiously. Off-road-vehicle sales jumped 19%.Polaris shares fell 1.4% Wednesday afternoon after rising 5.4% on Tuesday.Harley-Davidson (HOG), the best known of this trio of boy toys for grown-ups, was unchanged in early afternoon trading.

2219,UPS,"With two months of enrollment to go, ObamaCare continues to have trouble attracting young adults and men. Sign-ups plodded ahead to 3.3 million as of Feb. 1, but only 25% were in the key 18-34 demographic and 55% were female — both worrisome signs for the health of the insurance pool. Women tend to use more medical care than men…
"
2220,UPS,"In gauging whether ObamaCare exchange policies make health care reasonably affordable, federal enrollment data have been little help.
"
2221,UPS,"They've offered no clarity on a key metric: the type of policies that households with modest incomes are buying.
"
2222,UPS,"But evidence from the one state that's breaking out such data suggests cause for concern: In Washington, one in four individuals in households earning less than 250% of the poverty level signed up for a bronze plan with a deductible of $5,000-$6,350 per person and $10,000-$12,700 per family.
"
2223,UPS,"Even after premiums, these households could face medical costs ranging from 17% to 40% of income before ObamaCare's nonpreventative-care benefits kick in.
"
2224,UPS,"By any standard, these enrollees hailed by many ObamaCare defenders as success stories are woefully underinsured. The Commonwealth Fund, which studies the health care system, generally considers a person who has to pay at least 10% of income on medical care (excluding premiums) to be underinsured. Households earning under 200% of the poverty level, whose budgets are already stretched, are deemed underinsured if medical costs take up even 5% of income.
"
2225,UPS,"The nature of ObamaCare's subsidies has set up what for many individuals and families may be a coverage decision with no good choices. They can stretch their budgets up to, if not beyond, the breaking point to buy generous coverage — or face financial disaster if they get a low-cost, high-deductible plan and wind up in the hospital.
"
2226,UPS,"As the Commonwealth Fund warns, modest-income households with insurance ""who face high out-of-pocket costs for medical care relative to their incomes are nearly as likely as the uninsured population to go without care because of costs (or) forgo care when sick.""
"
2227,UPS,"Beyond the premium subsidies that the law provides, households earning up to 250% of the poverty level qualify for cost-sharing assistance. It can greatly reduce the deductible that must be exhausted before benefits kick in and, after that, the co-payments required for medical services and prescription drugs.
"
2228,UPS,"But those cost-sharing subsidies are available only for those who buy silver-level coverage, a decision made by the law's crafters that might have held down ObamaCare's cost but looks questionable in light of the Washington state data.
"
2229,UPS,"Consider a single 40-year-old in King County who makes twice the poverty level ($22,980): That individual would have to pay $1,080, or 4.7% of income, in premiums for the cheapest silver plan with a $250 deductible. If $1,080 seems too pricey, the cheapest bronze plan would cost only $370, or 1.6% of income, but it carries a $6,000 deductible. The deductible applies not just to medical visits but to prescriptions as well.
"
2230,UPS,"While strained household budgets may have led some low-income enrollees to opt for a bronze plan, limited understanding of health insurance and the concept of deductibles and co-pays may explain why some selected low-cost bronze plans.
"
2231,UPS,"The Department of Health and Human Services has reported that of just over 8 million ObamaCare exchange sign-ups through mid-April, 1.6 million, or 20%, selected bronze plans.
"
2232,UPS,"The most useful data point provided by HHS: In the 36 states using the federal Healthcare.gov sign-up site, 688,000, or 15%, of those qualifying for subsidies have selected bronze plans.
"
2233,UPS,"Still, these data are of limited use in gauging affordability because they include households making up to 400% of the poverty level. They also include all sign-ups — not just those who pay.
"
2234,UPS,"The Washington state figures reflect only paid enrollment, but even these data have shortcomings. The state breaks subsidized enrollees into two groups: those earning up to 250% of the poverty level and those earning more.
"
2235,UPS,"It would be useful to know the age of the bronze-plan enrollees and how many earn only 200% of the poverty level. For example, a high-deductible plan may not be as much of a concern for a 32-year-old at 245% of the poverty level as a 52-year-old at 150% of poverty.
"
2236,UPS,"Advocates for low-income families in Minnesota have criticized ObamaCare's ""bronze plan trap"" which will get even worse next year, when ObamaCare deductibles rise as high as $6,600.
"
2237,UPS,"Families ""with little to no discretionary income left after paying for essentials like food, housing, transportation and child care . . . are likely to fall into the 'bronze plan trap,' where they select the zero-premium bronze plan but must pay high deductibles and co-payments when they seek health care,"" said the Minnesota Budget Project, which analyzes budget and tax issues.
"
2238,UPS,"The Minnesota Budget Project warned that the likely result would be ""poor health outcomes and more costly medical interventions later on.""
"
2239,UPS,"Minnesota is the only state so far to implement what some have seen as an antidote to ObamaCare's bronze problem: a state-run public plan covering households earning up to 200% of the poverty level.
"
2240,UPS,"This option, known as the Basic Health Plan option, was included in the 2010 Affordable Care Act. But this option may have a downside. Because Minnesota's ObamaCare exchange sign-ups generally earn more than 200% of the poverty level, it is attracting an older population, with three adults age 55 and up for every two young adults.

2242,UPS,"The average employer-provided family health insurance premiums have climbed $2,976 since 2009, according to an annual Kaiser Family Foundation survey released this week. They're up $3,671 compared with the year before President Obama took office. That's despite Obama's repeated promises that the health care reform law he championed would cut premiums by $2,500 in his first term.
"
2243,UPS,"And while annual premium increases have moderated over the past two years, that's due to trends in the insurance market largely unrelated to ObamaCare, and trends the law could actually reverse.
"
2244,UPS,"The Kaiser survey found that the average family premium this year is $16,351, up 4% over last year, and up 22% since 2009. After adjusting for inflation, premiums climbed an average 3.2% a year in Obama's first term, higher than the 2.7% average during President Bush's last four years in office.
"
2245,UPS,"During his first campaign for president, Obama repeatedly claimed that his health reform plan would, as he said at a Virginia rally in 2008 ""lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.""
"
2246,UPS,"Nevertheless, the White House has been touting recent signs of health cost moderation as evidence that ObamaCare is ""already working to reduce costs.""
"
2247,UPS,"Officials cite the fact that national spending on health care climbed just 3.9% in 2011, the same as the previous two years, and the slowest increase since the 1960s.
"
2248,UPS,"But the trends driving the slowdown in health spending have little to do with the Affordable Care Act.
"
2249,UPS,"The sluggish economy played a big role. ""The failure of the economy to bounce back as quickly as it has after past recessions has prolonged this dampening effect on health spending,"" noted Joseph Antos, a health care expert at the American Enterprise Institute.
"
2250,UPS,"Also important has been a broader shift that has been underway for years toward higher-deductible plans. These plans provide consumers with a stronger incentive to economize on health spending.
"
2251,UPS,"The Kaiser survey found, for example, that 78% of workers now face at least some deductible, up from 59% in 2008. And nearly a third has a deductible of at least $2,000, up from 12% in 2008.
"
2252,UPS,"In addition, the private insurance market has seen an explosion in Health Savings Account-type plans — an idea long championed by conservative Republicans — which combine high deductibles with a tax-free savings account that consumers can roll over if they don't spend it all in one year.
"
2253,UPS,"Kaiser found that one in five workers are now enrolled in an HSA-type plan, up from 8% in 2008.
"
2254,UPS,"A separate survey by America's Health Insurance Plans finds that more than 15 million people are now enrolled in HSA plans, up 15% from last year andmore than double the number in 2008.
"
2255,UPS,"Drew Altman, the Kaiser foundation's president, on a conference call with reporters called it ""part of a quiet revolution in health insurance from more comprehensive to less comprehensive.""
"
2256,UPS,"But it's clearly a revolution that can help control health costs. A Rand Corporation study last year — titled ""Skin in the Game"" — found that families in HSA-type plans spent 21% less, on average, in the first year after they switched from a traditional plan. The study found that annual health costs would fall $57 billion if half of workers signed up with an HSA.
"
2257,UPS,"Unfortunately, ObamaCare will likely shift the market in the opposite direction, toward less out-of-pocket spending, greater reliance on insurance to cover small health coasts, and higher premiums. ObamaCare, for example, already requires that preventive care be provided at no direct cost to the patient. It also puts strict limits on deductibles and out-of-pocket spending.

2301,UPS,"Text of President Obama's 2015 State of the Union Address Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are fifteen years into this new century.  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.  But tonight, we turn the page.Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.  We are humbled and grateful for your service.America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.At this moment — with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production — we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.  It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come.Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another — or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.  And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.It begins with our economy.Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.  She waited tables.  He worked construction.  Their first child, Jack, was on the way.They were young and in love in America, and it doesn’t get much better than that.“If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.”As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.  Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed for each other.  And slowly, it paid off.  They bought their first home.  They had a second son, Henry.  Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise.  Ben is back in construction — and home for dinner every night.“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story.  They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled.  You are the reason I ran for this office.  You’re the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.  And it’s been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.<[>We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores.  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump.We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  And more Americans finish college than ever before.We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.  And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.  Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.So the verdict is clear.  Middle-class economics works.  Expanding opportunity works.  And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way.  We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.  We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got a system to fix.  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007.  But here’s the thing — those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making.  We need to do more than just do no harm.  Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help.  She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.  Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.  Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.  We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.  We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet — tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them.That’s what middle-class economics is — the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.  We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success — we want everyone to contribute to our success.So what does middle-class economics require in our time?First — middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.  That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement — and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.Here’s one example.  During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority — so this country provided universal childcare.  In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.It’s not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have.  It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.  And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America — by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.Here’s another example.  Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.  Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave.  Forty-three million.  Think about that.  And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.  So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington.  Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  It’s the right thing to do.Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  Really.  It’s 2015.  It’s time.  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned.  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.These ideas won’t make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship.  That’s not the job of government.  To give working families a fair shot, we’ll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest.We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage — these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.  That is a fact.  And that’s what all of us — Republicans and Democrats alike — were sent here to do.Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world.  But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more.By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education.  Two in three.  And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.  It’s not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future.That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero.  Forty percent of our college students choose community college.  Some are young and starting out.  Some are older and looking for a better job.  Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.  Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt.  Understand, you’ve got to earn it — you’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.  I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.  And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.  Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.  Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.  We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a veteran.Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.  Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.  Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.  But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist ten or twenty years ago — jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.  But we do know we want them here in America.  That’s why the third part of middle-class economics is about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure — modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.  So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.  Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.  Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region.  That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage.  Why would we let that happen?  We should write those rules.  We should level the playing field.  That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but fair.Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.  But ninety-five percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders, and we can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China.  Let’s give them one more reason to get it done.21st century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development.  I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine — one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.  In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.  Tonight, I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes — and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs — converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay.  Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.  In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.  Good luck, Captain — and make sure to Instagram it.Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there’s bipartisan support in this chamber.  Members of both parties have told me so.  Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.  As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.  They’ve riddled it with giveaways the superrich don’t need, denying a break to middle class families who do.This year, we have an opportunity to change that.  Let’s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.  Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.Let’s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.  We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.  We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy.  Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness.  This is where America needs to go.  I believe it’s where the American people want to go.  It will make our economy stronger a year from now, fifteen years from now, and deep into the century ahead.Of course, if there’s one thing this new century has taught us, it’s that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America.  In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.  When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military — then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.  That’s what our enemies want us to do.I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.  We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don’t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.  That’s exactly what we’re doing right now — and around the globe, it is making a difference.First, we stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists — from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.  We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we’ve done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we’ve learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years.Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we’ve trained their security forces, who’ve now taken the lead, and we’ve honored our troops’ sacrifice by supporting that country’s first democratic transition.  Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we’re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL’s advance.  Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.  We’re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.  This effort will take time.  It will require focus.  But we will succeed.  And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.  We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine’s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.  Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin’s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength.  Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.That’s how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.  When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new.  Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.  And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.  As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of “small steps.”  These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.  And after years in prison, we’re overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs.  Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we’ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.  Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies — including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran.  But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails — alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again.  It doesn’t make sense.  That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.  The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.Third, we’re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.  We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism.  And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children’s information.  If we don’t act, we’ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.  If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola — saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.  I couldn’t be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.  But the job is not yet done — and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules — in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.  And no challenge — no challenge — poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.  Now, one year doesn’t make a trend, but this does — 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.I’ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they’re not scientists; that we don’t have enough information to act.  Well, I’m not a scientist, either.  But you know what — I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities.  The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe.  The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  We should act like it.That’s why, over the past six years, we’ve done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it.  That’s why we’ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.  And that’s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.  I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action.  In Beijing, we made an historic announcement — the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.  And because the world’s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we’ve got.There’s one last pillar to our leadership — and that’s the example of our values.As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I’ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.  It’s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.  It’s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims — the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace.  That’s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.  We do these things not only because they’re right, but because they make us safer.As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice — so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.  Since I’ve been President, we’ve worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half.  Now it’s time to finish the job.  And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.  It’s not who we are.As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties — and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.  So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven’t.  As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.  And next month, we’ll issue a report on how we’re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.Looking to the future instead of the past.  Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely.  Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities.  Leading — always — with the example of our values.  That’s what makes us exceptional.  That’s what keeps us strong.  And that’s why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards — our own.You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn’t a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America — but a United States of America.  I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home — a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world’s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision.  How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.  It’s held up as proof not just of my own flaws — of which there are many — but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naïve, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.I know how tempting such cynicism may be.  But I still think the cynics are wrong.I still believe that we are one people.  I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.  I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best.  I’ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London.  I’ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia.  I’ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.  I’ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home.  So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother’s keeper, and our sister’s keeper.  And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.  So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America’s hopes.  I’ve served in Congress with many of you.  I know many of you well.  There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.  And many of you have told me that this isn’t what you signed up for — arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.  Imagine if we did something different.Understand — a better politics isn’t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.  A better politics is one where we appeal to each other’s basic decency instead of our basest fears.  A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than “gotcha” moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives.  A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America.If we’re going to have arguments, let’s have arguments — but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.  We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it’s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs.Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it’s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it’s being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.  But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed.  Surely we can understand the wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.  Surely we can agree it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all.That’s a better politics.  That’s how we start rebuilding trust.  That’s how we move this country forward.  That’s what the American people want.  That’s what they deserve.I have no more campaigns to run.  My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I’ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol — to do what I believe is best for America.  If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand.  If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you’ll at least work with me where you do agree.  And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth — that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood:  your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids.I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen — man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.  I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:  that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past six years:  “It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family.  We, too, have made it through some hard times.  Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.  We’ve laid a new foundation.  A brighter future is ours to write.  Let’s begin this new chapter — together — and let’s start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love. ####

2331,UPS,"Divergence among world regions is likely to persist and will be one of the main themes for 2015, Koesterich reiterated in a Jan. 5 commentary. The momentum in the U.S. economy should continue, based on Q3 GDP figures and forward-looking indicators, he added. In other top markets, the outlook is grimmer.

2332,UPS,"In the U.S. stock market in December, small-cap stock funds led U.S. diversifieds higher, with small-cap growth and core mutual funds rising 1.97% each and small-cap value gaining 2.17%. Large caps posted negative returns almost across the board, as did alternatives, according to data from Lipper Inc.

2335,UPS,"""Should the dollar continue to appreciate, that would exert more downward pressure on commodity prices,"" he wrote. In recent weeks, oil, natural gas and copper traded at their lowest level in years.

"
2337,UPS,"In 2014, U.S. diversified stock funds were up 7.57% overall, above their average annual 7.04% for the past 10 years. It follows their outsized 32.3% gain posted last year.

"
2339,UPS,"The strong performance of defensive stocks, many of which outperformed in 2014 as interest rates unexpectedly fell, may come under pressure in the new year, said Koesterich.
"
2340,UPS,"While the stronger growth forecast for 2015 should generally support stocks, it makes a rise in interest rates more likely.

2341,UPS,"""Rising interest rates are a negative for dividend plays, like utilities, as higher rates have historically been associated with lower valuations,"" Koesterich wrote.

2352,UPS,"In Europe, markets are caught between geopolitical risks and potential upside from further stimulus by the European Central Bank (ECB), Koesterich said. Greece once again is the focus of anxieties, he added.
"
2353,UPS,"As a result, he takes a more favorable view of Asian equities — especially markets getting monetary stimulus (China) or undergoing structural reforms (Japan).

Energy commodities' 32.08% tumble made them the worst-performing sector fund category in 2014.The strong performance of defensive stocks, many of which outperformed in 2014 as interest rates unexpectedly fell, may come under pressure in the new year, said Koesterich.While the stronger growth forecast for 2015 should generally support stocks, it makes a rise in interest rates more likely.""Rising interest rates are a negative for dividend plays, like utilities, as higher rates have historically been associated with lower valuations,"" Koesterich wrote.For mutual fund investors, he advised a more cyclical tilt.""We continue to see opportunities in 'old technology' firms and in financials,"" he said. By 'old technology,' Koesterich means traditional hardware and software companies, as well as makers of telecom equipment and semiconductor chips. Among financial firms, he recommends a focus on banks.Mixed-asset funds, including target-date retirement funds, lost 0.72% in December but gained 4.35% in 2014 as a whole. Over the past five years, they rose an average annual 8.28%.China Was TopsThe average world equity mutual fund gave up 3.12% in December and 2.24% in all of 2014 vs. an average annual gain of 4.16% over the last 10 years. Even India region funds — last year's outperformer across virtually all mutual fund categories — fell 2.69% in December. China region funds eked out a 0.12% gain but escaped the red, unlike peers in the world equity group.In a familiar repeat, the biggest losers were Latin American funds. They gave up 8.38% in December, which took their 2014 loss to 13.61% — the most among world equity funds by a margin.Emerging markets gave up 5.01% and Europe funds lost 3.45% in December. They also posted negative returns for 2014 as a whole, of 3.23% and 7.05%, respectively.By comparison, China funds climbed 3.43% for the year, while India funds catapulted 40.31%.2015 OutlookThe strong U.S. economic outlook and the prospect of a rallying dollar bode well for fund investors. But beyond American shores, the situation starts to get murky.In Europe, markets are caught between geopolitical risks and potential upside from further stimulus by the European Central Bank (ECB), Koesterich said. Greece once again is the focus of anxieties, he added.As a result, he takes a more favorable view of Asian equities — especially markets getting monetary stimulus (China) or undergoing structural reforms (Japan).""Look for markets with tailwinds,"" Koesterich advised, adding this includes both developed and emerging markets within Asia.At Vanguard, economists described their outlook for global stocks and bonds as the most guarded since 2006.""The U.S. economy will likely remain resilient to the global slowdown,"" global chief economist Joseph Davis and his team wrote in their 2015 economic and investment outlook report. At the same time, they added, ""growth is not immune to the downside (and growing) risks in Europe and China.""In Europe, the Vanguard experts see a heightened risk of recession. ""Investors should prepare for periodic market volatility driven by political flare-ups and concerns over the capitalization of the European banking system,"" the report said.Davis' team expects the Chinese economy to grow at a lower but more sustainable pace in 2015, but considers a hard landing unlikely. They find the outlook for Japan of greater concern, with pickup in real GDP growth likely to stay low at around 1%.

2375,UPS,"Global equity markets went on a rollercoaster ride in October, although given the cauldron of global issues that were brewing for some time and the month's history of big moves, it shouldn't be all that shocking many investors got spooked. While much of the media focused on the short-term panic, long-term investors used such pullbacks to search for bargains. In the long-term camp, our equity teams view corrections as par for the course, remaining focused on a long-term thesis and not short-term hysteria. Several of our investment professionals share their perspective on the recent market ups and downs. 
"
2376,UPS,"Ed Perks, CFA® Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer Franklin Equity Group® 
"
2377,UPS,"It was not that long ago (early to mid-September) when the market debate was centered around the strengthening US economy and the pace that we would see the Federal Reserve (Fed) start to shift gears and tighten monetary policy in response to a very strong economy. For the most part, we think that scenario is very much still intact; the US economic data continues to point to a strengthening US economy. What has changed, though, is a bit of the global macro picture. Other major economies, particularly the eurozone, are decelerating a bit, and that's raising concerns that those economies may be falling back into a recession. 
"
2378,UPS,"In the United States, I think a big part of this recent global equity market selloff, particularly the violent nature of it in October, is an indicator that perhaps the scars from the 2007—2009 financial crisis still are fairly deep. If we were to go back to July or August of this year and survey folks wanting to get into the equity market, I think many or most would probably have said they wanted a bit of a pullback. It's when we are in the midst of a pullback that it becomes a real challenge to have the intestinal fortitude to stick to your plan and look for opportunities. For us, this kind of market in many ways is a great opportunity. I've always viewed these types of markets as a way to reset or recharge our portfolios.
"
2379,UPS,"Energy is clearly one of the areas that has been hit the hardest across market sectors. There are, I think, some valid fundamental reasons why we have seen a pullback in energy prices, but the selling in that sector has been so indiscriminate and across the board, in our view, based largely on fear or forced selling. Energy is one sector that we are now looking at and think there is greater opportunity in select names, and that's where our bottom-up stock selection process comes in. 
"
2380,UPS,"Don Taylor Chief Investment Officer Franklin Equity Group®, US Value 
"
2381,UPS,"The recent downturn in the global equity market has been attributed to a litany of different things, including slowing growth in the United States, China, Europe and Japan, geopolitical issues in Russia and Ukraine, ISIS in the Middle East and even Ebola cases in the United States. It may sound silly, but October's history as a month of heightened volatility may also have played a factor in terms of market sentiment; for example, the ""Black Tuesday"" crash of 1929 and ""Black Monday"" crash of 1987 both took place in October. I think the market has in recent years become more and more dominated, at least in the short run, by trading-oriented accounts that can also magnify volatility when sentiment shifts. We could find trends in any given week or month aggressively reverse. 
"
2382,UPS,"In light of this recent market uncertainty, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) certainly has the tools to start easing again if it deems necessary. We've seen some comments to that effect come across the tape in October, essentially sending a message that Fed policymakers are not going to let bad things happen in the markets. 
"
2383,UPS,"Overall, I suspect it will become more clear, especially as we get deeper in the earnings season, that US growth appears to be OK. Maybe there will be some slowdown in the United States reflecting the slowdown we've seen in some of the other parts of the world, but we still see a pretty favorable environment for the market. Most US companies do sizable business outside the United States, so it's clearly relevant, but I think in the United States, we're in an environment where there are not the major excesses that would likely cause a really sharp downturn. There may be a perception that the global economy is falling apart, but it wouldn't surprise me to see some strengthening in the market in November and December. 
"
2384,UPS,"Peter Langerman Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Franklin Mutual Series™ 
"
2385,UPS,"I think the pace of the recent equity market drop, particularly in Europe, took some investors by surprise. When sentiment started to take a turn for the worse, the market did feel similar to a few years ago—the panic, the heightened volatility, the intraday ups and downs. We really hadn't seen that sort of action for some time as volatility had remained relatively low for an extended period. 
"
2386,UPS,"We certainly are not in a position to call a bottom, but when you look at the fundamentals for the US markets, we think the situation is not so dire. Europe is a little different; Europe has taken some real hits. I think the recovery in Europe has struggled to meet expectations throughout much of the year. Even Germany, one of the stronger markets in Europe, has shown some real signs of weakness, and that's an issue. While this is partly attributable to ongoing issues related to Ukraine, there are probably additional factors contributing to the recent economic weakness. There are some serious concerns about the pace of the recovery in Europe, but we believe many European corporates paint a picture that belies the macroeconomic headlines. In our discussions with companies located there, we have found that while things aren't great in Europe, they don't appear as bad as the last several weeks and months of market action would seem to indicate. The silver lining from an investment standpoint is that we are finding more potential investment ideas in Europe at better prices than before. 
"
2387,UPS,"It can be difficult for investors to keep calm amid days of extreme volatility like we've seen in October, but I think the good news is that the financial system is in much better shape today than it was six years ago. There are pockets of weakness (such as energy stocks, which have been pummeled), but we aren't seeing major liquidity issues. We aren't seeing big banks or other financial institutions teetering on the edge of bankruptcy like we did during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. 
"
2388,UPS,"Norm Boersma, CFA® Chief Investment Officer Templeton Global Equity Group™ 
"
2389,UPS,"That said, I don't think investors should just jump in and buy everything. It's important to be selective. At Franklin Mutual Series, we will remain disciplined as we look to take advantage of potential opportunities created by the market's ups and downs. Nobody can call the market bottom. As we have seen time and again, things can turn around very quickly, often for no apparent reason, but historically, we have been able to take advantage of these periods due to our opportunistic approach. 
"
2390,UPS,"The results of the Asset Quality Review ""AQR"" and stress tests released October 26 were mostly benign, yet their specific conclusions matter less than their symbolic importance. As the ECB assumes supervisory control over the regional banking system, clarity and transparency should improve, in our view. Confidence should follow, and the newly recapitalized banks could begin to increase lending in a less uncertain regulatory regime. The ECB's recent decision to increase asset purchases and set negative deposit rates should help, and are all part of a bigger push to get the credit mechanism going again. I think that's part of the reason that the growth has been weak. There is a demand issue, but there's also a money supply issue that I think needs to be addressed. If banks don't lend, you don't get inflation either. So we've seen deflation, magnified as periphery countries are trying to cut costs at the same time banks aren't lending.I would emphasize that the fundamentals in Europe today are very, very different from 2010 and 2011. Bond yields are in line if not below where the United States is, and the peripheral countries have been slowly moving in the right direction in terms of reform, some more quickly than others. One of the things that I think still needs to happen (and the European Central Bank (ECB) has definitely been pushing in this direction) is related to reform in the banking system. Corporate Europe depends less on bond markets for financing than does corporate America, so the banking system is the main financial intermediary in the region. Policymakers are trying to get the banks to increase lending to spur credit creation, but at the same time they are requiring them to raise capital and pay punitive fines. Both of these goals may be understandable, but they are also largely incompatible. Hopefully the regulators' ""Comprehensive Assessment"" should help reconcile the differences. 
"
2391,UPS,"The emerging market slowdown has also had a bigger impact in Europe. So what we have seen then is a pretty sharp selloff in European equities, and we think within that pullback lies opportunities. In the short term, there isn't much on the horizon that would make us wildly optimistic, but we have been looking for new opportunities and nibbling away in Europe, energy stocks being one area we are examining closely. There are a lot of European cyclical stocks that also look pretty interesting to us. 
"
2392,UPS,"We also have been looking at opportunities in the emerging markets, which actually have had a pretty good run this year in general, despite recent weakness. There are a number of infrastructure plays, for example, that have pulled back pretty sharply and present good long-term opportunities, in our view. 
"
2393,UPS,"We think a market pullback like we have seen recently is pretty normal. We just haven't seen volatility of a similar nature for a while. That's why people get scared about equities, but that is part of investing—and, we think, part of the opportunity.

John West wanted to watch sports with his young children without violent movie ads, adult medication commercials and news about the latest sports scandals.""I was surprised how often I was muting the TV,"" West told IBD.He also noticed that kids' digital habits were different. Instead of plopping in front of the tube, they played musical screens: from computer to smartphone to TV.West's startup, Whistle Network, helps parents get a handle on what their children watch by bringing kid-friendly content to a multichannel YouTube sports network . Kids like it because they can watch on any device.• Dig in. ""We spent the first year doing research, trying to understand why this hadn't been done before,"" West said.He discovered that the solution needed to come from a disruptor, not an existing channel that would suffer from competition.""We are not worried about offsetting an existing platform,"" he said.• Tap stars. West gathered an all-star team for his startup. Investors include New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning and former Nickelodeon and MTV chief executives. Content partners include the National Football League, Major League Baseball, NASCAR and the PGA Tour.""We're excited to get deeper on a sport-by-sport basis,"" West said.• Bring them closer. With kids on the move, said West, ""they want to upload a video and share it. They also want to comment on it.""Welcoming viewers' content onto Whistle Network increases engagement. With 6 million plus subscribers, ""you have armies of creators out there,"" he said.• Build buzz. ""Bragging rights and ego."" That's what drove kids to develop games within Roblox, according to CEO David Baszucki. The multiplayer online game is 100% user generated, which means that its players — typically ages 8 to 18 — create games within the build-like-Legos platform.• Reward 'em. Roblox took a leap forward this year by letting user-developers convert virtual currency that they earn within the game into cash. Now some teens are making $4,000 a month, and the company has paid out more than $315,000 since January.• Celebrate skills. ""Making a game is a really complicated thing,"" Baszucki said, and kids dabbling in games like Roblox learn solid skills. Paying them for doing it well attracts and keeps the best user-developers. Baszucki likens it to a gaming version of the TV show ""American Idol.""""Roblox is all about having great user-created content,"" he said. ""It really ups the bar in the quality of the game.""• Evolve. For all those social media lovers who've grumbled about platforms like Facebook (FB) profiting from their engagement, Bubblews offers an alternative.The new social media site uses a portion of its ad revenue to pay participants for posting — a penny per like or comment. The cents can be cashed in at the $50 mark.""Now is the time for the social landscape to evolve into its next iteration, and we at Bubblews are excited to help push that change forward,"" said Arvind Dixit, CEO and co-founder.• Tempt them.

The platform, developed in 2012 and relaunched in July, now has 20 million visitors per month.

The new range is fully ahead of the $294.8 million analysts had been modeling.For the current quarter, Zillow expects sales of $75.5 million to $76.5 million, higher than the expected $71.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters.Zillow stock leaped 3.6% in late trading, gaining back some of its 9% decline in the regular session.Zillow and rival Trulia (TRLA) both are spending heavily this year on national advertising campaigns. Zillow plans to boost full-year spending to $65 million from $40 million in 2013, while Trulia this year launched its first national campaign with a plan to spend $45 million.Zillow's traffic is seeing a boost, the company reports, with April monthly unique users up 50% to about 79 million.Zillow reported about 53,000 subscribing real estate agents at the close of Q1, up 56% year over year. That marked decelerated growth from 64% in Q4, but still topped the 55% growth that analyst Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets had been expecting.Those agents buy ads and services from Zillow, and the average monthly sales to each agent jumped 10.4% to $286 in Q1 vs. a year ago. That marked an acceleration from 1.5% growth in Q4.About 60% of Zillow's Q1 ad impressions were bought up by existing paying agents who purchased more inventory than they previously had, Rascoff says.In 2013, only about 50% to 55% of those impressions were bought by already subscribing agents. Prior to that, it was about 30% to 40%, CFO Chad Cohen told IBD.""We see it as a positive because it means we're serving our existing premier-agent base well and they're finding a huge amount of value,"" Cohen said.

2431,UPS,"Scandal: Documents show the president was told by Veterans Administration officials during his transition briefings that he shouldn't trust the wait time and treatment scheduling data being reported by local VA centers.On April 9, 2009, with his Secretary of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Eric Shinseki by his side, President Obama said, ""As long as I'm commander in chief, I promise that we will work tirelessly to meet that mission and make sure that all those who wear this nation's uniform, know this when you come home to America, America will be there for you.""True, he has significantly increased VA funding on his watch. This upcoming fiscal year Obama requested a 3% boost for the Veterans Affairs budget. Obama's fiscal 2015 budget request points out he has increased the VA discretionary budget by 35.2% since 2009.The question amid this scandal is just how this taxpayer money was spent.""I am amazed this (scandal) is still happening, given the big increase in resources that the department has received,"" says Phillip Carter of the Center for a New American Security.Maybe not so amazing when you consider that according to records reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon, the VA has spent $489 million to upgrade conference rooms, buy drapes and purchase office furniture during the past 4-1/2 years.Just months before President Obama made his pledge to veterans, VA officials warned the Obama-Biden transition team not to trust the wait-time data that VA hospitals were reporting.They said that bureaucrats might be cooking the books to make performance look better than it was and to make bonuses likelier, according to briefing obtained by the Washington Times through the Freedom of Information Act.""This is not only a data integrity issue in which (Veterans Health Administration) reports unreliable performance data; it affects quality of care by delaying — and potentially denying — deserving veterans timely care,"" the officials wrote in materials used to brief the incoming commander in chief.The question of what Obama and Shinseki knew and when they knew it has been answered.Yet despite calls from two prominent veterans groups, the American Legion and Concerned Veterans for America, for Shinseki to resign or be fired, Obama has given the retired Army general a thumbs up.""The president remains confident in Secretary Shinseki's ability to lead the department and to take appropriate action based on the (inspector general's) findings,"" said White House spokesman Shin Inouye last week.On ""Fox & Friends"" Monday morning, yet another whistle-blower, Dr. Margaret Moxness, who was employed at the Huntington VA Medical Center in Charleston, W.Va., from 2008 to 2010, said she was told by superiors to put patients off for months on end, even after telling superiors they required immediate care.At least two of her patients committed suicide while they waited for care between appointments. She calls the administration ""compassionless,"" and eventually left the VA after sending higher-ups several memos that went ignored.A Dayton Daily News report on Sunday noted that its investigation of a database of claims paid by Veterans Affairs shows that the words ""delay in treatment"" were used 167 times.The VA paid out of $36.4 million to settle the claims.""Should they have known? Absolutely, they should have known,"" said Deirdre Parke Holleman, executive director of the Washington office for the Retired Enlisted Association, a veterans group, which has not taken a position on whether Shinseki should resign. ""These are problems that should have been dealt with.""Obama knew and did nothing.Like Fast and Furious and Benghazi, we have more dead bodies due to his administration's neglect and incompetence.

2454,UPS,"Weather across America may have more or less returned to normal. Thoughts of winter are drifting further behind.But there are still few signs of a spring thaw in the market for high-growth, high-priced stocks.While the Dow Jones industrial average is a small rally away from sealing an all-time intraday high, the IBD 50 index remains in an intermediate-level correction.The decline has even overshadowed the tech-focused Nasdaq composite.Through Friday, the IBD 50 has fallen 14% below its recent peak. (Type in 0IBD5 at Investors.com to see the daily chart.) At one point in mid-April, the decline ran as deep as 16.6%.Now view the relative strength line of the IBD 50 chart. This tool tracks the performance of a stock or an index with the S&P 500. The IBD 50's RS line has sloped lower — underperformed — for 10 weeks.All of this means that caution is still warranted when it comes to fishing for stocks that fully meet the criteria of IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm.Last week, the IBD 50 lost 3.3%. The 500 fell less than 0.2%.Looking at the current IBD 50 list, numerous names are still fighting to keep their head above the 50-day or 200-day moving average. Others have potentially formed a bottom, but the right side of new bases still needs a lot of work.Of course, a few stocks have fallen much less than their IBD 50 peers. They are worth monitoring on a watch list. But stay wary of those that have already staged long run-ups or built more than two or three bases. Later-stage bases are likelier to crumble.Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) rallied higher for a fourth straight week. But the current base that began with a wild reversal on Feb. 26 is third stage. In the first base, the buy point was 16.39, and Anika began its breakout in the week ended June 14 last year.An aggressive early buy point is also found at 15.18. Either way, the maker of hyaluronic acid-based arthritis treatments has already made a big run.Anika's base does not a show a single down week in above-average volume, yet its Medical-Biotech group has suffered its steepest correction since the summer of 2011.Other stocks that have generally fallen less than the IBD 50 and are trading near their 52-week peaks include Akorn (AKRX), Air Lease (AL) and EOG Resources (EOG).

Berkman decided to make Weisner his assistant.Weisner saw how singers did interviews with the press and noted that MGM's units worked closely together (""there were no divas"").After a year with Berkman, Weisner shifted to marketing in the Verve label, where he learned about distribution, production quality control and the label's artist and repertoire segment, which was signing new acts like Richie Havens, Janis Ian and the Velvet Underground.In 1969, Weisner followed two colleagues from MGM to Buddah Records (later renamed Buddha).""We knew that to survive, we'd have to outhustle and outthink the major labels, but we thought we could develop a reputation for being more artist friendly,"" he said.One of Buddah's most important clients was Curtis Mayfield, who had composed many of the anthems of the civil rights movement.""One of the great wordsmiths of our era,"" said Weisner.Mayfield and two other Buddah performers, Gladys Knight and Sha Na Na, became Weisner's first management clients.""What I wanted to do was to nurture the best talent, helping them put on brilliant live shows and build a following over the long run,"" said Weisner, who moved his management business to Los Angeles in 1972.""The first thing that grabbed me about Ron is how much he loved music,"" wrote Knight in the foreword to Weisner's memoir. ""When I asked him to be my manager, he said, 'I'll do what I can.' He didn't talk a big game like some managers do. The passion and loyalty he has for his artists, his business associates and his friends are unmatched.""Sha Na Na was a dozen guys who put on 250 shows a year, but each had a different idea of what the band should be doing.Weisner had to constantly intervene in their arguments while making their 1950s doo-wop style famous with their appearance in the 1978 movie ""Grease.""He also signed a syndication deal for a TV variety series for them, but it needed a sponsor. Weisner approached some Procter & Gamble (PG) executives, but they were skeptical about the group's appeal.Weisner came up with a flashy idea. He arranged for them to fly to New York so the P&G suits could see Sha Na Na perform, then called a billboard company. As the execs were driven up Sixth Avenue, the electronic billboards flashed pictures of the performers.P&G signed, and the show ran for four seasons.In 1977, Weisner got a call from a friend who said a group of brothers called the Jackson 5 needed help. They had left Motown for Epic Records, and their career had stalled because their light pop style had lost its appeal.The problem was that their dad and manager, Joe Jackson, didn't care what they sang, as long as he could squeeze every dollar out of the deal. They were petrified of him.""I knew I was walking into a minefield and became their manager anyway,"" Weisner said. ""Joe and I had constant fights, and my only real concern was that I could keep these away from Michael, who could make magic when he was in the studio.""Feet On The GroundWeisner found Michael to be a serious student of entertainment who had studied how Fred Astaire, Charlie Chaplin and James Brown danced and moved.""His energy level was off the charts, unmatched by anyone I've seen before or since,"" Weisner said. ""He wanted to be the best, then go beyond that.""Against the wishes of Epic, which thought Quincy Jones was too old to produce a record for what they thought was Michael's preteen audience, Weisner arranged for him to handle Jackson's solo record ""Off the Wall.""The process proved worth it.After it was released in 1979, ""Off the Wall"" sold 20 million copies — compared with the 1.3 million the label had expected.Jackson's next album, ""Thriller,"" was the ultimate smash after coming out in 1982. It sold 110 million copies, the greatest number ever.Michael had been calling Weisner 20 times a day when suddenly he stopped in 1984, after Joe Jackson reasserted his control over his son's careers.Downs And UpsBy then, Weisner had brought on a partner, Freddy DeMann, but by 1985 they had different visions for the business and decided to divvy up the clients.One of those clients was Madonna, and Weisner happily let DeMann have her.The singer had topped the charts the year before, but her demeanor wasn't for Weisner.""Sure I want to help my family have the good life, but I also want me to have a good life, and if Madonna were part of it, no amount of money was worth the headache,"" Weisner wrote.Paul McCartney sparked the opposite experience.""He was, without fail, a joy to work with — professional, energized and punctual,"" Weisner wrote. ""From him I learned that you must persevere not only when things are at their worst, but also when they're at their best. I learned that it's possible to balance your show business with your personal life and remain at the top of your game in both. I learned that entertainment is a noble profession.""Larry Schweikart, director of the independent film ""Rockin' the Wall,"" said: ""In interviewing musicians for our documentary on how rock music helped bring down the Iron Curtain, I learned that almost all of them had a very difficult time finding a manager they could trust. Ron Weisner was known for having built his success on being absolutely honest and always putting the client's benefit before his own. That's a lesson that can be applied to any profession.""

2458,UPS,"Reform: Probably hoping no one would notice, regulators late last week exempted from ObamaCare five U.S. territories where it was failing. Will they do the same once it's obvious ObamaCare is failing everywhere else?When the geniuses in Congress and the White House were writing the ObamaCare legislation, they made a slight mistake. The law imposed ObamaCare's guaranteed issue and community rating insurance mandates on the five territories — which have a combined population of more than 4 million — but it exempted them from the individual mandate and didn't offer any subsidies.Not surprisingly, the insurance markets quickly collapsed in Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands, just like health officials there said would happen.Until last week, the administration claimed there was nothing it could do. A year ago, in fact, they told the territories that, while the law might have been badly written, it's the law. The HHS ""does not have the authority"" to fix the problem.Then higher ups at the White House recalled that, when it comes to ObamaCare, ""the law means just what they choose it to mean — neither more nor less"" (to paraphrase ""Alice in Wonderland's"" Humpty Dumpty).The press and the administration tried to downplay the latest change as simply responding to the unique circumstances the law unintentionally created. But the problems plaguing the territories will eventually show up in the states as well.Even where it applies, for example, the individual mandate is easily avoidable. As we've noted, huge swaths are automatically exempt, and individuals can easily claim a hardship exemption if they don't want to buy insurance or pay the penalty.Plus, the mandate penalty is unenforceable. If people don't pay it, the IRS is mostly powerless to collect it.And unless Obama unilaterally rewrites another part of the law, the cost of insurance will soon outstrip government subsidies meant to keep it affordable. The law caps the total amount of insurance subsidy payments after 2018 to artificially hold ObamaCare's costs down.So rather than a fast implosion of the insurance market, it will be more like an expanding sinkhole. Insurance rates will climb year after year as the young and healthy abandon the market, causing still more cancellations and a resulting insurance pool that is increasingly sicker, more expensive and less stable.Already there's talk of higher premiums next year, as insurers look at the cost to cover those who signed up this year, plus the costs involved to comply with Obama-Care's myriad benefit mandates, regulations and taxes.The weighted average rate hikes proposed in Washington state and Virginia, for example, are 9.6% and 11.7%, according to the American Enterprise Institute.A report from Avalere Health finds that premiums will climb an average 8% next year, with increases ranging up to 16% in some states. It also found that those sticking with their current plan could face substantial rate hikes, in part because of the way ObamaCare subsidies are calculated.Meanwhile, people in need of specialty care are finding that ObamaCare policies often provide scant coverage. Patients are suing in California over Anthem Blue Cross' narrow networks, and groups representing chronically ill patients say skimpy drug benefits put their populations at greater risk.So the White House is looking at rules to force insurance companies to expand their ObamaCare networks. That might help solve the access problem, but only by further jacking up ObamaCare premiums.This endless tinkering will not put ObamaCare back together again. As with the territories, the only solution is to sweep the mess away entirely.

2494,UPS,"Now that it has leapfrogged up the ranks of homebuilders for a coast-to-coast scope, TRI Pointe Homes wants to become the poster child for a new kind of builder.Call it a hybrid: a cross between a publicly traded builder with a national presence and a small, regional builder with local connections, says CEO Doug Bauer.Monday's $2.8 billion merger with the homebuilding division of timber giant Weyerhaeuser (WY) gave Irvine, Calif.-based TRI Pointe Homes (TPH) five new regional homebuilding brands, with operations stretching to the East Coast.The deal enabled Weyerhaeuser, a real estate investment trust (REIT), to focus on its core timberland and wood-product business.Bauer says that the acquisition positions the company for the housing recovery in some of the nation's most attractive housing markets — in areas such as Southern California, Texas hot spots Houston and Austin, Arizona and around Washington, D.C. And he expects to build a whole new business template.""The big guys have deep pockets, and the regional guys are a little more nimble,"" he told IBD. ""The new vision for TRI Pointe is what I call the next generation of homebuilder, a family of regional homebuilding companies.""You maximize your income by running a local business at a regional level, but you have the deep pockets, economies of scale and (financial) sophistication of a public company. It's the best of both worlds.""Investors seem skeptical of the deal. TRI Pointe stock fell 1.7% Wednesday. And Thursday, shares fell 3% intraday to around 15.TRI Pointe hasn't traded above its January 2013 IPO price of 17 since late May.Stock Market HopscotchUntil the Reverse Morris Trust merger closed on Monday, TRI Pointe had been one of the smaller publicly traded builders in the U.S.It operated in just two states, California and Colorado, and had 3,000 developable lots, though that was up from virtually nothing in 2009, when Bauer and his partners started the firm from scratch.Now it has more than 30,000 lots, a market capitalization lifted from just over $500 million to $2.6 billion and 900 employees, up from 150.The five new homebuilding companies from Weyerhaeuser include Pardee Homes in Southern California and southern Nevada, Quadrant Homes in Washington state, Maracay Homes in Arizona, Trendmaker Homes in Houston, and Winchester Homes in Richmond, Va.Bauer plans to keep the company names and management teams.""My job is to steer this family of homebuilders to generate results as a pure homebuilder vs. being part of a REIT,"" he said.Under the REIT structure, he says, returns from homebuilding operations often were plowed back into the parent company for general operations. Much of the profits were returned to shareholders.But the deal has a potential downside: more inventory than Bauer wanted.Having learned the pitfalls of being stuck with too much in a downturn when he worked for California builder William Lyon Homes (WLH), Bauer had vowed to keep inventory down to no more than three years' worth.Now inventory is at nine years, due in large part to Pardee Homes in California.""I've adjusted my horizon to five years (inventory),"" Bauer said, adding that he thinks it'll take about three years to achieve.""We're going to focus on project sizes of no more than 500 units so we can build and sell them in 36 to 48 months,"" he said. ""That will allow us to weather the ups and downs of the housing business.""As for further expansion, he puts Texas at the top of the list near-term, using the new Houston homebuilding operation as a springboard.""In the short run, probably the closest market I'd like to focus in on is Austin, to the northwest of Houston,"" Bauer said.He says that the new TRI Pointe is comparable in size to such builders as Standard Pacific Homes (SPF), Ryland Group (RYL) and Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC), which also went public last year. Like TRI Pointe, those builders have struggled in the stock market and have low Relative Strength Ratings from IBD.TRI Pointe will also compete in many of its markets with Lennar (LEN), the No. 1 homebuilder in the country by market cap.

2497,UPS,"When it comes to investing in ETFs, the best tool for the job depends on your investment goal.
"
2498,UPS,"Here's a look at how to match approach with investor type:
"
2499,UPS," Suppose you're a long-term buy-and-hold investor. In the part of your portfolio devoted to ETFs, you want ETFs that John Bogle would like. These are ETFs that you stick with for the long haul, through market ups and downs. Bogle founded the giant mutual-fund firm Vanguard Group; he's recommended buying and holding multiple large-company stocks.
"
2500,UPS,"The ETFs best suited to your needs are broadly diversified. You don't want an ETF that trades a lot, racking up transaction costs. It would defeat a key trait of ETFs — their low fees — to hop in and out.
"
2501,UPS,"If this is what you're after, SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is your poster child. It's big, and it sticks to one clearly defined index that does not change its makeup often. Other ETF providers have their own versions of this kind of fund, with slight differences in fees and index-tracking accuracy: iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) and Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) are examples.
"
2502,UPS,"If you want something potentially a little tamer, consider ALPS Equal Sector Weight (EQL). By equally weighting each of the S&P 500's nine sectors, the fund underplays the index's largest categories.
"
2503,UPS,"It tilts away from hot sectors and favors unloved sectors. The process deprives shareholders of momentum-stock gains. But it shields them from bubbles.
"
2504,UPS,"In the volatile three months that ended May 6, EQL was up 6.87% vs. 5.71% for SPY. But over the trailing 12 months, SPY outperformed by 17.78% vs. 17.46%.
"
2505,UPS," A more active ETF investor needs reliable tools. They include moving averages, trading volume, rate of earnings growth, bases, relative price strength and whether institutional investors are accumulating the security.
"
2506,UPS,"IBD's ETF Center can help. The center features a screening tool that lets you sort through all ETFs or just certain types, such as nonleveraged, equity or single-industry ones. It also lets you search for ETFs that are in bases or that have just come out of bases.
"
2507,UPS,"You can also think of ETFs themselves as tools. Some passively run ETFs that track an index that does not change often are as simple as a hammer.
"
2508,UPS,"Others are more like power tools. They combine a passive index with an actively run portion.
"
2509,UPS,"Actively run ETFs can take better advantage of twists and turns in the market. But they can have higher fees.

2517,UPS," What if you're looking for income?
"
2518,UPS,"You can aim for an ETF like SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its SEC yield is 5.85%, and it is trending higher but repeatedly testing its 10-week moving average.When it comes to investing in ETFs, the best tool for the job depends on your investment goal.Here's a look at how to match approach with investor type: Suppose you're a long-term buy-and-hold investor. In the part of your portfolio devoted to ETFs, you want ETFs that John Bogle would like. These are ETFs that you stick with for the long haul, through market ups and downs. Bogle founded the giant mutual-fund firm Vanguard Group; he's recommended buying and holding multiple large-company stocks.The ETFs best suited to your needs are broadly diversified. You don't want an ETF that trades a lot, racking up transaction costs. It would defeat a key trait of ETFs — their low fees — to hop in and out.If this is what you're after, SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is your poster child. It's big, and it sticks to one clearly defined index that does not change its makeup often. Other ETF providers have their own versions of this kind of fund, with slight differences in fees and index-tracking accuracy: iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) and Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) are examples.If you want something potentially a little tamer, consider ALPS Equal Sector Weight (EQL). By equally weighting each of the S&P 500's nine sectors, the fund underplays the index's largest categories.It tilts away from hot sectors and favors unloved sectors. The process deprives shareholders of momentum-stock gains. But it shields them from bubbles.In the volatile three months that ended May 6, EQL was up 6.87% vs. 5.71% for SPY. But over the trailing 12 months, SPY outperformed by 17.78% vs. 17.46%. A more active ETF investor needs reliable tools. They include moving averages, trading volume, rate of earnings growth, bases, relative price strength and whether institutional investors are accumulating the security.IBD's ETF Center can help. The center features a screening tool that lets you sort through all ETFs or just certain types, such as nonleveraged, equity or single-industry ones. It also lets you search for ETFs that are in bases or that have just come out of bases.You can also think of ETFs themselves as tools. Some passively run ETFs that track an index that does not change often are as simple as a hammer.Others are more like power tools. They combine a passive index with an actively run portion.Actively run ETFs can take better advantage of twists and turns in the market. But they can have higher fees. Let's say you want to hedge. There are simple strategies, such as buying gold when you expect the stock market to tumble.Then there are fancier strategies. Almost everyone expects a rise in interest rates, right? It should drive down prices on existing bonds.Market Vectors' Treasury-Hedged High Yield Bond ETF (THHY) holds high-yield corporate bonds. It also shorts five-year Treasury notes. Why?

2577,UPS,"What Are the Risks? 
"
2578,UPS,"All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Value securities may not increase in price as anticipated or may decline further in value. Investments in foreign securities involve certain risks including currency fluctuations, and economic and political uncertainties. . Investments in emerging markets, of which frontier markets are a subset, involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Because these frameworks are typically even less developed in frontier markets, as well as various factors including the increased potential for extreme price volatility, illiquidity, trade barriers and exchange controls, the risks associated with emerging markets are magnified in frontier markets.

Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Value securities may not increase in price as anticipated or may decline further in value. Investments in foreign securities involve certain risks including currency fluctuations, and economic and political uncertainties. . Investments in emerging markets, of which frontier markets are a subset, involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Because these frameworks are typically even less developed in frontier markets, as well as various factors including the increased potential for extreme price volatility, illiquidity, trade barriers and exchange controls, the risks associated with emerging markets are magnified in frontier markets. 1Franklin Templeton's 2014 Global Investor Sentiment Survey was conducted online by ORC International in January 2014. The survey polled 11,113 investors across 22 countries. 1Franklin Templeton's 2014 Global Investor Sentiment Survey was conducted online by ORC International in January 2014.

2580,UPS,"When firms build an environment where people trust each other, the office functions faster and smoother. People give each other the benefit of the doubt and are willing to take more risks.

2581,UPS,"""The main thing we see is trust makes work happen easier,"" said Jennifer Robin, a management professor at Bradley University in Illinois and research fellow at the Great Place to Work Institute.
"
2582,UPS,"Here's how leaders create that atmosphere of trust.
"
2583,UPS,"• Listen. Ask for your employees' concerns and pay attention to what they say, Robin says. Invite them in to talk on a regular basis.
"
2584,UPS,"""Sometimes managers think all they have to do is open the door,"" she told IBD. ""A leader has to be a little more proactive than that.""
"
2585,UPS,"• Do the job. You have to be good at your work or people won't have faith in your ability to properly execute, even if your word is gold. ""They can believe you're the most benevolent leader, but if you don't demonstrate competence, they won't follow you,"" said Robin, who co-wrote the forthcoming ""No Excuses.""
"
2586,UPS,"• Be real. When leaders are authentic, others will trust them and go the extra mile for them. Sometimes they'll go a lot of extra miles.

2587,UPS,"Terry Pearce, founder and president of the Larkspur, Calif.-based consulting firm Leadership Communication, points out the story of a UPS (UPS) driver who had an accident just before Christmas. Some gifts, including a painting, were damaged. He contacted the artist, drove for hours to pick up a new print and delivered it before Santa came to town. ""People get devoted to a cause and get internally invested when they know the leader is authentic,"" said Pearce, author of ""Leading Out Loud.""
"
2588,UPS,"• Give thanks. People always remember when they receive notes of gratitude, Pearce says. He knew of one person who had such a note from 40 years ago and still carries it. ""Why in the world are leaders not aware this can be used as a tool to build trustworthiness?"" he said.
"
2589,UPS,"He lauds executives who go to the front lines to pitch in and thank employees. That goes a long way.
"
2590,UPS,"• Be predictable. A key to people liking their workplace, says Robin, is that they know what their leader will do and that the boss follows through.
"
2591,UPS,"• Know yourself. Be willing to admit weaknesses and show where you're vulnerable, Pearce says. People might not agree with your views, but they'll trust that you're honest if you come clean with your shortcomings.

2593,UPS,"• Show empathy. Put yourself in the shoes of others and show that you know how decisions affect them.

2594,UPS,"The boss at one of Pearce's clients had to lay off 50 people from a workforce of 4,300. That was just 1%, but it still concerned him.

2598,UPS,"""It gives you a buffer when things go wrong,"" she said.

2599,UPS,"• Act. If you have a misstep and cause people to lose faith in you, the only way to regain their trust is to show them you'll live up to it, Robin says.

2609,UPS,"A volatile session on global stock, commodities and currency markets took a turn for the better Tuesday as Europe's major indexes staged a significant, late-day rebound.
"
2610,UPS,"The rally left Frankfurt's DAX index up 2.5%. London's FTSE 100 seized a 2.4% gain, and the CAC 40 in Paris surged 2.2%. The CAC 40 and the DAX had been off as much as 1.9% and 1.2%, respectively, in earlier trade.

2611,UPS,"The French and German markets have tended to show Europe's strongest response to the ups and downs of Russia's fortunes, due to their trading ties with the country.
"
2612,UPS,"Russia's ruble toppled as much as 10% to new lows Tuesday, following its central bank's emergency interest-rate increase of 650 basis points to 17% on Monday. When the move failed to stem the ruble's slide, global investors began to take cover in safe havens including the dollar, gold and the yen.
"
2613,UPS,"Oil also came under early pressure, partly tied to the rising dollar and partly linked with weak manufacturing data out of China.
"
2614,UPS,"But oil prices rebounded, and Russia's ruble grabbed back more than half of its early loss. Moscow's Micex index recovered from an 8% dive to end ahead 1.4%. Among Russian energy companies trading on U.S. markets, Gazprom (GZPFY) reversed a 7% dive into a 3% gain. Lukoil (LUKOY) converted an 11% loss into a flat finish.
"
2615,UPS,"Reuters reported that the turnaround was potentially linked to comments by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry regarding constructive efforts from Russia aimed at reducing tensions in Ukraine. Shortly thereafter, the White House said that President Obama was set to sign legislation imposing a new round of sanctions on Russia.
"
2616,UPS,"Part of the early dip in oil prices appeared tied to weak manufacturing data out of China, which also helped leave Asia's markets sharply mixed. Weak factory activity points to weaker demand for oil, steel, coal, copper and aluminum. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index responded with a 1.6% loss. The Shanghai Composite jumped 2.3%, possibly on speculation that the weak data will spur additional stimulus measures.

2633,UPS,"European markets already stirred by heavy pharmaceutical-sector merger and acquisition news received another jolt Thursday, on reports that General Electric (GE) was pursuing iconic French rail and energy heavyweight Alstom.
"
2634,UPS,"Alstom shares soared more than 14% on the Paris Exchange Thursday after Bloomberg reported late Wednesday that GE was in discussions with the French builder of high-speed trains and power plants.
"
2635,UPS,"The report quoted unnamed sources placing the deal at more than $13 billion.
"
2636,UPS,"Alstom denied in a statement it had received an offer from GE, promising an update on May 7.
"
2637,UPS,"The Bloomberg report said the deal was also backed by French builder and telecom Bouygues, a member of the CAC 40 index that reportedly owns 29% of Alstom. Bouygues shares gained 5% Thursday.
"
2638,UPS,"Bloomberg also said GE held foreign cash reserves of $57 billion. If applied toward such a deal, GE would avoid the tax hit that would come from repatriating that cash onto its books in America. Bloomberg calculated multinational companies had increased their foreign reserve holdings more than 11% over year-ago levels, to $1.95 trillion.

2646,UPS,"Affordable Care Act: President Obama has for a while been bragging that 8 million people have signed up for ObamaCare. But the administration still hasn't released the state-by-state numbers to back up that number.
"
2647,UPS,"You'd think that with such good news, the administration would want to put out as many details as possible, as soon as possible. But judging by previous months, the latest Health and Human Services enrollment report is now nearly two weeks behind schedule.
"
2648,UPS,"As a result, we still don't know where 2.7 million ObamaCare enrollees came from.
"
2649,UPS,"Here's what we do know:
"
2650,UPS,"The exchanges run by 15 states and Washington, D.C., have reported final enrollment numbers at least through March, and most have numbers through April 15. The combined total for these exchanges is 2.6 million.
"
2651,UPS,"For the remaining 36 states, all we have are the numbers HHS released through February. At that point, these states accounted for 2.7 million sign-ups.
"
2652,UPS,"Add the two together, and you get 5.3 million. That means roughly 2.7 million must have signed up in just these 36 states after March 1 to reach the 8 million mark. And that means enrollment in these states must have doubled in just the last six weeks of a 28-week open enrollment period.
"
2653,UPS,"To call this an incredible achievement is putting it mildly, particularly since the state-run exchanges saw enrollment climb only 62% in those final six weeks.
"
2654,UPS,"So where did these 2.7 million come from? We won't know until the HHS report comes out, which presumably could be any day now.
"
2655,UPS,"But even if Obama can account for these fantastic gains, there are still several questions that need answering.
"
2656,UPS,"First, of course, is: How many have paid?
"
2657,UPS,"Georgia says that only 48% of the 221,604 who enrolled through March 31 have paid their premiums. In South Carolina, only 59% of the 114,789 who enrolled through April 15 had done so.
"
2658,UPS,"Another question: Do the numbers account for people who dropped coverage earlier? We know at least some have been kicked off for nonpayment, and others canceled their plans for one reason or another. Is HHS netting out these losses, or is it simply adding new enrollment numbers on top of the old ones?
"
2659,UPS,"And, did the agency screen out duplicate enrollments? One broker told us that in the last month his company was encouraged to simply start a new application if something went wrong during the process, so as to speed things up. He figures 30% of the ObamaCare applications his firm handled in the home stretch were duplicates. Did these get counted in the final tally?
"
2660,UPS,"The mainstream media, unfortunately, have shown zero interest in trying to make sense of these numbers, much less independently verify them. Instead, they obeyed Obama's command to ""move on.""

Instead, they obeyed Obama's command to ""move on.""But until we get more data, and get answers to these questions, we're reluctant to accept any ObamaCare numbers put out by this administration.

2662,UPS,"When the Obama administration announced on April 1 that an estimated 7.1 million had signed up for ObamaCare by the end of March, it seemed a nearly impossible achievement. In every month before, sign-ups lagged behind the administration's original forecast by wide margins and had fallen 1.4 million behind by the end of February. In mid-March, the AP said that…

2665,UPS,"Momentum can shift quickly on Wall Street. A single trend or event sends some stocks or industries tumbling, while others get a shot in the arm and race higher.
"
2666,UPS,"Stock groups that fall into the latter category — share prices that have spiked considerably in recent weeks — feature a diverse mix of companies that range from Time Warner (TWX) and Walt Disney (DIS) to FedEx (FDX), Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Whirlpool (WHR).
"
2667,UPS,"Following are four stock groups that have made big moves over the past few weeks.
"
2668,UPS," Freight shippers: An improving economy, combined with falling oil prices, have created a positive operating environment for companies that deliver freight and packages for a living. IBD's Transport-Air Freight group ranks No. 11 out of 197 industries tracked — up from No. 49 four weeks ago and No. 117 as recently as 13 weeks ago.
"
2669,UPS,"FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) are far and away the biggest players in the group and boast IBD Composite Ratings of 94 and 91, respectively, out of a possible 99.
"
2670,UPS,"A couple of other stocks also have pretty high ratings: Air T (AIRT), with a Composite Rating of 89; and Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW), with a Composite Rating of 87. Composite Ratings factor in things like earnings growth and stock price gains.
"
2671,UPS," Media conglomerates: As recently as 13 weeks ago, IBD's Media-Diversified group languished way down the industry rankings in 157th place. Since then, the group has steadily moved higher and currently ranks No. 12.
"
2672,UPS,"In addition to Disney and Time Warner, the group includes media/entertainment heavyweights 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Viacom (VIA) and CBS (CBS).
"
2673,UPS,"Some stocks in the group have benefited from moves to expand their Internet offerings and build bigger audience bases.
"
2674,UPS,"For example, Time Warner's HBO premium channel recently said it will offer streaming-only HBO Go to consumers without cable subscriptions next year to help it compete against Netflix (NFLX). Similarly, CBS recently said it will offer its Showtime premium channel as an online subscription service and CBS News as an advertising-supported online channel
"
2675,UPS," Medical supplies: Like the Media-Diversified group, IBD's Medical-Supplies group has made a big move the past few months. Thirteen weeks ago the group ranked No. 164. It has since vaulted to No. 19. The group's shares touched a record high on Monday and have risen 19% since the beginning of October.
"
2676,UPS,"Becton Dickinson, the largest stock in the group by market cap, saw its shares spike in October after it announced plans to buy CareFusion (CFN) for around $12 billion. Shares have since moved even higher for Becton, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 91.
"
2677,UPS,"Other highly rated stocks in the group include Patterson (PDCO), which has a Composite Rating of 94; and West Pharmaceutical Services (WST), with a Composite Rating of 93.

His multiple pacts have helped to turn Huntsman (HUN) — a maker of polymers, pigments and advanced carbon and glass composites used in everything from airline seats to car parts — into a behemoth that went public in 2005. Since 2009, it's rocketed 1,100% in the stock market.…
"
2694,UPS,"Following a brief dip in October tied to the Ebola scare, airline stocks are trading at their highest point in years as the industry benefits from cheap oil prices and a growing U.S. economy.
"
2695,UPS,"One of the biggest gainers in recent weeks is Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the low-cost carrier that has made a name for itself by providing a bare-bones flying option for budget-conscious travelers.
"
2696,UPS,"Its shares have risen nearly 60% since Oct. 13, when IBD's Transportation-Airline group hit an eight-month low as investors worried that a spreading Ebola outbreak might curb air travel.
"
2697,UPS,"Spirit's stock gain compares favorably with the performance of other airlines highly rated by IBD, such asSouthwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).
"
2698,UPS,"Shares of Spirit got a lift on Oct. 28, rising 7% after the company beat third-quarter earnings views.
"
2699,UPS,"""We're very pleased with how the market is responding to our track record and growth story,"" Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza told IBD. ""People like our return on investment and growth profile.""
"
2700,UPS,"That track record includes years of solid profits despite the ups and downs of the air travel industry. More recently, the airline has run off seven straight quarters of at least double-digit sales and EPS growth.
"
2701,UPS,"Baldanza's Bonanza
"
2702,UPS,"Spirit has an all-Airbus (EADSY) fleet of 60 narrow-body planes and operates more than 280 daily flights going to more than 55 destinations in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.
"
2703,UPS,"The recipe for success is pretty simple, Baldanza says. Spirit offers cut-rate fares — about 40% lower than other airlines on average, according to Department of Transportation data — to travelers who value cost savings over all else.
"
2704,UPS,"Those travelers represent the majority of the airline market, according to evaluations Spirit conducted.
"
2705,UPS,"""Our evaluations found that when you ask customers how they pick an airline, more than half say they just want the lowest price,"" Baldanza said. ""That's more important than other features such as more leg room or in-flight entertainment.""
"
2706,UPS,"To reach those customers, Spirit offers a basic ""bare fare"" option that includes a seat and one piece of carry-on luggage. If you want anything else — even a beverage — it costs extra.
"
2707,UPS,"The company caters to passengers who order and pay for their own tickets, which basically means leisure and small-business travelers. Business-class travelers who work for corporations with large travel budgets are not the target demographic.
"
2708,UPS,"Baldanza notes that what you'll find on a Spirit flight reflects the low fare.
"
2709,UPS,"""If you are paying for the ticket yourself, you tend to be more realistic,"" he said. ""Our planes don't have as much leg room as other airlines, our seats don't recline, we tend to only make one or two flights a day from many markets.""
"
2710,UPS,"That's a compromise, he concedes. ""But what you get is the absolute lowest total price. That's why our planes are very full and why we continue to grow very profitably.""
"
2711,UPS,"Spirit keeps its fares low by keeping its own costs low, Baldanza says. ""We don't have wide-body planes, which add weight. We don't have a sales force. We don't have the kinds of things you need to have to win corporate accounts.""
"
2712,UPS,"In addition, he says, Spirit puts more seats on its planes than competitors, which means that it has more potential customers for each flight, albeit those customers are squeezed in tighter.
"
2713,UPS,"Most Profitable Airline?
"
2714,UPS,"In a recent research note, Morgan Stanley analyst John Godyn said that during the second quarter, Spirit ranked the second most profitable airline in the world based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (or restructuring) costs, or EBITDAR.
"
2715,UPS,"Airline Weekly also cited Spirit as the second most profitable airline in the world for the 12 months ended June 30, based on operating profit as a percentage of operating revenue. The Panamanian Copa Holdings (CPA) was No. 1, while Las Vegas-based low-fare carrier Allegiant Travel (ALGT) ranked No. 3.
"
2716,UPS,"Godyn reckons that Spirit can move to the front of the line based on his metric.
"
2717,UPS,"""Following a strong 3Q result, we forecast SAVE generating about 36% EBITDAR margins in 2015 — a level likely to make it the most profitable airline in the world,"" he said.
"
2718,UPS,"Spirit posted third-quarter earnings of $1.01 a share, up 28% from a year earlier and 3 cents above what analysts expected.
"
2719,UPS,"Revenue for the quarter climbed 14% year over year to $519.8 million, slightly below estimates. Revenue per available seat mile declined 0.8% to 12.45 cents as the company's load factor fell to 87.6% from 89.1% a year earlier.
"
2720,UPS,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 34% in 2014 and another 38% in 2015. Spirit shares moved to a record high above 84 on Friday, amid optimism about the effect of low oil prices on airline profits.
"
2721,UPS,"Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent recently noted that he is ""optimistic"" about Spirit's ability to continue growing profits. He cited several factors, including the company's steady base of target customers as well as ""strong capacity growth and lower oil prices.""
"
2722,UPS,"CEO Baldanza says that he expects Spirit's business model to become more prevalent in the airline industry. ""When somebody creates a better mousetrap, people copy it,"" he said.
"
2723,UPS,"Baldanza points to Europe, where about 20% of travelers fly on carriers similar to Spirit, including Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY). In contrast, Spirit carries just under 2% of the total U.S. air passenger traffic.
"
2724,UPS,"""We don't see anybody doing what we are doing yet, though over time we expect they will,"" Baldanza said.
"
2725,UPS,"Meanwhile, Spirit continues to expand its operations.

"
2729,UPS,"One thing that distinguishes IBD and Investors.com from other leading financial publications is a passionate focus on volume.IBD tracks volume for both individual stocks and the major stock indexes (see the charts on the ""What's The Market Trend?"" page, today on B8). Why? It keeps investors informed on what those numbers might mean relative to the bigger picture.Minding volume is key to tracking the behavior of hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, insurers and other large-scale investors. In the market, this behavior tells you whether smart money investors are in a buying or a selling mood — trends you want to trade with and not against.For individual stocks, volume tells you if institutional investors are moving in or out of a stock in a big way. A central concept in reading an individual stock's volume is the supply of the company shares, the ""S"" in the CAN SLIM acronym. It links directly to the behavior of leading stocks at the start of winning runs.Supply Vs. DemandThe combination of supply and demand ultimately determines price. More demand, when few shares are available, means a higher price. Weak demand and many shares guide prices lower.Two volume elements combine to set the stage for winning stock moves. The first is the average number of shares traded each day. IBD uses a 50-day average and generally considers a stock moving fewer than 400,000 shares per day to be thinly traded.Thinly traded stocks are unpredictable. The share supply is so tight that a large purchase by a fund or big-money investor can produce explosive gains. When the same investor decides to book profit or change strategy, the shares can collapse.Price also figures into this part of the equation. A stock with a healthy float, but a very low price, can be easily manipulated by large investors.Sticking to stocks with dollar volumes above, say, $20 million each day helps to minimize this risk. A stock that trades at 50 and averages 400,000 shares a day has a dollar volume of $20 million. So does a stock trading 850,000 shares around 23.50, or one priced at 80 and moving 250,000 shares.The second key element in a stock's share supply links to its chart pattern. Base patterns, such as the cup with handle, outline a transition in stock ownership. The left side of the base forms as some large investors exit the stock. This distribution puts more shares on the market, increases the readily available supply and sends the price lower.The right side of the base forms as new funds and smart money investors build positions. This accumulation tightens supply, forcing prices higher. A handle is the final act of this play, when the price drifts lower in quiet trade, shaking out the final few disgruntled investors who want to exit the stock.When the handle forms, it is not a point of equilibrium in supply and demand. In a winning stock, demand outweighs supply, but incoming investors are paused, waiting to see whether the price might drift lower and give them a better entry price.When they move to add to positions at the handle's lower price, the constrained supply forces the stock to go above the buy point. Buyers rush to get on board before the stock steps up to a new level. Trading volume surges. A breakout is born.

2730,UPS,"The term creative destruction is thrown around a lot, but Amazon truly ushered in a new industry while disrupting several others. It wrote the book on e-commerce, spreading from its bookselling roots into a behemoth that brought down brick-and-mortar rivals with superior service and execution, to linking new and unlikely businesses in novel ways. 
"
2731,UPS,"Amazon (AMZN), founded in 1994 by CEO Jeff Bezos in his garage, started as an online bookseller and sold its first book in July 1995. Customers could get rare books they couldn't find anywhere else and current titles more cheaply than from rivals.

2735,UPS,"Building The Brand
"
2736,UPS,"Amazon wasn't making money — but that was the plan. Bezos realized from the start that building the brand, infrastructure and market share was crucial, so his strategy was to forgo profits for years.
"
2737,UPS,"""There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time,"" Bezos told Inc. magazine in 1997. ""But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.""

"
2750,UPS,"Amazon's online reviews gave users the chance to rate and describe products that gave other potential customers the sense they were feeling out the product before buying it.

The move still puts pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers to adapt.

"
2779,UPS,"But despite its continued long-term focus, Amazon delivered strong profit growth in 2013. And analysts expect triple-digit EPS gains over the next three years.The term creative destruction is thrown around a lot, but Amazon truly ushered in a new industry while disrupting several others. It wrote the book on e-commerce, spreading from its bookselling roots into a behemoth that brought down brick-and-mortar rivals with superior service and execution, to linking new and unlikely businesses in novel ways. Amazon (AMZN), founded in 1994 by CEO Jeff Bezos in his garage, started as an online bookseller and sold its first book in July 1995. Customers could get rare books they couldn't find anywhere else and current titles more cheaply than from rivals.The e-commerce firm expanded into electronics, toys, music and home improvement products and went public in 1997.Amazon sales exploded from well under $1 million in 1995 to $2.76 billion in 2000 and $74.5 billion last year.Shares leapt 8,526% from their 1997 low to their initial December 1999 peak.Building The BrandAmazon wasn't making money — but that was the plan. Bezos realized from the start that building the brand, infrastructure and market share was crucial, so his strategy was to forgo profits for years.""There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time,"" Bezos told Inc. magazine in 1997. ""But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.""While Bezos is hailed as a visionary now, nobody wanted to hear about money-losing Internet companies after the dot-com bust. Losses continued to mount while sales growth slowed to 13% in 2011.Shares crashed 95% from December 1999 to October 2001.In 2000, Ronald Unkefer, CEO of West Coast electronics retailer Good Guys, told IBD that he wasn't worried about Amazon, saying that Amazon and consumer electronics don't mix.But Amazon sales growth ramped back up and the company soon became profitable.Within a few years, Good Guys was out of business, followed by Circuit City and bookseller Borders. Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Best Buy (BBY) are often derided as de facto Amazon showrooms and are still trying to adapt. In February, Best Buy's CEO said his company was an ""online first"" retailer.Amazon shares rose 7,306% from their 2001 low to their March 2014 peak — or 31,050% for their entire run.The key to Amazon's success was in creating a no-hassle, no-worry experience, building trust with customers in the new realm of online shopping.""Amazon looks like a highly efficient company today,"" Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told IBD.

2801,UPS,"Official ObamaCare enrollment data got a thorough dental cleaning on Thursday. Apparently, no one had flossed the data in some time, because a chunk of nearly 400,000 stowaways came flying out and slimed the Obama administration's credibility. Yuck!
"
2802,UPS,"Republican House investigators discovered, and Bloomberg News reported, that the latest numbers on people with health coverage via ObamaCare's federal- and state-operated exchanges were inflated by the addition of 380,000 people who had signed up for dental plans. The Department of Health and Human Services later acknowledged the error, even expressing shock and dismay.
"
2803,UPS,"Whether the error was the result of carelessness or, rather, a deliberate effort to keep the enrollment number levitating above the 7 million goal set in the fall of 2013, the revelation didn't come as a great surprise to IBD. We've been reporting that the paid enrollment data reported separately by a number of states cast doubt on the accuracy of HHS data.
"
2804,UPS,"Now we've learned the truth — 6.7 million people were paid up as of mid-October, about 16% less than the 8 million sign-ups that the administration celebrated back in the spring. Now, everyone will start to focus on how many people will sign up during the second enrollment period, which just launched. But there's another, more immediate question that is also quite interesting: How many people will bother to pay their premiums in December?
"
2805,UPS,"It's unclear that this number will ever be reported, but there is good reason to suspect that people will take advantage of ObamaCare's rules to skip their final payment of the year without consequence.
"
2806,UPS,"Under ObamaCare's 90-day grace period, insurers must pay all claims for an enrollee for the first month after a payment due date is missed. For policyholders who aren't close to meeting their deductible, there is not risk in not paying their December bill and waiting to see if they have a costly medical emergency during the month.
"
2807,UPS,"The other factor that could lead people to take a free ride during the last month of the year is that many of the low-cost policies on various state exchanges have seen significant price hikes, while other competitors have taken over as the lowest-cost provider. As a result, people shopping for bargains may consider switching plans and leaving their old provider in the lurch for December.
"
2808,UPS,"Insurers have been worried about this. In a rate filing in Connecticut, for example, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield said that it expected 15% of enrollees to skip out on one month's payment.

""They had both ordered perfume, so presumably you can't give your girl perfume after Christmas.""Bad weather also hurt deliveries, UPS spokeswoman Natalie Black told Reuters on Wednesday. UPS projected 132 million deliveries last week ""and obviously we exceeded that,"" Black told Reuters, without disclosing a figure.Amazon said it would refund shipping charges for all late deliveries and give those affected $20 gift cards.'Decent Holiday Season'The numbers indicate that the cybersales growth engine remains intact, says Will Devlin, senior marketing manager for ShopVisible.""It was a decent holiday season overall for our clients, and that is pretty much in line with what we have seen from other reports out there,"" Devlin said.Mobile devices accounted for nearly half of all online traffic on Christmas Day, a record, says Jay Henderson, strategy director for IBM Smarter Commerce.""As people winded down their conversations with family, they pulled out their mobile devices and were thinking about what items they might return, or were looking for some post-Christmas deals,"" he said.More than 1 million consumers worldwide signed up for Amazon.com's Amazon Prime loyalty program in the third week of December, the No. 1 etailer said Thursday. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime provides free two-day shipping and other perks.""The entire 2013 holiday season was the best ever for Amazon,"" the company said in a release.Traffic growth at online seller Overstock.com is up 10% this holiday season, which CEO Byrne says equates to bigger growth.""That is fine for us because we are getting more revenue out of each visitor,"" he said. ""We are getting better conversions and a higher average order size.""Sales at Wayfair.com, an online retailer of home goods, jumped 50% from Nov. 1 through Christmas Day vs. the year-earlier periond, says CEO Niraj Shah.""It wasn't a great holiday season for everybody, but I think you're going to see that e-commerce was the stand-out success,"" Shah said.NoMoreRack.com also reports a big holiday season, with sales of $144.1 million from Oct. 15 through Dec. 25, up 180% from the year-earlier period. Its Christmas Day sales rose 108% to $762,651, says company CEO Deepak Agarwal. ""The holiday shopping season was extremely strong for us,"" he said.

2921,UPS,"Enrollment: ObamaCare loyalists are trumpeting a new Kaiser Family Foundation survey finding that more than half of those who enrolled had been uninsured. But the survey's findings are nothing to cheer about.First, nobody knows exactly how many ObamaCare enrollees were previously uninsured, because the administration didn't bother to ask for that information when people signed up. So it's been up to pollsters to figure out what happened, and previous surveys showed that only a small percentage of ObamaCare sign-ups came from the ranks of the uninsured.The new Kaiser survey, in contrast, found that 57% of those getting coverage through an ObamaCare exchange had lacked insurance. But this number isn't nearly as glowing as it first appears.First, it's bloated. The survey asked whether those signing up had been uninsured at the time they enrolled. Turns out almost 1-in-10 of those listed as ""uninsured"" had, in fact, lacked coverage for less than three months — presumably thanks to ObamaCare itself. And nearly a quarter had been uninsured for less than a year.Also, 29% of those uninsured said they would have gotten insurance anyway, even without ObamaCare. The number also doesn't factor in those who dropped insurance once they got a look at ObamaCare rates.Even if the Kaiser number is right, it's underwhelming. The Congressional Budget Office forecast 6 million would gain insurance through the exchanges this year. The Kaiser survey suggests it's more like 4 million.And remember how Obama promised that everyone would love ObamaCare because the benefits were so wonderful? Turns out that's not true, either.The Kaiser survey found those forced to switch plans have far more negative views of ObamaCare than the general public — with 53% expressing an unfavorable view vs. 46% of the public overall. And 57% of those who had their coverage canceled because of ObamaCare say they've been negatively affected by the law.No wonder, since more than half ended up paying the same or more for ObamaCare plans than what they had, though they often came with higher deductibles, less coverage, fewer choices of doctors, and offered no better financial protection.The Kaiser survey also found that nearly half of those getting government subsidies through the exchanges don't even know they're on the government dole. An official HHS report says 87% of those enrolled in the federal exchange are getting government subsidies to hold down the cost of ObamaCare coverage, but only 46% told Kaiser they were. Even so, 43% of those enrolled in ObamaCare-compliant plans say they find paying their premiums ""difficult.""Also largely overlooked in all the glowing coverage is that far more people ended up moving from employer-based coverage to the exchanges than the government expected. The CBO figured that in the first year, ObamaCare would have a negligible impact, if any, on those who had been getting coverage through an employer.But the Kaiser survey found 14% of those enrolled in an ObamaCare exchange had employer or COBRA coverage before. Using the White House's enrollment numbers, that works out to more than 1 million workers.In the end, the Kaiser survey doesn't change any of the central complaints we have with ObamaCare.The only reason it looks good is because supporters keep lowering the bar for what constitutes success.

2959,UPS,"Budget Busting: The administration is bragging about its finding that ObamaCare's subsidized insurance policies are really affordable. But the same report shows they won't be affordable to those who must pay for the subsidies.The Health and Human Services report, released this week, claims that of the 5.4 million people who enrolled in ObamaCare through the federal HealthCare.gov site, 4.7 million got tax subsidies to offset the cost of their premiums.It goes on to say that once you factor in the subsidy, the average premium was $82 a month. ""Consumers have more choices, and they're paying less for their premiums,"" boasted new HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell.That claim itself is dubious. Even with the subsidies, ObamaCare is hardly cheap.For example, a young person making $22,980 would pay up to $1,450 for an ObamaCare ""silver"" plan after subsidies. But that same person would likely have been eligible for cheaper rates before ObamaCare, without any tax subsidies.The report also glosses over the fact that the average unsubsidized premium sold in the 36 federal exchanges was more than $4,000 a year.When you factor in higher deductibles, bigger co-pays and strict limits on access to providers that most of these ObamaCare plans impose, the real cost is higher still.After looking over the HHS report, Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, concluded that while ObamaCare might be a bargain for low-income families who can get private insurance for very little money, it's ""not attractive to working-class and middle-class families and individuals.""The other fact conveniently left out of the HHS report is that the cost of ObamaCare to taxpayers is far higher than expected.Early last year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that ObamaCare's tax credits would cost $15 billion in its first year. One year later, it had cut that number down to $13 billion, and then lowered it again in April to $10 billion.But using the administration's enrollment and subsidy numbers, it turns out that the subsidy costs just for those who signed up through the federal exchange will top $11 billion.The Los Angeles Times reports that if these subsidy numbers hold true for the 14 state-run exchanges, ObamaCare's first-year subsidy costs will climb to $16.5 billion.Some of the increase is due to the higher-than-expected sign-ups. But a big cause was the fact that a larger share of enrollees got subsidies than the CBO expected. And the average tax credit was bigger. The CBO had assumed the average credit would be about $222 a month. The actual number was $264 — about 19% higher.The Affordable Care Act is looking less affordable by the day.

"
2961,UPS,"Anti-Capitalism: You'd think that after ObamaCare's chaotic launch, premium rate shocks, subsidy foul-ups and costly ad hoc changes, the insurance industry would attack the law. Instead, it's slamming the drug industry.""Drugmakers have no straight-face explanation to justify the increasingly astronomical prices they have been charging for their medications,"" complains one of numerous public relations communications sent recently by the industry trade group America's Health Insurance Plans.The group has called drug prices ""unsustainable"" and accused the industry of ""price gouging."" The focus of the industry's fury at the moment is Sovaldi, a breakthrough treatment that can cure Hepatitis C, but which costs $84,000. These are the same complaints lodged for years by leftist groups that want price controls on prescription drugs — complaints that are at odds with the facts.The truth is that spending on prescription drugs has been virtually flat for years, climbing just 3.5% between 2009 and 2012 at a time when the nation's overall health care spending climbed 11.5%.Amazingly, drug spending accounted for a smaller share of the total health tab in 2012 than it did in 1960, government data show.Even if some drugs do cost a lot, it doesn't make sense to look at just one side of the ledger. A cure for Hepatitis C could save billions in health costs elsewhere, to say nothing of the economic gains of having these people as productive citizens.That broader perspective on drugs has been echoed in several studies. One of them, published in Health Affairs, found that each dollar spent treating congestive heart failure can save $9 in other health spending.To the extent that drug prices are a problem, the cause is largely the massive regulatory hurdles imposed on the industry, not price-gouging schemes. Insurers say they're raising a fuss in hopes that the drug industry will keep prices in check now, rather than suffer government price controls later. But it's really just trying to deflect blame for ObamaCare-caused premium spikes.By feeding the public's impression that drug prices are wholly arbitrary, it's providing fertile ground for those price controls. And not just for drugs. Soon, someone's going to use the insurance industry's same arguments to call for price controls on premiums, too.

2969,UPS,"Herro, a manager of three Oakmark funds, including $32.8 billion International , told IBD beforehand that he planned to discuss where he sees value in Europe, why his weighting is low in emerging markets and his outlook on Japan.
"
2970,UPS,"Emerging Markets
"
2971,UPS,"Another morning panel will focus on emerging markets. Justin Leverenz, manager of $42.6 billion Oppenheimer Developing Markets , told IBD he planned to describe what the next wave of emerging markets growth will look like.
"
2972,UPS,"Yet another early Thursday panel will consider whether strategic beta funds are useful or Frankensteinian monsters, combining tactics that don't belong together.
"
2973,UPS,"On an afternoon panel about protective moats, Stephen Yacktman of Yacktman Asset Management said he would discuss stable operating margins and returns on investment for names like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola (KO). In a downward-trending stock market they should hold their value better than many rivals, he said.
"
2974,UPS,"A session later on Thursday will ask panelists where their preferred global opportunities are.
"
2975,UPS,"Panelist Dennis Stattman, cofounder of $60 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund , told IBD that he likes valuations in Japan and Western Europe. Japan's easy money policy dwarfs that of the U.S. And he likes prospects for corporate earnings and stock buybacks.
"
2976,UPS,"Bernie Horn, manager of $269 million Polaris Global Value , currently likes small and midcap stocks, especially in Japan, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Many valuations in those parts of Asia remain attractive vs. stocks in developed markets, particularly the U.S., that have enjoyed large run-ups, he told IBD.
"
2977,UPS,"Many stocks in Japan now benefit from low valuations after years of economic doldrums, combined with a new government stimulus program and a post-tsunami rebound.
"
2978,UPS,"In Thailand, Horn likes Thai Oil, a stock whose price has been hurt by concerns over domestic political turmoil. The energy and transportation conglomerate's refinery lets them convert petroleum to complex, higher value products.
"
2979,UPS,"He recently added a smaller Norwegian bank, SpareBank. ""The Norwegian economy is slowing a little, but it's one of the healthiest in Europe because of oil,"" Horn said. ""So if you're going to invest in a bank that's a good value, it's better to buy in an economy that's doing well vs. one that's falling off a cliff.""
"
2980,UPS,"Horn also likes longtime Hong Kong-listed holding Guangdong Investment. ""It's a water utility that supplies all the water from Guangdong province to Hong Kong,"" he said. ""It is a lower risk, steady cash flow business.""

2981,UPS,"Friday Highlights
"
2982,UPS,"On Friday morning, T. Rowe Price's Thomas Huber and Wellington's Don Kilbride will discuss where to find attractive dividends with downside protection.
"
2983,UPS,"Also Friday morning, a panel will discuss opportunities and potential land mines in floating-rate bank loans. Eaton Vance's Scott Page, whose funds include the $14.1 billion Floating Rate Fund , told IBD that he prefers a moderate strategy that lets him harvest coupon yield — EVBLX currently averages 4.5% — with little risk to his principal. More aggressive strategies gain 25 to 50 basis points in yield annually, but they put capital at risk when the credit cycle ends, he says.What can Morningstar tell investors and their financial advisers? Plenty, judging by the registration of nearly 2,000 of them for the research firm's 26th annual investment conference, which gets into full swing Thursday.This year's subjects range from active management strategies to ""strategic beta"" — an index investing strategy that seeks to boost returns by using certain features of active management — to unconstrained bond funds, dividend-paying stocks and international opportunities.This year's gathering, which began Wednesday afternoon in Chicago, is scheduled to feature high-profile fund investors, including Pimco founder and chief investment officer Bill Gross (Thursday lunch keynote), Fidelity's Will Danoff, Ariel Investments' John Rogers and Oakmark's David Herro.Morningstar expects the conference to draw 1,914 attendees, including 1,066 advisers. Last year, 1,963 people attended, including 1,028 advisers. Information gleaned from the conference will help advisers serve their clients, including those preparing for or in retirement.Danoff, manager of $107.5 billion Fidelity Contrafund , was on a Wednesday panel that discussed how to find leaders ahead of the crowd. He said he looks for firms whose durable multiyear earnings growth is not reflected in its current price. And he looks for best-of-breed stocks — whose high returns on capital and solid free cash flow contribute to strong competitive positions.Thursday PanelsHerro's Thursday morning panel was to be aimed at finding opportunities in a market that looks fairly valued to many investors.Herro, a manager of three Oakmark funds, including $32.8 billion International , told IBD beforehand that he planned to discuss where he sees value in Europe, why his weighting is low in emerging markets and his outlook on Japan.Emerging MarketsAnother morning panel will focus on emerging markets.

2988,UPS,"It is clear that the emerging markets had a generally rough time in 2013, and that bearish mood continued into the first month of 2014. The underperformance of emerging market equities versus those in the developed world last year was actually the worst since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998.1
"
2989,UPS,"In our view, the main issues affecting emerging markets are three-fold: 
"
2990,UPS," First, the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) pulling back or ""tapering"" of its asset purchase program known as Quantitative Easing (QE) has been elevating financing costs and spurring some capital outflows.  Second, there's a fear of a slowing in China's growth rate.  Third, the rapid credit expansion in several emerging markets has posed some risks to financial stability. 
"
2991,UPS,"Of these, probably the most attention has been focused on the uncertainties surrounding Fed policy, but in our view, local risks in individual markets could be just as important. 
"
2992,UPS,"Unearthing Emerging Market Bargains The relatively good news is that the emerging markets don't appear to be getting hit indiscriminately at this stage. Those faring the worst have had a higher dependency on foreign financing, and within this most vulnerable group, those with large current account deficits are bearing the brunt of recent selling pressure. 
"
2993,UPS,"As such, we see a fair degree of divergence in performance. Some economies are more vulnerable than others. In our view, the recent underperformance of emerging market equities probably reflects mainly a growing realization that the slowdown in the largest emerging economies—China, Brazil and India—is as much structural as it is cyclical. 
"
2994,UPS,"A number of emerging markets are looking pretty attractive to us right now versus their 10-year averages. However, we think absolute price-to-earnings ratios (PEs) are not as attractive. It is important to remember that many of the tailwinds of the last decade, including very strong earnings and economic growth, have receded, and headwinds are rising. So while PEs may seem low, earnings in general are still near peak levels and forward estimates may be too high, per our estimates. 
"
2995,UPS,"South Korea: Significant Strides ForwardOur analysis is indicating that in general, emerging markets are not excessively undervalued, so bottom-up analysis when it comes to individual stock selection is critical. For example, South Korea has been a good hunting ground for us in terms of unearthing bargains at the stock level. South Korea's export competitiveness was undercut by yen weakness in 2013, but reduced competition between Korean and Japanese exports since 2008 has been an offset. We've seen a number of South Korean companies overshadow their Asian peers, including those in Japan. For example, South Korean auto firms are more sensitive to currency fluctuations, but they have made strides and now produce significant output overseas. They also target different buyers from Japanese auto makers. South Korean car exports were at a monthly record high in the fourth quarter of 2013, with the US and China being the primary major end-markets.2 
"
2996,UPS,"To its credit, South Korea appears to be focusing on structural economic initiatives rather than trying to weaken its currency to gain a competitive edge. It initiated some deregulation, outlined more financial support for small- and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups, is looking to expand the service sector to rebalance domestic growth, and is working to cultivate new innovations instead of coddling large conglomerates. 
"
2997,UPS,"Thus far, South Korea's economy has responded well to won strength, and its exporters have been increasing efficiencies and cutting costs. So, South Korea is currently an area of interest for us. More generally, if further pronounced weakness occurs across emerging markets generally, we will be on the hunt for opportunities in other places where we see a proliferation of potential bargains. 
"
2998,UPS,"China: A Wild Card China is of course the wild card for emerging markets as well as for the global economy. For two decades, China's economic growth has been turbocharged. Surging exports and intensive state-driven investment have lifted millions out of poverty and propelled China into the ranks of global economic superpowers. However, we believe the sustainability of China's old development model is now at the crunch point. 
"
2999,UPS,"In China, the more vibrant private sectors of the economy in small- and medium-sized enterprises have been typically starved of cash. The larger state-owned enterprises, as well as local governments, have meanwhile enjoyed easy access to loans, which they have often used to fund redundant projects offering low rates of return. We believe structural reforms are needed to sustain sufficient growth. But even then, most of the reform measures that the government has proposed will take time to have an effect. So the key determinant of China's growth for this year, and the next several years, in our view, will be how aggressive policy makers will be in attempting to wean the economy off its reliance on credit and investment. We believe this transition is unlikely to happen smoothly, and the risk of a sharp slowdown cannot be discounted. But we think not dealing with credit excesses would be a long-duration and potentially even worse scenario. 
"
3000,UPS,"Hoping for a ‘Long' Landing in ChinaThe fact that China has started to embrace reform is clearly good news. However, structural reforms are not easy to implement, and it will be very difficult for China to easily reduce investment as a share of economic activity. What we should hope for in China is not a soft landing versus a hard landing, but a long landing. In sum, we think China's problems are large but not yet crippling. The good news for investors is that China's leadership seems to recognize that a serious deleveraging is in order, in addition to structural reform and a shift toward a more market-based economy to more efficiently allocate capital. So the question is not really whether China will be transformed—in many ways that transformation has begun. Our focus is on how that transformation plays out, what is destroyed and what emerges to replace it, and where we will find stock opportunities as China's deleveraging unfolds.

3011,UPS,"Scandal: The pilot who flew the survivors of the Benghazi tragedy to Germany says we could have rescued those who died and that the State Department knew who was attacking as it listened to the terrorists on captured cellphones.In her book ""Hard Choices,"" Hillary Clinton doubles down on the administration's Benghazi lies, writing that President Obama ""gave the order to do whatever was necessary to support our people in Libya. It was imperative that all possible resources be mobilized immediately.""Of the terrorist attackers, Clinton, the originator of the Benghazi video lie, says:""It is inaccurate to state that every single one of them was influenced by this hateful video. It is equally inaccurate to state that none of them were.""We'd like to introduce the former secretary of state to Eric Stahl, a recently retired major from the U.S. Air Force. Stahl was the commander and pilot who flew the corpses of the four killed at the Benghazi mission — U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, information officer Sean Smith and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. Also on board were the survivors of the raid. All were taken to the U.S. military base in Ramstein, Germany.Stahl, who — like Clinton — was for some strange reason never interviewed by the State Department's Accountability Review Board, says, no, we didn't do whatever was necessary and that none of the survivors knew anything about a spontaneous protest or a video that was put forth by her and by Obama repeatedly as the cause.In fact, says Stahl, the State Department knew that night it was a terrorist attack.Stahl told Fox News' Bret Baier that members of a CIA-trained Global Response Staff who raced to the scene of the attacks were ""confused"" by the administration's repeated implication of the video as a trigger for the raid, because it ""knew during the attack ... who was doing the attacking.""The administration knew, according to Stahl, because immediately after leaving the consulate in Benghazi and moving to the (CIA) safe house, there were reports ""that cell phones, consulate cell phones, were being used to make calls to the attackers' higher-ups.""Interestingly, a Defense Department targeting memo sent to the State Department two days after the attack, and two days before then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice spread the video lie on five Sunday talk shows, listed 11 suspects: four connected to the al-Qaida affiliate in North Africa known as AQIM, and seven connected to Ansar al-Shariah, a group with ties to the terrorist network.""They knew from the get-go that al-Qaida was involved in the attack,"" said counter-terrorism analyst Thomas Joscelyn of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, ""so the idea that the Obama administration didn't know that early on, or they suspected it was something else entirely, basically is willful blindness.""Stahl also disputes the claim that we could not have mounted a timely rescue attempt. That was always an odd explanation for not trying, since at the time no one knew how long the attack would last. He says he and his C-17 crew could have reached Benghazi in time to have played a role in rescuing the victims of the assault and ferrying them to safety in Germany.""You would've thought that we would have had a little bit more of an alert posture on 9/11,"" Stahl told Baier. ""A hurried-up timeline probably would take us (an) hour-and-a-half to get off the ground and three hours and 15 minutes to get down there. So we could've gone down there and gotten them easily.""At least the administration made sure that filmmaker was locked up, as Clinton promised the parents of the dead in front of their sons' caskets.

3012,UPS,"Waste: Lawmakers have learned that ObamaCare could end up overpaying insurance subsidies by as much as $152 billion. That's more than the deficit cut Washington once promised ObamaCare would produce.Former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-Eakin on Tuesday told members of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health that ObamaCare would likely result in huge overpayments.To make his case, Holtz-Eakin pointed to the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program that works somewhat like ObamaCare in that it hands out refundable tax credits based on income. Despite its relative simplicity and the fact that it has been around for decades, the EITC overpaid $11.6 billion in 2012 — an error rate of 21%.The vast complexity of ObamaCare means an even greater risk of such overpayments.After all, subsidy payments depend on individuals' claims about future incomes, family size, immigration status and the availability of ""affordable"" coverage at work. Obama promised that all this would be instantly verified during the application process, but the administration now admits that at least 25% of sign-ups could be either ineligible for any subsidies or are getting the wrong amount.And, since the law restricts the IRS' ability to ""claw back"" any overpayments — and caps how much must be repaid — many of those who get too-big subsidies are likely to simply ignore the government's request to have that money back.Holtz-Eakin calculates that if the same 21% error rate applies to ObamaCare subsidies, it will mean $152 billion in overpayments in a decade. In other words, these overpayments could easily swamp the $120 billion budget savings the CBO said ObamaCare would produce.This is, of course, just one way the deficit-cutting claims were phony. As we've pointed out in this space many times, the CBO based its estimates on a fantasy in which ObamaCare worked exactly as predicted.But the administration has already made vast changes to the law. It delayed the employer mandate, neutered much of the individual mandate, put off cuts to Medicare Advantage, promised bigger insurance industry bailouts and so on. All of these had the effect of raising the net cost of ObamaCare.President Obama has made so many ad hoc changes, in fact, that the CBO finally gave up even pretending it can predict how ObamaCare will affect the deficit.Now if everyone else would just give up pretending this law can be fixed.

Overall sales rose 0.3% in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Excluding autos, the gain was 0.1%. Sales edged even lower without autos, gasoline and building materials. Those figures…

"
3028,UPS,"A little-discussed ObamaCare provision offers states potentially large incentives to steer about 40% of exchange enrollees into a public health plan paid for with federal dollars.
"
3029,UPS,"The basic health plan option lets states set up a public program to serve those eligible for exchange subsidies who earn up to 200% of the poverty level.
"
3030,UPS,"Because this low-income group gets the most generous subsidies, more than half of exchange subsidies for state residents could instead shift to a public health plan.
"
3031,UPS,"Minnesota is farthest along in adopting such a program, paying for its own trial run in 2014. Federal dollars start flowing next year.
"
3032,UPS,"State enrollment data show how much the basic health plan option can shift the structure of ObamaCare. In Minnesota, exchange sign-ups — including those who haven't paid — make up just 22% of the total via the MNsure marketplace.
"
3033,UPS,"By contrast, in other ObamaCare-friendly states setting up their own exchanges, 39% of new sign-ups are in the exchange, with the rest joining Medicaid.
"
3034,UPS,"New York's new budget authorized a basic health plan with a net savings — not cost — of $300 million.
"
3035,UPS,"The basic health plan has largely dropped out of the national ObamaCare dialogue since it cleared committee by a 12-11 vote in October 2009. But the provision could have far-reaching effects.
"
3036,UPS,"The basic health plan option is intended to address what some on the left have called ObamaCare's bronze trap.
"
3037,UPS,"The law offers generous subsidies to low-income households, but only if they chip in enough to buy a silver-level plan — 4% to 6.3% of income for those earning 150% to 200% of poverty.
"
3038,UPS,"The alternative: A bronze plan with a low after-subsidy premium, but a deductible that can reach as high as $6,350.
"
3039,UPS,"That's where the basic plan comes in. The idea is that states use their bargaining power to contract with insurers to offer lower-cost plans than are available on the exchange, allowing minimal premiums and co-pays.
"
3040,UPS,"Reimbursing health care providers at Medicaid rates would exacerbate access-to-care issues. New York hopes to minimize problems by setting rates in between those of Medicaid and exchange plans. However, there have been numerous reports of doctors and hospitals who say they have been priced out of Obamacare plans.
"
3041,UPS,"In most cases, the basic plan would be available to households with incomes starting at 139% of poverty — just above the Medicaid threshold. But legal immigrants with lower income who are not yet eligible for Medicaid due to a waiting period would also qualify for a basic health plan.
"
3042,UPS,"That's one attraction of the basic health option in New York, where savings from a basic health option could reportedly approach $1 billion a year.
"
3043,UPS,"On paper, the basic health plan would let lower-income people get more affordable coverage at a lower federal cost.
"
3044,UPS,"Funding for states equals only 95% of the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies (help with deductibles and co-pays) available to the people who enroll.
"
3045,UPS,"In reality, the basic health plan would likely cost the government more than the exchange subsidies. Analysts expect more people would sign up for basic health plans than exchange plans due to much lower out-of-pocket costs.
"
3046,UPS,"On top of that, 95% of available subsidies likely amounts to more than what many ObamaCare enrollees will actually get. Those who fall into the bronze trap leave up to one-third of their subsidy on the table.
"
3047,UPS,"Bottom line: The basic health plan option will tend to send extra money to states where political leaders are most comfortable with expanding government-run health care.
"
3048,UPS,"States do pay for administrative costs, which is among the factors they must consider.
"
3049,UPS,"Because the population earning up to 200% of the poverty level tends to be younger, it's possible that a basic health plan would lead to an older, less healthy exchange pool, pushing up premiums. But this analysis will differ from state to state.
"
3050,UPS,"Over the intermediate term, there's another reason that the basic health option is a big wild card for ObamaCare costs.
"
3051,UPS,"Starting in 2019, a cost curb would take effect, driving up premiums, if exchange subsidies exceed 0.5% of GDP. Yet it's not clear whether basic health plan payments would be counted.
"
3052,UPS,"If they're excluded from the calculations, which seems likely based on the law's text, pro-ObamaCare states might adopt basic health plans to help avert this cost curb. But if basic health plan funding is included, the extra enrollment driven by the low-cost plans would make it more likely that the cost curb is triggered.
"
3053,UPS,"The law has faced criticism because its subsidies, which dwindle as income rises, act as a disincentive to work more and earn more. The basic health plan is worrisome in that regard because it would mean those whose earnings rise just above 200% of the poverty level would face a dramatic increase in health costs — far greater than under the exchanges.

When those worries turn into selling pressure, Norm Boersma, chief investment officer, Templeton Global Equity Group, rolls up his sleeves and searches for bargains for his portfolios.

3060,UPS,"Norm Boersma, CFA®Chief Investment OfficerTempleton Global Equity Group
"
3061,UPS,"One of the main questions our clients have been asking us lately revolves around worries of how strong equity markets have been over the last five years. During that period, we've seen markets bottoming out in February — March 2009 and basically recovering since then. 
"
3062,UPS,"Given the performance of the market since the trough, it's not surprising that people are a bit concerned right now, and the market has been quite volatile in early 2014. But when you take a look at longer time frames, ones that capture both the decline and the upturn in the equity markets—for instance a 10-year return—the numbers are below the average historical long-term return for equity markets, which is more in the 8% to 9% range for the MSCI World Index. 
"
3063,UPS,"That offers us a little more comfort that markets are not wildly overpriced. While we are optimistic about the market, I don't think it's prudent for investors to expect average returns akin to what we saw in the past five years to occur in the next five years. Markets appear to us today to be at what we'd call mid-cycle valuations. Many markets are no longer cheap in our view , but we are seeing a stockpicking environment where we have found individual companies to invest in that have for some reason hit a headwind and been driven down by investors in price. That's where the opportunities are arising, in our view. And, for our value-driven approach, it's an environment we like to be in.
"
3064,UPS,"Recently, we have seen correlations in the markets globally starting to come down, which also benefits stockpickers, that is, bottom-up investors. In some parts of the world, conditions have stabilized and recovery has taken hold. Elsewhere, there are clearly some stresses in the market. The emerging markets are certainly one area where people have been very worried, and that is creating some selective opportunities for our portfolios. Not every emerging market, not every stock, but on the margin, we're starting to see new ideas flow onto our buy list.
"
3065,UPS,"Exploring Opportunities in Energy, and in Europe
"
3066,UPS,"The energy sector is one area that looks interesting to us. Particularly in energy services stocks, we've seen a number of potential new opportunities. Companies that have the technology and know-how to help the major integrated oil companies find the oil and take it out of the ground have a lot of potential that we think the market isn't fully appreciating. We view it as a long-term growth industry and, at this point in time, these stocks look attractively valued to us.
"
3067,UPS,"Europe is at an interesting juncture right now. In our view, the sort of ""jump up and down and get excited"" time for Europe was probably in 2011/ 2012 when the majority of investors essentially hated Europe. Nobody wanted to buy anything there, worried that Europe was going to come apart at the seams and the euro was going to disintegrate. What we saw then was one of those big valuation opportunities, which today has definitely begun to narrow. We continue to invest in Europe, particularly in the financial sector, and additionally, a few industrials and health care stocks where in general we see names trading at a discount relative to their competitors around the world. But by and large, the valuation gaps have closed to a large extent, and they don't represent the type of bargains they did a few years ago. That said, Europe still remains a focus for us.
"
3068,UPS,"China: Reasons to Be Optimistic
"
3069,UPS,"China's market has been through some ups and downs over the past few years. Within emerging markets overall, China's market is probably the one most people are concerned about right now, aside from the recent political turmoil in eastern Europe. It's not abnormal considering China had seen growth rates in the low teens in decades past, and those growth rates have, in more recent years, started to slow into the single-digits—albeit high single digits.
"
3070,UPS,"When you have those kinds of lofty growth expectations, stresses start to appear in some sectors subject to what you might call ""irrational exuberance."" Certainly, the banking system is one area in China that has grown very rapidly, and we've seen real estate overexpansion. There has also been overcapacity in a number of areas on the supply side within manufacturing in China, and one might argue there is too much debt sitting in China as well. Those are the negative issues that we think are pretty well known.
"
3071,UPS,"On the more positive side, China has a lot of wealth and the government has the ability to help deal with some of its problems. China's government controls the banking sector, as well as other aspects of the overall economy. China probably has a better level of control over its economy than some other emerging markets. In China, we are starting to see the more investment-oriented and infrastructure-oriented-type companies—the companies in the materials sector and in the energy sector—starting to come under pressure because those are the areas subject to prior overinvestment. Meanwhile, some of the consumer-oriented stocks really haven't come off that much. That's an area where investors have been feeling that growth will likely continue to be stronger. So we are starting to see a bit of a bifurcation in the market, and we're starting to find some opportunities in China to nibble at.
"
3072,UPS,"We recognize there are global uncertainties in the markets right now that will cause investors to worry at times. When those worries are enough to cause selling, as we see it, that's where the opportunity comes in. It then becomes a question of looking carefully at the individual companies and trying to sort out which are properly valued, in our view, given the issues that we know.

3076,UPS,"What Are the Risks?
"
3077,UPS,"All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Value securities may not increase in price as anticipated or may decline further in value. Special risks are associated with foreign investing, including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging markets, of which frontier markets are a subset, involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Because these frameworks are typically even less developed in frontier markets, as well as various factors including the increased potential for extreme price volatility, illiquidity, trade barriers and exchange controls, the risks associated with emerging markets are magnified in frontier markets

"
3094,UPS,"Much of the attention from the public and the press has been on who has signed up for ObamaCare exchange plans, but what happens in the off-exchange market is also important.
"
3095,UPS,"Insurers selling plans on the exchanges must group people who enroll in ObamaCare-compliant plans purchased off the exchange in the same risk pools as those buying on the exchange.
"
3096,UPS,"With at least a couple million people who are ineligible for exchange subsidies buying directly from insurers, or going through eHealth's online insurance marketplace, their age-mix and health status will help determine whether insurers need to push premiums higher to offset their risk.
"
3097,UPS,"Insurers have been slower to report the details of their off-exchange enrollments.
"
3098,UPS,"But Internet-based eHealth (EHTH), which in May released data on ObamaCare plan applications over the prior six months, seemed to offer great news: 42% of enrollees were in the key young-adult demographic.
"
3099,UPS,"A Risk Pool Of Their Own
"
3100,UPS,"Yet a closer analysis explains why the eHealth enrollment data, rather than cause for celebration, reflect a largely missed opportunity in the near term and a likely cause of regret in years to come.
"
3101,UPS,"The reason: 14% of eHealth enrollees opted for catastrophic coverage, including close to half of 18- to 29-year-olds.
"
3102,UPS,"Under ObamaCare, catastrophic plans cover a younger and healthier risk pool that is separate from the main pool comprising bronze, silver, gold and platinum policyholders.
"
3103,UPS,"The popularity of catastrophic coverage among young adults — primarily those ineligible for subsidies — is easy to understand. Department of Health and Human Services data for the 36 states using Healthcare.gov show that the lowest-cost bronze plan, on average, costs 26% more than the cheapest catastrophic plan. Yet bronze plans only cover about 5% more of the insured group's costs.
"
3104,UPS,"Setting aside this group selecting catastrophic plans in a younger, healthier pool significantly alters the profile of eHealth's additions to ObamaCare's primary state risk pools — and not in a good way. The 42% young-adult share among eHealth enrollees — an over-representation relative to their 40% share of potential ObamaCare enrollment — falls to about 34% of entrants to primary risk pools, an IBD analysis finds.
"
3105,UPS,"The risk is that as premiums rise over time, these lower-priced catastrophic policies will look increasingly attractive to the young and healthy, leaving the main risk pool older, in poorer health and more costly.
"
3106,UPS,"Premium Shift
"
3107,UPS,"A possible preview of that future came in the past week as insurers announced 2015 rates. In Connecticut, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield proposed to lower its catastrophic plan premiums by 4.8% while raising premiums for its other plans by 12.4%, the Connecticut Mirror reported.
"
3108,UPS,"The Affordable Care Act specified that all insured would be grouped in a single risk pool, but HHS regulations adopted last year effectively created a separate catastrophic pool primarily for those up to age 30.
"
3109,UPS,"The apparent reason HHS made this change, despite warnings from liberal groups like Families USA, was to make coverage affordable for young adults who earn too much to qualify for subsidies. The Obama administration judged that the downside would be limited because people can't use subsidies to buy catastrophic coverage. Yet, catastrophic coverage is already looking like a better deal for some subsidy-eligible young adults earning about 250% of the poverty level or higher.
"
3110,UPS,"Catastrophic coverage also is available to older people who qualify for a hardship because bronze coverage costs more than 8% of income. The White House extended that hardship to anyone receiving a plan cancellation notice.
"
3111,UPS,"On the federal exchange, about 89,000 people, or 12% of people signing up without subsidies, opted for catastrophic policies. Of those, 85% were age 34 or younger.
"
3112,UPS,"Overall, HHS reported that young adults accounted for 28% of 8 million sign-ups. Once the numbers are adjusted based on paid enrollment and catastrophic selections, the young-adult share may fall to 25%.
"
3113,UPS,"The eHealth data are the most detailed available on ObamaCare plan purchases off the subsidized exchanges, but they have limitations.
"
3114,UPS,"The data cover 213,000 applications submitted during the open-enrollment period, just a fraction of a few million ObamaCare policies that have been sold off the exchanges.
"
3115,UPS,"It's possible that eHealth shoppers are younger and more tech-savvy than typical off-exchange buyers, who may go directly to a big insurance carrier with whom they have an established relationship.
"
3116,UPS,"Further, the data don't winnow out plans sold in a state by carriers who aren't participating in that state's exchange and who aren't included in ObamaCare's big risk pools.
"
3117,UPS,"The risk-pooling requirements go hand in hand with the law's guarantees that coverage will be available to all at a cost that doesn't take health status into account. To further discourage carriers from seeking out the most profitable customers or shying away from the sick, ObamaCare transfers payments from carriers with below-average risk to those who take on above-average risk.Much of the attention from the public and the press has been on who has signed up for ObamaCare exchange plans, but what happens in the off-exchange market is also important.Insurers selling plans on the exchanges must group people who enroll in ObamaCare-compliant plans purchased off the exchange in the same risk pools as those buying on the exchange.With at least a couple million people who are ineligible for exchange subsidies buying directly from insurers, or going through eHealth's online insurance marketplace, their age-mix and health status will help determine whether insurers need to push premiums higher to offset their risk.Insurers have been slower to report the details of their off-exchange enrollments.But Internet-based eHealth (EHTH), which in May released data on ObamaCare plan applications over the prior six months, seemed to offer great news: 42% of enrollees were in the key young-adult demographic.A Risk Pool Of Their OwnYet a closer analysis explains why the eHealth enrollment data, rather than cause for celebration, reflect a largely missed opportunity in the near term and a likely cause of regret in years to come.The reason: 14% of eHealth enrollees opted for catastrophic coverage, including close to half of 18- to 29-year-olds.Under ObamaCare, catastrophic plans cover a younger and healthier risk pool that is separate from the main pool comprising bronze, silver, gold and platinum policyholders.The popularity of catastrophic coverage among young adults — primarily those ineligible for subsidies — is easy to understand.

3132,UPS,"A stock that gaps up is flashing a bullish sign.The gap up means the stock opens higher than any price in the previous day's range. Further, the stock stays above the previous day's high throughout the session. The result is air on the chart.The Big Cap 20 features quite a few stocks that have gapped up in recent weeks or months.Online social platform operator Facebook (FB) staged a 30% gap up in late July, then advanced strongly.In late December, the stock delivered a stingy-looking gap up. The low of the gap up was barely above the high of the previous day.Facebook slid sideways to down for about six weeks after that poor man's gap up. A disciplined investor probably would've cut losses during the choppy period.A more convincing Facebook gap up occurred Jan. 30. The stock thrust 14% higher in heavy volume. Since then, it's made three new highs. The stock's about 10% above the close of the gap-up session.Biogen (BIIB) gapped up 13% in November after finding support at its 50-day line. The biomed stock consolidated after the gap up, but is 11% above the gap-up day close.Gene-sequencing company Illumina (ILMN) has delivered a series of gap-ups since April. The stock gapped up 13% in April, 10% in July, 10% in October, and 3% and 9% on Jan. 16-17. The stock is 157% past the close of its April gap up and 18% past its most recent gap up.Sometimes a stock will move sideways after a gap up before advancing again. Other times it will advance immediately after the gap up. Cyber memory company Micron Technology (MU) did both.The stock gapped up 11% on March 22, then shaped and broke out of a six-week flat base. Later, the stock gapped up 5% on Sept. 4 and immediately began an advance. Last month, Micron gapped up 10%. The stock made a new high Monday.After consolidating in a shallow pattern for five months, Google (GOOG) gapped up 14% on Oct. 18. The stock advanced an additional 16% from the gap-up close.Google's advance came after it reported quarterly results that topped the Street's views on Q3 earnings and revenue.This is fairly common. Facebook's Jan. 30 gap up also was on strong quarterly results. The same was true for Micron Technology.Sometimes an investor wonders if he or she should buy a stock when an earnings report is near. Waiting for the earnings report — then buying fundamentally strong stocks that gap up on earnings — is probably a better bet.The problem with buying before a quarterly release is that stocks can gap down if results disappoint. Boeing (BA), a former Big Cap 20 stock, gapped down 5% on Jan. 29 on strong earnings but cautious guidance. This was the second gap down in four sessions. Selling on the first gap down on Jan. 24 could've offered some protection.

That's below last year's $1.32 and undershoots consensus estimates for $1.43.UPS also trimmed its full-year EPS guidance to $4.57 from its prior outlook of $4.65-$4.85. Full Q4 and 2013 results are slated for release on Jan. 30.Shares were down 2% on the stock market today. The company's stock rose at a robust rate last year and hit an all-time high close of 105 on Dec. 31. It's been consolidating this year and shares are down about 6% from the peak.Rival FedEx (FDX) eased less than 1% Friday.UPS added 30,000 more temps than planned as the holiday peak approached in December, for a total of 85,000, along with trucks and other equipment to meet a last-minute surge in deliveries.On Dec. 23, UPS delivered more than 31 million packages. That was 13% above the year-ago peak day and the most ever for the company.Additionally, a series of heavy storms on the East Coast and in the Midwest hampered delivery efforts, driving up costs further.The shorter holiday season didn't help either. There were just 26 shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. In 2012, there were 32 shopping days.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar .

3145,UPS,"Frank Woolworth changed the retail landscape of America by keeping things simple and staying true to his beliefs.He founded F.W. Woolworth & Co. in 1879. The five-and-dime store chain, with its distinctive gold lettering and red awnings, made him one of the richest men in America.""For more than a century, Americans shopped at Woolworth's five-and-tens,"" wrote Jean Maddern Pitrone in ""F.W. Woolworth and the American Five and Dime."" ""These stores were as American as apple pie, baseball and Norman Rockwell paintings.""It was all a labor of love, as Woolworth was quoted as saying in ""Five And Ten: The Fabulous Life of F.W. Woolworth"" by John Winkler: ""No man can make a success of a business which he does not like.""Hard work was another Woolworth staple. ""There are plenty of opportunities today,"" he said. ""Many young men fail because they are not willing to sacrifice.""Come On InWoolworth made sure to provide customers an enjoyable shopping experience at his five-and-dime stores. ""Make it a rule not to bore or annoy customers,"" he wrote to his store managers. ""Let them look around to their heart's content. Don't try and press goods on them. ... Make your customers feel at home. ... Encourage people to meet their friends in your store. Give them something free.""His strategy led to riches. The estate of Woolworth (1852-1919), according to the Watertown, N.Y., city website, was estimated at $27 million when he died — $364 million in today 's money.Also by 1919, F.W. Woolworth & Co. operated some 1,100 U.S. stores and 90 in Britain and Ireland, with annual sales of over $100 million, or $1.4 billion today.A bronze bust of Woolworth, along with seven other industry giants, stands near the Merchandise Mart in Chicago.Paul Seaton, author of ""A Sixpenny Romance: Celebrating a Century of Value at Woolworths,"" wrote of the founder's ""dogged determination, refusing to take no for an answer.""Seaton told IBD: ""To achieve his goal of a successful chain of fixed-price stores, Frank didn't just buy from wholesalers and traveling salesmen. Line by line, he traced his products back to their sources, all over the world, and persuaded the manufacturers to deal direct.""Winkler concluded that all great ideas are traceable to a ""tenacious, believing individual. So it was in this case. Frank Woolworth clung to his belief in the future of the five-and-ten"" — a term that came from his selling nothing for over 10 cents, a practice that lasted until the 1930s.In lower Manhattan, he built the Woolworth Building, which towered nearly 800 feet high and for a time was the tallest skyscraper in the world.Woolworth's personal stature was so high, President Wilson drew him to his World War I Cabinet and tasked him with the responsibility of fundraising.By 1954, the number of Woolworth stores worldwide had grown to 2,800.But in 1997, Woolworth's went out of business and was absorbed into what is now Foot Locker (FL).Woolworth was born in Rodman, N.Y. His father was a farmer who went off to fight for the Union in the Civil War, reaching the rank of captain. Frank grew up working on the farm, much to his disdain.""My youth,"" he said in 1911, ""was the worst time of my life.""Farming taught him what he didn't want to do in life. ""He hated the blisters and calluses on his hands,"" Pitrone wrote. The boy also couldn't stand working the farm implements in the cold.Frank's teachers considered him a bit of a dreamer, Seaton wrote on WoolworthsMuseum.co.uk.Woolworth would reflect years later that ""dreaming never hurt anybody if he keeps working right behind the dream.""The future five-and-dime giant might have dreamt of such an outlet after he and his younger brother Charles were laughed at in a nearby Watertown department store while pondering a birthday present for their mom. Their crime? Wanting to pay with loose change.""Frank walked out and bought a similar item in another shop where the staff were more polite,"" Seaton wrote. ""In later life, he recalled the event and how he had told to his brother that one day people would be able to buy five or even 10 items for 50 cents, and shops would give helpful and friendly service to everyone, both rich and poor.""Farm, School, BusinessAfter leaving school at age 16 to work full time on the family farm, Woolworth figured a way out. He asked his mother to send him to night school to learn book keeping.She did. With her backing, the boy escaped the farm for life in business. By age 21, he had a sales position with a dry-goods store.""In his first job fresh off the farm at a retail store, he was humble and willing to do what was necessary with effort and dedication to prove his point,"" John Compton, who worked 43 years at Woolworth's, told IBD.In 1876, Woolworth married Jennie Creighton, whom his parents had hired as his nurse when he fell ill due to exhaustion and stress. Frank and Jennie would have three daughters.He excelled especially at merchandising. The next year, the dry-goods store wound up with a pile of unsold inventory. Woolworth was tabbed to create a table display where everything was on sale for 5 cents.He did so expertly, and the merchandise sold out.Finding his calling, Woolworth decided to open a five-and-dime store and approached his family for financial backing.The answer was no. Refusing to fold, he appealed to one of his employers, William Moore, who offered him some merchandise on credit. Woolworth was in business.Down, Not OutAfter first opening a store in Utica, N.Y., that failed, he opened one in Lancaster, Pa., in June 1879.""He became convinced that his failure in Utica was ... mainly due to the poor location of his store and Utica itself,"" Winkler wrote.In Utica, he'd sold merchandise at only one price: five cents.In Lancaster, he sparked what Winkler calls the first successful five-and-dime chain in the world.Woolworth was alerted to Lancaster by a friend who gave him a glowing account of the city and reason to believe that the thrifty Dutch population would welcome his store, Winkler wrote. Two years later came a second one in Harrisburg, managed by Charles.Woolworth believed in the power of merchandising.""You don't have to bark for customers,"" he wrote a store manager in the 1890s. ""That method is too ancient for us. But you can pull customers into your stores, and they won't know it. Draw them in with attractive window displays, and when you get them in, have a plentiful showing of the window goods on the counters.""By then, Woolworth had shifted into high gear, targeting cities east of the Rockies for 10 store openings a year. A few years later, he wrote, ""I have been looking over a census of the United States, and I am convinced that there are 100 cities and towns where we can locate (five-and-dime) cent stores.""He learned early from mistakes. ""Some of my first stores failed because I placed them in the wrong part of town,"" he said. ""There's always a right location. Find it.""Said Compton: ""Woolworth never gave up. In his failures, he would regroup and try again but making sure he did not repeat the causes of his earlier failures.""Woolworth made store openings gala events. Saturday starts were preceded by Friday-afternoon receptions of prominent people from each neighborhood. Orchestras enlivened the parties.Over a quarter-century beginning in 1879, Woolworth and Charles enticed family and former co-workers to open five-and-dime stores across North America.Woolworth created a buying consortium known as the Friendly Rival Syndicate. Five independent chains pooled ideas and shared common merchandise. In November 1909, the first British Woolworth's opened in Liverpool.By then, F.W. Woolworth & Co. shares were sold to store managers, family members and suppliers.""He showed extreme loyalty to the people he trusted, helping them through difficult times and rewarding their loyalty,"" Seaton said. ""All of his first managers became directors and VPs, and became immensely rich. Staff across the organization knew him as a kindly, hard-working man who paid everyone a Christmas bonus and gave paid holidays long before this was the norm, but also a man who should not be crossed and expected discretion, hard work and loyalty ... or else!""On Top Of ItWinkler recounted how Woolworth often traveled his store circuit, dropping in unannounced — and pity ""the manager whose counters, shelves or windows were slovenly. To him, the boss seemed ubiquitous. He particularly abhorred cheap and hasty window displays, and would often jump in himself and decorate.""Seaton said: ""Frank embodied the adage 'retail is detail.'""Woolworth had a single-minded focus in putting his stores on top and didn't let setbacks stop him.""Of course you will be discouraged,"" he said of the ups and downs in business. ""But keep on.""

3149,UPS,"United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, after the market closes.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2%. Both earnings and revenues surpassed estimates and increased year over year. Strong demand for air travel boosted results.However, with rising oil prices having engulfed the entire airline industry, the prospects for United Continental seem dismal in the second quarter.Let’s look into the factors rendering such an outlook.Factors Likely at PlayHigh fuel prices are a major concern for the company in the period to be reported. Crude oil prices are currently hovering at around $70 a barrel. As fuel costs comprise a major chunk of airline expense, such high costs push up operating expenses, hampering bottom-line growth in turn. The metric is expected in the range of $2.18-$2.23 per gallon for the second quarter, much higher than $1.63 reported a year ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.22.Bedsides fuel costs, expenses pertaining to labor are also likely to hit the bottom line in the second quarter. The carrier expects unit costs (excluding fuel, profit sharing & third party business costs) to rise in the band of flat to 1% year over year in the second quarter. The company’s high leverage further adds to its woes. Its current long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) is well over 100. This compares unfavorably with its industry average of 92.6% as well as the S&P 500 index’s tally of 81.4%.However, robust growth in passenger revenues on account of strong demand for air travel is anticipated to aid the company’s top line in the second quarter. The company estimates passenger unit revenues to inch up 1-3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger unit revenues is pegged at 12.77 cents, above 11.67 cents reported a year ago.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model does not conclusively show that United Continental is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Per the proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: United Continental has an Earnings ESP of -0.70%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $3.05 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.United Continental Holdings, Inc.

3150,UPS,"Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 18 after market close.Last reported quarter, the company came up with a negative earnings surprise of 1.4% on lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. Results were hurt by rough weather conditions. However, the top and the bottom line improved from the year-ago figures.Things do not look up for the company this to-be-reported quarter too.Factors at PlaySimilar to the previous quarter, revenues at the Grain, Forest products and Automotive segments might decline in the second quarter as well. Soft revenues are likely to affect the top line and overall results.The company’s high operating expenses also raise concerns and are anticipated to hurt the operating ratio, limiting bottom-line growth.Further adding to the woes are the company’s high-debt levels. Its debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio is currently more than 100. The figure compares unfavorably with the industry’s 71.1% average and the S&P 500 index’s tally of 81.4%.Due to the headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the Apr-June period, gaining only 3.7% compared with the industry’s 8.3% rise. However, the company’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are impressive. This May, it raised its quarterly dividend per share by 15.5% to C$0.65 per share. The company is also active on the repurchase front.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Pacific is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

3151,UPS,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 17 after market close.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.2% with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Moreover, both the measures improved on a year-over-year basis. A substantial decrease in operating expenses also aided results.With the Precision Scheduled Railroading well underway, things look up for the company in the second quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that CSX is likely to beat on earnings this quarter on the back of a perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: CSX has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 87 cents per share, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 85 cents. A positive Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteFactors Likely at PlayThe company’s cost-cutting efforts are anticipated to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter. CSX has been benefitting immensely from the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, designed to improve operational efficiency, by lowering costs and optimal asset utilization. Reduced operating expenses are expected to improve operating ratio and drive bottom-line growth.Impressive performance of the intermodal and coal segments is also likely to produce better results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $476 million, higher than $448 million a year ago. The figure also compares favorably with $449 million, recorded in the preceding quarter.The consensus mark for coal revenues is pegged at $541 million. The tally compares favorably with $530 million and $503 million, reported in the prior-year quarter and the first quarter, respectively.Needless to mention, the new tax law is also expected to buoy results in the second quarter. As expected, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been aiding results since its implementation in December 2017 and the second quarter is not likely to be any different. The reduced effective tax rate arising from the slashed corporate tax rate is expected to boost the company’s bottom line in the period to be reported.However, the company’s high-debt levels remain a cause for concern.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider United Parcel Service, Inc.

This transportation company’s earnings of $1.07 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. However, the bottom line improved 16.3% on a year-over-year basis despite higher operating expenses. In fact, the 19.6% year-over-year increase in revenues to $1,948.2 million aided results. The top line also cruised ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,872.1 million.However, things seem to be looking up for the company in the second quarter. Shares of the company have gained 3.8% in the Apr-Jun period, outperforming the industry’s 0.6% rise. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that J.B. Hunt is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: J.B. Hunt has an Earnings ESP of +0.95%.

3153,UPS,"Now a literal household name, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has experienced meteoric growth since its May 1997 IPO, since which its stock price has soared an astounding 111,260%. This represents about hundred times more growth than any of its industry competitors over that same time frame. This year alone, Amazon is up nearly 43% compared to an industry average of 9.2%.With this much growth already baked into its stock price, many investors may feel that Amazon stock is too expensive and that they have missed their chance to cash in. Is this truly the case? Let’s take a look.An Ever-Expanding Sphere of InfluenceOur team reported on Thursday that shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) plummeted on news that Amazon would purchase online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move is part of the firm’s push into the $400 billion industry. While specific details have not yet been released, the idea is that the firm would sell prescription medicines online.This isn’t Amazon’s first foray into healthcare. The company announced in January that it, alongside Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), would begin “partnering on ways to address healthcare for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs.” The partnership will see the formation of an independent company, at which a top-level executive from each respective firm will take lead.Amazon also announced Delivery Service Partners on Thursday, a new program that is designed to let local entrepreneurs manage and operate delivery networks with up to 40 vans within their respective regions. The move puts firms like UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) directly in their crosshairs. It said that the move would involve “hundreds” of small businesses and ultimately result in the hiring of “tens of thousands” of delivery drivers across the country.This week, Amazon began rolling out special deals for its Prime members to Whole Foods, which it acquired in August of last year. According to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, this could double Whole Foods’ customer base. Amazon is also expanding Go, its cashier-free convenience store initiative which made its public debut in January of last year.Amazon’s sphere of influence is only continuing to expand. It is difficult to fathom that the same firm which at one point only sold books, now has a presence in retail, logistics, media production, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, just to name a few of its numerous ventures. What makes the company interesting is the fact that it continues to invest and expand into new territory, just as its recent news announcements have shown us.By the NumbersAmazon had a stellar earnings report in April, delivering first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.27 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $2.05 (168%) and representing 121% year-over-year growth. The company also reported $51.04 billion in revenue, beating our Consensus Estimate by almost a billion dollars and representing 43% in year-over-year growth.Product sales, which account for 61.9% of Amazon’s overall sales, increased 33.2% year-over-year to $31.61 billion, while service sales (which account for the other 38.1%) rose 62.2% year-over-year to $19.44 billion. This was driven largely by Amazon’s physical store presence through Whole Foods and Amazon Go. Physical store sales accounted for $7.46 billion in revenue compared to our $4.35 billion Consensus Estimate.The strong earnings report was also guided in part by strong performance in Amazon’s Web Services division (AWS), which saw revenues climb 48.6% year-over-year to $5.44 billion. The change was primarily driven by an expanding customer base, which included the addition of enterprise customers such as LG Electronics and Shutterfly (SFLY  -  Free Report). AWS now accounts for ~11% of Amazon’s total revenue and ~73% of its operating income, and holds a third of the global cloud computing services market.Investors should take note of Amazon’s 12-Month Forward P/E ratio of 101x, which is notably lower than its F1 2018 ratio of 130.4x. The ratio shifted dramatically in April, as analysts significantly raised their estimates on the back of the firm’s extremely strong earnings report.Investors may also notice that the aforementioned 12-Month Forward P/E of 101x still appears to hold a significant premium to the industry average of 23.7x. The reason why this is the case however, is because Amazon sacrifices profits in the short-term to fund its many different initiatives. This reduces earnings and thus inflates the ratio. This aggressive investment strategy is what has allowed Amazon to grow in such an explosive fashion. One good example is AWS, which was not immediately profitable as the firm created its infrastructure, but now represents one of its most lucrative divisions.The effects of Amazon’s investment strategy become clear when we look at the last five years of Amazon’s earnings estimate history, represented by the green line:Note that although earnings estimates for F1 2018 sat at $8.69 per share before April’s report, they currently sit at $12.74 per share. That Amazon’s estimates have continuously increased is a testament to analyst confidence that its various initiatives have not only already brought in results but will continue to do so.Here is another point that investors may find interesting:Although Amazon is burning through cash to fuel their operations, it has been increasing its margins consistently for the last six years. This is important because it tells us that Amazon is becoming more efficient at converting sales into actual profit. Once Amazon’s newer investments turn profitable, it will mean that Amazon can potentially continue to pull off earnings surprises as significant as last quarter’s 168% beat.OutlookAlthough investors may feel hesitant about Amazon’s current stock price, various signs point to it being warranted rather than overhyped. With a perpetually growing product portfolio, aggressive operations investment, and increasing margins, Amazon is positioning itself to dominate multiple industries at once for years to come.While nothing is certain, investors should remain aware of the possibility that should they attempt to wait for a better entry point to invest, it may never come. Regardless of if investors choose to purchase Amazon stock, they should continue to monitor its performance. As its various divisions continue to grow, an increasing number of firms will see their business models threatened.Amazon currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3155,UPS,"United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) received encouraging news on the labor front when the company inked a tentative deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — a labor union in the United States and Canada. Notably, this provisional agreement with the teamsters union pertains to the wages and other benefits of multiple employees (mostly package handlers and drivers) in Louisville.Replacing the current four-year wage progression scheme for part time workers, the new agreement calls for increases in their starting pay rate for each year of the tenure of the contract ($13.00 per hour on Aug1, 2018 to $15.50 on Aug1, 2022). In fact, all part-time employees joining UPS after Aug 1 will get the new starting rates. The deal also aims at providing increased pension benefits to its part-time as well as full-time employees.Moreover, the agreement calls for a new provision of full-time combination drivers in a bid to address concerns like excessive forced overtime and deliveries on weekends. Their pay would start at $20.50, with a maximum of $34.79 on Aug. 1, 2022. The provision also increases full-time opportunities for part-time workers.However, there is a long way to go before the deal becomes effective. We note that tentative agreements do not necessarily mean that the deal will be operational. The provisional deal inked by UPS will be reviewed and subsequently voted upon by union members, probably next month. The deal will be effective only if the voting result is favorable. In that case, it will be effective till Jul 31, 2023.With so much to look forward to on the labor front, investors will keenly await further updates on this burning issue.Zacks Rank & Key PicksUPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3156,UPS,"In a shareholder-friendly move, FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) announced a hike in its dividend payout. This, in turn, reflects the company’s intention to utilize free cash for enhancing shareholders’ returns.Notably, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 30% to 65 cents a share (or $2.60 annually) from 50 cents (or $2 annually). The new dividend, which has been approved by the company’s board of directors, will be paid on Jul 9, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Jun 25. The dividend yield based on the new payout and the Jul 11 closing market price is approximately 0.99%.Apart from highlighting FedEx’s commitment to create value for shareholders, this hiked dividend underscores its strong financial condition and bright prospects. Also, a look at the past records reveals this Memphis, TN-based company’s stable dividend payment history.We remind investors that FedEx’s rival, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report), had also raised its quarterly dividend by approximately 10% in February 2018. Following the hike, the company's quarterly dividend payout stands at 91 cents per share ($3.64 on an annualized basis).As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Shareholder-Friendly Announcement Precedes Q4 ReleaseThe timing of the dividend hike announcement at FedEx is very appropriate and comes as the company is gearing up to unveil its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 19.We expect the company to deliver solid results in the fiscal fourth quarter driven by e-commerce growth. Also, FedEx’s Ground unit is expected to perform well backed by volume expansion and higher base rates. While releasing its fiscal third-quarter results in March, the company stated that it expects adjusted operating margin (minus TNT Express integration expenses) between 17% and 17.5% at its Ground unit.Our quantitative model too shows that FedEx is likely to beat earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise..Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% as the Most Accurate estimate exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.71 per share by 2 cents.

3157,UPS,"United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) has been benefiting immensely from the new tax law. This is quite evident from the company’s bottom-line growth owing to significant reduction in corporate tax rate. In first-quarter 2018, the bottom line soared 17.4% for the same reason. Results were also aided by strong performances by the International, and the Supply Chain and Freight segments. In fact, the effective tax rate in the quarter was just a little over 19% compared with 31.8% in the prior-year quarter. Effective tax rate is projected between 23% and 24% for the remaining quarters of 2018.The reduced corporate tax rate also boosts cash flow. In the first quarter, free cash flow totaled approximately $2.6 billion. Notably, with increased cash flow companies have more cash available to fund share repurchases among other things. In February, UPS raised its quarterly cash dividend by 10%. Furthermore, it paid approximately $840 million as dividend to shareholders in the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 10% year over year. Simultaneously, the company bought back 2.2 million shares for more than $250 million.For 2018, free cash flow is projected between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. Given this bullish view we expect an uptrend in these shareholder-friendly activities.UPS’ efforts to expand globally also raise optimism in the stock. In line with this objective, the company acquired Sandler & Travis Trade Advisory Services (STTAS) in December 2017. This buyout enables UPS to provide customers with enhanced solutions to maximize their trade investments. Furthermore, UPS' decision, taken in February 2018, to broaden the reach of its UPS WorldWide Express service is customer-friendly. Following the expansion, the service can be availed in 124 countries and territories across the globe. The measure aims to facilitate the delivery of urgent shipments in markets offering high-growth potential. Furthermore, the rapid growth of e-commerce is a boon for UPS. Toward this end, last September, the company joined forces with SF Holding keeping in view that the Chinese e-commerce market is highly lucrative, offering significant commercial potential.United Parcel Service, Inc.

3158,UPS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UPS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First Quarter ResultsUPS  reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.55, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 per share. The bottom line also increased 17.4% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by strong performances from the International and Supply Chain and Freight segments.Revenues improved 10% to $17,113 million from the year-ago quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,443.6 million. This upside was driven by strong demand for UPS solutions.Segmental DetailsU.S. Domestic Package revenues climbed 7.2% year over year to $10,227 million in the first quarter, owing to improved revenues across all products. On the contrary, segmental operating profit (adjusted) declined 20.4% to $756 million due to rough weather conditions among other factors.Segmental average daily package volumes expanded 4.6%, backed by a 4.1%, 9.3% and 4.3% rise in Ground products, Next Day Air services and Deferred Air products, respectively. Average revenue per piece for the segment was up 2.6%.International Package revenues improved 15% to $3,533 million. Daily export volumes rose 12% in the quarter under review on the back of premium products outpacing non-premium products. Segmental operating profit increased 15% to $594 million as well.Supply Chain and Freight revenues grew 16% to $3,353 million. Operating profits in the segment increased 14% to $170 million in the first quarter. Segmental results were boosted by impressive revenue-quality initiatives, growth strategies as well as structural cost reductions.Other DetailsIn the first quarter, the company’s capital expenditure was $1.5 billion. Also, UPS distributed approximately $840 million to shareholders.2018 OutlookThe company expects adjusted earnings per share for the current year in the range of $7.03-$7.37, unchanged from its previous expectation.  Free cash flow is anticipated between $4.5 billion and $5 billion.Meanwhile, the effective tax rate is projected at 23-24% for the remainder of the year. Also, the company’s capex is likely to be in the band of $6.5-$7.0 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

3159,UPS,"Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, before the market opens.In the third quarter of 2017, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.4%. The bottom line was hurt by higher costs. Results were also hurt due the impact of the back-to-back hurricanes.Let’s unearth the factors likely to influence the carrier’s fourth-quarter results.We expect high costs to hurt Alaska Air Group’s fourth-quarter results as well. In fact, the company expects non-fuel unit costs to be in the range of 8.65 cents to 8.67 cents much higher than 8.45 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The increased projection can be attributed to the costs associated with the pay-related deal inked with its pilots.Increase in fuel costs are also likely to pressurize the bottom line. The company expects fuel costs per gallon (economic) to be $2 per gallon, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 and also the year-ago figure of $1.68 per gallon. Additionally, costs related to the acquisition of Virgin America are likely to push up operating expenses in the fourth quarter.However, the top line is likely to be driven by the strong demand for air travel during the holiday season. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1,684 million, much higher than the year-ago figure of $1,484 million. Alaska Air Group expects passenger unit revenues in the band of 10.69 cents to 10.71 cents in the quarter.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not show conclusively that Alaska Air Group will beat earnings in fourth-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Alaska Air Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 83 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is projected to be flat on a year-over-year basis mainly due to higher fuel costs. However, the same for sales is projected at $10.58 billion, up 8.1% year over year. The uptick is primarily owing to anticipated growth in passenger revenues.Alaska Air Group, Inc.

3160,UPS,"Shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) have gained 34%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 14.2% in 2017. In fact, the company has also outperformed its rival United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that gained only 3.9% in the same period.Reasons for FedEx’s OutperformanceThe strong e-commerce growth bodes well for FedEx. Moreover, the company reportedly experienced a highly successful holiday season which is a huge positive. In fact, FedEx outperformed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Nov 30, 2017) as well. The outperformance was driven by increased package volumes during the peak holiday season. Also, growth was witnessed across all the major segments of the company — FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight.Furthermore, we are impressed with the company's decision to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks. In June 2017, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) from 40 cents (or $1.60 annually). The  dividend hike not only highlights FedEx’s commitment to create value for shareholders but also underscores the company’s strong financial condition and confidence in its business prospects. Additionally, a look at past records reveals FedEx’s stable dividend payment history.The hike in shipping rates announced in September 2017 is expected to boost revenues. FedEx's efforts to modernize its aircraft fleet are also encouraging.New Tax Regime is a PositiveOn Dec 22, President Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cut and Jobs Act). The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid FedEx, for which the effective tax rate was 35.4% in the first half of fiscal 2018.Moreover, companies like FedEx spend significantly for capital expenditures. In the new regime, these companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, which was not allowed earlier. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly owing to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, among others.The new tax regime is expected to boost fiscal 2018 earnings per share in the range of $4.40 to $5.50 (before mark-to-market year end pension accounting adjustments, primarily due to the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax liabilities).Estimate Revisions & Style ScoreUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. FedEx scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2.5% and 3.3% upward, respectively, over the last 30 days.Additionally, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Attractive Valuation & Zacks RankFedEx is attractively valued. Going by the EV by EBITDA ratio, the stock doesn’t look expensive at this point.  The measure for the stock is 9.4, which is favorable compared with the S&P 500's 11.9. The stock’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds and the favorable readings, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. The company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) also supports our view.

3161,UPS,"Shares of the major transportation companies surged on Dec 4. The uptick was primarily due to the Senate’s approval of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades by a 51-49 vote in the early hours of Dec 2.Consequently, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the day 1.8% higher, thereby closing at 10,368.58. The Index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies, apart from the airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be considered as a true representative of the U.S. transportation division.With the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index performing exceptionally well, it was no surprise that most participants had a field day. In fact, stocks like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry gained 3.6% and 2.8% on the day, thereby hitting their respective 52-week highs of $239.05 and $123.02.Other notable gainers from railroads include — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) (up 4.4%) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) (up 1.7%) — and from airlines — Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) (up 3.5%), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) (up 3.1%) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) (up 2.1%).All the above-mentioned stocks with the exception of FedEx and Alaska Air Group carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax BillWith the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill, President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office. We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid-November. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year-end, following resolution of the differences in the two versions.As various market watchers seem to debate over the pros and cons of the tax reform bill, we expect transportation stocks in the United States to be a major beneficiary. The optimism was reflected by the buoyant performance of the sector participants in the stock market on Dec 4.Both versions propose to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20%. On materialization, this huge reduction will naturally benefit transportation stocks in the United States. Most sector participants book a significant part of their revenues, domestically. Therefore, the 15-point cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn will aid their bottom lines.The proposal aims to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate than they otherwise would’ve shelled out. Currently, if foreign income is repatriated, it is taxed at 35% with a full credit of the local levies.Capital ExpendituresTransportation stocks — mainly railroads and airlines — invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors transports and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Picture for AirlinesApart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space also are expected to be huge benefactors from the U.S. tax overhaul. The capital-intensive nature of the industry implies that the above-mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should aid carriers as well.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.In fact, most market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low-cost carriers like Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways more than the legacy carriers. This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago. Consequently, their current incomes are still being offset by prior losses. Naturally, they do not stand to be benefitted immediately (tangibly) by the tax cuts. However, their smaller rivals like JetBlue are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they were paying higher taxes till now.Price PerformanceFollowing the recovery from the negative effects of the back-to-back natural calamities stocks in transportation space have been performing well recently. Additionally, an  improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.The fact that things are looking up for transports can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last month. While the industry rallied 4.4%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 2% in the same period. With the corporate tax cut likely to become a reality, transports are expected to gain further in the coming days. Naturally, investors will keenly wait for further updates on this burning issue.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3162,UPS,"The transportation sector is riding high on first-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization, reported so far, up 20.9% on revenue growth of 8.7%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the key industry players managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts.

3166,UPS,"The Q1 earnings season has so far unfolded a promising picture. According to the latest Earnings Preview, this positive scenario is expected to continue in the remainder of the current reporting cycle. The above report also projects S&P 500 companies’ bottom-line growth of 18.3% year over year. Additionally, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are anticipated to end the period with the top line expanding 7.7%.The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the ongoing earnings season with a year-over-year increase in the bottom line. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.    One of those sectors is the Zacks Transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 19%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing companies, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with the new tax law bodes well for the sector participants.Already, key sector participants from Transportation namely, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the current reporting cycle.However, high fuel costs have emerged as a major headwind for transports in Q1. Evidently, the same has induced bottom-line contraction of the likes of Delta and the trend is likely to continue for the remainder of the season.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation space will keenly await Q1 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) , Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service, Inc.

3169,UPS,"Welcome to the fully open spigot of Q3 earnings season. It is the single busiest day of the quarter, and after the bell we will see results from GOOGL, MSFT, INTC and others. Plenty of S&P 500 companies have already reported earnings before the opening bell today, and if that’s not enough, we’ve also got tons of economic data and newsworthy financial information to get to. So let’s get started:European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi has extended the quantitative easing program that has helped foster the Eurozone back to good health. Euro buybacks, which were scheduled to have expired in December, will now taper off beginning in January and continue through September of next year.Buybacks will be cut in half to 30 billion euros per month. As a result, we see the euro fall in value, but not drop out of its range. In his statement, Draghi expressed that risks to growth in the Eurozone are “broadly based” and the economic expansion is “solid.”Initial Jobless Claims also stayed range-bound at 233K last week, up 10K from the slightly revised 223K the previous week. Continuing claims stayed even at 1.893 million. A few weeks ago, we saw a spike in initial jobless claims following the double-whammy of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but weekly claims have reverted back to the favorable 225-250K range we’ve seen for the past couple years.Wholesale inventory rose 0.3% in its latest read, while Retail inventory fell 1%. Growth via inventory increases is widely considered one of the weakest economic growth metrics, whereas drawdowns on inventory make room for new products to hit the market. Consider this report another modest positive for the current U.S. economy.Q3 Earnings, ContinuedTwitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) shares are spiking up 12% in today’s pre-market following a better-than-expected Q3 earnings report: 10 cents per share topped the 7 cents we were expecting, whereas $589.6 million in quarterly sales modestly outpaced the $589.3 million in the Zacks consensus.

Though UPS reported a $50 million cost as a result of the hurricanes, the company also raised the lower end of earnings guidance for full-year 2017.

In fact, the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) have contracted 7.6% and 28.6%, respectively, in Q3 on a year-over-year basis.Notably, the unfavorable projection for this widely-diversified sector highlights the fact it has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico). For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues.In fact, the negative impact of the hurricanes is also well reflected in the key transportation earnings reports available thus far. Evidently, United Continental Holdings had to cancel 8,300 flights in the quarter and consequently its third-quarter pretax income reduced to the tune of approximately $185 million.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines, leading to rapid increase in freight costs. Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs has hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of Q3.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 26Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q3 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) that are scheduled for Oct 26.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.American Airlines Group, headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, operates more than 6,700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe. Of late, this carrier also underwent a turbulent phase like the other airlines, mainly due to the hurricanes.Consequently, the company called off approximately 8,000 flights in the third quarter. Also, increased costs (fuel and labor) are expected to hit the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price per gallon (including taxes) is pegged at $1.59, much higher than the $1.48 reported a year ago.Despite the disruptions, the scenario with respect to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) is an improved one from the year-ago quarter, courtesy better-than-expected yields. For the third quarter, American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to grow between 0.5% and 1.5%.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter TRASM is pegged at 14.98 cents, higher than 14.73 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter yields is pegged at 15.56 cents, higher than 15.27 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016.However, the chances of this legacy carrier beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q3 are less, even though it has an Earnings ESP of +0.53%. This is because American Airlines’ Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) acts as a spoiler.In fact, our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier as well. Previously, when we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +1.41%, while the Zacks Rank remained the same.

The same for International Package revenues is pegged at $3,076 million, below the figure of $3,163 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Also, high costs are likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.According to our proven model, the chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in this quarter are less, despite its Zacks Rank #3.

These natural disasters have forced the airline to cancel approximately 5,000 flights. Owing to the multiple flight cancellations, the company expects the quarters’ operating revenues to be hurt to the tune of $100 million.Increased costs are expected to hurt the bottom line as well. Cost per available seat miles, excluding special items, is estimated to increase between 3% and 4%. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $2.00 and $2.05 in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price is pegged at $2.00 per gallon, higher than $1.93 reported in the second quarter of 2017.According to our proven model, the chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in this quarter are less. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -0.61% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) (read more: Will Southwest Airlines Disappoint in Q3 Earnings?).Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise  Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise | Southwest Airlines Company Quote  Zacks' Hidden Trades While we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

3173,UPS,"United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company posted earnings of $1.67, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65. The bottom line also increased 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Revenues improved 11.2% to $18,829 million from the year-ago quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18,190.5 million.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.We expect e-commerce growth to boost results in the soon to-be-reported quarter. The company’s impressive performance in the most recent holiday season backed by e-commerce growth should aid the top line in the quarter. In fact, UPS like its rival FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) had invested substantially to meet the surge in demand during the holiday season.Revenues at the company’s U.S. Domestic Package unit are also likely to benefit from increased package volumes. Strong performances primarily in the Deferred Air and Ground units are likely to drive segmental results. At this segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $10,117 million, higher than $9,535 million a year ago.Furthermore, the company’s International Package division is anticipated to perform well in the first quarter on the back of robust growth in export volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at this segment is pegged at $3,339 million, higher than $3,058 million a year ago.However, we expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, high package delivery costs have been hurting UPS for quite some time now and the first quarter is likely to be no different. Also, UPS is working hard to expand its presence globally. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might drag down first-quarter earnings.United Parcel Service, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Parcel Service, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Parcel Service, Inc.

3174,UPS,"Read part 1 here, read part 2 hereEveryone knows Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) makes battery-powered electric automobiles, but many are unclear about the entire range of products currently offered or coming soon from the alternative energy pioneer. So, to better understand what to expect from Tesla in the future, let’s take a look at the entire line, from the very beginning.2008-2012 RoadsterTesla’s first automotive product offering, the original Roadster hasn’t been offered for sale in almost 6 years, but its development, design and sales strategy are informative in terms of the company’s general philosophy.  From inception, the Roadster was a technological marvel.  Fully electric and blindingly fast (0-60 in less than 4 seconds), it made a big splash on the world stage, putting Tesla on the map as a serious automaker. Built on a Lotus chassis that Tesla contracted to buy only 2,500 of, 2450 Roadsters were sold to the public worldwide. Most importantly, Tesla used the proceeds from selling the Roadster at $130k to finance the development of their next, more mass-market car, the Model S.2012-Present Model SThe current Model S is what most people mean when they say “Tesla”, at least until recently.  Sleekly styled, with a simple yet futuristic interior and superior performance, it was an immediate hit, proving Tesla could build a true mass-market automobile.  Within 6 months of its introduction, Tesla was selling 5,000 Model S cars per quarter.  Bolstered by its reputation for efficiency, performance, comfort and especially status, that sales figure was north of 10,000 cars/quarter by 2015. Production has stayed steady ever since, flattening out between 11,000 – 15,000 cars per quarter.  Upgraded Model S versions with longer range per charge, better performance, and features like AWD and Autopilot self-driving assistance system have kept demand strong – and also prices high - with top end models exceeding $130,000.2015 – Present Model XWith a nearly identical platform to the Model S, but with a roomier SUV body, a hatchback and futuristic falcon wing doors (your kids can literally not bang the car next to you in a parking lot), The Model X is Tesla’s answer to the high-end BMW, Mercedes and Lexus luxury SUVs.  It has nearly the performance of the Model S, but with space for five, six or seven passengers, depending on how the buyer chooses to configure it. The Model X sells in just slightly lower numbers than the popular Model S, (10.070 in Q1 2018 vs 11,730 for the Model S) but fills a niche in the high-end energy efficient SUV market.  Similar to the Model S, the Model X starts at $79,900, but well optioned versions can easily hit six figures.2016 – Present Model 3The Roadster, Model S and Model X have all been very expensive autos.  For Tesla to succeed in the mass market, they had to make a car most people could afford and they had to produce it in large numbers.  The average new car in the U.S. costs $35,000.  It’s probably not a coincidence that when Tesla debuted a prototype of the Model 3 in March of 2016, the price point they announced was…you guessed it…$35,000.  Upgrades and options are expected to take the average Model 3 closer to $45,000, with some versions topping $50K. They immediately took 200,000 orders (accompanied by a deposit of $1,000 for each car.) At least 200,000 more followed in the meantime. That’s $400M in cash added to the balance sheet for the notoriously cash hungry company.  As we discussed in part 2 of the series, financially, the Model 3 is a make or break product for Tesla.  Coming Soon…New Roadster In November 2017, Tesla unveiled the long-rumored new generation Roadster.  Not due for delivery until 2020, this new supercar will be the quickest car ever made, going 0-60 mph in under 2 seconds and topping out at 250 mph.  It has a range of 600 miles.  And it has 4 seats!  Though the Roadster will likely not be produced in great numbers, especially with a price tag north of $200K, it signals Tesla’s willingness to continue to push technological limits – advances that are likely to trickle down into the mainstream vehicles, just as the original Roadster spawned the Model S. Tesla is taking $50,000 deposits on the new car and offering the first 1000 produced to those who pay $250,000 up front and wait two years for delivery.  Though they haven’t released specific reservation data, it’s clear this is an attempt to acquire some (interest-free) cash to use for more immediate operations in the meantime.Semi TrucksAt the same November 2017 press event, Tesla also introduced a new semi truck.  Aerodynamic, with a single driver cabin, its four electric motors will take it 500 miles on a charge, and it promises to save owners $200,000 in fuel costs over its useful life.  Tesla itself will be the first users of the big rigs, using them to transport parts from the Gigafactory in Nevada to the Freeport, CA manufacturing facility.  Over 250 pre-orders for the Semi have been taken (with $20,000 deposits on a vehicle that will cost upwards of $200,000.) Orders are already rolling in for the first production models from the likes of FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), WalMart (WMT  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report).  Tesla said in a recent press release that they are using input from the companies that have placed early orders to design features for the Semi.Model Y?Nothing has been officially announced, but it’s widely rumored that Tesla has begun shopping for supply contracts for another new vehicle codenamed Model Y.  Speculation has it that the Model 3 – level compact SUV will go into production late in 2019.Energy SolutionsAfter acquiring Solar City in 2016, Tesla has produced innovative solar energy production and storage devices, primarily for the consumer market, but also doing large scale municipal projects as well – building the world’s largest battery array in Australia in December 2017.  Their premium products include a solar roof which resembles conventional tiles but that are actually photo-voltaic cells, and the Powerwall, a home energy storage device that allows users to store the electricity produced by rooftop solar and use it at night or when the sun is otherwise not shining.  The Australia project was essentially a networked version of the Powerwall technology referred to at the Powerpack which allows large energy producers to store excess energy and release it during periods of high demand, alleviating the need to spool up coal fired power plants and preventing interruptions in service.  Audacious GoalsIt’s easy to see how Tesla’s plans fit together, with energy efficient cars and trucks than span the range from mid-market to ultra-high end, electric semi trucks for large scale transportation and shipping and solar power generation and storage solutions to power it all.  What remains to be seen is whether they can actually execute the production of all these aggressive offerings.  So far, they’ve missed nearly every production goal they’ve ever set, with Musk even referring to Model 3 headaches as “production hell.”  They’ll need to make some major changes soon to bring all these big ideas to life.

3175,UPS,"The Masters’ tagline has been “a tradition unlike any other” for years. The validity of this claim aside, the first major championship of the year at Augusta National Golf Club is unique to the rest of major sports and golf as a whole for the simple fact that it does not pursue the most money possible.Augusta keeps many of its financial dealings under wraps, but the Masters reportedly generated revenues of roughly $115 million in 2015, according to a Golf Digest report. The club also leaves millions of dollars on the table when you consider the relatively cheap ticket prices, insanely inexpensive food, and absence of online merchandise.So where does the money come from and where does all of it go?AugustaThe most basic revenue breakdown is as follows: merchandise ($47.5 million); tickets ($34.75 million); international TV rights ($25 million); and concessions ($7.75 million).Augusta pours millions and millions of dollars into the course every year. Another large chunk of the money goes directly to the players. The Masters will shell out a total of $11million in prize money this year, which is the second-highest on tour.Masters tickets, one of the largest revenue generators despite their relatively low costs, are usually won and purchased through a lottery system. But tickets always end up on secondary markets. Four day badges for the Masters had been selling for about $6,500 right up until the start of Thursday’s first-round, on various ticket sites.One of the most obvious ways that Augusta leaves money on the greens is through its now iconically-cheap food and drink offerings.Once again, the amazing concession prices at the Masters. Important Note: Today’s badge alone is going to cost you about $1,750. pic.twitter.com/DGhfsy4gJN— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) April 5, 2018TelevisionCBS (CBS  -  Free Report) will broadcast weekend coverage of the Masters for the 63rd year in a row. The network and Augusta have worked on one-year deals pretty much the entire time, and look as if they will continue this relationship in perpetuity.Interestingly, neither CBS nor Augusta reportedly make money from their relationship. This breakeven partnership is based on mutual prestige, which seems hardly enough when looking at the massive 12-year, $1.1 billion deal Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and the USGA signed in 2013.  The 2018 Masters also marks roughly 10 years since ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) took over Thursday and Friday coverage. Details about the deal aren't clear, but ESPN certainly dedicates a lot of resources to its nearly around-the-clock coverage.Fans can also watch nearly all of the coverage on Masters.com, which shows far more total hours than ESPN and CBS.SponsorsDelta (DAL  -  Free Report) became the newest official sponsor of the Masters last October. The airline’s addition brought the overall total to six. UPS (UPS  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Mercedes-Benz, and Rolex all spend between $6 and $8 million a year, but have zero signage in view on the property.This investment grants the Masters’ partners the rights to split four minutes of ads per broadcast hour, which is far less time than most other sporting events. Three of the biggest sportswear giants, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) will also all be on full display during the four-day tournament. Lastly, many of the players themselves will have a slew of corporate logos, from KPMG and other financial firms to golf companies such as Callaway (ELY  -  Free Report), all over their bodies.RatingsOf all the mystique surrounding the Masters, one thing that seems all too clear is that both CBS and ESPN hope this year’s tournament grabs better ratings.The Masters suffered it lowest TV ratings in 13 years in 2017. But this year’s event promises to be different because the sport’s biggest star, Tiger Woods, is back at Augusta—and this time he looks healthy.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3176,UPS,"You’d think that the one tech-cum-retail company without an overdependence on China would be spared at a time when Wall Street is freaking out over a trade war with the country. But that doesn’t seem likely given President Trump’s obsession with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). So, here we go-Trump After Amazon AgainPresident Trump has been beating up a Twitter storm over Amazon’s monopolistic and anti-competitive trade practices, tax avoidance and the shipping fees it pays the U.S. postal service.There’s a bit of truth in all this as well as other sides to the tale.The President has said that Amazon has achieved scale and size on the back of taxes it didn’t pay the government, so it must be forced to pay up. It’s true that Amazon earlier didn’t collect and pay sales tax, which lowered the final prices of products on its platform, giving it a competitive edge against traditional retailers. As a result, many smaller retailers went out of business while larger ones saw a drop in business.Amazon has made changes, however. The benefits of the omni-channel approach and its own size necessitated a physical presence, so today, based on its physical presence, it is a tax payer in every state. Not only that -- Amazon is now charging third-party sellers a fee for collecting sales tax on their behalf, so if the focus on taxing remote sellers increases in the future, it could actually improve Amazon’s revenue generation.    The President has also accused Amazon of paying a pittance to the U.S. Postal Service for package delivery. Here again, it’s true that  Amazon pays USPS half of what it pays FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) or United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), but Amazon only uses the service for last mile delivery, which could be the reason for the lower rate. Amazon is also building its own logistics network and it isn’t clear if it will continue to use USPS, which has struggled to survive because of other reasons. In fact, Amazon’s business helped it generate revenue growth last year.But Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which has riled Trump, perhaps because the Post has repeatedly targeted the President on governance and other issues. Trump has said that the newspaper operates as a lobbyist with a political agenda, which seems far-fetched at the outset. But when you think about it, Amazon is an utterly monopolistic business with millions of seller dependents across the country and satisfied buyers eating out of its hands. WaPo is potentially its mouthpiece with the power to trash who it likes. While there’s nothing illegal about all this, it’s enough to make you uncomfortable.For reasons that are hard to fathom, because Amazon is doing everything right, its shareholders are getting jittery, sending the shares down- Other News-Amazon in France: Amazon is shaking things up not only in the U.S. but also elsewhere. French food retailers have taken note of its Whole Foods acquisition and are prepping for a showdown. Leading hypermarket group Carrefour, which has operations all over the world has said that it will invest more than $2 billion a year to shore up its digital capabilities.Privately held Leclerc, France’s biggest food retailer by market share, reportedly launched its own home delivery service this week after talks with Amazon fell through. And Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, which owns the upmarket grocery chain Monoprix, has signed up to sell its grocery items to Amazon Prime subscribers in Paris and its surrounding areas while it works to build its own platform (the company recently tied up with the UK grocer Ocado Group plc to license its order fulfillment technology).Amazon in Brazil: The deal with Casino reportedly extends to Brazil where its Via Varejo SA unit, which includes Brazil's third-largest e-commerce operation and 900+ stores selling appliances and electronics, will now be managed by Amazon. Whether this constitutes an outright sale or not is unclear from news reports. But Casino has denied that the two are in partnership and also said that it put up for sale a controlling stake in Via Varejo in October 2016 and that the sale process is underway. Amazon has treaded cautiously in this market because of stiff competition between local players that dominate the ecommerce landscape.Sales Tax Issue in Canada: Quebec, one of Canada’s most populous provinces, is considering making sales tax collection mandatory for goods sold to customers outside the province. The financial ministry of the state estimates that online sales of goods and services to companies outside the province is resulting in revenue losses of around C$270 million annually.Moreover, foreign companies selling more than C$30K a year in taxable supplies of goods or services to Quebec consumers will be required to register for the provincial sales tax. U.S. companies like Amazon and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) will be impacted by the new law.Amazon Housekeeping: Amazon Home Assistants are a new take on its old handymen service. This time round, the company is hiring its own cleaning people in the Seattle area rather than serving as an online marketplace for handymen and consumers to meet. It turns out that the trust factor is important when people grant access to their homes and Amazon can guarantee the quality of service and security only when it employs its own people. Plus this allows the company to sell into a $16 billion services market using its own brand.RecommendationsAmazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3177,UPS,"“Seller Flex” is reportedly Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) new delivery service where the company itself will pick up packages from third-party merchant warehouses and deliver them to customers, a function currently handled by its long-time partners United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report).It sounds like a new service but the retail giant started testing it two years back in India and this year in West Coast states, per a Bloomberg report. A broader rollout is expected in 2018.We observe that Amazon shares have gained 30.8% year to date, underperforming the 51.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.The couriers could still be in use but Amazon will take the final decision regarding how a package is sent rather than leaving it up to the seller.So basically, the company is increasing its own control and reducing reliance on courier partners and third-party merchants in the process of delivering products.But Why?It appears that Amazon is seeking greater flexibility and tighter control over its inventory management and supply chain. This will help it reduce congestion of its own warehouses (by avoiding merchandise of outside sellers), make deliveries quicker and impress shoppers by better managing last mile deliveries and last-minute holiday orders.So, shoppers can expect more items qualifying for the two-day shipping program and far more growth for Amazon.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteShould its Courier Partners Hit the Panic Button?Well, we believe yes, supposing that they have read the company they have partnered with for so long. Amazon has never hesitated in doing what it believes could bring more customers under its umbrella and giving them reasons to stay. That’s part of its long-term plan and a huge cash balance and technological prowess back its implementation.While Amazon may not immediately do away with its courier partners, it is certainly reducing reliance on them and building alternatives/supplements by developing its own global logistics.And What’s Beyond That?Just as what Amazon did with its online retail platform and AWS that is offering the same platforms it built to handle its own business as a service.We all know that Amazon has been pushing its own logistics in recent years through investments in fulfillment centers, trucks and containers and its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service has been doing well. It has also bought some planes and self-designed drones that are in the works.So, if on a fine day, Amazon starts offering its logistics to outside parties, it should not come as a surprise.Zacks Rank and a Better PickAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better pick from the broader technology space would be Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3178,UPS,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have performed well so far in 2017. The stock has gained 22.4% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming its industry’s rally of 21.6%.  Additionally, shareholders of this railroad operator were in for another good news recently. In a bid to enhance its shareholders’ value, the company’s board of directors of approved a new share buyback program. The company is now authorized to buy back an additional 50 million shares through Dec 31, 2022.Notably, Norfolk Southern has been rewarding shareholders through buybacks since 2006. Following the new authorization, the total number of shares that may be bought back now stands at 225 million as opposed to 175 million earlier. In fact, the company has repurchased approximately 43 million shares for $3.8 billion between Aug 1, 2012 and Sep 25, 2017 with approximately 9 million shares remaining as of the latter date. Furthermore, the company’s shareholder friendly attitude can be discerned from the fact that while releasing its second-quarter results in July 2017, it had increased its full-year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from $800 million to $1 billion. Earlier in 2017, the company raised its quarterly cash dividend by 3% to 61 cents per share (annualized $2.44 per share).Going forward, Norfolk Southern expects its bottom line to expand in double digits by 2020 (compound annual growth rate). Markedly, the company’s decision to approve a new buyback plan is in line with the objective. We note that share repurchases benefit a company’s earnings per share by lowering outstanding share count.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNorfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation space are Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3180,UPS,"The transportation sector is riding high on second-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far are up 9.6% on revenue growth of 10%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged (read: 3 ETFs Loaded with Positive ESP Stocks).For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company – United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) – topped our estimates on both fronts. Earnings of $1.58 surpassed our earnings estimate by 12 cents while revenues of $15.75 billion edged past our estimated $15.48 billion. For the current fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $5.80–$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $5.95.The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report)) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) lagged on revenues. UNP and KSU surpassed our earnings estimate by 8 cents and 7 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $87 million and $33 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.71 at NSC trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents while revenues of $2.637 billion were marginally below our estimated $2.642 billion.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat our earnings estimate by 7 cents and revenue estimate by $24 million (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The two largest U.S. airlines – Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) – reported varied results. Earnings of $1.62 and revenues of $10.79 billion at Delta missed our estimates of $1.66 and $10.85 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.75 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 and revenues of $10 billion were ahead of our estimated $9.96 billion.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier – J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) – came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and revenues were $6 million below our estimate.ETFs in FocusHowever, strong results failed to boost transport stocks as the sector saw 2.4% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. Given this, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading over the past one month. IYT shed 3.7% while XTN was down 2.2%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a High risk outlook.IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 28% and 18% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm – FedEx (FDX) – at 13.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 46.7% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 29.8% of the portfolio while railroads, airlines and trucking round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $842.7 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of more than 342,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETF Hits New 52-Week High).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 45 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 55% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 36.4% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $176.5 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a moderate volume of around 33,000 shares a day. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3181,UPS,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into NCAA March Madness ratings ahead of Monday’s championship game. We then take a look at the money that fuels Major League Baseball, before diving into a Masters preview. Time Warner’s Turner  and CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) have seen their ratings fluctuate throughout the 2018 March Madness college basketball tournament, despite some favorable storylines. Meanwhile, MLB’s opening day has already come and gone in the shadow of college hoops. But as baseball’s popularity on a national level continues to decline, MLB is more profitable than ever. The New York Yankees are worth nearly $4 billion, and the average opening day salary was roughly $4.5 million.These big contracts come from ticket sales, as well as large local and national television broadcast deals. MLB teams around the country consistently post some of the best primetime ratings in their local markets, which is why Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and others spend billions on multi-year deals.MLB has also been on the cutting edge of streaming technology, as demonstrated by Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) majority acquisition of BAMTech. Furthermore, the league will continue its partnership with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV during the 2018 season. Shifting gears one last time, we turn our attention to the Masters. Golf’s biggest tournament tees off this week on ESPN and CBS. The first major of the year has potential to be one of the sport’s biggest events in recent memory due to Tiger Woods’ return.Still, aside from the small amount of commercial time split between Delta (DAL  -  Free Report), UPS (UPS  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), and Mercedes-Benz, the week-long event at Augusta National is known more for its lack of commercialism.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans. The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events. But some stocks are better investments than others.Zacks has just released Cybersecurity!

3182,UPS,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) slumped more than 3.5% in early morning trading Thursday, extending the stock’s recent troubles amid market-wide volatility and direct criticism from none other than President Donald Trump.Thursday’s dip comes in the wake of Trump lashing out at the e-commerce giant on Twitter, just one day after an Axios report suggested POTUS was “obsessed” with Amazon and wanted to “go after” the company for alleged tax abuses and antitrust violations.“I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election,” the president tweeted. “Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!”Amazon shares were showing signs of rebounding before the tweet, with the stock gaining about 1.6% in premarket trading. But Trump’s latest callout clearly has investors worried that the White House could target Amazon with direct policy initiatives.Of course, some critics would be quick to point out that at least some of the backlash towards Amazon seems to be misguided. The Jeff Bezos-led company does, in fact, collect at least some sales taxes from shoppers in all 45 states with a sales tax, rounding out its list with four new states in April 2017.Other would also argue that Amazon is one of the few remaining things keeping the U.S. Postal Service afloat. Wednesday’s report from Axios noted that Trump’s view of the post office “has been explained to him in multiple meetings” as “inaccurate,” and in fiscal year 2017, USPS revenue from package deliveries increased 12% year over year—making it one of the agency’s lone bright spots.Still, Amazon’s reported plans to launch its own full-scale delivery service poses a serious threat to the Postal Service, along with private delivery companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and UPS (UPS  -  Free Report).Trump’s criticism of Amazon also comes amid significant volatility in the technology sector and broader public skepticism of tech companies. Investors have been quick to ditch tech stocks over the past two weeks as users respond to renewed data privacy concerns—inspired by Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) Cambridge Analytica scandal.Ad-driven internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), have been among the most affected.Meanwhile, analyst sentiment surrounding Amazon’s near-term prospects remains mixed. Within the last 60 days, we have witnessed 17 revisions to the company’s current-year earnings estimates, with eight of those coming in positive and nine of them negative. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s annual earnings has inched just a penny higher over that timeframe.This mixed estimate revision activity has kept AMZN at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, the stock is sporting an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and promises to continue its rapid expansion this year. Current estimates are calling for earnings and revenue growth of nearly 87% and 32%, respectively, in fiscal 2018.Want more market analysis from this author?

3183,UPS,"Shares of both FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) have fallen victim to the latest market-wide sell-off. However, this recent downturn isn’t likely to scare off many value investors, and it might actually make stocks like these two shipping and delivery powers look even more attractive.FedEx and UPS have long dominated the industry that they helped revolutionize, which is now set to grow based on the expansion of e-commerce and increased demand for extremely fast shipping. The companies do face competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and others, but the two legacy giants offer both stability and value, which look even more attractive amid this newly volatile market.FedEx and UPS also seem to attract similar buy-and-hold investors. With that said, these same investors likely understand the value of a diverse portfolio. This means they might only want to pick one of these two shipping stocks.So which of these stocks is the better buy right now? Let’s take a closer look.ValuationTraditional value investors love to look at the price-to-earnings ratio to determine great buying opportunities. After all, buying a stock makes one a partial owner of that company, so investors are inherently interested in profitability.Here is a look at the Forward P/E trend for FDX and UPS over the last year:One of the first things to note here is that UPS consistently traded at a premium to FDX over the last year. But this changed in early February, when investors can see FDX jump above its counterpart. This quick transition suggests that investors have reason to believe that FedEx is worthy of a premium over UPS going forward, where they previously thought UPS deserved to be the more expensive stock.Still, investors who are on the hunt for value should consider both of these stocks, as they are trading relatively in line with the “Transportation - Air Freight Market” industry’s average Forward P/E of 13.8.PerformanceValue investors should also be interested in a stock’s recent price performance. For instance, if a stock has sold off significantly, its lower valuation might speak to a greater problem that has forced investors to flee.Check out how FDX and UPS have performed since this time last year:As we can see, FedEx outpaced UPS for almost a full year. Then, in early February, we notice a huge divergence in share price, where UPS plummets while FDX dips. FedEx was also able to recover amid the recent downturn, while UPS currently rests near a 52-week low. These moves also help to explain why investors quickly became willing to pay a slight premium for FDX.Zacks RankWe demonstrated that both of FDX and UPS are relatively intriguing picks, but the best value plays are undervalued companies that also boast strong Zacks Ranks. In this case, both stocks are once again neck and neck, as FedEx and UPS are currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks.However, the proven Zacks Rank system puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions. And this seems to give the edge to FDX.Within the past 60 days, we have seen 11 revisions to FDX’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. Meanwhile, UPS has earned five upward revisions along with seven downward revisions.With all this said, it seems that FedEx looks like the more attractive stock based on its momentum, positive analyst sentiment, and attractive valuation.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3185,UPS,"In a bid to strengthen its e-commerce portfolio, leading package delivery company FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of U.K.-based P2P Mailing Limited for £92 million. The earlier P2P offered customers unique last-mile delivery options. The company, prior to being acquired, provided parcel delivery services to more than 200 countries.P2P will operate under the FedEx Cross Border unit from now on. FedEx Cross Border operates under FedEx Trade Networks, Inc. (FTN), which has been operational since Mar 1. The decision is aimed at helping the company gain from the e-commerce boom.With e-commerce growing by leaps and bounds, it is natural that FedEx is looking to tap the opportunity. In fact, the strong growth of e-commerce is a huge positive for the company. On the back of such exponential growth, FedEx did extremely well in the holiday season. In fact, the company had left no stone unturned to cash in on the opportunity, hiring more than 50,000 seasonal workers to meet the surge in demand. FedEx’s rival United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) also saw an impressive holiday season.E-commerce Growth Drives StockShares of FedEx have done impressively well on rising e-commerce demand. The stock has gained 22.7% in a year’s time, substantially outperforming the 6.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Consequently, FedEx’s decision to boost its e-commerce portfolio through the P2P buyout seems to be a prudent one.New Tax Law — Another PositiveThe new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which slashes the corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold ) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The tax cut has primarily backed the company raised earnings projection for fiscal 2018. For the fiscal, the company anticipates earnings per share (excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items) of $15-$15.40, higher than the previous projection of $12.70-$13.30.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law now allows these companies to deduct capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of occurrence. This aspect hugely favors FedEx as it incurs substantially high capital expenditures. The company’s annual tax bill will not be significantly lower, courtesy of the higher deductions.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act might also ramp up shareholder-friendly activities (dividend payments and buybacks) at FedEx. It is encouraging to note that transportation stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have already announced dividend hikes this year.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

The upside was driven by growth across all key segments of the company.Segmental DetailsU.S. Domestic Package revenues climbed 8.4% year over year to $11,835 million in the reported quarter.

3187,UPS,"Ahead of Thursday’s opening bell, we see market futures again wallowing in negative territory, after strong Q4 earnings helped Wednesday trading make back some of the losses from earlier in the week. And, it being Thursday, we see new Initial Jobless Claims from a week ago, plus fresh Q4 Productivity results.New jobless claims fell to 230K from a downwardly revised 231K the previous week. This is lower than expected, and stays directly within the sweet spot of a healthy U.S. labor market. For the past dozen quarters or so — give or take hurricane effects and other short-term realities — we have seen jobless numbers between 225K-250K, again consistent with robust domestic employment.Continuing claims remained relatively high, however, at 1.953 million from the previous week. We have not crossed the 2 million continuing claims threshold in quite some time, but the narrative remains: fewer near-term claims and steady longer-term jobless claims have been dominant themes in the jobs market.Q4 Productivity Lower than ExpectedThe new preliminary read on Q4 Productivity disappointed, falling to -0.1% from an expected +1.0%. Granted, a pullback from Q3’s stronger 3% — which itself was downwardly revised to 2.7% — was expected, but not into negative territory. Then again, we are looking at a preliminary view of the Q4 tally, so the possibility of an upward revision in future reads is something we’ll be considering in the future.And as productivity reportedly fell, Unit Labor Costs for Q4 naturally rose — to 2% from the 1% expected. Through 2017, productivity has averaged 1.2% relative to 2016. While it’s good this figure is in positive territory, we again see that productivity and strong job growth in the U.S. (witness ADP’s 234K new private-sector jobs reported for January, following an even better 242K the previous month) not completely aligned.Again, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases its non-farm payroll results for January tomorrow morning, we’ll be keying on the Average Wage Growth number, which is expected to continue to go up, albeit very gradually. Aside from the other ways to breakdown these important labor market numbers, analysts have been looking for wage growth to take hold for, literally, years — with little to show for it since jobs figures began to notably improve.Q4 Earnings RoundupDue to the monstrous amount of earnings reports coming out both after yesterday’s close and before this morning’s opening bell, we will keep our focus to those stocks with strong Zacks Ranks:Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-based United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines, reaching $1.67 per share (2 cents higher than anticipated) on $18.83 billion in quarterly revenues, which was significantly higher than the $18.19 billion expected. Full-year earnings guidance for 2018 is in a range between $7.03-7.37 per share; the Zacks consensus previously had been for $706 per share. For more on UPS’ earnings, click here.Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #1 stock with a Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of A, also outperformed in its Q4 report, beating earnings estimates by 5 cents to $1.05 per share, with revenues surpassing estimates to $21.24 billion from the $19.70 billion expected. For more on MPC’s earnings, click here.Oil & Gas integrated supermajor ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) only managed to meet bottom-line estimates of 45 cents per share, though quarterly revenues were well out in front of expectations — $87.36 billion easily topped the $76.98 billion we had been looking for. Biggest among elements positively affecting the quarter was Conoco’s Refining & Marketing business, which zoomed ahead from $166 million a year ago to $732 million in Q4. For more on COP’s earnings, click here.

3189,UPS,"The picture that has been unfolding in the Q4 earnings season is a rosy one so far. According to the latest Earnings Preview, this positive scenario is anticipated to continue. In fact, the above report projects that companies in the prestigious S&P 500 space will end Q4 with an overall bottom-line growth of 11.4% year over year. Additionally, stocks in this highly sought-after fraternity are expected to end Q4 with their top line expanding 7.5%. Both these figures compare favorably with the readings in the previous quarter, when bottom line expanded 6.7% and revenues grew 5.9%.In fact, 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors are anticipated to end the reporting cycle with earnings growth, one being the widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector. The bottom line for this sector is projected to increase 2.6% compared to the year-over-year decline of 13.9% in preceding quarter.Transports Bounce BackStocks in the transportation space seem to be back in favour, after being laid low for most of 2017 due to multiple headwinds like the back-to-back hurricanes. Also, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) is a huge positive for the companies in this space. Notably, the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package signed into law by President Trump on Dec 22, 2017, reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%.Buoyed by the new law, various sector participants like Southwest Airlines  and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) have declared bonuses for their employees. Apart from the huge drop in corporate tax rate, the fact that companies are now allowed to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately has proved to be favorable for transport stocks as they will be able to invest toward capital expenditures considerably.String of Outperformances in Q4In line with the optimism surrounding the sector, the key players like American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) have reported better-than-expected results in Q4.Moreover, the likes of Norfolk Southern and Alaska Air Group have announced hikes in their respective quarterly dividend payouts. This signifies their financial prosperity and shareholder-friendly attitude.What Lies Ahead?Given this healthy backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q4 reports from key sector participants like United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), Schneider National (SNDR  -  Free Report), SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Heartland Express (HTLD  -  Free Report).According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.

3192,UPS,"The Q2 earnings season is in full swing with a deluge of companies reporting their financial numbers each day. The picture to have emerged so far is a rosy one with many companies reporting better-than-expected earnings per share. Moreover, the growth rate with respect to the bottom line is also a healthy one.In fact, this healthy picture is unlikely to fade, with our latest Earnings Trends report suggesting that stocks in the much sought-after S&P 500 Index will end the current reporting cycle with bottom-line expansion of 8.6%. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 4.7%.Notably, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to end Q2 in the green as far as bottom line expansion is concerned. One such sector is the highly diversified Transportation sector. The participants from this space are likely to end this quarter with the top and the bottom line expanding 9.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Both these figures compare favorably with the readings in Q1, when revenues grew 6.9% and earnings contracted 17.8%.Significantly, multiple tailwinds like an improved economy, a better job market scenario and better unit revenue trends have contributed to this bullish picture for the sector. Already, this space has seen strong Q2 earnings reports from key players like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) that have outperformed on both the fronts.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation sector eagerly await the Q2 earnings releases by major sector participants like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.

3193,UPS,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.54%. It reported earnings of $1.32, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. Earnings increased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the results were aided by the substantial increase in operating profits at the Supply Chain and Freight unit.Moreover, revenues improved 6.2% to $15,315 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,179.5 million.Let’s see what awaits the company in the second quarter.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterWe expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the quarter.  As of now, high package delivery costs have been hurting United Parcel for some time, and the to-be-reported quarter is likely to be no different.Moreover, United Parcel, like its rival FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might also drag down second-quarter earnings.Foreign currency-related headwinds are expected to hurt the quarter’s results too. Additionally, unfavorable product mix and weakness in industrial production might dampen the company’s performance.In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the 1.4% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings over the last three months. However,  the company’s efforts to reward shareholders consistently through buybacks and dividend payouts are impressive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that United Parcel will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: United Parcel has an Earnings ESP of -0.69% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.45 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Parcel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.United Parcel Service, Inc.

3194,UPS,"Shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) declined 5.1% to $236.27 on Mar 22, despite reporting better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, on Mar 20. This is the biggest one-day decline for the stock since March 2013.Why the Decline?Following President Trump’s order to levy tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports, shares of this Memphis, TN-based package-delivery company declined despite reporting better-than-expected results in the fiscal third quarter due to fears of trade contracting.FedEx’s chief executive officer, Fred Smith is also not too impressed by Trump’s policy to impose tariff on Chinese imports. Smith has stated that the measures might be detrimental to the economic health of the United States.The fact that FedEx has a significant presence in China has given rise to fears of significant revenue loss due to the weakening of trade, following the tariffs. In fact, shares of its rival, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) also declined to the tune of 3% on Mar 22.However, FedEx’s worries are greater since its exposure to Asia (including China) is greater than UPS, according to Bloomberg. We note that FedEx opened a hub in Shanghai in January 2018 to strengthen its presence in China.Apart from the trade-related fears, FedEx was also in the news after a parcel recently exploded at one of its facilities in Texas. Even though FedEx’s Ground and Freight units performed well in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, performance at its Express air-freight unit raises concerns.Zacks Rank & Key PicksFedEx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3195,UPS,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of f $1.45 that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 per share. The bottom line also inched up 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. However, results were hurt by the hurricanes.Revenues improved 7% to $15,978 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,605.5 million. The upside was driven by growth across all the key segments of the company.Things seem to be looking up for the company ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings release as well. The bullishness can be gauged from the fact that the UPS stock has outperformed its industry over the last month.  Shares of the company have gained 11.4% compared with the industry’s 9.9% rally in the period. Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsE-commerce growth is likely to aid the company’s results in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Revenues from the company’s U.S. Domestic Package unit are also likely to benefit from increased package volumes on the back of e-commerce growth. Ground products are likely to drive growth in the segment. In fact, UPS like its rival FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) had a highly successful holiday season buoyed by strong e-commerce growth, per a Reuters report. To meet the surge in demand during the holiday season, UPS hired around 95,000 seasonal workers.At the U.S. domestic package division, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $11,578 million, higher than $9,649 million reported in the previous quarter. The projection justifies our bullish stance on the segment.Furthermore, the company’s international package division is to perform well in the fourth quarter on the back of robust growth in export volumes. At this segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3,607 million, lower than the $3,364 million in the third quarter of 2017.However, we expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, high package delivery costs have been hurting UPS for some time and the fourth quarter is likely to be no different. Moreover, UPS is working hard to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might drag down fourth-quarter earnings.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that UPS is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks Rank: UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks ESP: UPS has Earnings ESP of +0.10%.

3197,UPS,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after the closing bell on Mar 20.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. It reported better-than-expected results owing to increased package volumes during the peak holiday season. Both the top as well as the bottom line increased 9.3% and 13.6%, respectively, in the second quarter.Let’s see how things are shape up for this announcement.    Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that FedEx is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of +2.20%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $3.13 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, pegged lower at $3.06. A favourable Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: FedEx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that the stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Together with a positive ESP, the combination makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.FedEx Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  FedEx Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | FedEx Corporation QuoteWhat is Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Strong growth of e-commerce is likely to boost results in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the FedEx Express (including TNT Express) division stands at $9,127 million, much above the year-ago reported figure of $6,779 million. For Ground and Freight revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $5,170 million and $1,612 million, respectively, greater than the year-ago figures of $4,688 million and $1,492 million.The new tax law, which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for transportation stocks and FedEx is no exception. With decreased corporate taxes, the company’s bottom line is likely to get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, the company has hiked shipping rates since January 2018. Notably, FedEx Express, Ground, Freight and Home Delivery shipping rates in the United States have been increased by an average of 4.9%. This move is in turn anticipated to aid the company’s top line in the period to be reported.However, high costs are likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in the third quarter. Significant investments at the company's Ground unit have been pushing up costs. Moreover, the company’s high debt-levels are a cause for worry.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider the following stocks, which have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in the upcoming releases:American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +17.50% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.11% and a Zacks Rank of 3.United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) is also a #3 Ranked player and has an Earnings ESP of +1.45%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3198,UPS,"Accenture PLC (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that a consortium consisting of AB InBev, APL, Kuehne + Nagel and an anonymous European customs organization examined and approved its blockchain technology aimed at addressing global shipping issues.The pilot project marked an effort to transition to a process where data could be shared securely through blockchain instead of physical documents, thus leading to cost savings for the industry.Per the press release, “The solution can speed up the entire flow of transport documents, reduce the requirement for data entry by up to 80 percent, simplify data amendments across the shipping process, streamline the checks required for cargo and reduce the burden and risk of penalties for customs compliance levied on customers.”Accenture PLC Price Accenture PLC Price | Accenture PLC Quote The secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the blockchain technology. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible and is meant to provide unaltered information.Since blockchain uses a distributed consensus, tampering with its records without being noticed by an entire network is difficult. This makes the system extremely safe. With minimum chances of double counting and hacking, the possibility of monetary losses is low.Driven by multi-industrial adoption, the technology has rapidly gained traction over the last few years. The solutions offered by other key players in this domain like International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) have been adopted by the insurance, banking, food supply and automobile industries among others.Blockchain in LogisticsOf late, this technology is being used in the shipping and freight industry. In November 2017, United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) announced that it has joined Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) in an attempt to form regulatory blockchain standards for logistics.In January 2018, IBM entered into a blockchain deal with A.P. Moller-Maersk, a prominent container shipping firm. The partnership is intended to deliver a secure and efficient industry-wide trading platform that will lead to more transparency and simplicity in tracking shipments across borders and trading zones.These initiatives indicate that blockchain technology might turn out to be crucial for the logistics industry going ahead.Accenture in BlockchainNotably, Accenture’s blockchain initiatives are backed by its motto of “Blockchain needs to adapt to an imperfect world”.Considering regulatory changes and human errors among other issues, Accenture is providing “Editable Blockchain” and has also been awarded with a patent for the same last year.Also, the company is a member of both Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and the Hyperledger committee, which provide the underlying technology for commonly used commercial blockchain systems. While Hyperledger is an open source global collaboration hosted by the Linux Foundation, Ethereum has been developed by a Swiss non-profit called Ethereum Foundation. This is an additional advantage for the company in comparison to Microsoft and IBM.Accenture has inked several blockchain deals in the past year. In June 2017, Accenture inked a deal with Microsoft to create digital ID databases for more than 1.1 billion people globally. Its other collaborations include Digital Asset, R2 and Ripple.  Most recently, the company announced that it is developing a blockchain prototype along with DHL to track pharmaceuticals throughout the supply chain. This will be a huge step against tampering of drugs.Accenture is expected to make the most of blockchain opportunity. The technology is projected to reach $7.6 billion by 2022 from $411.5 million in 2017 at a CAGR of 79.6%, per data from MarketsandMarkets.Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3200,UPS,"In a customer-friendly move, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) has broadened the reach of its UPS WorldWide Express Service. Following the expansion, the service can be availed in 124 countries and territories across the globe. The measure aims to facilitate the delivery of urgent shipments in markets offering high-growth potential.In fact, UPS seems to be constantly expanding the scope of this service as it is highly favored by companies for global shipments that are time-sensitive by nature. Depending on the destination, customers availing of this service are guaranteed delivery within 1-3 business days by 10:30 a.m., noon, or 2 p.m.Last year, the UPS Express Service was added to 7,000 postal codes in 57 countries and territories, including the likes of India, Brazil and South Korea.European Union Sued by UPS Over TNT Acquisition BlockadeApart from the above expansionary measure, UPS was in the news when it reportedly sued the European Union to the tune of approximately 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion) plus interest and taxes. UPS is asking for the amount to compensate it for wrongly blocking its attempts to take over Dutch delivery firm TNT Express. We remind the investors that UPS’ efforts to acquire TNT Express were thwarted by European regulators in 2013.The regulators had blocked deal citing UPS’ massive European presence. They were of the opinion that the materialization of the deal  would lead to limited competition in the European delivery market.In the previous year, an EU court had stated that it was wrong on the part of European Commission to block the deal from materializing, per a Reuters report. In fact, UPS’ decision to sue the EU was natural after the submission by the EU court. Following UPS’ failure to close the deal, rival FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) acquired TNT Express in 2016, for approximately €4.4 billion, thereby boosting its European presence.Now with UPS seeking compensation from the EU over blocking its attempts to buy TNT express, we expect investor focus to remain on this burning issue. Additionally, in the event of UPS eventually receiving the hefty amount claimed, its already strong balance sheet is expected to be strengthened further.UPS’ sound financial position can be made out from the fact that its board of directors cleared an approximately 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share ($3.64 annually) on Feb 8. Apart from UPS, other transportation companies like Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised their dividend payouts recently.(NOTE: We are reissuing this article to correct an error. The publication from earlier today, March 1, 2018, should no longer be relied upon.)The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3201,UPS,"The biggest overhaul in U.S. tax code in 30 years has been a boon for package delivery giants like FedEx Corp. (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report). The $1.5 trillion package, converted into law (Tax Cut and Jobs Act) on Dec 22, reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid the above-mentioned companies. We note that the effective tax rate at FedEx was 35.4% in the first half of fiscal 2018.Riding on this momentum, shares of FedEx and UPS that dominate and define the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo Industry, hit their respective 52-week high levels on Jan 3, 2018. While FedEx shares scaled a 52-week high of $261.57 during the trading session, the UPS stock touched its highest point of $126.69.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors companies like FedEx and UPS as they invest substantially toward capital expenditure.Naturally, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.Holiday Season – Another CatalystThe holiday season every year presents a big opportunity to companies like FedEx and UPS to boost their revenues. It is normally considered a busy period for such companies as shipping volumes tend to surge.As is the case every year, the companies left no stone unturned to shine brightly in the most recent holiday season. To meet the surge in demand, FedEx hired more than 50,000 seasonal workers this time. Meanwhile, UPS hired around 95,000 seasonal workers.In fact, according to Reuters report both these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies had a highly successful holiday season buoyed by strong e-commerce growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Dividends/Buybacks Attest Solid Financial HealthFinancial prosperity of FedEx and UPS is reflected in the fact that both the companies have hiked their respective dividend payouts in 2017. In February, UPS raised its quarterly dividend by 6.4% to 83 cents per share ($3.32 on an annualized basis).During the first nine months of the year, the company paid approximately $2.1 billion as dividend to shareholders. It also bought back bought back 12.3 million shares for about $1.4 billion in the same period.FedEx hiked its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) in June. Needless to say, as investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. To this end, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Price PerformanceShares of both UPS and FedEx have outperformed the S&P 500 Index in the last six months. While, UPS has gained 14.3%, FedEx has rallied 20%. The S&P 500 Index has gained only 8% in the same period. Will the Rally Continue in 2018?With the tax-bill becoming a law in the final month of 2017, stocks like FedEx and UPS are likely to be huge beneficiaries in 2018. The new tax law is likely to boost their share prices further in the current year.FedEx has already stated that the new tax regime is expected to boost fiscal 2018 (ending May 31, 2018) earnings per share in the range of $4.40 to $5.50 (before mark-to-market year end pension accounting adjustments, primarily due to the revaluation of the company’s net deferred tax liabilities).Furthermore, FedEx and UPS are likely to continue with their shareholder-friendly activities in 2018 due to the new tax law. Therefore, a hike in dividends from both the companies can be anticipated in the year.   In fact, the new tax regime is a positive for not only these two companies but the other transportation players as well. Evidently, Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) announced bonuses worth $1,000 per employee, following the tax overhaul.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3202,UPS,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Third Quarter ResultsUnited Parcel Service reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.45, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 per share. Earnings increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. Results, however, were hurt by the recent hurricanes.Revenues improved 7% to $15,978 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,605.5 million. The upside was driven by growth across all the key segments of the company.Segmental DetailsU.S. Domestic Package revenues climbed 3.9% year over year to $9,649 million in the reported quarter, driven by e-commerce growth. Segmental operating profit decreased 5.6% to $1,182 million.Segmental average daily package volumes increased 3.4%, driven by a 3.4% rise in Ground products and 8% growth in Next Day Air services. Deferred Air products were down 1.6%. Average revenue per piece for the segment was up 2%. International Package revenues improved 11.2% to $3,364 million. Daily export volumes rose 19% in the quarter on the back of growth in all regions. Segmental operating profit increased 8.9% to $627 million.Supply Chain and Freight revenues increased 13.4% to $2,965 million. Segmental results were aided by better market conditions among other factors. Operating profits in the segment climbed 9.7% to $226 million in the reported quarter.OutlookThe company now expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share between $5.85 and $6.10 (old guidance: $5.80 to $6.10). The guidance includes $400 million of pre-tax currency headwinds.  UPS intends to raise some rates by an average of 4.9% from Dec. 24.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.United Parcel Service, Inc. Price and Consensus  United Parcel Service, Inc. Price and Consensus | United Parcel Service, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, United Parcel's stock has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for growth, value and momentum investors.OutlookNotably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

3203,UPS,"The transportation sector is struggling this earnings season with total earnings from 97.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far down 14.2% despite revenue growth of 5.1%. This is much below earnings growth of 9.6% and revenue growth of 10% for the same period, in the last reporting cycle (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Earnings and revenue beat ratio of 69.2% and 61.5%, respectively, are also disappointing despite the fact that most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.45 surpassed our earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $15.98 billion edged past the estimated $15.61 billion. For fiscal 2017, the company narrowed its earnings per share guidance range from $5.80-$6.10 to $5.85-$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $6.00.The major railroads Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) also beat on both the top and bottom lines. NSC outpaced the earnings estimate by a wide margin of 11 cents while earnings at UNP and KSU came ahead by a penny and three cents, respectively. Revenues for the three railroads trumped their Zacks Consensus Estimate by $102 million, $9 million and $40 million, respectively.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by four cents and revenue estimate by $42 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results but the latter lagged on revenues. Earnings of $1.57 and revenues of $11.1 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 and $11.03 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.22 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 but revenues of $9.878 billion slightly fell shy of the estimated $9.88 billion (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel but revenues were $28 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusGiven this, the sector saw a 2.3% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. As such, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading in the past one month. IYT shed 1.6% while XTN was down 0.4%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) rating with a High risk outlook (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large-cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 26% and 19% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.3%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47.2% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.8% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $799.2 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 258,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees.XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 43 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 47% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 32.3% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $194.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 22,000 shares a day (read: ETFs to Buy After Weak Jobs Report).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3204,UPS,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.58 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 per share. The top-line also increased 11% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Revenues improved 7.7% to $15,750 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,477.3 million. The upside was driven by growth across all the key segments of the company.Factors Likely to Influence This Quarter We expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, high package delivery costs have been hurting UPS for some time and the third quarter is likely to be no different. Moreover, UPS is working hard to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might also drag down third-quarter earnings.Additionally, foreign currency-related headwinds are expected to hurt the quarter’s results as well. The third-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues — international package — is pegged at $3,076 million, lower than the $3,163 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Moreover, unfavorable product mix and weakness in industrial production might dampen the company’s performance.We are, however, impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders consistently through buybacks and dividends. An update on the subject will be awaited on the conference call. Also, UPS is leaving no stone unturned to perform well in the upcoming holiday season like its rival FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report). The company expects to benefit from growth in ecommerce. We expect a detailed commentary on the issue on the third-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UPS will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks Rank: UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: UPS has an Earnings ESP of -0.06%, which acts as a spoiler. The Zacks Rank combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.United Parcel Service, Inc.

3205,UPS,"Bond yields are scaling record highs on expectations of a hike in interest rate. A two-year budget deal declared by top senators should strengthen the economy giving the Federal Reserve enough reason to raise rates. A pick-up in wages sparked fears of inflation, bolstering expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates.Lest we forget, a soft Treasury auction on Feb 7 dragged bond prices down and helped yields move up. This rise in bond yields rattled the equity market, resulting in a lot of gyrations. And why not? When bond yield rises, it increases the opportunity cost of investing in other asset classes such as equities, thus, making them less attractive.Given such uncertain times, investors should select the safest of stocks, particularly those that are sound enough to withstand the intensifying volatility in the market.US Stocks Finish Lower, Bond Yields SpikeThe stock market is on a roller-coaster this week. Major bourses largely finished in the red on Feb 7 and at current levels, they stand nearly 5% below last month’s record high. The Dow shed 19.42 points to 24,893.35, while the broader S&P 500 slid 13.48 points to 2,681.66. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, in the meantime, remained at 27.73. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market. This is in sharp contrast to the fear gauge’s reading in 2017. Last year, VIX fell as low as 9.14.While stocks struggled for direction, marked by the comeback of once-dormant volatility, treasury yields continued to scale record highs. The 10-year Treasury note yield was up 7.8 basis points to 2.843% following a decline of 2.648% earlier in the week. The two-year Treasury notes rose 4.3 basis points to 2.134%, registering its largest one-day gain since Oct 16. Similarly, the 30-year rate jumped 7.5 basis points to 3.118%, its highest level since March.  What’s Driving Treasurys?Treasury yields moved north after Congressional leaders struck a two-year bipartisan budget deal, boosting expectations of a stronger economy. This in turn bolstered possibility of an imminent rate hike eventually leading to higher bond yields. In fact, record rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Fed will hike rates more times than anticipated.Bipartisan Budget DealU.S. Senate leaders reached a deal to raise federal spending by almost $300 billion to address all kinds of fiscal issues that have been plaguing Washington for years. They have agreed to lift caps on defense funding and some domestic government outlays. Defense budget will be raised by $160 billion, while funding for domestic programs will be hiked by $128 billion.Congress has time and again voted to raise the budget caps. Earlier, there have been two bipartisan deals to uplift caps by billions of dollars. The first was in 2013, forged between PaulRyan and Patty Murray, while the second was signed in 2015. However, both the deals that have extended through fiscal 2017 have expired.Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Needless to say, several states have raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute.Why Spike in Bond Yield Halted a Market Rally?Major selling point for equities since the financial crisis has been rise in bond yields. Investors always compare yield of equities with that of fixed income. In case of equities, earnings are largely considered the yield of a share of stock. Thus, the current rise in bond yields have made these more alluring, compelling investors to pull money out of stocks.Moreover, value of future earnings goes down as interest rates go up. Higher interest rate affects almost everything from mortgages to auto loans. Purchasing a house becomes expensive and credit card bite becomes harder. All these in turn could lead to recession, ending the nine-year-old bull market.Best Screening Parameters Amid Widespread UncertaintyAs the equity market frets over rising yields, make sure you pick safe investments. In general, you should look for companies that are unperturbed by wavering market conditions. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks also have a good position in the market and pay out part of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. After all, dividend payers boast solid financial structure and are immune to market vagaries. Further, they are positioned to grow in the near term and are economically priced.5 Top Safe Stocks to BuyWe have, thus, selected five stocks flaunting the aforesaid virtues along with a solid Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3206,UPS,"Benchmarks finished mostly in the red on Thursday as investors switched from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields continued to hover near their best levels since April 2014. Additionally, weak earnings results from United Parcel Service weighed on the broader S&P 500. Further, the tech-heavy index, Nasdaq fell ahead of major tech earnings. However, rising rate hike prospects pushed financial blue-chips like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan upward, which in turn boosted the Dow.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.1%, to close at 26,186.71. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,821.98. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,385.86, losing 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 1.6% to close at 13.75. A total of around 7.80 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.23 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.24 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?In its two-day policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that the labor market remained strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The central bank also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Tighter labor market and prospects of rise in inflation raised rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March, which in turn weighed on investor sentiment. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.722% on Wednesday to 2.773% on Thursday, its best levels since April 2014. Also, 30-year U.S. Treasury yield surged more than 3% for the first time since May 2017. High treasury yields weighed on broader equity markets to a great extent.Q4 Earnings Continue to Hog AttentionOn the earnings front, shares of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) decreased 6.1% despite posting upbeat fourth-quarter earnings results. (Read More) High level of shipping costs during the holiday season weighed on the package delivery company’s net profit, which in turn dragged down share performance.Additionally, PayPal Holdings, Inc’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) shares declined 8.1% after its former parent company, eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) decided to rely less on the company for processing payments.

The decrease was in contrast to previous quarter’s increase of 2.7%.Moreover, the ISM manufacturing index declined from 59.3% in December to 59.1% in January. But the index remained at its best level since June 2004. Reading above 50 indicates expansion in the activity. Additionally, ISM Prices Index advanced from 68.3% in December to 72.7% in January, reaching its highest levels in seven years.Additionally, the U.S Department of Labor reported that seasonally adjusted initial claims decreased 1,000 to 230,000 in the week ending Jan 27, its lowest level in more than 44 years. Low initial claims indicate a tighter labor market, which along with increase in factory prices cemented rate hike prospects further.High rate hike chances had a positive impact on the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), which rose 1%. Some of its key holdings, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) rose 1.7% and 1%, respectively.

3207,UPS,"It wouldn’t be the retail rivalry of the 21st century if e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) didn’t announce a new initiative soon after brick-and-mortar titan Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) made headlines of their own (see: Jet.com’s New Private Label Grocery Brand and Walmart Buys NYC Startup Parcel).According to a new report from Bloomberg, Amazon is testing a program dubbed “Seller Flex” that would both allow more items from third-party merchants to be listed under the Prime umbrella, and provide delivery services for those sellers on its platform.Amazon would also take care of picking up packages from its third-party merchants, as well as delivering these items to customers’ homes, potentially eliminating the need for its major delivery partners like UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report).While the company won’t completely stop using UPS and FedEx—these carriers will still be used for some delivery situations—Seller Flex demonstrates the growing desire by Amazon to control more aspects of its delivery logistics division; the program would also take delivery decisions out of the hands of third-party sellers.More control would give Amazon “greater flexibility…over the last mile to shoppers’ doorsteps, [letting] it save money through volume discounts, and [helping it] avoid congestion in its own warehouses by keeping merchandise in the outside sellers’ own facilities,” writes Bloomberg.Seller Flex builds on Amazon’s previous delivery improvements. Fulfillment by Amazon lets merchants ship goods to Amazon warehouses around the U.S. in order to be stored, packed, and shipped out, while Seller Fulfilled Prime is a program introduced last year that allows sellers to list their products under Prime even if they aren’t stored in Amazon warehouses.The new delivery service was originally rolled out in India two years ago, and over time, Amazon has been marketing the service to its U.S.-based merchants in order to prep for national expansion; Seller Flex was piloted earlier this year on the West Coast, and the company hopes to increase it in 2018, notes Bloomberg.Potential ImpactsMonday saw shares of both UPS and FedEx slip in the wake of the report, and the companies fell about 1.48% and 0.50%, respectively, in late-morning trading.The threat of disruption caused by Amazon has no doubt been on the minds of these two delivery carriers, but neither have seemed too concerned about the online retailer’s encroachment over the past year. Granted, both of UPS and FedEx’s networks are vast and intricate, but Amazon is one of the most widely-used online shopping sites in the U.S.; not having as solid of a relationship with the company could be hurtful.It will be interesting to see if UPS or FedEx takes any steps to counteract these measures, especially if Seller Flex is rolled out nationwide. Perhaps one of the carriers will develop a closer relationship with Jet.com or other online retailers that are looking to expand delivery services.One should also consider the timing of this report. The holiday shopping season is fast approaching, and Bloomberg points out that online holiday spending will reach $129 billion in the U.S. this year. Consumers become dependent on companies like Amazon, UPS, and FedEx to send and receive gifts on time, and a busy holiday season is the perfect time to test and showcase a new delivery service, demonstrating that it can operate successfully on its own.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.
