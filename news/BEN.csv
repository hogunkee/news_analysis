However, the company might be successful in offsetting the expense growth through its North Star initiatives.Revenues Might Decline: Owing to low volatility in the market and lack of sufficient mortgage banking activities, Fifth Third’s fee income is likely to decline.

4,BEN,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Tuesday, Oct 24, after market close. The company is expected to witness a rise in net interest income (NII) in credit card and commercial banking divisions while NII for consumer banking segment is likely to fall.Driven by improving economy and purchase volume growth, credit card loans (part of broader consumer loan portfolio) continued to increase during the quarter. This will support Capital One’s credit card NII. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for credit card NII of $3.38 billion shows a 2.7% sequential rise.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for commercial banking NII of $583 million shows 2.5% growth on a sequential basis. However, NII for consumer banking division is expected to be $1.52 billion, down 3.7% from the prior quarter.Overall, we believe Capital One will report an increase in total NII for to-be-reported quarter as rising interest rates will further support growth.Other Factors to Impact Q3 ResultsModest fee income growth: Like the prior quarter, Capital One is expected to witness a rise in its fee income in the to-be-reported quarter. As the quarter is likely to show increased card usage, interchange fees (major part of its fee income) are expected to rise.Marginal increase in expenses: Similar to the prior quarter, operating expenses are expected to trend upward in the third quarter. Specifically, marketing expenses will likely remain elevated with rising loan growth opportunities.Asset quality to worsen: While improvement in card loans is leading to increase in interest income, Capital One will continue to witness a rise in credit card delinquency rates. Also, the company expects a rise in auto businesses charge-off rate of nearly 15-20 basis points in the third quarter, owing to accounting changes in the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:The chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is +0.44%.Zacks Rank: Capital One currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the predictive power of ESP.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has been revised nearly 1% downward over the last 30 days to $2.15, with four out of 11 estimates moving lower. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 6%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $6.83 billion indicates 5.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Franklin Resources, Inc.

Also, assets under management (AUM) improved during the quarter. However, lower revenues were the undermining factor.For full-year 2017, adjusted net income was $220.9 million or $2.18 per share, up from $208.9 million or $2.03 per share in the prior year.Downtrend in Revenues, Costs Down For 2017, total revenues came in at $1.1 billion, down 4% year over year.Total revenues in the fourth quarter declined 4% year over year to $278.3 million. Moreover, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $284 million.The year-over-year decline in revenues was mainly due to the change in a customer relationship and altered average money market assets mix. This was partially mitigated by decreased voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds and increased revenues resulting from higher average equity and fixed-income assets.Also, net investment advisory fees dropped 5% year over year to $186.1 million. In addition, net service fees (other) marked a 1% decrease, amounting to $43.1 million. Further, administrative service fees were down 5% year over year to $49.1 million.During the reported quarter, Federated derived 40% of its revenues from money market assets, and remaining 60% from equity and fixed-income assets.Furthermore, supported by a rise in net investment income, the company recorded a spectacular improvement in non-operating income of $2.4 million in the quarter, significantly up year over year.Total operating expenses dipped 9% year over year to $187.5 million. The fall primarily exhibits decline in distribution expenses associated with a change in a customer relationship and reduced average money market fund assets, partially mitigated by increased distribution expenses related to lower voluntary yield-related fee waivers.Steady Asset PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, total AUM was $397.6 billion, up 9% year over year. Average managed assets were $382 billion, up 7% from the prior-year quarter.Federated witnessed equity assets of $68.1 billion, up 9% year over year.

Notably, during the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 197,237 shares of Federated class B common stock for $4.6 million.Our ViewpointFederated displays substantial growth potential on the back of its diverse asset and product mix, as well as a solid liquidity position. Furthermore, strategic acquisitions are anticipated to be favorable for the company. Additionally, with rise in interest rates, lower fee waivers are expected to aid the company’s top-line performance.

However, rise in expenses remain a major drag.Including tax benefit and one-time items, Legg Mason reported net income of $149.2 million or $1.58 per share compared with $51.4 million or 50 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues Rise, Expenses Flare UpLegg Mason’s total operating revenues in the quarter came in at $793.1 million, up 11% year over year. The upsurge was mainly due to elevated average long-term AUM and non-pass performance fees, as well as higher pass-through performance fees. In addition, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $764.4 million.Investment advisory fees increased 13.8% year over year to $710 million in the quarter. Further, other revenues climbed 31.2% year over year to $1.64 million. Yet, distribution and service fees were down 9.6% year over year to $81.5 million.Operating expenses escalated 36% to $820.4 million on a year-over-year basis. The rise was chiefly due to higher compensation and benefits expenses, other expenses and impairment of intangible assets.Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 27.2%, up from 23.9% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Solid Assets PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, Legg Mason’s AUM was $767.2 billion, up 8% year over year from $710.4 billion. Of the total AUM, fixed income constituted 55%, equity 27%, liquidity 9% and alternatives represented 9%.AUM inched up 1.7% sequentially from $754.4 billion as of Sep 30, 2017, driven by upbeat market performance, and other of $13.5 billion, long-term inflows of $2.2 billion and $0.1 billion in acquisitions. These positives were partially offset by liquidity outflows of $2.3 billion, $0.4 billion in negative foreign exchange and realizations of $0.3 billion.Notably, long-term net inflows of $2.2 billion included equity outflows of $3.2 billion offset by fixed income inflows of $5.4 billion. Additionally, average AUM was $759.9 billion compared with $716.7 billion witnessed in the prior-year quarter and $750.3 billion in the previous quarter.Strong Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, Legg Mason had $680 million in cash.

8,BEN,"Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Jan 24, are expected to reflect a year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues.Notably, the company provides majority of its asset management services through the C&IS unit, which generates more than 50% of total revenues. A rise in revenues in this segment will boost overall revenues for the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion for sales for the to-be-reported quarter reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13.3%.Moreover, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets were relatively decent in the fourth quarter, the company will likely be able to register growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Here are the other factors that might influence the company’s Q4 performance:Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances, along with the effect of rising interest rates, Northern Trust should record an increase in NII.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Remain Stable: Given the mixed trend in foreign exchange (“FX”) trading volatility and volumes in the fourth quarter, the company’s revenues from FX trading might remain flat for the quarter.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Despite some cost-saving initiatives, Northern Trust’s continued investments in new business activities may lead to a marginal rise in expenses. Further, management expects transaction and integration costs relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management’s fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland to be $8-$10 million in the fourth quarter.Adverse Impact of New Tax Code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings.

The rise resulted mainly from elevated compensation and benefits, general, administrative, and information systems and technology expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower sales, distribution and marketing, along with occupancy expenses.As of Sep 30, 2017, total AUM came in at $753.2 billion, up 3% from $733.3 billion as of Sep 30, 2016.

However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for value based on our styles scores.OutlookWhile estimates have been trending upward for the stock, the magnitude of this revision has been net zero. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

23,BEN,"Diversified conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 24. The company is likely to report lower revenues in the quarter due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.This, in turn, is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Top-Line WoesThe financial performance of United Technologies depends largely on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. The company is also heavily dependent on the U.S. government’s budgetary allocation for defense. A reduction in capital spending for the commercial aviation or defense industries is likely to have a significant effect on the demand for its products.United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | United Technologies Corporation QuoteUnited Technologies relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems. This exposes the company to market price volatility and availability risks. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on its ability to meet delivery schedules and thereby increase operating costs. These headwinds look all the more potent with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UTC Climate Control and Security segment revenues is currently pegged at $4,566 million, significantly down from $4,712 million reported in the second quarter. Revenues from Otis and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to be sequentially low with respective estimates of $3,075 million and $3,661 million compared with reported revenues of $3,131 million and $4,070 million in the prior quarter.UTC Aerospace Systems’ revenues are likely to be $3,619 million compared with $3,640 million in the previous quarter.Other Key FactorsDuring the quarter, United Technologies inked a definitive agreement to acquire Iowa-based avionics firm, Rockwell Collins, Inc. The acquisition is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs. With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.24% with the former currently pegged at $1.68 and the latter at $1.69. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Franklin Resources, Inc.

The company is expected to witness year-over-year growth in revenues and earnings.Further, Citizens Financial boasts an impressive surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9.1%.The Providence, RI-based bank’s organic growth was reflected in second-quarter 2017 results, which witnessed continued rise in loan and deposit balances. On the downside, the company recorded increased expenses.Citizens Financial’s results are expected to benefit from rising interest income and prudent expense management efforts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for to-be-reported quarter earnings of 64 cents indicates a 23.3% year-over-year improvement.Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citizens Financial Group, Inc. QuoteFactors That Might Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsHigher Net interest income (NII): On account of a decent quarter in terms of loan growth and higher interest rates, Citizens Financial’s NII is likely to increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.05 billion reflects 11.6% growth year over year.Moreover, estimates for average interest-earning assets of $139 billion reflects a 5.1% increase from the year-ago quarter.Controlled Expenses: Citizens Financial’s expenses are expected to continue declining on the back of its TOP IV efficiency initiative. Also, its self-funding revenue initiatives might help lower the efficiency ratio.The consensus estimate for efficiency ratio is 0.60%, down 4 basis points year over year.Fee Income Might Decline: Fee income might have declined in the third quarter due to lack of volatility in the markets.Also, some of the other sources that contribute to fee income, such as Service Charges and Trust & Investment Management Fees, are expected to decline. The consensus estimate for Service Charge and Fees of $131 million reflects a 13.8% decline year over year. Further, estimates for Trust & Investment Management Fees indicate 4.1% decline to $38.5 million.Overall, non-interest income is projected to fall 2.6% to $378 million in the third quarter.Mortgage Banking Likely to Improve:  Mortgage banking is expected to show strength on stronger origination volumes. Also, expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $29.8 million, reflecting 18.1% improvement year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Citizens Financial has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Citizens Financial is +0.51%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Citizens Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Franklin Resources, Inc.

25,BEN,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp is likely to beat on earnings in the third quarter. This is because the company has the combination of the two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at +0.26%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement.Notably, U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.23% as depicted in the chart below:U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 3.2% for the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, underperforming growth of 3.9% recorded by the industry.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsExpenses Might Trend Higher: While the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII.Consumer Revenue Growth: It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity, which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses. An improved economic backdrop will also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments.Mortgage Banking Likely to Improve:  Higher mortgage banking is projected on stronger origination volumes. Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenues to total revenues will not be much. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenue is $215 billion, relatively stable year over year.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 88 cents over the last seven days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $5.6 billion, up 4.9% year over year.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

32,BEN,"Franklin Resources, Inc.’s (BEN  -  Free Report) shares have dropped 21.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s gain of around 13.4%, on rising investors’ concerns due to persistent net outflows recorded by the company.Investment management fees have been Franklin’s biggest source of revenues, accounting for about 68%, for the past few years. Notably, during fiscals 2016 and 2017, fees declined due to reduction in average assets under management (AUM) and lower effective fee rate, which remain concerns.ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12-month period is 14.66% for Franklin as compared with the S&P 500 average of 16.56%.

37,BEN,"Driven by prudent expenses management, shares of Apollo Global Management, LLC (APO  -  Free Report) gained 5.1% following the first-quarter earnings release on May 3. However, the company reported economic net loss of 30 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 4 cents. Also, the reported figure compared unfavorably with the economic net income of 82 cents per share in the year-ago period.Results were primarily affected by poor performance across all segments, each witnessing a decline in economic income. However, higher assets under management (AUM) supported the results. Further, lower expenses acted as a tailwind during the quarter.GAAP net loss attributable to Apollo Global was $62.6 million or 34 cents per Class A share against net income of $145.2 million or 75 cents per Class A share in the prior-year quarter.Decline in Revenues Offsets Rise in AUM and Lower ExpensesTotal revenues were $166.9 million, plunging 75% year over year. Also, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $242 million. The decline was primarily due to investment loss. Apollo Global’s total revenues for combined segments in the first quarter amounted to $149.6 million, down 78% from the prior-year quarter. The plunge was primarily due to significant revenue decline in the private equity segment.  Total expenses for combined segments decreased 38% year over year to $214.9 million in the reported quarter. The decline was primarily due to a fall in profit sharing expenses resulting from the decrease in carried interest income.Fee-earnings AUM increased 18% to $182.5 billion from $154.2 million in the year-ago quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, total AUM was $247.4 billion, up 25% from $197.5 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. The rise in total AUM was due to an increase in private equity, credit and real estate segments.Capital and LiquidityAs of Mar 31, 2018, Apollo Global had $988 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.4 billion of debt (excluding $500 million of undrawn revolving credit facility). These amounts exclude cash and debt pertaining to Apollo Global’s consolidated funds and consolidated variable interest entities.Distribution UpdateAlong with the earnings release, Apollo Global declared a quarterly cash distribution of 38 cents per Class A share. This distribution will be paid on May 31, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 18.Our ViewpointSignificant decline in revenues keeps us apprehensive about the stock. Moreover, volatility in the capital market and strict regulatory reforms, we believe, could adversely impact the company’s performance going forward.However, Apollo Global is poised to grow through meaningful acquisitions, strategic alliances and divestitures.

38,BEN,"Waste Management Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. In the last reported quarter, earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 0.3%, beating estimates only once.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterStringent government regulations are likely to contract Waste Management’s margins as compliance with such regulations increases operating costs. In order to develop or operate a landfill or any waste management unit, facility permits and other governmental approvals are necessary. These permits and approvals are often difficult to obtain, time consuming and costly and are likely to restrict its operations. All these might impact profitability in the quarter.The company expects volumes to be down due to lower national counts as it strives for improved margin growth and pricing. The pricing environment also remains challenging and highly competitive due to aggressive bidding by smaller competitors. Waste Management needs to improve margins on the recycling side through adjustment of rebates to reflect lower pricing and also needs to improve the quality of inbound material to increase profitability. Decline in average recycling commodity prices and recycling volumes also remain headwinds.However, Waste Management is executing well its initiatives to refocus on the core business activities and instill price and cost discipline to achieve better margins. The company further aims to focus on improving customer retention by providing better service and higher value solutions.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Waste Management is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at -0.28%.

Moreover, the company is well on track with SNL Financial’s integration and anticipates generating synergies.The company’s strategic portfolio restructuring and focus on core business will continue to drive growth. This apart, strategic acquisitions and positive industry trends like surge of new high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, fuelled by tight interest-rate spreads, augur well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S&P Capital IQ revenues is currently pegged at $426 million, up from $414 million reported in the second quarter. Total revenues are expected to be $1,442 million compared with reported revenues of $1,439 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the S&P Dow Jones Indices is estimated to be $121 million compared with $120 million in the previous quarter while that for Commodities & Commercial markets is expected to be up from $191 million to $225 million.Other Key FactorsThe successful integration of SNL Financial is likely to complement the S&P Capital IQ and Platts businesses, which will help S&P Global avail cost cuts and revenue synergies. Moreover, it will enable global expansion on a greater scale especially within the banking and insurance sectors, while media and real estate areas are likely to emerge as new opportunities.Moreover, our proven model conclusively shows that S&P Global is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components.

40,BEN,"Franklin Resources (BEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. While revenues are projected to improve year over year, earnings might decline.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Franklin has a high chance of beating Q4 earnings estimates. This is because the company has the right combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Currently, Franklin has an Earnings ESP of +0.56%.Zacks Rank: Franklin currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). Further, Franklin has an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.6%.In the last quarter, the company reported in line earnings. Results reflected lower revenues and higher costs. Net outflows in the quarter were another headwind. However, increase in assets under management (AUM) was a positive factor.Franklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Franklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Franklin Resources, Inc. QuoteFactors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsStrong Market Performance to Benefit Franklin: Performance of equity markets remained strong in the July-September quarter. The S&P 500 Index gained nearly 4% in the quarter. Moreover, the index measuring international equity performance — the MSCI EAFE — climbed around 5%. This should benefit this California-based asset manager.Higher AUM: Given Franklin’s AUM disclosure for September 2017 and equity market rally, the results are expected to display higher AUM on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the company is expected to record inflows mainly tied with Global Fixed Income asset class, Global Equity and U.S. Equity. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total AUM for the to-be-quarter is expected to rise 1.4% to $743 million on a year-over-year basis.Increase in Revenues: Investment management fees, which marks a significant portion of the company’s revenues, might improve on the back of market strength. The consensus estimate for investment management fees of $1.1 billion reflects nearly 1% growth year over year. However, this increase is likely to be partially offset by sales and distribution fees which is projected to fall 0.7% year over year to $438 million in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.64 billion indicates a year-over-year increase of 1.6%.Controlled Expenses: While Franklin expects information and technology expenses along with general and administrative costs to exhibit an uptick in the fiscal fourth quarter, compensation and benefits expenses are expected to decline.However, the company’s cost-control efforts have been successful in trimming expenses so far this year. We expect these efforts to support bottom-line growth to some extent.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Lazard Ltd.

45,BEN,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) performed decently over the last several quarters. This time too, decent results are anticipated on positive markets, favorable currencies and better-than-expected flows.The S&P 500 Index recorded a total return of 3.1% in the second quarter. Though the U.S. equity market recorded positive returns amid mixed economic data, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are anticipated to record a rise in equity asset under management  (AUM). Moreover, weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the global diversified AUM mix. Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, driven by marketing and investments might hurt the bottom line.Conversely, during the quarter, fixed income generated positive returns as investors ran for safe haven assets. Consequently, fixed income prices increased and resulted in reduced yields.Notably, some investment managers, including The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report), T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report), Ameriprise Financial Inc.’s (AMP  -  Free Report) and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), have already released results.

Further, the bottom line compared favorably with the prior-year quarter figure of 74 cents per share.The results reflect Franklin’s top-line strength, supported by higher investment management fees.

53,BEN,"The Zacks investment management industry, part of the broader Finance sector, performed decently over the past several quarters. However, the trend seems to have picked up pace to some extent in the first quarter on the back of improved domestic growth environment.The companies that have reported first-quarter 2018 earnings so far witnessed growth in their trading revenues due to increased volatility in the quarter. However, dismal overall investment banking activities remained a drag.The Investment managers’ earnings are expected to get support from rising interest rates and lower tax. Also, the quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, along with President Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports. This led to increased volatility, which indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Apart from this, the global M&A activity increased in the quarter. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally rose during the quarter. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Hence, the related fees are projected to increase.However, debt underwriting remained disappointing as rising rates limit corporates’ involvement in  these activities. Thus, overall investment banking income is likely to witness a decline. Also, increased spending in technology is expected to keep costs up, in turn, hurting the investment managers’ bottom line.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the finance sector are expected to grow 27% year over year on revenue growth of 5.4%.Now, let’s take a look at some of the investment management stocks that are scheduled to announce first-quarter results on Apr 26.Franklin Resources (BEN  -  Free Report) is slated to report before the opening bell. The company is likely to record a fall in assets under management (AUM) in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM is expected to decline 1.2% year over year to $745 million.Thus, due to decrease in AUM and lower sales and distribution fees (the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $417 million, reflecting a fall of 3.2% from the prior-year quarter), Franklin’s revenues are likely to decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.6 billion indicates a year-over-year increase of 0.86%.However, earnings are projected to rise year over year.

54,BEN,"Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) has announced a special cash dividend of $3 per share, to be paid on Apr 12, to shareholders of record as of Mar 29. Along with this, the company has announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of 23 cents per share, which will be paid on the same date.Given that the new Tax Act improved the company’s capital position as well as its financial strength, management feels that a special dividend is the best way to return capital to shareholders.According to 551.7 million of shares outstanding as of Jan 23, 2018, this special dividend represents a total payment of $1.7 billion.In fact, the company’s chairman and CEO, Greg Johnson, said, “This dividend is consistent with our long-term capital management policies and our commitment to our stockholders. We will continue to prudently invest in our business, actively pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions, buyback our stock when it makes economic sense, and distribute the rewards of those investments to our stockholders over time.”Notably, the company also paid a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share in January 2015. Moreover, it has hiked its dividend every year since its inception in 1981, the latest being a 15% increase in December 2017. Further, the company has an efficient share repurchase program in place.Given a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, question arises, whether it is worth considering Franklin stock for earning this dividend income.Let’s delve deeper into its financial performance and fundamentals to understand the risk and reward.Earnings: Although the company has witnessed nearly 4% decline in its earnings per share (EPS) over the last three-five years, it is expected to deliver a strong earnings performance in the near-term as indicated by its projected EPS growth of nearly 8% and 6.7% for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. Moreover, its long-term (three-five years) projected EPS growth of 9.1% promises reward for shareholders.Valuation: Franklin stock looks overvalued, based on its price-to-earnings (F1) and price-to-sales ratios. The company currently has a P/E (F1) ratio of 11.94 and a P/S ratio of 3.32, which are above the industry averages of 11.76 and 3.09, respectively.Leverage: Franklin has a debt/equity ratio of 0.09, which compares favorably with the industry average of 0.11. This indicates that the company has a lower debt burden, relative to the industry and that it will be financially stable, even in adverse economic conditions.Return on Equity (ROE): The company’s ROE of 13.88% is higher than the industry average of 13.45%. This reflects that it is more efficient in utilizing shareholder funds, compared with its peers.Expenses: Franklin has been successful in reducing costs for the last few years. Expenses have declined nearly 7%, 14% and 3% in fiscals 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Thus, lower expenses are expected to aid bottom-line growth in the quarters ahead.Share Price Movement: The company’s price performance does not look impressive. Its shares have lost 5.8% in the past year, as against 19.9% growth for the industry it belongs to.Our TakeWhile a stretched valuation and poor price performance make us a little apprehensive about the stock, we believe that it is a wise idea to add the stock to your portfolio now, given its declining expenses, a lower debt burden, superior ROE and good earnings growth prospects.Moreover, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year earnings has been revised nearly 3.5% upward over the last 30 days, indicating analysts’ optimism regarding its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks in the same space worth considering are Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (WDR  -  Free Report), Federated Investors, Inc. (FII  -  Free Report) and Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (AMG  -  Free Report).Waddell & Reed’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has increased 11.6% in the last 30 days. The company’s share price has increased 12.3% in the past year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Federated Investors’ earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 1.5% upward, over the last 30 days.

55,BEN,"With prudent cost management and strong diversification strategies, Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) appears a solid bet now. The company’s relatively strong distribution platform and consistent well-planned acquisitions are anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.Though expenses might escalate for Franklin due to the strictly regulated nature of investment management business and potential investments in the technology, sharper focus on organic growth is expected to make the growth path smoother for the company.During the Q4 earnings season, the Finance sector performed well. Despite inflation-related issues and heightening chances of political uncertainty, easing margin pressure, consumer loan growth, tax benefits from the tax reform and controlled expenses helped most finance stocks to perform well. So, we thought of bringing up a stock from the sector that reflects strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.Particularly, Franklin is one such stock that not only beat estimates this time, but has also been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 increased 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively.Though shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have declined 9.4% in the last six months, compared with 8.7% growth recorded by the industry, Franklin has a number of other aspects that make it an attractive investment option.Why Franklin is an Attractive PickPrudent Expense Management: Franklin recorded 7%, 14% and 3% declines in operating expenses in fiscals 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. While potential investments in the technology front might escalate expenses in fiscal 2018 (3-5%), previous cost-cutting initiatives will likely improve the top line in the near term..Steady Capital Deployment: Franklin returns sufficient capital to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, the company adopted a new stock trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 in March 2015 to facilitate share buyback under its current repurchase program. In June 2016, it announced an additional repurchase authorization of up to 50 million shares. Moreover, driven by a healthy liquidity position, the company has hiked its dividend every year since its inception in 1981, the latest being the 15% increase in December 2017. The company had also paid a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share in January 2015.Leverage: Franklin’s debt/equity ratio comes in at 0.09 against the S&P 500 average of 0.69, reflecting lower debt burden compared with the industry. It highlights the company’s sound financial flexibility.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Franklin’s ROE of 13.88%, as compared with the industry average of 13.45%, indicates the company’s commendable position over its peers.Stock is Undervalued: Franklin has P/CF and P/B ratios of 11.65 and 1.77 compared to the industry average of 12.03 and 1.80, respectively. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Stocks to ConsiderShares of Apollo Global Management, LLC (APO  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), gained more than 12% over the past six months.

60,BEN,"WisdomTree Investments, Inc. (WETF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, this New York-based exchange traded fund and exchange-traded product sponsor reported adjusted earnings per share of 5 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company witnessed significant increase in other income. However, the positives were partially offset by lower assets under management (AUM) and higher expenses.WisdomTree has a disappointing earnings surprise history. It lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 21.9%.WisdomTree Investments, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise WisdomTree Investments, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | WisdomTree Investments, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for WisdomTree in the upcoming results. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for this to happen, which is not the case here as elaborated below:(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for WisdomTree is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents.Zacks Rank: WisdomTree’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors at PlayIn 2016 and first-quarter 2017 WisdomTree was hit by significant outflows. The outflows were mostly due to internationally hedged products, particularly the company’s major currency-hedged funds – HEDJ and DXJ – which constitute a major part of the company’s AUM.In the second quarter, there was no measurable progress that can help the company reduce outflows.   WisdomTree remains focused on executing strategic growth initiatives, including expansion of distribution capabilities, investment in technology, launch of innovative products and addition of personnel. We expect such initiatives to increase marketing and sales expenses in the second quarter.A key area to watch is the compensation expense level during the quarter. Management expects compensation expenses to be 28–31% of revenues for the year.WisdomTree’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a LookFranklin Resources, Inc.

61,BEN,"Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, before the opening bell on Apr 26. Earnings are projected to rise year over year, while revenues might decline.Last quarter, Franklin outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by rise in revenues. Also, assets under management (AUM) growth remained strong.Further, Franklin recorded positive earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.34%. Franklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Franklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Franklin Resources, Inc. QuoteNevertheless, activities of the company in the fiscal second quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 75 remained unchanged over the last seven days. However, the figure reflects year-over-year rise of 1.35%.Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, we cannot conclusively predict if Franklin will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Franklin’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsMixed Market Performance: Performance of equity markets remained mixed during the January-March quarter. The S&P 500 Index gained nearly 11.8% year over year, but declined 1.2% sequentially in the quarter. Moreover, the index measuring international equity performance — the MSCI EAFE — climbed around 2.5% year over year, however was down 5.1% sequentially. This is anticipated to likely benefit this California-based asset manager to a lesser extent.Lower AUM: Given Franklin’s AUM disclosure for March 2018 and equity markets performance, its results are predicted to display lower AUM on a sequential basis. In addition, the company is expected to record outflows mainly tied with U.S. and non-U.S. mutual funds. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is expected to edge down 1.2% to $745 million on a sequential basis.Decrease in Revenues: Investment management fees, which mark a significant portion of the company’s revenues, might decline on the back of quarterly market performance. The consensus estimate for investment management fees of $1.1 billion indicates nearly 1% growth year over year. However, sales and distribution fees are projected to be down 3.2% year over year to $417 million in the quarter to be reported.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.6 billion indicates a year-over-year fall of 0.86%.Controlled Expenses: Management remains focused on effective cost control. While potential investments in the technology front might escalate expenses in fiscal 2018, previous cost-cutting initiatives are likely to reflect optimism.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) is +1.38% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

64,BEN,"Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report) is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the opening bell. It is expected to record a year over year decline in revenues and earnings.Encouraging underwriting performance, lower costs and significant drop in losses in Non-Core division were the primary reasons for improvement in last quarter’s results. However, fall in trading revenues, lower net interest income and rise in credit impairment charges were the undermining factors.Analysts’ doesn’t seem to be happy with the company’s business activities in the just concluded quarter. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate declined 40.1% over the last 60 days. Also, Barclays’ shares on NYSE have declined 0.8% so far this year, as against 15.4% gain for the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively indicate that Barclays will outpace earnings estimates in the second quarter. Note that a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher to have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Barclays is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 13 cents.Zacks Rank: Barclays currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsTrading weakness to hurt revenue growth: During the second quarter, trading environment was disappointing as markets experienced low volatility. Barclays’ trading income is likely to face fixed-income trading slump. Also, trading in equities is expected to witness a downtrend due to decreased client activities.Rise in loan impairment charges: Loan impairment charges should continue to trend upward in the quarter as consistent global slowdown has led to deterioration in asset quality.Investment banking to modestly support revenues: Driven by improving market conditions, the quarter witnessed an increase in equity issuance while debt issuance was hit by higher interest rates. Per the data compiled by Thomson Reuters, equity market activities led to over 22% increase in equity underwriting fees. So, given this favorable trend, Barclays is projected to witness a rise in the same.However, the data indicates that global fees related to bond activity roughly totaled $6.5 billion during the quarter, down more than 16% year over year. So, the bank is expected to record a decline in debt underwriting fees during the quarter.Further, global M&A activity remained lackluster during the quarter. Per the data, the total deal value of announced M&As across the globe declined during the quarter. Thus, total fees earned through deal making are likely to decline as well. Likewise, Barclays is likely to record a fall in advisory fees.Rise in loan demand to support interest income: While a low interest rate environment across several major economies continue hampering interest income growth, increase in loan demand is likely to offset it to some extent.Cost saving efforts to play savior: Barclays has been on a streamlining spree since the second half of 2016. It announced divestures of several non-core businesses. These initiatives are expected to improve the bank’s operating efficiency and trim costs. Nevertheless, legal and other regulatory expenses are bound to adversely affect its bottom line.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Hilltop Holdings Inc.

67,BEN,"Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY  -  Free Report) is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens. Its revenues are projected to rise year over year, while earnings are expected to fall marginally.Escalated expenses and higher provisions largely led Ally Financial’s first-quarter earnings to lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher net revenues supported results to some extent.Analysts seem to be happy with the company’s business activities in the just concluded quarter. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained stable over the last 30 days. Also, the stock has a decent earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.9%.Ally Financial Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ally Financial Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ally Financial Inc. QuoteFurther, the company’s price performance has been decent as well. Its shares have jumped 15% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 1.9%.Factors at PlayLower used vehicle prices to hurt results: With management’s expectations of decline in used vehicle prices, Ally Financial’s earnings are likely to be adversely impacted to some extent as it primarily deals in auto loans.Further, lease revenues are projected to fall during the quarter owing to a smaller lease portfolio as well as lower used vehicle value.Higher rates to support net interest income (NII): Given the higher interest rates and Ally Financial’s efforts to diversify into mortgage business, NII is expected increase in the second quarter.Operating expenses to rise: Ally Financial has been making efforts to grow inorganically, introduce new products and diversify operations. Given these initiatives, the company will likely witness an increase in operating expenses. Management expects expenses to be $760 million in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ally Financial is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That’s because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as elaborated below.

68,BEN,"Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (SC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the market opens. Its earnings and revenues are projected to decline year over year.Last quarter, Santander Consumer USA’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by a decline in provisions. However, a rise in total operating expenses and lower revenues hurt results to quite an extent.The company’s price performance has not been very impressive though. Despite marginally outperforming the industry it belongs to, shares of Santander Consumer USA hardly managed to gain anything year to date.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict if Santander Consumer USA will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This is because the stock does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the chances of an earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Santander Consumer USA is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 62 cents matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Santander Consumer USA’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsManagement expects net interest income for the quarter to be down 5–7% sequentially owing to credit mix, lower interest accrual on TDR loans and a smaller balance sheet.Also, other income is expected to decrease compared with the last quarter, primarily due to lower servicing fees driven by lower managed assets and changes in consumer practices.Thus, total revenues are likely to decline in the quarter.Management expects operating expenses to decline by $5-$10 million on a sequential basis.Due to seasonality, the company expects net charge-offs to be down $130–$150 million sequentially. Also, allowance for credit losses is expected to be down $20–$40 million. Thus, overall provisions are expected to be lower on a sequential basis.However, activities of Santander Consumer USA in the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate was revised 1.6% downward over the last 30 days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Hilltop Holdings Inc.

Per the data compiled by Thomson Reuters, equity market activities led to over 22% increase in equity underwriting fees.However, the data indicates that global fees related to bond activity roughly totaled $6.5 billion during the quarter, down more than 16% year over year.

The company has a solid earnings surprise history, beating estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with a positive average earnings surprise of 183.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderVASCO is continuing with its pursuit to develop innovative products that significantly reduces the risk of losses due to fraud and data theft. The trusted identity strategy of VASCO products provides enhanced data security with adaptive authentication. In addition, the company is drawing on the in-house cloud expertise gained through the acquisition of eSignLive to develop the cloud-based elements of IDENTIKEY Risk Manager and trusted identity solutions. At the same time, VASCO is expanding eSignLive's growth opportunities by integrating it with popular cloud-based services.The new trusted identity solutions enable the integration of multiple anti-fraud capabilities in a more unified manner while easing implementation and administration. These investments are likely to translate into incremental revenues for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.VASCO expects the long-term shift toward software and services to continue in the quarter. However, the company expects to record valuable contributions from its hardware business with a solid pipeline of business opportunities. VASCO is likely to continue aligning its resources with growth opportunities and enhance ability to develop innovative solutions that identify and mitigate online and mobile threats. With a change in top management and focused approach, the company is likely to report healthy top-line growth in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that VASCO is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Its earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, an increase in fee revenues drove the company’s operating earnings growth. In fact, the number handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher expenses was the downside.State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.1%.These earnings beats supported a 17.1% year-to-date rally of the stock, significantly outperforming the 4.7% growth of the industry it belongs to.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post second-quarter earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.According to our quantitative model, chances of State Street beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are low. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. But, this is not the case here as is elaborated below(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is -0.64%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.56 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57.Zacks Rank: State Street’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Moreover, State Street’s activities during the quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable over the last seven days.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsNet Interest Margin (NIM) Improvement: The Mar 2017 rate hike should support the company’s NIM expansion in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expects NIM to grow in the mid single-digits.Revenues to Increase Modestly: Although, trading services activity is likely to remain muted in the second-quarter, the company expects servicing fees to improve, driven by client flows and net new business.Additionally, with moderate growth in loans witnessed in the quarter and improving rate scenario, net interest income (NII) is expected to increase modestly. In fact, management expects the NIM growth to offset the modest decline in balance sheet, leading to an increase in NII.Expenses to Remain Stable: Although the benefits of the company’s cost-saving initiatives through State Street Beacon are not expected to be realized much in the quarter, the same is likely to partly offset expenses to support new business, continued business investments, and merit and depreciation increases.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some finance stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Banc of California, Inc.

84,BEN,"Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Driven by an increase in revenues and lower credit cost, Zions’ first-quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, rise in operating expenses was an undermining factor.Also, the company’s business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the just concluded quarter moved 1.6% upward over the last 30 days.Zions boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.8%.The company’s price performance has been decent as well. Its shares have gained 1.2% year to date as against the industry’s decline of 0.3%.Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high.

This further increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsManagement expects net interest margin to benefit from the Mar 2017 rate hike. Also, we believe that increasing yields and growth in investment securities portfolio will boost margins to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.This is expected to have some positive impact on net interest income (NII) in the second quarter. Further, a modest improvement in loans will support NII.Zions has been undertaking several initiatives to control costs. Though its cost-saving efforts are likely to reduce operating expenses to some extent, the company’s continued spending on technology systems overhaul and normal salary adjustments will keep overall expenses stable during the quarter.Zions’ oil and gas-related exposure (9.4% of net loans) remains a matter of concern, despite a recovery in oil prices. Though the company expects energy-related losses to be lower year over year, oilfield services portfolio is likely to hamper significant improvement in asset quality.

85,BEN,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 25. Its earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by higher revenues. Also, assets under management (AUM) witnessed growth. However, a rise in expenses was the major downside.That said, the company does not have a very impressive earnings surprise history, as it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the trailing four quarters.Nevertheless, the company’s price performance has been quite encouraging.

However, we also need a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAmeriprise’s persistent efforts in improving business are expected to have a positive impact on profitability during the quarter.Moreover, management believes that the March rate hike will lead to an improvement in interest revenues.Further, we expect Advice & Wealth Management segment’s (AWM) performance to drive the company’s results. The segment witnessed growth in assets in the previous quarter. Based on expectations of improved advisor productivity, the same is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.The company expects margin expansion in the AWM segment to continue over time, assuming no significant market disruptions.Management expects Department of Labor related expenses in the to-be-reported quarter to decline on a sequential basis.However, Ameriprise’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62 to remain stable over the last 30 days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Banc of California, Inc.

86,BEN,"With revenues and earnings projected to grow year over year, we expect T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) to beat earnings expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 25.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that T. Rowe Price is likely to beat on earnings in the second quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +2.38%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of T. Rowe Price’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated stocks) going into an earnings announcement.Below is the company’s earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart: T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteShares of T. Rowe Price gained 8.9% during the second quarter ended Jun 30, 2017, outperforming the 7.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsMutual Fund Products Performance: According to Morningstar data, T. Rowe Price witnessed around $5.6 billion of net outflows in U.S. mutual fund products in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company is likely to record a rise in assets under management (AUM) as the second quarter experienced decent performance of equity markets. Notably, the S&P 500 index gained 3.1% in the quarter, which is likely to benefit T. Rowe Price, given its equity-heavy asset mix.Insignificant Fee Waivers: Management believes that with the gradually improving interest-rate environment, fee waivers in its money market mutual funds and trusts would be insignificant.Revenue Growth: T. Rowe Price’s efforts to improve its operating efficiency, has resulted in year-over-year growth in the top line over the past few years. We believe that the company is well poised to sustain the uptrend, going forward, on the back of several planned initiatives largely tied with launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client engagement capabilities in each distribution channels, strengthening distribution channel in the U.S., EMEA, and the Asia Pacific, and improving its technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Expenses to Escalate: The company did not point out anything related to its cost-control initiatives during the quarter, due to its several planned strategic initiatives. T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses for 2017 at growth rate of 10% (excluding the charge tied with the Dell appraisal rights matter). Notably, T. Rowe Price is anticipating capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $200 million, including two-third for technology development.Notably, this investment manager could not win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at $1.26, over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.OM Asset Management PLC  is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Aug 3.

Price and EPS Surprise BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteFactors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsBlackRock continues to dominate the ETF market with its brand initiatives. Moreover, driven by a rise in equity inflows in the second quarter, the company’s U.S. iShares inflows remained strong. This might have strengthened its assets under management.The New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically. Thus, the average fee rate is likely to rise, driven by higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions.However, higher expenses could be a dampening factor. BlackRock has witnessed rising expenses over the last few years. Its plans of restructuring traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings might lead to an increase in expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s activities encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward.

88,BEN,"Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 0.7%, beating estimates only once.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterDuring the quarter, Xerox collaborated with Innovation Lab to counter healthcare challenges. The collaboration intends to seek new products, ideas, and concepts that can be commercialized through the Innovation Lab by working in unison with physicians, employees, and industry partners. This is likely to augment Xerox’s revenues and strengthen its position in the market.Xerox is reprioritizing investments and accelerating its restructuring actions and services to improve revenues and margins. As part of the restructuring, it is executing a three-year strategic transformation program which targets incremental savings of $600 million across all segments. When combined with savings from cost streamlining actions currently in process, Xerox is attempting to realize cumulative cost reduction of $2.4 billion over the next three years.The company also remains committed to its five-plank strategy that is centered on portfolio management, global growth, cost transformation, operational excellence and analytics. With sustained investments to expand geographical footprint and build its services capabilities in areas that provide significant customer value, Xerox expects to reap benefits in the long run.However, advancements in IT have resulted in the replacement of the traditional means of sending and storing information with the digital media. As a result, Xerox is grappling with decreased demand for paper-related systems and products while its attempts to leverage the business process outsourcing market failed to lend growth momentum.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Xerox is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

89,BEN,"Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 (ended Sep 30) results tomorrow, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Improved investment banking drove the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was partially offset by elevated expenses and slowdown in trading activities.Analysts seem to be happy with the company’s business activities in the just concluded quarter. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved 1.5% upward to $1.34, over the last 30 days. The earnings estimates reflect a year-over-year rise of 4.3%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.67 billion indicates 14.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Also, the stock has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 13.4%.Further, the company’s price performance has been decent as well. Its shares have jumped 24.6% so far this year compared with the industry’s gain of 8.4%.Raymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Raymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Raymond James Financial, Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsSlight rise in underwriting fees: Driven by improving market conditions and chances of continued rise in interest rates in the future, the quarter witnessed an increase in debt issuance. Further, the quarter is likely to have recorded a slight improvement in equity issuance despite seasonality. So, both debt and equity underwriting fees for Raymond James are projected to rise in the to-be-reported quarter.Muted advisory fee revenues growth: With the overall improvement in global M&A scenario during the quarter, Raymond James is expected to be able to generate decent advisory fees.Trading income to fall due to lack of volatility: For the major part of the quarter, trading activities remained sluggish, largely due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. Absence of any concrete development on the proposed financial reforms by the Trump administration and an unchanged monetary policy of the Fed were the primary reasons for the reduced volatility. Therefore, Raymond James will likely report dismal trading revenues.Loan growth in RJ Bank to support interest income: With stabilizing economy, a rise in demand for loans and improvement in rates, RJ Bank segment is expected to record a rise in interest income.Expenses to rise: Raymond James is expected to incur integration costs during the quarter as it continues to grow inorganically. Also, as the company persistently hires advisors and invests in franchises, overall expenses are expected to increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Raymond James is likely to beat earnings this time.

90,BEN,"Legg Mason Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Sep 30) results tomorrow, after the market closes. This asset management company is expected to witness a rise in performance fees while distribution and service fees, and other service revenues are likely to fall.Given the increase in assets under management (the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $746 billion shows 1.8% year-over-year rise) during the quarter, Legg Mason’s non-pass-through performance fees are projected to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-pass-through performance fees of $8 million reflects 29.7% growth from the prior-year quarter. Nonetheless, management expects it to be in the range of $5-$10 million in the to-be-reported quarter.However, distribution and service fees are anticipated to decline 15.8% year over year to $80 million. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for other service revenues of $1.05 million indicates 27.6% plunge from the last-year quarter.Overall, Legg Mason is expected to record a marginal fall in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $739.1 million shows a decline of 1.2% year over year.On cost front, management expects compensation ratio to be down in the range of 54-55%, reflecting seasonal compensation decline. Nonetheless, we expect overall operating expenses to trend upward as the company continues to invest in franchise.Further, we expect non-operating expenses to decrease in to-be-reported quarter as other income continues to rise.  Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter has been revised nearly 1.5% upward over the last 30 days to 69 cents, with all four estimates moving up.

91,BEN,"Amid cyclical movements in the asset management industry, asset managers are striving for growth through different avenues. Recently, New York-based WisdomTree Investments, Inc. (WETF  -  Free Report), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and exchange-traded product (ETP) sponsor and asset manager, entered into a stock-cash acquisition deal with ETF Securities. Under this deal, WisdomTree will acquire $17.6 billion worth European exchange-traded commodity, currency and short-and-leveraged business (the ""Acquired Business"") for about $611 million.The combined entity will form the ninth largest ETF provider in the world with significant presence in the two largest markets — Europe and the United States. The deal is likely to close by first-quarter 2018, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.ETFs are one of the fastest-growing products in the asset management industry. These allow investors the ease of trading the entire portfolio of stocks against trading only one stock. ETFs are often constructed to track a broad market index, which can be done at quite a low cost.Terms & Benefits of the DealOn entering into the agreement, WisdomTree has expanded its foothold in Europe, acquiring the leading position in the European-listed gold and commodity products industry. Further, diversified AUM internationally and increased profitability at WisdomTree Europe and its International Operating segment will serve as tailwinds.Further, on completion of the Acquired Business’ acquisition, as of Nov 9, 2017, WisdomTree’s assets under management would total nearly $66 billion internationally, on a pro-forma basis.Per the deal, WisdomTree will pay $253 million in cash and 30 million shares for the Acquired Business. Cash portion includes $200 million of newly issued debt and $53 million of cash in hand.Moreover, the dividend will be reduced to 3 cents per quarter from 8 cents, following the transaction. Though the acquisition is likely to be accretive to earnings per share immediately on completion, excluding one-time transaction and integration costs, the above-mentioned deal might face near-term headwinds on dividend reduction and increasing debt burden.""We are very excited to meaningfully expand and enhance our presence and capabilities in the European market by adding ETF Securities` market-leading commodity platform to WisdomTree`s differentiated European product offering,"" said Jonathan Steinberg — WisdomTree CEO and president. ""The acquisition will immediately add scale, diversification and profitability to our business in Europe, the second largest ETF market in the world and a growing and strategically important region for us and the entire industry. The addition of this complementary and competitively positioned commodity business is an important development in WisdomTree`s strategy to establish itself as a differentiated and diversified ETP provider that can thrive globally and generate long-term shareholder value,"" Steinberg further noted.Similar Moves by Other Asset ManagersInvesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) acquired the ETF business of Guggenheim Partners LLC and London-based ETF provider — Source — in 2017. Further, Franklin Resources Inc.’s (BEN  -  Free Report) Franklin Templeton is on the verge of developing a new ETF strategy for which operations have been rolled out in Canada and Europe.Bottom LineWe believe the latest acquisition is a befitting one that will likely support the future prospects of WisdomTree, which remains focused on executing strategic growth initiatives, including expansion of distribution capabilities, investment in technology, launch of innovative products, as well as addition of personnel. However, the asset manager has significant exposure to internationally-hedged products, particularly major currency-hedged funds — HEDJ and DXJ — which are highly unstable and might act as headwinds.Notably, the company's share price rose nearly 18.7% over the last six months as compared with 11.2% growth recorded by the industry.Currently, WisdomTree carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

94,BEN,"Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   This Birmingham, AL-based company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to impressive growth in revenues aided by easing margin pressure. Further, the company recorded growth in loans, though deposits balance remained stable. Credit quality metrics also improved. Rise in adjusted operating expenses and decline in non-interest income were the undermining factors.Notably, this upbeat performance resulted in an appreciation of the company’s share price. For the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the stock gained around 4%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 25 cents over the last 30 days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 5.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.45 billion indicates around 1% growth from the prior-year quarter.In addition, Regions is projected to record slight decline on a sequential basis in average interest-earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $109.7 billion.Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below: Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions’ stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Regions doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing its chances of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Regions is +0.48%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Regions’ Zacks Rank #4 decreases the predictive power of ESP.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to support the company’s net interest income.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. The bank projects average loans to be flat to marginally down on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impact of the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio. Average deposits are estimated to be relatively stable compared to the prior year.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Regions should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of the 2017 NII and other financing income to grow in the range of 3-5% are likely to show impact in the third quarter as well.Non Interest Income Might Escalate: The persistent decline in non-interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years. Nevertheless, adjusted non-interest income is estimated to grow 1-3%. Management expects a pick-up in capital markets revenues, along with modest growth in wealth management, mortgage and card, and ATM fees to contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the second half of the year.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is estimated to improve sequentially to $41.4 million, while commercial credit fee income is projected to remain stable at $18.2 million.Expenses Might Rise Slightly: Regions’ efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter. Owing to the current global macroeconomic headwinds, management’s plan to slash $300 million of core expenses by 2018 is right on track. Furthermore, encouraged by recent increases in market interest rates, Regions expects to eliminate an additional $100 million by 2019.However, the company projects adjusted expenses to trend from a flat to 1% increase, while efficiency ratio is expected to scale at approximately 62% in 2017. Adjusted operating leverage is projected in the range of 2-4%.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 26. The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.25% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

95,BEN,"With revenues and earnings projected to grow year over year, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Oct 26.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that T. Rowe Price is likely to beat on earnings in the third quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +3.25%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of T. Rowe Price’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated stocks) going into an earnings announcement.Below is the company’s earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart: T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteShares of T. Rowe Price gained around 22.2% during the third quarter (ended Sep 30, 2017), outperforming the 8.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsMutual Fund Products Performance: According to the Morningstar data, T. Rowe Price witnessed around $2.9 billion of net inflows in U.S. mutual fund products in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company is likely to record a rise in assets under management (AUM) as the third quarter experienced decent performance of equity markets. Notably, the S&P 500 index gained 4.5% in the quarter, which is likely to benefit T. Rowe Price, given its equity-heavy asset mix. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for assets under management is $911 billion, up 4.6% sequentially.Insignificant Fee Waivers: Management believes with the gradually improving interest-rate environment, fee waivers in its money market mutual funds and trusts would be insignificant.Revenue Growth: T. Rowe Price’s efforts to improve its operating efficiency have resulted in year-over-year top-line growth over the past few years. We believe the company is well poised to sustain this upbeat uptrend, going forward, on the back of several planned initiatives largely tied with launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client engagement capabilities in each distribution channels, strengthening distribution channel in the United States, EMEA, and the Asia Pacific, and improving its technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Expenses to Escalate: The company did not point out anything related to its cost-control initiatives during the quarter, due to its several planned strategic actions. T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses for 2017 at growth rate of 10% (excluding the charge tied with the Dell appraisal rights matter) and 7% for 2018. Notably, the company is anticipating capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $200 million, including two-third for technology development.However, this investment manager could not win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at $1.41, over the last seven days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 20.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.21 billion indicates around 10.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Lazard Ltd.

96,BEN,"Industrial goods manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 25. The company is likely to report lower revenues in the quarter due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.This, in turn, is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Top-Line WoesIngersoll continues to reposition its portfolio to focus on high-barrier markets. While such efforts are encouraging, they involve upfront costs, which might lead to earnings dilution in the near term. Consequently, the company is continually under stress to maintain profitability through stringent cost-cutting measures.In addition, when the economy in Europe is highly unpredictable post the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. In addition, Ingersoll is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial Technologies segment revenues is currently pegged at $729 million, down from $765 million reported in the second quarter. Revenues from Climate Control Technologies are also expected to be $2,992 million compared with reported revenues of $3,144 million in the prior quarter.Other Key FactorsOperating income for Industrial Technologies ad Climate Control Technologies segments are expected to be $88 million and $505 million, respectively, compared with the corresponding tallies of $92 million and $527 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that Ingersoll is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.20%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Ingersoll-Rand PLC (Ireland) Price and EPS Surprise Ingersoll-Rand PLC (Ireland) Price and EPS Surprise | Ingersoll-Rand PLC (Ireland) QuoteZacks Rank: Ingersoll has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc.
