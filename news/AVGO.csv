Let's see how things are shaping prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPaylocity’s both top and bottom-lines for the third quarter increased year over year. The company also raised fiscal 2017 guidance.We remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology. Notably in the last few quarters, clients switching from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services generated a significant portion of its revenues. Therefore, we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost the company’s top-line in the long run. Such initiatives are also likely to have positive impact on forthcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, which specializes in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, will act as a tailwind.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), Oracle Corporation and SAP SE remain major headwinds.Paylocity Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Paylocity Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Paylocity Holding Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Paylocity will beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Also, lack of visibility and intensifying competition from Priceline, Expedia and Alphabet continue to be growth concerns.However, for the second-quarter, the company’s solid fundamentals, strong focus on developing mobile products, expansion into international restaurant reservation and improvement in user growth and engagement, especially on mobile devices, will be the likely drivers.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TripAdvisor will beat earnings estimates this quarter.

6,AVGO,"The Priceline Group Inc.  is slated to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 8 after the bell.The company is one of two leading players in a highly fragmented online travel booking market, the other one being Expedia (EXPE). But the two companies are different because Priceline generates most of its revenues overseas, particularly Europe, while Expedia is more focused on North America. Both companies are expanding geographically.In terms of share price movement, Priceline has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained 47.4%, the stock rallied 38.3%.Last Quarter RecapPriceline’s first-quarter 2017 earnings not only came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also increased year over year. Revenues however missed the consensus mark by a slight margin but were up year over year.On a year-over-year basis, the agency business showed strong momentum but the merchant business was lumpy. Room nights and Rental cars performed impressively. Airline tickets continue to remain weak.Second Quarter ExpectationsFor the second quarter of 2017, Priceline expects room nights booked to grow 16-21% and total gross bookings to grow 12-17% year over year (15-20% on a constant currency basis).Priceline expects gross profit dollars to increase 14%-19% (17-22% on a constant currency basis), with adjusted EBITDA in the range of $860-905 million.Pro forma earnings per share (EPS) are expected to come in the range of $13.30-$14.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $15.49. GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $12.55-$13.25.What’s in Favor of Priceline?The U.S. Commerce Department estimates international travel to the U.S. to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2016 to 2021. Inbound travel volumes from Mexico, China, Canada, India and South Korea will be the highest during this period. Visitor volume in 2017 is expected to be up 2.4% from 2016. Since it is a major international player, these trends play into Priceline’s sweet spot and will have an impact on its quarterly performance.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 10.3%. Not just that, the company hasn’t missed estimates in any quarter since 2012, which is a very big deal and is an indication that this quarter will be no different.The Priceline Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Priceline Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | The Priceline Group Inc. QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.Priceline has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.31% and that indicates a likely positive surprise.

Most recently, the company released Ryzen 3 processor. It is set to release notebook Ryzen chips late 2017. Intel is expected to response by launching 14-nm eighth generation core processors (Coffee Lake).We believe that this new launches along with growing adoption of Windows 10 can give a boost to the sluggish PC shipment market. Moreover, DRAM and NAND supply constraints are also expected to ease out in the later half.Further, growing incidents of cyber attack are also anticipated to increase the demand for cybersecurity software providers.Technology sector’s second-quarter earnings are now expected to grow 15% from the same period last year on 6.9% higher revenues.

The strong growth was driven by higher net sales, which surged 58.8% from the year-ago quarter to $902.7 million. On a sequential basis, net sales increased almost 2.4%.Meanwhile, the company revised sales and earnings guidance for the going-to-be-reported quarter in early June. The company now forecasts non-GAAP net sales to be in the range of 4.5–6% (mid-point at 5.25%) as compared with earlier guidance range of 2–7% (mid-point at 4.5%), up on a sequential basis.Further, non-GAAP earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.22–$1.26 per share, as compared with previous guided range of $1.17–$1.27. Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteMicrochip’s stock has gained 24.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 15.6% rally of the industry it belongs to. The outperformance is driven by consistent results as well as the revised guidance that reflects product portfolio strength. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayMicrochip’s microcontroller business (64.3% of fourth-quarter revenues) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. Moreover, the company’s microcontroller business is evidently benefiting from the addition of Atmel’s product portfolio (5 cents incremental benefit in the last quarter), which it acquired in Apr 2016.We believe that newly launched products like PIC32MX1/2 XLP and MOST-based Intelligent Network Interface controllers will continue to expand customer base. Moreover, improving operating efficiency and leverage will boost gross margin in the going-to-be reported quarter.Earnings WhispersHowever, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Microchip’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.14 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.57% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NetEase (NTES  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.83% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

18,AVGO,"Shares of Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) went up sharply in the after-hours trade and bounced back from a slight drop during the normal trading session, as the computer security software firm reported better-than-expected second-quarter top-line results and raised its outlook for 2017.Moreover, although the company’s bottom-line results fell short of estimates, it came in line with the year-ago quarter. The company’s adjusted loss per share (excluding all one-time items but including stock-based compensation) came in at 39 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents.However, on a non-GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 17 cents per share, marking approximately three-fold jump from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 6 cents. The year-over-year improvement was primarily stemmed by solid top-line growth and efficient cost management, which were partially offset by higher share counts.Following the earnings announcement, shares of Proofpoint gained approximately 3.5% in the after-hours trading session. Notably, the stock has gained 25.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 17.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter in DetailProofpoint reported total revenue of $122.3 million, up 36.1% year over year, mainly driven by customer additions, improved add-on-sales and strong renewal rate. The company’s revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $120.4 million and also came ahead of its guidance range of $118–$120 million.Total billings during the quarter also jumped 45% year over year to $146.3 million. Renewal rates also remained well over 90% during the second quarter.Non-GAAP gross profit surged 39.8% from the year-ago quarter to $94.4 million. Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin expanded 200 basis points (bps) to 77.1%, primarily driven by higher sales and efficiency improvements across the company’s cloud operations.Furthermore, the company efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 69.7% from 71% in the year-ago quarter. In dollar terms, however, the figure increased 33.6% to $85.3 million.Owing to higher revenues and efficient cost management, Proofpoint’s non-GAAP operating income for the quarter jumped year over year to $9.1 million from $3.7 million recorded in second-quarter 2016. Operating margin expanded 280 bps to 7.4%, primarily due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income, therefore, increased to $9.1 million from $2.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Net income margin advanced 460 bps to 7.4%.Proofpoint, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Proofpoint, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Proofpoint, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowProofpoint exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $429.5 million, slightly up from the previous quarter balance of $412.9 million. Accounts receivable were $75.6 million compared with $62.4 million at the end of first-quarter 2017.During the first half of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $67 million. Free cash flow for the first two quarters came in at $44.1 million.OutlookBuoyed by better-than-expected top-line result, Proofpoint provided encouraging outlook for the third quarter and raised guidance for the full year. For 2017, the company now anticipates revenues in the range of $503–$506 million, up from the earlier guidance range of $496–$500 million. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $500.55 million.Billings’ guidance for the year has also been revised upward and is now anticipated to come between $625 million and $628 million. Earlier, it was projected to remain in the range of $619–$623 million.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now estimated to come between 62 cents and 64 cents, up from the previous guidance range of 56–59 cents. Free cash flow for the year is now projected to be in the range of $100–$107 million, up from the earlier projection of $98–$106 million. The company intends to incur capital expenditure in the range of $44–$46 million in 2017.Coming to the third-quarter outlook, the company anticipates reporting revenues in the range of $130–132 million, and billings between $162 million and $164 million. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $129.6 million.GAAP and non-GAAP are expected to be 72% and 77%, respectively. Non-GAAP net income is anticipated to come in the range of $8.0–$9.0 million, or 16–18 cents per share. Proofpoint projects reporting loss in the range of $24.8–$28.2 million or 56–64 cents per share, on a GAAP basis.Free cash flow is projected to be in the range of $26–$28 million, while capital expenditure to be approximately $12 million during the third quarter.Our TakeProofpoint reported mixed results for second-quarter 2017, wherein its top line fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line didn’t. However, on a year-over-year basis, the company witnessed improvement on both the counts. Furthermore, an optimistic third-quarter outlook and upbeat full-year guidance are encouraging.Proofpoint is a leading security-as-a-service provider that focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance, and secure communications. The company’s sustained focus on launching products, acquisitions and partnerships have helped it register over 35% revenue growth consistently for the last few quarters.Nonetheless, since it continues to invest in sales and marketing, we anticipate this to remain a drag on the company’s bottom line in the near term. Intensifying competition and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its woes.Currently, Proofpoint carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report), Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term expected EPS growth rates for Applied Optoelectronics, Broadcom and Mellanox Technologies are 18.8%, 13.6% and 13.1%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

19,AVGO,"Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 1.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.9%, putting an end to the streak of earnings misses in the last five quarters. Pitney Bowes has an average negative surprise of 4.6% over the trailing four quarters.Factors to ConsiderPitney Bowes’ concerted efforts to transform its business over the past four years are finally beginning to show results. Last quarter, the company’s Software business, which has been long hurting from macro woes, finally returned to growth. This trend might likely continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, driven by a rise in license revenue, high data and SaaS revenues.Speaking of catalysts, Pitney Bowes’ Global Ecommerce business continues to be one of the strongest profit churners. In less than five years, Global Ecommerce has expanded from a $20 million business to worth over $400 million. During first-quarter 2017, Digital Commerce Solutions reported 9% year-over-year increase on the back of strong Global Ecommerce business (up 17%).We believe, exponential increase in cross border trade volume will continue to escalate Ecommerce sales in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Other factors – including introduction of new products and digital capabilities, partner channel expansion, improvement in the direct channel, and expansion of the Presort Services network – are likely to act as second-quarter growth catalysts.Despite these positives, prolonged softness in the mailing business is likely to prove detrimental to Pitney-Bowes’ growth momentum to some extent. Lower recurring supplies revenues are expected to hurt the mailing business for the quarter under review. In addition, strengthening of the U.S. dollar pose might play spoilsport for the company’s cross-border sales.In addition, escalating marketing expenses in relation to the ERP implementation program is likely to act as an overhang for the second-quarter results. Pitney Bowes expects incremental marketing expense in the ERP program, related to digital capabilities enhancement, for entire 2017. Also, capital expenses associated with the ERP project pose as a concern for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Pitney Bowes will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%.

20,AVGO,"The Q2 earnings season is off to a flying start, courtesy of broad-based performance across most sectors. Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods, total earnings are likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. It appears that the equity markets have dispelled the recent skepticism about President Trump’s ability to deliver on his pro-growth promises.     As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products.

21,AVGO,"In basketball, when a player hits a few shots in a row, he is said to have a “hot hand.” In finance, we call it “momentum.”Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks (i.e. stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times) to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift.At the core, momentum investing works on the principle of “Buy High, Sell Higher.”Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for momentum strategy to work. For instance, we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hoping that they will spring back to their original prices. On the other hand, many investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things gain clarity, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Also, unlike other investment styles, momentum premium has stood the test of time, remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s. This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums (like size and value) becomes known to public, the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes.Obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play. Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets, and we have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains.Our screen will help you take advantage of both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #150: This item selects the top 150 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past one year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #50: From the 150 stocks, we choose those that are also among the 50 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter what the market conditions are, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score cuts short the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Style Score of 'A' or 'B,' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensurestrong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume shows that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the nine stocks that made it through this screen:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), which manufactures and sells lifting and material processing products worldwide, has rallied almost 73% in the past one year. The company carries a Momentum Style Score of ‘B’.Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), which designs, develops, and supplies a range of semiconductor devices worldwide, has gained 58.5% over the past one year.

22,AVGO,"TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 26.The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 8.9% for the trailing four quarters. TE Connectivity scored its sixth consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, beating estimates by 10.2%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether TE Connectivity is set to add yet another earnings beat to its winning streak.Factors to ConsiderTE Connectivity’s harsh environment business applications, which have been a staple top-line growth driver for the past five years, will continue to stoke growth for the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well. In recent times, the company has been witnessing decent increase in organic revenues, fueled by strong demand in the end markets. Especially, growth in global auto production and thriving heavy truck business is likely to act as major catalysts for the third-quarter results.  Apart from its transportation business, robust performances of the other two businesses, namely, Industrial and Communications Solutions, have been driving its operating margin expansion significantly in recent times. Post the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions, Industrial business has been on an uptick. We believe TE Connectivity’s robust inorganic growth will continue to boost its third-quarter financials as well.Of late, the company’s overarching business model has been conducive to its bottom-line and margin expansion. During the last reported quarter, the “TEOA Operating System” helped the company improve organic sales by 8%, adjusted EPS by 32% and adjusted operating margins by 16.6%. Also, the company’s concerted efforts to bring down its operating costs and the savings generated from there are expected to positively impact the fiscal third-quarter results as well.Despite these positives, TE Connectivity’s sluggishness in oil and gas markets and its derivative impact on other industrial markets is expected to negatively impact growth to some extent. Also, stiff competition from both direct and indirect players in the market are likely to hurt margins for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. In addition, the company has been suffering from poor sales through distribution channels, which is taking longer than expected to recover. This issue is expected to weigh down on third-quarter sales as well. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TE Connectivity will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.17.

23,AVGO,"Badger Meter Inc.’s (BMI  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings per share rose 12.5% year over year to a record 36 cents and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents.Sales in the quarter inched up 0.3% year over year to a record $104 million, but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $108 million. Domestic residential and commercial municipal water product sales were flat year over year as some customers delayed orders to capitalize on the latest advancement in the ORION Cellular technology, the ORION Cellular Long-Term Evolution (LTE) endpoint, which began shipment in Jun 2017. Domestic sales of flow instrumentation products increased but were partially offset by fewer international projects.  The oil and gas business also improved during the quarter.Cost and MarginsCost of sales decreased 2% year over year to $63 million. Gross profit in the quarter was $41 million, up 4% from $39.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross margin was 39.4%, a 150 basis points (bps) expansion from the year-ago quarter owing to pricing discipline, manufacturing cost controls and its strategy to acquire or consolidate much of distribution network. These actions helped negate the impact of higher brass costs.Selling, engineering and administration expenses were flat year over year to $24.5 million owing mainly to staffing reductions in the flow instrumentation business in the second half of 2016 and lower health care expenses. Operating income went up 11% to $16.6 million from $14.9 million in the year-earlier quarter. Consequently, operating margin expanded 150 (bps) to 15.9%.Badger Meter, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Badger Meter, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Badger Meter, Inc. QuoteFinancial PositionBadger Meter reported cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million at the end of second-quarter 2017, up from $7.3 million at year-end 2016. Receivables were pegged at $64.4 million at the second quarter end, higher than $59.8 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Inventories were $74 million at the end of second quarter compared with $78 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Badger Meter acquired D-Flow Technology AB of Luleå, Sweden in the second quarter.

24,AVGO,"Continuing with its upbeat performance for the fourth straight quarter, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) yesterday reported strong results for second-quarter 2017. Quarterly revenues came in at the higher-end of the company’s expectations, while earnings were above the guidance range. Moreover, the top and bottom lines, both, surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Check Point’s adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) of $1.14 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Adjusted earnings also climbed approximately 18% on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher revenues, efficient cost management and a lower share count.On a non-GAAP (excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets) basis, the cybersecurity company posted earnings of $1.26, higher than its guidance range of $1.17–$1.25, and marked a 15.6% year-over-year improvement.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. QuoteRevenuesSecond-quarter revenues came in at $458.6 million, up 8.5% year over year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $455 million. The figure was also close to the upper end of the company’s guidance range of $440–$465 million (mid-point $452.5 million). Quarterly revenues were mainly driven by strong performance of its small and midsize-enterprise product lines as the company has been successfully able to penetrate through the midmarket and acquire new customers.Segment wise, the company witnessed sales growth of 11.9% in Products & Software Blades, and 4.4% in Software Updates and Maintenance. The company also reported a 27% surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades.Geographically, the Americas contributed 49% to revenues and Europe accounted for 34%, while Asia-Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 17%.Talking about deal size, the number of new customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more totaled 63, flat year over year. Moreover, customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 71% to the total order value, which is equal to the second-quarter 2016 tally.Operating ResultsOn a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased 8.1% to $405.7 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross profit contracted 30 basis points (bps) to 88.5%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) rose 6.5% year over year to $180.8 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 80 basis points (bps) mainly due to efficient cost management.Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets) came in at $224.9 million, up nearly 9.5% year over year. In addition, margins expanded 40 bps to 49% primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items calculated on a proportionate tax basis) was $191.3 million or $1.14 per share, up from $169 million or 97 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowCheck Point exited the quarter with cash balances of approximately $3.806 billion, slightly down from $3.797 billion at the end of the first quarter. During the first half of 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $581.7 million. Additionally, Check Point repurchased about 4.9 million shares for a total cost of $496 million in the first two quarters of 2017.Share Price PerformanceDespite reporting robust quarterly results, shares of Check Point dipped 7% during yesterday’s trade as the company hinted that its third-quarter revenues might be hit slightly due to the very special Israeli holiday – Yom Kippur – coinciding with the last day of third quarter.Israel-based Check Point announced that the entire country will be completely shut down during Yom Kippur and so it won’t be able to operate any business activities. Notably, the company normally derives almost $30 million of revenues in the last few days of any quarter.However, Check Point expects to mitigate some of the impact during the quarter. Also, despite of all this, the company has maintained the outlook on full-year revenues, which signifies that it is optimistic about its long-term prospects.Notably, shares of Check Point have gained 27.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 21.2% rally.OutlookTaking into account the aforementioned factors, the company provided outlook for the third quarter. The company expects to generate revenues between $430 million and $465 million (mid-point $447.5 million). The mid-point of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $462.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.18–$1.28 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 15 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.14 per share.For 2017, Check Point continues to anticipate generating revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.90 billion (mid-point $1.875 billion). The mid-point of the guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the band of $5.05–$5.25 per share. GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 70 cents lesser than the non-GAAP figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.69.Our TakeCheck Point continues to report splendid quarterly results for the fourth consecutive quarter. The company’s top and bottom lines not only came ahead of the respective guidance ranges at mid-points, but also marked solid year-over-year improvement. Although, the third-quarter outlook is slightly disappointing, we believe that the company is well capable of mitigating the third-quarter revenue losses in the fourth quarter.Rapid adoption of Check Point’s data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top-line support. The company’s focus on enhancing mobile capabilities will enable it to tap greater larger opportunities. Furthermore, Check Point’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is praiseworthy.Additionally, we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises, and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.Nonetheless, changing customer spending behavior, intensifying competition, an uncertain economic environment and currency fluctuations remain headwinds.Check Point currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

25,AVGO,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 IFRS earnings per share of €0.56 (62 cents), which reflects a decline of 17.7% on a year-over-year basis. An increase in the share-based compensation expenses and restructuring related expenses proved to be a drag on the bottom line.Total IFRS revenues for the first quarter were €5,782 million ($6,358.1 million), up 10% year over year. However, the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,175 million. Robust performance of both the company’s segments, namely, Cloud and Software and Services, drove top-line growth.Also, new cloud bookings – a key indicator of sales success in cloud business – were significantly up 33% to €340 million ($373.9 million) in the reported quarter.Inside the HeadlinesCloud and Software business, which includes Cloud Subscriptions & Support, and Software licenses & support, reported revenues of €4,757 million ($5,230.9 million), up 9% year over year. Individually, Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €932 million ($1024.9 million) in the quarter, up 29% year over year. Software licenses and support reported revenues of €3,826 million ($4,207.2 million), up 5% on a year-over-year basis.In addition, for the reported quarter, Services revenues rose 17% year over year to €1,024 million ($1,126.0 million). Overall, IFRS Cloud and software revenues witnessed the highest increase in APJ (up 52%), followed by EMEA region (up 48%) and the Americas (up 20%). This was mainly driven by IFRS Cloud Subscriptions & Support strength.In the EMEA region, Cloud subscriptions and support revenue growth was driven by strong performance of Germany and Russia. Also, stellar growth in software revenue in Germany and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) proved conducive to overall performance in the EMEA region.For the Americas, impressive software revenue growth in Canada, Mexico and Chile acted as tailwinds. For the APJ region, impressive cloud subscriptions and software revenue growth in China, along with that in Japan and Australia, acted as catalysts.SAP reported IFRS operating margin of 16.0%, down 820 basis points from the figure recorded a year ago. Additionally, the company recorded an almost 27% drop in its operating profit, which came in at €926 million ($1,018.3 million).SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SAP SE Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SAP SE QuoteQuarterly HighlightsSAP’s human capital management (HCM) applications continue to drive growth, with SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassing the 1,800-customer mark at the end of second-quarter 2017. Also, SAP’s Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions witnessed double-digit growth in cloud bookings and software revenue during the quarter.Moreover, consistent market traction of the SAP S/4HANA platform is proving to be the highest profit churner. To date, S/4HANA has earned 6,300 customers. The company gained 500 customers in the reported quarter, of which 30% are new. This has fueled the company’s revenues to a great extent.This apart, SAP’s business networks (which it manages through three main players – namely Ariba, Fieldglass and Concur) experienced 22% growth during the reported quarter. Currently, the Ariba network handles trading of 2.8 million connected companies, which is worth over $1 trillion. Meanwhile Concur manages travel and expenses of more than 49 million end users, and Fieldglass helps in managing 3.5 million flexible workers.SAP’s latest digital innovation system – SAP Leonardo – is also off to a decent start, gaining clients. Carrying efforts forward, last month, the company expanded its SAP Leonardo, which can now integrate machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, analytics and blockchain on SAP Cloud Platform. During the reported quarter, the company gained CITIC Pacific Mining among other clients.Other Financial DetailsFor the quarter ended Jun 30, 2017, the company’s operating cash flow came in at €642 million (approximately $733.3 million), up 46.2% on a year-over-year basis, while free cash flow generated by the company came in at €322 million ($367.8 million), up 59.4% from the year-ago figure.As of Jun 30, 2017, SAP had cash and cash equivalents of €4,236 million ($4,838.4 million), compared with €4,206 million recorded at the end of Jun 30, 2016.Guidance ReiteratedSAP is highly optimistic about its solid backlog coupled with a robust pipeline, which positions it for profitable growth in 2017. The company raised its view for full-year 2017 non-IFRS total revenue projection from €23.2–€23.6 billion to €23.3–€23.7 billion at constant currency (cc).Fueled by continued strong momentum of the cloud business, the company believes the non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to lie in the range of €3.8 billion to €4.0 billion at constant currencies. Considering the upper end of the range, this reflects a 34% improvement compared with the year-over-year improvement.Also, buoyed by the adoption of S/4HANA and digital business platforms, non-IFRS cloud & software revenues are projected to grow in the range of 6.5–8.5% at constant currencies for full year 2017.The non-IFRS operating profit guidance for 2017 has been reiterated at the €6.8–€7.0 billion (at cc) band. We are optimistic about the company’s strong momentum in its cloud business as well.Concurrent with the earnings release, SAP announced a share buyback of up to €500 million in 2017. After evaluating the expected cash flow development for the second half of 2017, SAP believes it can commence the program shortly. It will be executed in several tranches.Our TakeThough SAP’s earnings figures have declined, its thriving cloud business look strongly positioned to drive growth in the quarters to come. The company’s resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth drivers. The company’s S/4HANA has proved to be a solid profit churner, fueled by increase in cloud subscriptions and support-revenue increase in recent times.Also, SAP’s renewed focus on bolstering its IoT foothold is expected to result in significant client wins, stoking top-line rise. SAP’s intention to fortify its IoT foothold became quite clear when it announced an investment of a whopping $2.2 billion for the expansion of its IoT portfolio.Despite these positives, the company’s fall in operating profit and rise in operational expenses remains a concern. These are likely to exert pressure on the margins and top line. Also, SAP has to fend off stiff competition from technology biggies, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report), in the cloud domain.Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) has an average earnings surprise of 6.7%, beating estimates all through, over the trailing four quarters. It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

26,AVGO,"Shares of TiVo Corporation (TIVO  -  Free Report), a provider of digital home entertainment services and solutions, have been performing well of late.If you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock to your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to maintain the momentum. Although these stocks at times are weighed down by tough market conditions, they have potential to filter the negatives and focus on the positives.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 10% and a market cap of 2.28 billion.Earnings Surprise History EncouragingTiVo outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, generating a positive average earnings surprise of 67.6%.Ahead of the IndustryTiVo has outperformed the Zacks categorized Internet Services industry over the past one month. Share price of TiVo rose 5.2% compared with the industry’s gain of just 1.7% over the same time period.ValuationOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 17.7x, which is significantly lower than the Zacks industry’s average of 36.0x. The ratio is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings and measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. The lower the P/E of a stock, the better for a value investor.Growth DriversThe merger of Rovi and TiVo has brought together two leading players in the media entertainment industry, which has complementary products and services and a number of patented technologies. The two companies have been witnessing stiff competition from Internet video providers such as Alphabet’s YouTube, Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Apple and Roku. Notably, these two companies were arch rivals and their merger will prove to be mutually beneficial. The new TiVo has become the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. The company currently has a wide range of products ranging from from interactive program guide to DVR. The combined company will have over 6,000 issued and pending patents offering it a competitive advantage against media and tech giants.TiVo’s innovative product pipeline is a major growth catalyst, in our view. The company’s strategy of offering content on all devices on a real-time basis significantly enhance the utility of its products, which will drive demand, going forward. The TiVo Roamio has gained significant traction due to its added ability to connect the company’s mobile apps and stream and download live as well as recorded television program. To improve customer engagement, the company launched “What to Watch Now” app for iPad owners. We believe that the company’s innovative product pipeline will drive significant top-line growth over the long term.A potential revenue stream for TiVo is advertising. The acquisition of advertising analytics provider, TRA Inc., has helped the company to focus on expanding its television ad analytics business.  Moreover, the company’s existing partnerships with NBC and CBS and six of the world's largest advertising companies (WPP, IPG, Publicis, Havas, Carat and Omnicom Media Group) will boost ad revenues going forward. Viewing through DVR is becoming significant part of the advertisement buying equation as its penetration is expected to grow at a favorable rate over the next 3–4 years. We believe that this should trigger a surge in the demand for TiVo technology.Risk RemainsIntense competition is eroding TiVo’s subscriber base. The company faces increasing competition from cable and satellite providers, who offer bundled up DVR service with digital cable in one set-top box at comparable monthly subscription rates and without any upfront costs. It faces significant competition from a number of companies, which have created competing DVR technologies and offer attractive licensing agreements to service providers and manufacturers of DVRs, thereby leaving little to no scope for differentiation.Last WordLooking at these positives, we feel TiVo is a technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

28,AVGO,"Danaher Corp. (DHR  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 20.The company hasn't missed estimates in the trailing sixteen quarters, which is an impressive feat.  Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. The stock boasts an average positive surprise of 5.7% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn the past few quarters, Danaher has faced stunted revenue growth in its dental segment, mainly attributable to weakness in higher-margin traditional consumables business. We believe the weakness will continue to mar the second-quarter results as well. Moreover, unfavourable product mix and incremental costs associated with various new product developments, particularly in the dental segment, are expected to hurt the margin performance for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.This apart, sluggishness in some of Danaher’s key end markets, including Latin America and some European regions, are likely to impact growth. A significant portion of its revenues is derived from regions outside the U.S., which makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuations. Over the past few quarters, Danaher has been suffering from strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus other currencies.Also, the company has been witnessing relatively smaller organic growth over the past few quarters. We believe Danaher's Life Science portfolio lacks a significant upstream product offering, which has been restricting growth. A decelerating organic growth is likely to affect the company’s overall top-line performance for the second quarter.Despite these negatives, Danaher’s acquired businesses, namely Pall and Cepheid, are expected to act as key growth drivers for the quarter to be reported. Also, the company’s robust operating culture, DBS, is likely to act as a catalyst. Historically, DBS has contributed to meaningful core revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share improvement and cash flow generation. Furthermore, positive industry trends like new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration are expected to act as tailwinds, fueling top-line increase for the second quarter. Also, market traction of the recently launched products, including SMARTmatic handpiece campaign, KaVo OP 3D Pro panoramic X-Ray imaging system and CM130 coring monitoring system, are expected to stoke growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Danaher will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP for the company is currently 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 97 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Danaher Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Danaher Corporation price-eps-surprise | Danaher Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Danaher has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.71% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

The company has a market capital of $8.35 billion and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.67%.What’s Backing the Rally?Rising demand for laser technology from different sectors of the economy have expanded the scope of core material processing industries. IPG’s vertically integrated business model has helped it emerge as the strongest player in this field. Owing to the comparative advantages that it enjoys like power advantages, global scale, low cost and high quality, it has been instrumental in creating a strong barrier to entry.The company has shown rapid growth across core products, applications and geographies. Increased demand for its products from China and Eastern Europe was witnessed in the first quarter. Laser-cutter manufacturing and fiber-optic communications categories have also demonstrated strong gains.IPG expects revenues in the range of $320–$340 million for the second quarter of 2017. Earnings are projected in the range of $1.50–$1.70 per share. The mid-point of this guidance represents quarterly revenue and earnings growth of approximately 31% and 28%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report).  All the three stocks have the same Zacks Rank as IPG.

30,AVGO,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20.The company posted a negative earnings surprise of 19.3% in the last reported quarter. Overall, SAP has a dismal earnings surprise history, beating estimates only once in the trailing four quarters. Consequently, it has an average negative surprise of 3.0% for the observed period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSAP’s staple growth drivers include its resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas, namely, customer engagement and human capital management. The company’s S/4HANA has proved to be a solid profit churner, fueled by growth of cloud subscriptions and support-revenue growth in recent times. During first-quarter 2017, the company gained 400 customers, of which, 50% is entirely new.We believe sustained growth in the cloud business and robust momentum of software business will prove conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth for the second quarter. Over the past few months, the company has strategically expanded its innovation portfolio – SAP Leonardo – to integrate machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, analytics and so on.SAP’s renewed focus on bolstering its IoT foothold is expected to boost second-quarter top line as it has resulted in significant client wins. This apart, the company’s business networks, which had experienced 24% growth in first-quarter 2017, is likely to act as a catalyst for the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well. Also, solid adoption of the company’s human capital management (‘HCM’) applications, led by SuccessFactors Employee Central, is also expected to supplement second-quarter revenue increase.Despite these positives, economic slowdown in certain end markets is likely to hurt second-quarter financials. Weak sales in Latin American countries and China are expected to play spoilsports. Unfortunately, this trend might continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.A weaker global client spending in the technology sector is also expected to weigh down on the company’s profitability. Moreover, the cloud domain is characterized by sturdy competition from technology biggies like Microsoft, IBM and Amazon. Stiff competition in the IT industry may also dampen the second-quarter financials. Furthermore, currency fluctuations are likely to thwart sales for the upcoming results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SAP will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.03. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.SAP SE Price and EPS Surprise  SAP SE price-eps-surprise | SAP SE QuoteZacks Rank: SAP has a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 and 3 increase the predictive power of the ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.71% and a Zacks Rank #1.Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.09% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (ACLS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.03% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

31,AVGO,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Here we have discussed Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report), a stock with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 29.3% and Growth Style Score of ‘A’.In the last one year, Proofpoint has outperformed the Zacks Computer Software-Service industry. The stock has returned approximately 34% in the said period, outperforming the industry’s gain of just 24.6%.Let’s look at the reasons behindProofpoint’s solid momentum.Driving FactorsProofpoint reported better-than-expected results for top line in the first quarter and raised its outlook for 2017. Although the company’s bottom-line results fell short of estimates, the figure improved year over year.Proofpoint reported total revenue of $113.3 million, up 43.3% year over year, mainly driven by customer additions, improved add-on-sales and strong renewal rate. The company’s revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $110 million and moved ahead of its own guidance range of $109–$111 million.The company’s adjusted loss per share narrowed year over year to 38 cents from 54 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily stemmed by strong top-line growth and efficient cost management, which were partially offset by higher share counts.Proofpoint also raised it guidance for the full year. For 2017, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $496–$500 million, up from the earlier guidance range of $488–$492 million. Billings’ guidance for the year has been revised upward and is now anticipated between $619.0 million and $623 million. Earlier, the same was projected in the range of $611–$615 million.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between 56 cents and 59 cents, up from the previous guidance range of 49–52 cents.Proofpoint is a leading security-as-a-service provider that focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance and secure communications. The company’s sustained focus on launching products, acquisitions and partnerships have helped it to register more 40% revenue growth consistently for the last few quarters.According to a Markets and Markets report, the cyber security market will touch $202.36 billion in 2021 from $122.45 billion in 2016, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 10.6%. The favourable trend in the space is likely to aid Proofpoint’s financial results.ConcernsSince the company continues to invest in sales and marketing, we expect this to remain a drag on the company’s bottom line in the near term. Intense competition and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its woes.Bottom LineNotably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has shown an uptrend in terms of earnings as is evident from its average positive earnings surprise of 8.7% in the trailing four quarters.We believe that the stock still has much potential, which essentially filters the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader broader technology sector are Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials, Broadcom and Applied Optoelectronics have a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.6%, 13.6% and 18.7%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

33,AVGO,"On Jan 2, we issued an updated research report on Fitbit Inc. (FIT  -  Free Report), one of the leading providers of wearable fitness trackers.Shares of Fitbit have declined 10.1% in the past 12 months, underperforming the 1.8% decline of the industry it belongs to.Fitbit has made a lot of progress on the corporate wellness front, by selling fitness trackers and software subscriptions to employers as part of their corporate wellness programs. The company has already partnered with several enterprises and healthcare companies. It has over 1,300 enterprise customers and 70 of them are Fortune 500 companies.Fitbit is witnessing strong international growth. The company has penetrated Indian and Chinese markets by entering into various partnership programs. In 2016, Fitbit generated 29% of its revenues, based on ship-to destinations, from outside the  United States. Currently, the company sells its products in 65 countries.However, Fitbit’s growth has been slowing down with smartwatches outshining the fitness wearable category, influx of new wearables, lack of upgrades among existing users and lackluster growth in the Asia Pacific region. The company faces tough competition  for both high- and low-end products. The company’s biggest competitors are Apple, Xiaomi and Garmin. There are other big manufacturers too who are developing connected devices on Alphabet owned Google's Android operating system.Fitbit is trying to maintain its foothold in the market. According to the latest International Data Corporation (IDC) report, Fitbit and Xiaomi tied at the top in terms of third-quarter 2017 shipment volumes, with each having shipped 3.6 million units. Apple  was pushed back to the third position with 2.7 million units shipped. In terms of market share, Xiaomi and Fitbit  hold 13.7% each, followed by Apple with 10.3% share.To counter this headwind, Fitbit came up with its turnaround strategy. The company realigned its business into two parts — Consumer Health & Fitness and Enterprise Health. The Consumer Health & Fitness business focuses on delivering more efficient health and fitness devices while Enterprise Health focuses on building relationships with employees, insurance companies, health systems and healthcare partners.The market for wearable fitness devices is continuously growing. Per IDC, the market for wearable devices will increase to 240.1 million units by 2021, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2%. This presents significant growth opportunity for Fitbit and the company looks well positioned to capitalize on it.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderFitbit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) are some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector. All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth for Micron, Broadcom and NVIDIA is currently projected to be 10%, 13.75% and 10.3%, respectively.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

34,AVGO,"Shares of BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report) have gained 62.2% in 2017, easily outperforming the Zacks Wireless (non-US) industry’s rally of 10.9%.Why the SurgeIt was not long ago that BlackBerry was struggling due to declining smartphone sales. To overcome these challenges, in September 2016, the company had announced its decision to end all internal hardware development and outsource the same to its partners. The decision has proved to be highly beneficial and was the primary reason behind the stock’s impressive performance in 2017.Robust software sales have aided BlackBerry’s results in the past few quarters. In fact, growth of its cybersecurity business is a huge positive. Of late, BlackBerry also inked multiple deals to enhance its software business.The company’s newly formed joint venture, PT BB Merah Putih, to license its software and services for the production of handsets for the Indonesian market is impressive. Notably, the JV and its affiliates account for a significant portion of the mobile market in Indonesia. Blackberry also signed a cross-platform deal with Emtek — an entertainment, media and technology power house of Indonesia. The deal with Giuliani Partners to combat cyber threats is encouraging as well. Another agreement with Indian telecom enterprise, Optiemus Infracom Ltd, is worth mentioning. We are also impressed with the company's deal with the leading auto manufacturer, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report).We expect BlackBerry to continue performing well in 2018 driven by its focus on the software business. Moreover, BlackBerry is not a highly leveraged company. This is indicated by the fact that the ratio of its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) currently stands at 32.7. This figure compares favorably with 47.9 for its industry and also the S&P 500 index, for whom the measure reads 82.9%.Estimate RevisionsUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. BlackBerry scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 (ending February 2018) earnings being revised 60% upward, respectively, over the last 30 days. The bottom line for the same period is expected to be up 26.7% on a year-over-year basis.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreThe above bullish factors are reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), implying that it is expected to outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of A highlights its short-term attractiveness.Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader computer and technology sector may also consider NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).NVIDIA and Broadcom have expected earnings growth rates (3 to 5 years) of 10.3% and 13.8%, respectively.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

35,AVGO,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) was having a splendid 2017 until it was revealed that software updates were slowing iPhones with older batteries. The stock lost 2.2% in the last five sessions and is currently facing at least eight lawsuits in various federal courts regarding the issue.The iPhone-maker recently issued a letter at its website, apologizing for the lack of transparency relating to the handling of iPhone performance with older batteries. However, the company denied that it has ever done anything to intentionally shorten the life of a product.Moreover, the company announced certain steps to pacify aggrieved customers.The company will lower the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement by $50 for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later. The offer will be available from late January through December 2018. It will also issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery.Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote Apple Devices Activated Most in the HolidaysApple’s apologetic stance is understandable considering the value of older models in the market.According to TechCrunch, which quoted data from Flurry Analytics, Apple devices accounted for 44% of smartphone and tablet activations during the holidays. Interestingly, older devices — iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 — took the top spots in terms of activations.The data reflects Apple’s diversifying business model. It’s no longer dependent on a single device for generating top-line growth. We note that iPhone 7 and older models have significant demand in cost sensitive markets of Asia-Pacific, India and China.Apple’s flagship product iPhone X at $999 is pricey for these markets. Taiwan’s Economic Daily recently suggested that Apple may cut unit volume by 20 million from its original expectation in the fiscal first quarter.What to Expect from Apple in 2018Despite the “transparency” debacle, we believe that Apple has significant prospects in 2018, backed by expanding product portfolio.Apart from the iPhone, the aggressively growing Services business is a key catalyst. Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 34% year over year to nearly $8.5 billion in the last quarter.Apple is on track to double Services revenues of $24 billion in fiscal 2016 by 2020. To boost subscriber base, the company is now venturing into original programming. Apple is reportedly willing to invest $1 billion and has appointed ex-Sony executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to initiate expansion into original television programming.Apple recently acquired popular music discovery app Shazam for an estimated $400 million. The company is expected to integrate the software into Apple Music (or Siri) or in HomePod, its high-end smart speaker with a superior sound quality, which will be launched in 2018.Moreover, we believe that foray into fast-growing technologies like autonomous vehicle, artificial intelligence (AI) & AR/VR are other long-term catalysts.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Apple sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

36,AVGO,"The United States Senate just passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, marking President Donald Trump’s first major legislative conquest. The highlight of the reform is the slash in corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% that is expected to boost the bottom line of the companies.However, the technology sector is unlikely to benefit much from the reforms owing to the fact that  it already enjoys several tax benefits and therefore has a lower effective tax rate. Citing S&P Global data, Bloomberg stated, “Among sectors, the 18.5 percent effective tax rate enjoyed by the group is the third-lowest among U.S. large caps.”This was also evident from the sector’s not so impressive run in early December 2017 when investors were moving their funds into sectors which had higher scope for gains. As a matter of fact, just after the Republican Senate passed the bill with a 51-49 majority on Dec 2 morning, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined approximately 2% in next two trading days.Nevertheless, we believe that the technology sector, which has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, augmented/virtual reality devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) related software is capable of  regaining momentum in 2018.In fact, investors also soon realized that the early December plunge across the technology sector is an opportunity to invest in stocks that were too pricey earlier.Here are a few stocks that saw a decline in their prices in early December following a shift in investors’ focus toward other sectors. But these stocks enjoy strong fundamentals and thus are well poised for growth.Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) is one such stock which is still available at discount compared with with Dec 1 closing price. We believe that the company has several driving factors, which can help it gain going ahead.The company is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. The trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2018. Moreover, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment. Additionally, Broadcom’s focus on multiple target markets mitigates operating risks and lessens the exposure to volatility in any single market. Based on its expanding product portfolio, the company is well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G.The company’s Zack’s Rank #1 and VGM Score of B are further testaments to its upside potential. The VGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum, across the board.Broadcom Ltd.

37,AVGO,"While a rise in interest rates might diminish the attractiveness of dividend stocks, these will still be in demand on optimism surrounding the biggest tax overhaul in decades. This is because lower corporate taxes will boost companies’ profits leading to handsome dividends and in turn lead to outperformance of stocks with a history of year-over-year dividend growth.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these make dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:Louisiana-based H&E Equipment Services Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report) is one of the largest integrated equipment service companies in the United States with full-service facilities throughout the Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast & Southeast regions of the United States.

38,AVGO,"Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) recently unveiled the Intel Stratix 10MX FPGA, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated with High Bandwidth Memory DRAM (HBM2) for high performance computing (HPC) systems. This will provide users up to 10 times more memory bandwidth compared to stand alone DDR memory solutions.The combination of HBM2 and FPGAs caters to high bandwidth memory interface required for next generation training in deep learning, HPC and routing applications. Intel Stratix 10 MX FPGA provides a memory bandwidth of 512 gigabytes per second for HPC systems and is based on 14-nm technology.The company’s HBM2-based FPGAs are able to compress and accelerate larger data movements compared to stand alone FPGAs. Additionally, the integration of HPDA with FPGA will boost real-time data acceleration in streaming data pipeline frameworks like Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.The company expects the new chip to expand both the onboard memory pool and add more bandwidth, thereby increasing the interconnect performance between the CPU and the associated MIC (Many Integrated Cores). We believe that the launch will improve the scalability, reliability, power and density requirements of future HPC deployments.According to ReynetteAu, vice president of marketing, Intel Programmable Solutions Group, “We designed the Intel Stratix 10 MX family to provide a new class of FPGA-based multi-function data accelerators for HPC and HPDA markets.”To ConcludeWe note that Intel has outperformed the industry over the last six months. While the company’s shares returned 32.7%, the industry gained 31.1%.Intel is riding high on robust performance from the data-centric portion of its business. Data Center Group, Internet-of-Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group form the crux of the company’s data-centric business model.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in the data centers from the cloud-based service providers like Amazon.com, Alphabet and Microsoft is a key catalyst for Intel.However, intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices is a concern.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderIntel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report).

Revenues of 1.42 billion also increased 6% year over year also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 billion.The impressive second-quarter results were driven by the company’s successful ongoing transition from underperforming segments to growth oriented sectors like all-flash arrays and hybrid cloud and Data Fabric strategies.NetApp, Inc. Revenue (TTM) NetApp, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | NetApp, Inc. QuoteAdditionally, the company has a positive outlook toward the phenomenal rate of data growth since its cloud-integrated all-flash solution fits well with the hybrid cloud infrastructure.NetApp has been witnessing higher demand for its flash-based solutions which have been a major contributor toward the company’s revenue growth. Moreover, the acquisition of SolidFire has further enhanced NetApp’s position in the all-flash array market.Positive Outlook For third-quarter fiscal 2018, NetApp expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 86-94 cents.

41,AVGO,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 21. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.33%. Also, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.22%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Influencing FactorsPaychex is a provider of payroll and integrated human resource, and employee benefits outsourcing solutions. It caters to the small- to medium-sized businesses (SMB) in the United States and is expected to continue benefiting from its strong domain expertise, going ahead.In fact, Paychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are impressive. Also, product launches and joint venture initiatives in a less-than-half-penetrated market are encouraging.Meanwhile, the company’s top-line continues to be boosted by its inorganic growth strategies. In this context, Paychex’s acquisition of HROI in August is worth mentioning. This is because this buyout is expected to drive this payroll and human resource solutions provider’s clientele and revenues.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. Due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention, the company’s payroll client base remained flat in the previous quarter. Additionally, political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market affected the company’s client base.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing, Insperity, Intuit, H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.

42,AVGO,"It seems that Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is firing on all cylinders to expand its data-center business across different regions. Yesterday the company announced a deal to buy Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan’s all the equity interests held in the Metronode group of companies for a total cash consideration of A$1.035 billion or approximately US$792 million. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the first half of 2018.By leveraging Metronode’s sturdy local presence, Equinix will be able to further penetrate into the Australian and broader Asia-Pacific region, which is currently one of the fastest growing markets. Notably, Equinix currently generates approximately 21% of its revenues from the Asia-Pacific region.The acquisition will add 10 data-center facilities to Equinix in Australia, in turn increasing its total number of IBX data centers to 15. Also, total number of IBX data centers across the Asia-Pacific region will reach 40.Acquisitions have remained one of the key growth strategies for Equinix. The company remains optimistic on this rising demand for data centers. To meet the growing demand for cloud services, this global interconnection and data-center company has been expanding its IBX data centers globally and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management.Therefore, the company anticipates its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2013 to 2017, and reach $24.0 billion. Based on this projection, Equinix estimates a revenue growth rate of 10% through 2017.Consequently, we believe by acquiring the Metronode data center, Equinix will be in a better position to capitalize on this opportunity. Moreover, the deal will help the company fortify its global footprint and bring in additional revenues. The latest buyout deal will also increase the company’s global data-center count to 200 across 52 countries.Currently, Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have gained 28.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 13.3% rally.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

43,AVGO,"The word FANG essentially means a large sharp tooth associated with dogs or wolves. No wonder it conjures frightening images of werewolves or Dracula in the general populace, who are steeped in myths and legends. But don’t you worry, this article isn’t meant to spook you with such stories.FANG here represents the most well-liked and high performing tech stocks in the market that have generated impressive returns for the investors. The term was popularized by CNBC's Mad Money host Jim Cramer.The word is an acronym where ""F"" stands for Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), ""A"" stands for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), then there is the ""N,"" which stands for Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), finally the ""G"" which is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), commonly referred to as Google.These four technology powerhouses have performed phenomenally this year. Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have all posted gains of at least 50%, while Alphabet gained more than 30% on a year-to-date basis. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 posted rallies of 28.8% and 17.4%, respectively so far this year.FANG – The RulersFacebook and Alphabet dominate the U.S digital ad market. Per the latest report from eMarketer, both these companies are expected to hold 63.1% share of the total domestic digital ad market, up from the earlier expected number of 60.4% in 2017.Their target advertising capabilities draw advertisers to these platforms, adds eMarketer. A giant user base is another major draw. Facebook has over 2 billion users while its subsidiary, Instagram has over 800 million users.Alphabet's strong advertising revenues and improving paid click growth remain the primary catalysts. Its focus on innovation, AI, cloud, home automation space, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. Alphabet has shown good execution to date, more or less maintaining dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market.Amazon rules e-commerce and cloud services with its Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) business. The company is benefiting from strong growth across all its businesses and especially the retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. On a global basis, AWS is now accessible across 46 Availability Zones (AZs) through 17 technology infrastructure regions worldwide. These AZs enable businesses to save costs, accelerate innovation, expedite the time to market as well as expand geographic presence within minutes.Netflix is one of the leading video streaming platforms driven by expanding content portfolio and subscriber base. Its growing subscriber base is the primary factor that helps it generate significant revenues. The company remains confident of adding more subscribers as the trend of binge viewing is catching up fast. Netflix now has over 109 million subscribers globally. We believe continuing subscriber addition and expanding content portfolio are the key catalysts that will help Netflix to sustain growth going forward.Despite remarkable growth of the FANG stocks, these aren't the largest standout in the tech sector this year. A small number of companies have posted gains that have crushed the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google this year. Notably, all four of these tech companies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Our ChoicesHere are some notable tech companies that have outperformed the FANG bigwigs, in order of performance.Moreover, these stocks either have a  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).NVIDIA Corp.

Per management’s anticipation, revenues declined 2.8% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal weakness in demand for broadband access and set-top box products.Broadcom stated that a slowdown in demand for optical products from access and metro networks hurt the top line. However, demand from data centers was strong in the quarter.Wireless Communications (37% of total revenues) were up 33.4% year over year and 40% quarter over quarter to roughly $1.80 billion. The strong growth was driven by the ramp up in shipments of next-generation platform from the company’s large North American smartphone customer. Higher dollar content in this platform also drove top-line growth.Enterprise Storage (13% of total revenues) increased 15% from the year-ago quarter but plunged 12.2% sequentially to $645 million. The sequential decline was due to lower hard-drive disks (HDDs).However, servers and storage connectivity business reported strong results driven by an increase in demand from Intel Corporation’s (INTC  -  Free Report) Purley server launch cycle.Industrial & other (5% of total revenues) soared 58.6% year over year and 8% sequentially to $257 million. The strong growth was driven by a significant increase in IP licensing revenues.

The move will also smoothen regulatory hurdles.GuidanceFor first-quarter fiscal 2018, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $5.30 billion (+/- $75 million).The seasonal decline in demand for set-top box and broadband access products are expected to negatively impact Wired Infrastructure revenues in the first-quarter. However, the downside trend is projected to improve beyond the quarter, primarily driven by increasing traction of 10G technology to support broadband video delivery.Wireless Communications revenues are projected to grow sequentially owing to strong demand from the large North American customer. For the rest of 2018, Broadcom expects significant increase in FBAR content driven by the need for additional filtering at the antenna.Moreover, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment.Management stated that Enterprise Storage segment results in the first-quarter of fiscal 2018 will benefit from the Purley product cycle and recovery in HDD demand.

46,AVGO,"With President Donald Trump closer to his major legislative move — the biggest tax overhaul in decades — investors have started chasing dividend growth stocks. This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies’ profitability leading to fatty dividends and in turn benefit stocks having a history of dividend growth year over year.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report): This Illinois-based full-service real estate firm provides management services, corporate and financial services and investment management services to corporations and other real estate owners, users and investors worldwide.

47,AVGO,"Just when you thought earnings season was over… shares of both lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) are up in late trading today following their respective Q3-18 and Q4-17 earnings reports. Even beneath their headline beats, both companies raised guidance and supplied investors with plenty of goodies heading into holiday season.Broadcom, noteworthy lately for its move to buy out like-sized competitor Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), outperformed analyst expectations on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of $4.59 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus of $4.52 on quarterly revenues of $4.85 billion, better than the $4.83 billion analysts were looking for. Guidance for fiscal Q1 2018 on the top line was raised to around $5.3 billion, well beyond the Q4 actual and the Q1 estimate of around $4.8 billion.A full $2.2 billion in revenues came from the company’s Wired business, with $1.8 billion coming from Wireless. Further, Broadcom has considerably upped its interim quarterly dividend by 72%. Shares are up more than a point and a half in after-hours trading, but have been trading down since Thanksgiving.lululemon, for its part, brought forth a 4-cent beat on its bottom line to 56 cents per share. Quarterly revenues easily surpassed the $610 million expected to $619 million in the quarter. This marks the third-straight positive earnings surprise, with a trailing 4-quarter average positive surprise of 8.5%. Comps rose 7% in the quarter, but with limited brick-and-mortar options (388 stores overall) it’s clear much of this growth for lululemon has come on-line. The company also raised Q4 guidance.

48,AVGO,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 4. The company is benefiting from strong demand for Wi-Fi chips and radio frequency solutions from smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).Moreover, rapid adoption of connectivity-related products in Internet of Things (IoTs) appliances and automobiles is a growth driver in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Broadcom’s extensive product portfolio serves multiple applications within four primary end markets — wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial & others. The company’s focus on multiple target markets and geographies mitigates operating risks and lessens exposure to volatility in any single market.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.79%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.74%. Broadcom Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Broadcom Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Broadcom Limited Quote Broadcom’s shares have returned 53.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 37.3% rally of the industry. The company completed the long-delayed Brocade acquisition in the quarter, which removes a major overhang from the stock.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Wired Segment View DismalWired infrastructure segment accounts for almost 50% of total revenues. Last quarter, segment revenues were driven by seasonally strong demand for set-top box products as well as merchant and custom silicon products from datacenters.However, management expects segment revenues to decline sequentially due to seasonal weakness in demand for the company’s broadband access products.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wired Infrastructure segment revenues are currently pegged at $2.15 billion.Wireless Benefits From Strong DemandWireless Communications comprise roughly 29% of total revenues. Last quarter, the rise in production volumes of the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s (Apple) next-gen platform (iPhone X) drove revenues.Broadcom expects the higher dollar content in the next-gen platform to drive strong year-over-year and sequential segment revenue growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wireless Communications segment revenues are currently pegged at $1.73 billion.Lower HDD Demand to Hurt Enterprise Storage SalesEnterprise Storage accounts for almost 17% of total revenues. Last quarter, revenues benefited from strong demand for the company’s Hard Disk Drive (HDD) products, which however, were expected to fall sharply. This will hurt Enterprise Storage revenues in the current quarter.However, strong growth expectation in the server and storage connectivity business will fully offset the negative impact from HDDs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Enterprise Storage segment revenues are currently pegged at $670 million.Earnings WhisperBroadcom is likely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 due to a favorable combination of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +0.63%.This is because, per our model, a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

50,AVGO,"While we are not in a traditionally busy stretch for earnings reports, there are still several noteworthy companies set to announce their latest results in the upcoming week. Q3 earnings have been strong across the board, so it will be interesting to see whether these reports will continue that trend and inspire strong trading for the remainder of the calendar year.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of December 4.1.       Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report)Dave & Buster’s is scheduled to report its latest earnings results after the market closes on December 5. Thanks to its unique arcade-eatery style restaurants, Dave & Buster’s was able to stick out in the struggling retail restaurant industry throughout 2016. But that momentum did not continue into 2017, and shares of PLAY are down about 5% on the year.Heading into its report date, Dave & Buster’s is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Our latest consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $0.24 per share and revenues of $255.38 million, which would represent year-over-year growth rates of -6.00% and +11.68%.PLAY has successfully surpassed earnings estimate in 12 consecutive quarters, but its stock has failed to respond positively recently. Rising labor costs should drag down profits, and a lack of international exposure means the company won’t benefit from an improved global economy. 2.       Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report)Semiconductor giant Broadcom is slated to release its latest quarterly report after the closing bell on December 6. After its bid for Qualcomm (QCOM) was rejected, Broadcom will look to prove to investors—and potential takeover targets—that its financial position is strong. Shares of AVGO are already up over 55% this year.As we approach its report date, Broadcom is sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Paired with its Earnings ESP of 0.63%, this strong Zacks Rank makes us feel more comfortable about its chances to exceed expectations this quarter. Broadcom has met or surpassed estimates in 13 straight quarters.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Broadcom to report earnings of $4.50 per share and revenues of $4.82 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of +29.57% and +16.64%, respectively. 3.       Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report)Lululemon is scheduled to report its latest financial results after the market closes on December 6. This yoga-inspired athletic apparel retailer is still growing, especially in terms of brand recognition and popularity, but its stock has failed to generate much momentum. Shares of LULU have gained just 3% so far this year.Heading into its upcoming earnings announcement, Lululemon is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our latest consensus estimates, the company is expected to post earnings of $0.52 per share and revenues of $611.47 million. These results would mark year-over-year growth rates of +10.77% and 12.32%, respectively.Lululemon has surpassed earnings estimates in two consecutive quarters, and with an Earnings ESP of 0.12%, our model shows that investors could be in store for another beat next week. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

51,AVGO,"Coupa Software Inc. (COUP  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 4. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 37.94%.In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41.18%. Moreover, Coupa beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in three of the last four quarters.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are anticipated in the range of $44.8-45.3 million. Subscription revenues are forecast between $40.8 million and $41.3 million, while professional services revenues are projected at approximately $4 million.Management projects non-GAAP gross margins between 67% and 69%. Moreover, non-GAAP loss from operations is anticipated in the range of $5.5-$6.5 million. Net loss is anticipated in the range of 10-12 cents per share. COUPA SOFTWARE Price and EPS Surprise COUPA SOFTWARE Price and EPS Surprise | COUPA SOFTWARE QuoteNotably, Coupa’s shares have returned 41.7% year to date, slightly better than the 29.8% rally of the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors    Coupa provides unified, cloud-based spend management platform that helps enterprises keep a tab of daily expenditures. Cumulative spending over the platform since its launch has surpassed $500 billion (at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018). This reflects growing adoption of its solutions by the likes of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report), Caterpillar, Unilever and others.Moreover, an expanding partner base is expected to drive top-line growth. The partnership with Software AG makes it easy for companies to integrate Coupa with most leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, including those from SAP and Oracle. The company has expanded CoupaLink certified solutions by adding Software AG’s webMethods Connector.In the last quarter, Coupa launched its next-generation cloud platform and added more than 70 new capabilities. We believe that the platform will help the company gain new customers rapidly, which will drive result in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Moreover, the availability of Coupa Open Buy with Amazon Business in the United States is a growth driver.Earnings WhisperNevertheless, Coupa is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in third-quarter fiscal 2018 due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This is because, as per our model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for this to happen.

52,AVGO,"Continuing its earnings streak alive for the 10th time in a row, Ambarella Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2018. In fact, the company beat its projections at every point — revenues and margins.However, on a year-over-year basis, its top- and bottom-line results registered declines mainly due to substantial plunge in chip sales to GoPro Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report), softness in the drone market as well as elevated operating expenses.Let’s discuss the quarterly results in detail.Quarter in DetailThe company’s fiscal third-quarter revenues decreased 11.4% year over year to $89.1 million, mainly due to decline in drone and GoPro sports cameras revenues, partially offset by strong performances in the IP security, auto and non-GoPro wearable markets.However, quarterly revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89 million and came toward the higher-end of management’s guidance range of $87.5-$90.5 million. Moreover, excluding sales to GoPro, revenues were up 7.2% to $70.6 million. Sales to GoPro significantly declined year over year from $34.6 million to $18.4 million. During the fiscal third quarter, GoPro’s contribution to total revenues was down to 20.7% from 30% in the year-ago quarter.Apart from GoPro, WT Microelectronics and Chicony were the two companies which have contributed more than 10% to Ambarella’s fiscal third-quarter total revenues. WT Microelctronics’ contribution totaled50.6%, while Chicony contributed 11.9%.On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported gross margin of 64%, which came in 230 basis points (bps) lower than the year-ago quarter. However, the figure came in 100 bps higher than the previous quarter, mainly driven by better IP security product mix and increase in sports camera revenues. Also, the fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP gross margin was higher than management’s earlier guidance of 62-63.5%.Non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $27.2 million, up from $24.2 million incurred in the year-ago quarter and $25.4 million in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Operating expenses flared up primarily due to escalating chip-development costs which more than offsets the benefit from a decline in the provision for annual executive bonuses. However, non-GAAP operating expenses came below the company’s previously guided range of $28-$29.5 million.Non-GAAP operating income dipped to $29.8 million from $42.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin contracted 880 bps to 33.4% in the reported quarter chiefly due to reduced gross margin and soaring operating expenses.Non-GAAP net income plunged to $25.7 million from $38.4 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. On per share basis, the company’s earnings came in at 75 cents, witnessing a substantial decline from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.11. The year-over-year fall stemmed from lower revenues and elevated operating expenses. However, the figure came well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents.Ambarella, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ambarella, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ambarella, Inc. QuoteBalance SheetAmbarella ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents & marketable securities of $414 million, up from $400.1 million recorded in the previous quarter.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 269,540 shares, for a total cash consideration of $12.8 million. Since the inception of its share-repurchase programs in June 2016, the company has bought back a total of 1,433,137 shares for a total consideration of $71.7 million. Ambarella has approximately $35 million remaining under the $50-million repurchase program, which commenced on Jul 1, 2017.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to be between $68 million and $72 million (mid-point $70 million), down 17.7-22.3% from the year-earlier quarter. The guidance at the mid-point is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.4 million.The company predicts that the considerable decline in GoPro revenues as well as the moderate fall in the drone market will adversely affect the next quarter’s top-line performance. Additionally, it believes shortage of high-speed memory will thwart its revenues for the coming few quarters. However, Ambarella anticipates strong year-over-year revenue growth in IP security (both professional and consumer), as well as solid growth in automotive and non-sports wearable.Non-GoPro revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to plummet to $13 million from $30.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 62.0% and 63.5%, as compared with 67.2% recorded in the year-ago quarter. The contraction will be due to increase in China security revenues and decline in sports camera revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated between $28.5 million and $30 million, up sequentially due to “chip takeout fees and engineering headcount increases.”The company did not give any update on fiscal 2018 outlook. The company, during its fiscal second-quarter earnings conference call, has projected revenues to decline in the range of 3-7% in fiscal 2018. The company anticipates that excluding GoPro and ODMs, its revenues will lie between 9% and 12%.However, the company did not provide any update on other fiscal 2018 expectations. During its fiscal first-quarter call, Ambarella had provided these forecasts. Gross margins are estimated to move toward the high-end of its target margin range of 59-62%, while operating expense is expected to flare up 12-14% over fiscal 2017 levels.Following the impressive earnings release, the company’s shares have gained 4.4% in the after-hours trade. An encouraging fiscal fourth-quarter guidance also contributed to yesterday’s gain.Notably, Ambarella’s shares have underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has been up just 0.3% during the period, while the industry has returned 39.2%.Currently, Ambarella carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space are Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Rambus, Inc. (RMBS  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

53,AVGO,"On Nov 28, we issued an updated research report on Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report).Broadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. Higher dollar content at the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s next-gen platform is a key catalyst.Moreover, completion of the long-delayed Brocade acquisition will boost the company’s position in the storage area networking (SAN) space.However, gross margin is expected to contract slightly due to unfavorable product mix (higher mix of low margin wireless business).Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus  Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus | Broadcom Limited Quote Broadcom shares have returned 56.9% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally of 43.4%.Expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)Broadcom’s expanding product portfolio makes it well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. Broadcom has strong ties with leading OEMs across multiple target markets that will help it to gain key insights into the requirements of customers.We believe that the company’s extensive product portfolio, which serves multiple applications within four primary end markets (Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial & Other), will help it to gain significant market share in the long haul.Moreover, the company recently launched its first-ever silicon-proven 7nm intellectual property (IP) targeting application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platform for deep learning and networking markets.Acquisitions Strengthen Broadcom’s PortfolioAcquisitions have played a significant role in deciding Broadcom’s growth trajectory. The addition of Brocade will help the company further penetrate the FC SAN market and garner competitive prowess in the long run.Broadcom is now targeting Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report). The company had offered $70 per share, which was rejected by Qualcomm’s board as it undermined the company’s value.However, Broadcom remains committed to pursue the Qualcomm acquisition. Earlier this month, the company announced its intent to redomicile in the United States. Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore with headquarters there as well as in San Jose, CA.The redomiciling will help Broadcom to aggressively pursue the Qualcomm bid, which is rumored to be around $77 per share. Moreover, the company is planning to attempt a hostile takeover by placing its chosen members at Qualcomm’s board during the shareholder meeting set for Mar 6, 2018.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBroadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) are other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. Both sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The Zacks consensus estimate is pegged at $128.6 million.  We expect the company to continue delivering robust top-line growth in the fiscal third quarter driven by strength across international markets, including EMEA and Japan, and growing add-on products.Also, the company has been continuously investing in security, compliance and administrative technology, and has plans of hiring more sales personnel. These investments and partnerships with leading enterprises, namely Cognizant, Google and Adobe among others, will help the company to capitalize on increasing adoption of cloud computing technologies and the need for secure collaboration.However, continuous investments in research and development could dent margins as well as profits going ahead.On a non-GAAP basis, the company projects loss per share in the range of 13 cents to 14 cents for the upcoming quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at loss of 13 cents.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if these have a negative Earnings ESP.

55,AVGO,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) recently announced the first-ever silicon-proven 7nm intellectual property (IP) targeting application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platform for deep learning and networking.The IP cores are built on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM  -  Free Report) 7nm process technology. The on-die computation required for training and inference of deep learning applications is expected to benefit from ultra-high density logic and memory of the 7nm ASIC platform.The combination of CoWoS packaging and HBM2/3 PHY caters to high bandwidth memory interface required for next generation training in deep learning, high performance computing (HPC) and routing applications.The platform’s SerDes cores (112G and 56G SerDes) are beneficial for switching and routing applications and inter-node connections in HPC applications and deep learning. The IP portfolio also supports SoC integration for 5G requirements.We believe this to aid Broadcom’s top-line growth going ahead.Growth FactorsBroadcom stock has gained 55.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 40.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. The growth can be attributed to the company’s robust top-line growth and steady execution.Broadcom benefits from strong demand of its wireless solutions. Higher dollar content at the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s (Apple) next-gen platform (iPhone) is also a positive for the company. Robust industrial re-sales are also tailwinds.Notably, the company’s recent acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems is expected to boost Broadcom’s position in the storage area networking space.Broadcom is currently eyeing Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). The latter has already turned down the recent takeover bid of $130-billion (includes $25 billion of net debt) on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently a leading player in the chipset market. However, the company is planning to raise the bid amount for Qualcomm, per Reuters.We believe that Broadcom’s product portfolio, enhanced by the offerings of its acquired entities, is a major tailwind. However, increasing competition from industry peers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Sumitomo remains a concern.Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) | Broadcom Limited QuoteZacks RankBroadcom has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

56,AVGO,"Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) has put all speculations to rest and confirmed today morning that it has entered into an agreement to acquire its smaller competitor Cavium Inc. . The transaction, which involves a mix of cash and stock, is valued at approximately $6 billion.Per the agreement, Marvell will pay $40 per share and 2.1757 of its common shares for each Cavium share. This means, post buyout, shareholders of Cavium will own 25% of the combined companies share. Marvell intends to fund the acquisition with available cash in hand and $1.75 billion in debt.Cavium shares were trading almost 6% higher in the pre-market trading. The company also has an impressive price performance history. In the past three months, Cavium shares have rallied 26% compared with the industry’s gain of 11.3%. Currently, Marvell and Cavium carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Cavium?Marvell Technology is one of the leading providers of chips for hard disk drives. Meanwhile, Cavium offers software compatible processors that enable functionality in data center applications and network connectivity for server and switches. Therefore, the buyout is believed to provide Marvell Technology an opportunity to expand its offerings and an access to newer market.Furthermore, Cavium’s strategy of breaking into Intel Corporation’s (INTC  -  Free Report) lucrative hold on the server microprocessor market makes it the most feasible buyout for Marvell Technology, per a Bloomberg report. According to the report, Intel holds over 99% market share in this space.In fact, Cavium got a major breakthrough in the server microprocessor market early this year when it announced that Microsoft Azure cloud platform will run on its ARM-based processors instead of Intel’s. Therefore, we believe that Cavium buyout will give Marvell Technology a direct access to this lucrative market.An Effort to Rebuild ItselfThe latest deal is believed to be Marvell Technology’s one of the biggest step toward rebuilding itself after the massive accounting scandal in late 2015 that plagued the company’s financial results throughout fiscal 2016. In fact, the company has overcome its prior headwinds and refurbished its senior management as well.However, the new management had been facing a sever challenge in the form of sluggish growth prospects in the hard disk drive market.Under the leadership of Matthew J. Murphy (CEO), Marvell Technology seems to restructure its business to focus on growth segments like adding offerings in areas such as data centers and wireless communications, which are anticipated to boost revenues.The Cavium buyout is projected to be in line with the company’s aforementioned initiatives. We expect the acquisition to help in lowering its dependency on hard disk drive market that is currently stagnant due to availability of other data storage solutions.Marvell Technology has marginally outperformed the industry in the last three months. While the stock rallied 29.9%, the industry to which it belongs gained 28.7%. Going forward, the deal depicts another move toward the consolidation of semiconductor industry. Earlier this month Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) made a takeover bid of $103 billion for Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), which the latter rejected saying its too undervalued.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

57,AVGO,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) popped on Monday morning after Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) made its massive buyout proposal public.The official Broadcom announcement came after news began to surface late last week that the chipmaker planned to make a bid for Qualcomm. Broadcom’s proposal values the struggling semiconductor power at $130 billion, including $25 billion of net debt, according to the official news release.The deal marks a 28% premium compared to Qualcomm’s closing price on Thursday—the last day of trading before news of the deal began to surface. In Broadcom’s proposed plan, Qualcomm stockholders would receive $70 per share, made up of $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock.""This complementary transaction will position the combined company as a global communications leader with an impressive portfolio of technologies and products,” Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement.“We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination. With greater scale and broader product diversification, the combined company will be positioned to deliver more advanced semiconductor solutions for our global customers and drive enhanced stockholder value.""Broadcom projects that a combined company could effectively merge Qualcomm's cellular and wireless-based semiconductor business with its smartphone chip technology, data storage, and electronic displays business.California-based Broadcom expects a Qualcomm buyout would create “enhanced scale, reach and financial flexibility,” which would help the combined firm “accelerate innovation and deliver more advanced semiconductor solutions to its broad global customer base.”Qualcomm is still currently trying to negotiate a deal to buy fellow semiconductor company NXP (NXPI  -  Free Report). However, Broadcom made it clear that the company will try to complete its bid for Qualcomm whether the NXP deal goes through or not.Still, despite the hope for creating a more diversified business, regulators will likely play a large role in Broadcom’s proposed deal.Qualcomm is already dealing with its own regulatory concerns. South Korean and Taiwanese regulators have fined Qualcomm $853 million and $773 million, respectively, within the last year. Maybe more importantly, in terms of this new proposal, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm in January over antitrust concerns, although that case is still pending.On top of that, one of Qualcomm’s big-name customers, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), sued the company for unfair patent-licensing practices and has since stopped paying royalties.Shares of Qualcomm gained over 2% on Monday morning to hit as high as $65.32 per share. Before news of the deal began to surface, Qualcomm’s stock price had fallen nearly 5% on the year.On the opposite side of the proposed deal, Broadcom’s stock price fell over 2% on Monday morning but remained near its new 52-week high, which it reached on Friday. The company’s shares have soared nearly 55% in 2017.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

58,AVGO,"Will Qualcomm Reject Broadcom Offer?

59,AVGO,"We’ve got another busy week in store: more Q3 earnings and economic data, Republicans in U.S. Congress get busy working through the details of its massive tax reform program and the arrest in Saudi Arabia of a man known as “the Warren Buffett of the Middle East” are all grabbing headlines this morning. And we also see what appears to be a hostile bid by Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) to take over Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) for $70 per share, or $130 billion, including $60 billion in cash and Qualcomm debt.Should this merger deal be accepted, it would be the largest pure-tech deal in history, which would be accretive to Broadcom after the first year of the merge. But odds are very good Qualcomm will reject this proposal; though the company has acknowledged it has received the offer but given no indications that its board will find the terms favorable. Considering Qualcomm’s recent difficulties as a supplier of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) products, some may see this as Broadcom moving at a very advantageous time.Reports this morning are that Qualcomm officials are openly questioning the initial asking price, as well as antitrust issues, in what is understood to be an initially negative reaction. And would Apple’s involvement — behind the scenes, perhaps — somehow manage to facilitate this deal down the road in a way that puts Qualcomm’s issues with Apple behind them? One thing is for sure: this is a discussion just warming up; we expect to hear much more about this proposed deal throughout the rest of this week and beyond.Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, reportedly facing money laundering charges following a corruption purge by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, may cause some ripples through the U.S. markets this morning — especially in two of al-Waleed’s major holdings, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). Questions regarding Middle Eastern countries surrounding and necessarily affected by the crown prince’s moves, such as rival major power in the region, Iran, and Lebanon, which has had its own issues with stability at the top recesses of government.Futures in U.S. markets are so far shaking all of this off. We are in the green again this morning, following 8 straight weeks of an up-market. As we’ve discussed before here and elsewhere, at least some of this positive sentiment is a result of hopefulness that corporate tax cuts will create new windfalls for companies and their shareholders, perhaps even before the year is out.Q3 Earnings UpdateCVS Pharmacy (CVS  -  Free Report) beat estimates by a penny to $1.50 per share this morning, on in-line quarterly sales of $46.18 billion. Earnings are down year over year, but revenues were up 3.5%. CVS also upped its earnings guidance for full-year 2017.Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) well outperformed expectations before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.33 per share easily surpassing the 83 cents in the Zacks consensus, up 37% year over year. Fiscal Q2 2018 sales of $1.147 billion topped the $1.046 billion we had been expecting. Guidance for both fiscal Q3 and full-year 2018, on both top and bottom lines, were also raised.Mylan Pharma (MYL  -  Free Report), however, missed expectations on both earnings and revenues, with $1.10 per share short of the $1.22 we were looking for, and $3.0 billion in sales beneath the $3.08 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Weaker-than-expected performance in North America, underscored by a fall in EpiPen sales in the quarter, were cited in the company’s report.

62,AVGO,"Another wave of mergers and acquisitions has lashed on the hot semiconductor space. This is especially true as communications’ chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) has make an unsolicited bid to acquire the smartphone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) for $70 per share or $130 billion, including debt. The news was first flashed on Bloomberg last week.Under the terms of the bid, Broadcom would pay $60 per share in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock. This represents a 13% premium to Friday's closing price of $61.81.By acquiring Qualcomm, Broadcom could become the third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung Electronics. This is because the combination would mix Qualcomm’s dominance of chips that connect handsets to wireless networks with Broadcom’s expertise in chips that link devices to Wi-Fi networks (read: Here's What Investors Need to Know About Soaring Semiconductor ETFs).The combination would represent the biggest technology acquisition in history, dwarfing Dell Inc.’s $67 billion buyout of EMC in 2015. In addition, Broadcom is also expected to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI  -  Free Report), which Qualcomm agreed to buy in 2016 for $38 billion. The takeover is yet to be completed due to an ongoing antitrust investigation.The Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, if struck, would face heavy regulatory scrutiny given their sheer size, and heavy level of consolidation in the chip industry. The Bloomberg report came in a month when an ongoing legal battle with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) over wireless chip pricing, patents and alleged anticompetitive behavior has led to weak trading in Qualcomm’s stock. Before the report, shares of QCOM were down 16% this year compared with a 41% surge in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (read: Take a Bite of Apple's Blowout Earnings With Top-Ranked ETFs).Market ImpactThe news has led to rise of 3.7% in Qualcomm shares in pre-market trade at the time of writing while Broadcom is up 1.1%. The Bloomberg report propelled Qualcomm shares up as much as 19% on Friday, the biggest one-day move since October 2008 and made it the best performing stock on the S&P 500 index on Friday. The stock crushed its average daily volume figure as it exchanged about 81 million shares in hand compared with 9.2 million shares on average. Meanwhile, Broadcom shares rose about 5.5% on the day on elevated volumes of 12 million compared with the 2.8 million average.Notably, QCOM has a market capitalization of $91 billion while AVGO has a market cap of $112 billion.Given the expected deal, investors seeking to ride out the surging corner of the broad tech space in a diversified way could consider the following ETFs. Any of these funds could make for a compelling choice as most of these surged to new record highs following the news. The trend is likely to continue in the days ahead given their Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggesting their continued outperformance.Moreover, these products gained more than 1% on the day following the Bloomberg report and outpaced the gain of 0.95% for the broad tech fund PowerShares QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report), which targets the Nasdaq-100 Index (see: all the Technology ETFs here).iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 firms. Of these, QCOM and AVGO take the fourth and fifth positions in the basket with a combined 15.53% share.

63,AVGO,"At the recently concluded WSJ D. Live tech conference organised by The Wall Street Journal, Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) reassured that its proposed takeover of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) is on track. Notably, the deal was facing a few problems.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP. The buyout deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.In June, the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will conduct an in-depth probe to see if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.The EC has time till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision, although it has twice halted its review in the past -- once in June and again in August. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.On Oct 5, 2017, the U.S. mobile chipset giant had submitted its new proposal to the EC. According to Reuters, “Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.""It is important to note that in September, Qualcomm had extended the period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP. The tender offer will now expire on Oct. 20, 2017 at 5:00 p.m., New York City time.Notably, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August, Elliot Management had disclosed to having accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP’s outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March to 3.2% in September. Notably, at least 70% of NXP’s total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for the deal to click. Hence, it looks quite unlikely to succeed unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Also, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. In addition, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. In fact, the company’s business has remained stagnant for the last couple of years.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc.

64,AVGO,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently revised its proposed deal to takeover NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report) in order to get regulatory nod from the European Commission (EC), which is a major part of the European Union. Notably, Qualcomm’s proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors is facing a few problems.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has time till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. The EC has already halted its review twice -- once in June and again in August. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.On October 5, 2017, the U.S. mobile chipset giant submitted its new proposal to the EC. According to Reuters, “Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes.

65,AVGO,"Many Americans and investors continue to be focused on a group of four technology firms that have become some of the biggest companies in the world, known simply by the acronym “FANG.”The phrase, created and popularized by CNBC's Jim Cramer, refers toFacebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)—formally Google. These companies have all been extremely successful in recent years, experiencing continued sales growth and massive surges in their stock prices—which has spurred many investors to jump on board.Shares of FANG companies are all up over 20% since the start of the year, with Facebook’s 46.66% year-to-date price change leading the charge.Interestingly enough, Bank of American Merrill Lynch (BAC  -  Free Report) recently added two more names to the mix to create “FAAANG.” Savita Subramanian added Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) to the group of mega technology players.This might make some investors start to wonder if the core four FANG stocks are poised to keep growing this year, as several new companies are starting to be added to the conversation related to high-performance tech stocks.So are FANG stocks set to pop as we head full force into Q4? Let’s look to see how the next few quarters and the full-year are shaping up for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet.FacebookFacebook is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and the stock sports “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Based on our consensus estimates, Facebook’s current-quarter sales are projected to skyrocket 40.45%. For the full-year, the company’s revenues are set to pop 41.93% to hit as high as $40 billion. The social media giant’s earnings are set to pop 19.33% this quarter and 26.47% for the full year.Within the last 60 days, Facebook has received 11 upward earnings estimate revisions and zero negative revisions. During this same time frame, the firm has received 11 positive estimate revisions for the next quarter and 12 for the year, all without being downgraded.Amazon Despite Amazon’s extended run of success, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The firm’s “F” grade for Value in our Style Scores system helps to bring down its overall VGM grade, even with its “A” scores for both Growth and Momentum.The company’s 27.54% year-to-date price change is impressive and beats the S&P 500 average of 10.56%. But things could change for Amazon in the next few quarters. Over the last 60 days, the company has been dragged down by a wave of negative earnings estimate revisions, which greatly affect the Zacks Rank.The company has earned 10 downward revisions for its current quarter, and nine for its next quarter, while earning zero upward revisions. In this same 60-day time frame, Amazon has earned 11 downward revisions for both its current full-year and following year earnings estimates—again with no upward changes. Amazon’s sales are projected to continue to surge, with our consensus estimates calling for 28.45% growth this quarter and 28.71% growth for the year to hit an eye-popping $176.58 billion.But Amazon has spent billions and billions of dollars during its wave of expansion into almost every industry possible over the last few years. This has hurt the company’s bottom line and diminished potentially-larger earnings. Amazon’s earnings are expected to plummet 103.57% in its current quarter and 29.13% for the year.Netflix This streaming video company has obviously helped to shake up the movie and television industry as we know it. Netflix’s 45.96% year-to-date price change came in just below FANG category leader Facebook. This growth is set to continue, despite the company’s current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) status.Netflix’s revenues are expected to balloon to as high as $11.55 billion for its full-year, which would mark 30.47% year-over-year growth. Within the last 60 days, the streaming service has received 13 upward earnings estimate revisions and no downward changes. Within that same time frame, Netflix has earned 13 upward revisions and to just one negative for the full-year.Based on our consensus estimate, Netflix’s earnings are projected to pop 165.56% for its current quarter and soar 177.05% for the year.Google/Alphabet Alphabet’s market cap is the largest of the four FANG companies and its stock price has experienced a 21.75% year-to-date price change, which tops the S&P average but falls short of some of its peers’ more lofty gains. Google’s parent company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has received a mixed-bag of earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and the following quarter. For the full-year, Alphabet’s 13 negative earnings estimate revisions, with no upward changes, is the worst among FANG. Alphabet’s revenues are projected to gain around 20% for the quarter and the year to hit an upward estimate of $89.04 billion. However, the internet giant’s earnings are set to fall 7.39% for the quarter and 9.91% for the year.Bottom Line All four FANG tech companies are set to see their revenues jump at very impressive rates during the quarter and the year—with Facebook expected to post the biggest gains. Netflix’s earnings are projected to skyrocket almost 180% for the year. But Alphabet and Amazon are set to see major quarterly and full-year earnings declines.It seems, that for now, growth investors might want to consider Facebook and Netflix over the other two FANG firms. But Alphabet and Amazon are still likely strong long-term plays.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

67,AVGO,"Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI recently took the wraps off a buck converter, which it claims to be the industry’s first 16-V input, 40-A synchronous DC/DC buck converter.Known as TPS543C20 SWIFT, it features an internally compensated advanced-current-mode (ACM) control topology that supports frequency synchronization. The converter offers improved efficiency by integrating low resistance high- and low-side MOSFETs into small-footprint package that is thermally efficient.Two converters can be stacked side by side for handling loads up to 80 A for processors in power dense and space constrained applications.How is TI Poised?The new buck converter finds use in several markets such as communications, cloud computing and enterprise and thus should strengthen the company’s presence in these markets.As the company continues to leverage on its expertise in analog and embedded products and systems to launch compelling products for different markets, we believe the move is intended to boost TI’s Analog segment revenues.In the last reported quarter, the segment was up 6.9% sequentially and 18% from the year-ago quarter. It generated 65% of quarterly revenues. (Read more: Texas Instruments Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue Estimates)Wrapping UpThe move highlights Texas Instruments’ R&D investments in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.The company has been integrating different functionalities into single devices, encouraging customers to go for the simpler, more power efficient and smaller form factor products that could potentially lower the cost of ownership and could be used in the smallest of applications. For TI, this increases the dollar content per device, helping share gains and margin expansion. It also helps to fend off tough competition from the likes of Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

68,AVGO,"Shares of On Semiconductor Corp. (ON  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $17.51, eventually closing a tad lower at $17.38 on Sep 15.The share price momentum can primarily be attributed to the company’s growing diversified global customer base driven the Fairchild acquisition and the expansion of its own product portfolio.The increase in its customer base was reflected in the company’s second-quarter results as non-GAAP revenues were $1.338 billion, surging 52.4% year over year and 4.4% from the previous quarter, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 billion. The figure was also better than the guided range of $1.285–$1.335 billion.On Semiconductor stock has gained 36.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 20.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Driving FactorsNotably, the company’s September 2016 acquisition of Fairchild has aided top-line growth. Management expects to see further growth in Fairchild’s revenue contribution in the near term, driven by the company’s strong foothold in the power semiconductor market post the acquisition.Moreover, the Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) is growing at a steady pace and is expected to reach $42.4 billion by 2021, per MarketsandMarkets. We believe the accelerated growth of the ADAS market has increased the adoption rate of the related applications provided by On Semiconductor, thereby improving its growth opportunity in the automotive market.ON Semiconductor Corporation Revenue (TTM) ON Semiconductor Corporation Revenue (TTM) | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quote Further improving end markets, less customer and product concentration have aided the company’s impressive performance. Growing demand for the company’s CMOS image sensor is also a key catalyst.Thus, with all these key growth drivers the company is well placed for growth in the smartphone, automotive and industrial end markets. These have also provided the company with a competitive edge against the likes Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), Diodes Incorporated (DIOD  -  Free Report) and Infineon Technologies AG (IFNNY  -  Free Report).Zacks RankOn Semiconductor currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

69,AVGO,"According to an article in Svenska Dagblade, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) is planning to cut 25,000 jobs outside Sweden in a desperate bid to contain costs and take its restructuring efforts to the next level. Although CEO Börje Ekholm announced impending job cuts earlier this month, the sheer magnitude has left industry insiders stunned.Last month, the beleaguered infrastructure giant announced that it plans to double its 2016 underlying operating margin of 6% by ramping up its cost-reduction drive. To meet this end, Ericsson announced to implement cost savings with an annual run rate effect of at least SEK 10 billion ($1.2 billion) by mid-2018.Job Cuts in StoreOver the past year, the company has sacked 7000 jobs in North America. The company is striving hard to slash common and service delivery costs, while keeping research and development costs unaltered. Details of the latest planned layoffs has been kept under wraps, as Ericsson did not comment which departments or countries will bear most of the brunt.People familiar with the matter expect that the troubled media business, which is under review, and Managed Services division may be the worst affected. If sources are to be believed, Ericsson has plans to streamline operations by a whopping 80-90% in some markets and centralize operations in others.Headwinds GaloreThe premium networking, telecommunications equipment and services provider’s financial troubles over the past few years have been well documented. Ericsson’s repeated earnings misses, eroding profitability and precipitous revenue decline have left investors high and dry. Also, shrinking gross margins have been putting immense pressure on the bottom line. The stock has lost 9% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s average decline of 4.3%.Concurrent with its second-quarter 2017 results, the company slashed its full-year guidance, signaling bleak times ahead. Mr. Ekholm warned that an uncertain market could wipe out as much as SEK 5 billion ($600 million) of operating income over the next year. There is also an increased risk of market and customer project adjustments, which can have a negative impact of SEK 3-5 billion on the operating income in the coming 12 months.The consensus analyst community is showing no favor toward the stock, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 earnings has tumbled from 27 cents to 3 cents, dragged by three downward estimate revisions versus zero upward. Most of the company’s troubles have stemmed from drying-up investments by major telecom equipment makers across the world.These companies continue to slash investments in 4G and 3G services while waiting for the introduction of 5G networks. Ericsson expects a high single-digit percentage drop in the market for radio access networks this year, which is worse than previously expected. Also, sky-rocketing restructuring expenses, as part of itsconsistent efforts to turn around its ailing business, are making matters worse for Ericsson.Despite these challenges, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company believes that its cost-streamlining efforts, with focus on structural changes, will help generate lasting efficiency gains and boost cost competitiveness. Also, the company’s focus on stabilizing its IT and cloud-product portfolio, and Managed Services business is expected to be conducive to long-term growth.It remains to be seen whether Ekholm’s restructuring plan can help Ericsson improve profitability and revitalize its leadership in technology and markets.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

70,AVGO,"salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 22. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 20%. Additionally, the stock has a mixed earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, matching in one and missing in the other occasion. However, the average earnings surprise remains positive at 2.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLast quarter, although Salesforce disappointed on the earnings front, it continued to witness solid growth in revenues. The improvement was primarily attributed to the rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, contributed to this improvement. We expect this trend to continue in the second quarter as well.A higher number of deal wins and geographical contributions are also likely to boost results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Overall, the company’s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain growth catalysts. Moreover, strategic acquisitions and resultant synergies are anticipated to drive the fiscal second-quarter results.Considering increased customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm –Gartner – acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. We believe that the rapid adoption of the company’s platforms indicates solid prospects in the expanding cloud computing space, which will, in turn, bolster results in the quarter to be reported.On the flip side, although the company has been growing reasonably in the cloud market, its prospects have been rationalized to a considerable extent due to intensifying competition from Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Oracle Corp. and SAP AG. In addition, currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments in international expansion and data centers could hurt the bottom line in the fiscal second-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Salesforce will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 9 cents comes in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Vmware, Inc. (VMW  -  Free Report), scheduled to release earnings on Aug 24, currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.88% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Notably, the company has positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 21.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSynopsys posted impressive second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.

72,AVGO,"NetApp Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2018 results on Aug 16. Notably, the company’s earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four trailing quarters, with an average positive surprise of 23.5%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.88%. Non-GAAP earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) surged 56.4% from the year-ago quarter and almost 5% sequentially to 86 cents.Revenues increased 7.3% from the year-ago quarter and 5.5% from the previous quarter to $1.48 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 billion.The fiscal first-quarter 2018 guidance has been affected by seasonality. Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of 49–57 cents per share, which reflects 15% growth year over year at the midpoint. The unimpressive outlook has adversely impacted the share price momentum. NetApp stock has gained 19.4% year to date, underperforming the 21.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to ConsiderNetApp is now focused on expanding its total addressable market (TAM) by growing product portfolio and strengthening its dominant position in all-flash arrays and converged infrastructure markets. We believe that continuing penetration into Tier 1 SAN market will drive top-line growth.NetApp, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise NetApp, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | NetApp, Inc. QuoteMoreover, the company’s introduction of new hybrid cloud offerings such as NetApp HCI, an enterprise-scale hyper converged solution, is a positive for the company and may add to its customer base. Moreover, NetApp plans to expand its strategic partnership with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) for enhancement of hybrid cloud services. This is also anticipated to drive the top line growth.We believe that the growing adoption of NetApp’s SolidFire (acquired in 2016) is a major tailwind for the company’s top-line growth. Further, the company is also focusing on expanding its international operations, which will further drive results.However, tepid IT spending raises concerns about the company’s near-term performance.

We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.80%.In the last quarter, Cisco delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.89%. Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings increased 5.3% on a year-over-year basis to 60 cents, which was slightly better than management’s guided range of 57–59 cents.However, revenues declined 0.5% year over year to $11.94 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.89 billion. Management had anticipated revenues to decline in the range of 2% or remain flat on a year-over-year basis.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to decline in the range of 6–4% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $12.06 billion, which reflects a year-over-year decline of 4.54%.

Notably, the company has been losing market share and witnessing declining revenues trend due to the aforementioned factors.Nonetheless, the acquisition of AppDynamics in March has helped the company to gain traction in the application and business monitoring space. Moreover, the ongoing evolution to a software-centric company is positive in our view.Further, partnerships with the likes of Pure Storage, salesforce.com and IBM will also positively impact the to-be-reported quarterly results.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cisco will beat earnings this quarter.

74,AVGO,"We expect Alibaba Group (BABA  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fiscal first-quarter 2017 results on Aug 17.The Chinese e-commerce goliath caters mainly to its native market. It operates as a platform for third-party sellers. It neither sells goods directly to merchants nor holds inventory.Last quarter, the company missed estimates, resulting in a negative earnings surprise of 17.02%.However, its surprise history has been impressive as it topped estimates in three of the last four quarters at an average beat of over 20.53%. Year to date, the stock has rallied 72.8%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 44%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Alibaba Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Alibaba has the right combination of two key components.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +4.11%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alibaba Group has a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with an ESP of +4.11% make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Alibaba has a huge (nearly 80%) share of the Chinese e-commerce market, one of the largest markets globally, and a market where consumers are increasingly turning to online channels to purchase quality products and global brands. China is Alibaba’s greatest strength and serving the Chinese customer is what has taken the company to the top. The company has been witnessing top-line growth of more than 40% for the past several quarters.But Alibaba isn’t resting on its laurels. This is because it isn’t just China but also other Asian markets that will see a rise in online shoppers. This has prompted it to invest in Lazada, a Singapore-based e-commerce company founded by Germany-based Rocket Internet. India is another big e-commerce market with several local players. Alibaba has bought stakes in these players, possibly preparing the road for a full-blown entry.Having been around long enough to establish logistical relationships through Cainiao, payments processing through Ant Financial and a solid core commerce model, Alibaba has been guzzling data that it is in an increasingly better position to use for improving customer experience and feeding its AI initiatives.Ant Financial, which runs Alipay, has a total of 450 million active users and processes 170 million transactions per day. Alicloud, which grew 103% in the last quarter, is also seeing enhancements. Alibaba is in the process of negotiations with ZTE for the purchase of its telecom gear-making subsidiary ZTEsoft Technology Co.All these factors are likely to have played a role in the very strong revenue targets management set for the year. Accordingly, management expects that e-commerce, cloud, digital media and entertainment, and of course international expansion will contribute to revenue growth of around 45-49%, or over $34 billion this year.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks, which you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.

75,AVGO,"Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal third-quarter 2017 results on Aug 17.  Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.95%.The company’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average of 3.35%.Coming to share price movement, Applied Materials’ shares have returned 33.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 34.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayApplied Materials reported strong fiscal second-quarter results, with both the top and the bottom lines coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Applied Materials has a solid product line and management has stepped up investments to prepare for the ongoing transition to larger wafer sizes and smaller process nodes. The ramp up in FinFET, 3D NAND and new display technology will likely be the catalysts.Moreover, the company remains strongly positioned in China where it continues to see strong growth in semiconductor orders. Growing investments from Chinese domestic manufacturers will continue to be the main catalysts.There is also scope for share gains on the Display side of the business. New display technologies like OLED are opening up new market opportunities for Applied Materials. The available market opportunity is now more than 10 times that of traditional LCD.Developing trends in mobility, connectivity, video and wearable devices are fueling growth in the industry. This, in turn, is expediting advancement in mobile processors, solid-state storage and interactive displays.The company has focused its structure and talent around key areas of value creation. It plans to align its product portfolio in a way that it generates the best returns for clients.All these factors will likely lead the company to report decent results in the upcoming quarter.

76,AVGO,"Voxeljet AG (VJET  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 14, after the closing bell.The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 16.7% in the last reported quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOver the past few quarters, Voxeljet has undertaken a host of strategic and operational initiatives to drive improvement in business. These actions are starting to take hold, as evidenced by the company’s improving margin performance. We believe that improved operational execution will prove conducive to the bottom-line performance for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.In terms of geography, we believe Germany and the U.S. will continue to act as strongest revenue churners. To further ramp up sales, the company has been moving its systems team into the new and increased production facility in Germany. Voxeljet believes that this state-of-the-art facility, which is equipped to handle demand of future machine generation, will supplement sales growth for the upcoming quarter.Moreover, steady increase in the demand of 3D printing equipment in the U.S. and higher demand for products in China are positives. Impressive market traction of Phenolic Direct Binding process is anticipated to be one of the major catalysts for the quarter. In addition, the company’s large-scale service centers across the globe, including the recently opened subsidiaries in China and India are expected to boost growth for the second quarter and beyond.However, on the flip side, the 3D printing industry has been battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years. For quite some time now, waning demand for printers has added to the company’s concern. We expect Voxeljet’s second-quarter 2017 results to take a beating on account of slowdown in markets.Over the past few quarters, Voxeljet has been suffering from delayed customer adoption rates, which in turn, led to a decline of order backlogs. Moreover, depressed oil prices, which have caused investment deferrals by clients, affected the company’s oil and gas extraction equipment business. This apart, Voxeljet has to contend itself with strong competition, which often results in price cuts and lower profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Voxeljet will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

77,AVGO,"The equity markets remained relatively skittish over the last few days as a range of geopolitical issues took center stage. These included constant conflict between the U.S. and North Korea regarding nuclear arsenal and prolonged standoff between China and India over sovereignty. As sublime tensions continue to raise an element of caution, investors are on the lookout for ‘cash cow’ stocks that will offer high returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products.

This was mainly attributed to growth in active user accounts and in the number of fulfilled orders.JD.com consistently invests to ensure long-term growth, increase brand awareness, broaden product offerings, enhance services offered to sellers on its marketplace platform and expand fulfillment capability. These should strengthen the company’s position and drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is currently gaining popularity among several international brands. JD Worldwide recently partnered with Wal-Mart subsidiary and British supermarket retailer ASDA to bring British products to Chinese consumers. It also partnered with other leading international brands including Inferno, Bayer and Cetaphil.Management expects second-quarter net revenue growth between 35% and 39% on a year-over-year basis.

79,AVGO,"ARRIS International PLC (ARRS  -  Free Report), leading customer premises equipment manufacturer for the cable TV industry, reportedly moved one step forward to complete its proposed acquisition of Ruckus after the exit of Ruckus Wireless’ channel chief, Sandra Glaser Cheek.In Feb 2017, ARRIS entered into a deal with Broadcom to acquire Brocade Communication Systems, Inc.’s  Ruckus Wireless and ICX Switch units for $800 million. The company plans to close the agreement in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Notably, ARRIS’ buyout came on back of Brocade’s decision to close the acquisition of Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report).In fact, we believe that the acquisition of Ruckus is intrinsic to ARRIS’ plans to enter the wireless business.Moreover, the company’s Carrier-Class Service Provider Wi-Fi Solution, currently deployed by Mediacom, integrates products from vendor partners including Ruckus, Aptilo Networks and Benu Networks.However, in an 8-K filing to the SEC made in July, Brocade agreed with Broadcom to refile their regulatory application with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Consequently, both the companies are undergoing a CFIUS review, and also agreed to refile their notice to provide CFIUS more review time, given the transaction’s complexity. Therefore, Broadcom and Brocade now expect the transaction to close before the end of the fiscal fourth quarter.In fact, the exit of Ruckus Wireless’ channel chief is kept under the close observation of many market watchers as a sign that the deal will close by the year-end as planned. Whatever be the final outcome, we expect investors’ focus to remain on the issue, going forward.Price PerformanceShares of ARRIS have underperformed the Zacks categorized industry’s growth in the last six months. The stock declined 3.6% against the industry’s gain of 14.8%. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderARRIS has recently inked several deals to broaden its product portfolio. Also, the company reported better-than-expected earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2017. However, customer concentration, foreign currency exchange rate risk and being a highly leveraged company remain added risks for ARRIS.We believe these factors substantiates its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

80,AVGO,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 10. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 24.2%. Additionally, NVIDIA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 27%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWidely known for its video gaming chips, NVIDIA has pioneered the art and science of visual computing. With singular focus on this field, the company offers specialized platforms for the gaming, automotive, data center and professional visualization markets. Its products, services and software deliver amazing experiences in virtual reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous cars.We believe that NVIDIA’s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. We also feel that the higher adoption of NVIDIA’s Tegra processors could act as a catalyst, going forward.On the flip side, the secular decline in the PC market has affected many chip makers. NVIDIA’s dependence on the PC market continues and therefore is being hurt by adverse conditions. The preliminary data released by Gartner showed that PC shipments in the second quarter were down 4.3% year over year to 61.1 million units. The decline marked the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.Also, Gartner’s forward-looking statements make us a shade cautious about the prospects of the PC industry. The research firm agreed that the recent surge in DRAM prices and short supply of SSD will lead to an increase in PC prices. This makes us slightly cautious about NVIDIA’s near-term performance.Additionally, competition from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM Inc. remains a near-term headwind.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NVIDIA is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 69 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%.

81,AVGO,"Brazilian state-run energy giant Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 10.In the preceding three-month period, the Rio de Janeiro-headquartered integrated player delivered a positive earnings surprise of 214.29% on the back of higher oil prices and cost cuts.Petrobras has a good earnings surprise history. It has topped estimates in three of the last four quarters. The company posted average positive earnings surprise of 59.58% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price and EPS Surprise  Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price and EPS Surprise | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras QuoteFactors to Consider This QuarterAlthough crude and natural gas ended the second quarter of this year 8.4% and 5% lower respectively, the pricing environment of commodity prices was much healthier than the year-ago period, courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement. This bodes well for Petrobras’ upstream unit. Improving commodity prices are likely to augment the company’s revenues and cash flows. Further, Petrobras’ successful cost-reduction initiatives and efficiency gains are expected to cushion results further. Petrobras has also slashed its capex budget for 2017–2021 by 25%, which will enable the company to lower its debt load. Moreover, Petrobras’ aggressive divestment plans are also in sync with its strategy  to reinstate investor’s faith in the stock, reduce the financial burden and increase focus on developing its core base of pre-salt fields. During the quarter, Petrobras announced plans to offload its 100% stake in the Jurua natural gas field in the Amazon region.However, Petrobras’ involvement in the multibillion-dollar money laundering and bribery case has deteriorated the company’s credit rating to certain extent. The high leverage of 54% also remains a key area of concern for the firm. Also, in June, Petrobras cut prices of diesel by 2.3% and gasoline by 5.8% to protect its market share and attract buyers. This may adversely impact Petrobras' downstream division’s near-term results. Further, rising costs due to tougher RIN obligations is likely to weigh on the earnings and margins of the downstream unit of the company. The RIN expense has increased from $3.3 to $3.5 per barrel in the second quarter when compared with the year-ago quarter. As it is, shares of Petrobras have declined 18% during the second quarter, wider than the industry’s loss of 11%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Petrobras will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 15 cents.Zacks Rank: Petrobras currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Petrobras, here are some firms you can consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) is expected to release earnings results on Aug 17.

82,AVGO,"Communications’ chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) surprised Wall Street by announcing that it is acquiring the software provider CA Inc. (C  -  Free Report)A) for $19 billion in cash.Under the terms of the deal, Broadcom would be paying $44.50 per share in cash to CA's shareholders. This represents a 20% premium to CA's closing price as of Jul 11. The transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, was approved by the boards of both companies. The deal came a few months after Donald Trump blocked Broadcom's $117 billion hostile bid for semiconductor peer Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), citing national security threats  (see: all the Technology ETFs here).The chip-making giant aimed at diversifying the company’s business beyond semiconductors by acquiring CA, which is a legacy software company specializing in mainframes. Per AVGO CEO Hock Tan, “the transaction represents an important building block as we create one of the world’s leading infrastructure technology companies. We intend to continue to strengthen these franchises to meet the growing demand for infrastructure software solutions.”The deal is expected to drive Broadcom's long-term adjusted EBITDA margins above 55% and be immediately accretive to its non-GAAP EPS. If approved, the transaction would reshape Broadcom’s pure software business and provide a new arena into the software market.Market ImpactThe news led to negative sentiment for Broadcom, pushing its shares down as much as 19% on the day - its biggest drop ever. Broadcom received a series of downgrades and price-target cuts, following the acquisition announcement. At least five Wall Street firms downgraded their ratings on Broadcom stock and four others cut their price targets, as they are concerned about the company’s strategy to acquire a low-growth software company. On the other hand, CA shares jumped 18.7%.The announced acquisition has put the spotlight on a few technology ETFs focusing on either semiconductor or software. Below we have highlighted these in detail. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting their continued outperformance:iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 firms.

It is streamed live, four times per week, and features breaking news and analysis from Zacks strategists. Free Lunch is available on YouTube, Facebook Live, Twitter, Ustream, and more.Up first, Ryan discusses Broadcom’s rough morning of trading after the chip behemoth announced it is purchasing CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion in cash. CA is a giant in the mainframe software industry, but that business is falling out of favor as customers continue to shift toward cloud computing.So why would Broadcom shell out so much cash for a dated brand? Some have said desperation after its Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) merger fell through, while others have suggested it might be another moment of brilliance from CEO Hock Tan.Ryan digs into these reactions and gives his own perspective on the story. Next, the host analyst notes related to Netflix and Amazon which have hogged headlines this morning.Netflix shares dipped in early trading after analysts from UBS lowered their rating to neutral from buy, citing the video streaming giant’s stretched valuation. Eric Sheridan, the leading analyst on UBS’ note, credited Netflix’s work in content and technology, but ultimately described the goods news as “priced in” to the stock.On the opposite end of the spectrum was Canaccord Genuity’s note on Amazon, which included a new $2,000 price target for the e-commerce stock. Ryan discusses both notes and shares his thoughts on Netflix, Amazon, and other “FAANG” stocks on the first half of today’s show.On the second half of the episode, Ryan is joined by Zacks Strategist Dave Bartosiak to preview Friday morning’s top bank earnings reports from the likes of JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Rising rates should be a catalyst for these big financials, but a flattening yield curve has led to apathy from analysts—a feeling that both Dave and Ryan mirror.

85,AVGO,"Shares of Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) tumbled about 17% in early morning trading Thursday after the chip manufacturer announced the surprise acquisition of CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) in a deal valued at $18.9 billion.Broadcom will pay that sum in cash for CA, a designer of mainframe software based in New York City. The purchase comes just months after President Trump blocked the chip giant’s proposed $117 million merger with Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report).Initial reactions to the Broadcom-CA deal are rife with confusion, as analysts and investors alike appear to be struggling to find a rationale for the semiconductor company’s sudden interest in the software space.“We think investors will likely be disappointed at this deal, which seems more financial engineering/PE driven than due to any strategic rationale,” wrote analyst from Evercore in a note Thursday morning.CA’s primary business is selling software for massive, mainframe computers, and admittedly, Broadcom will now be a major competitor in that industry. Its new acquisition is second only to IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) in the mainframe software business, and the firm generates a healthy $10 billion in annual cash flow from its operations.Still, some analysts have already pointed out that such a major bet on mainframe computing makes little sense in a world where customers are choosing cloud services over old-school hardware.“While CA is a departure from Broadcom's core semiconductor business, it is consistent with its track record of acquiring out-of-favor, market leaders with high cost structures,” said Jefferies analysts. “Importantly, AVGO has consistently demonstrated its ability to drive costs down and margins of its acquisitions up, often measured in 1,000s of basis points.”This sentiment from Jefferies is in harsh contrast to what some optimistic investors might point to right now: the ambition of Broadcom chief Hock Tan.Tan has helped grow the company from a relatively minor chipmaker to a worldwide titan through a number of hopeful deals, and the executive as earned the respect of many on Wall Street. Still, today’s move has brought out the most skeptical of voices.Investors have other reasons to be skeptical too, with Broadcom shares effectively flat lining over the past year despite sizeable gains for others in the semiconductor industry.What’s more, analyst sentiment was already mixed heading into today’s announcement. The firm’s current fiscal year ends in October, and looking ahead, analysts appear uncertain as to what fiscal 2019 holds for Broadcom.Over the past 60 days, AVGO has witnessed nine positive revisions to its fiscal 2019 earnings estimates, but five negative revisions have also come in during this stretch. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 has gained in the trailing two months but is down from where it started the current quarter at.This mixed revision activity has kept Broadcom at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for now.Want more market analysis from this author?

86,AVGO,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CA, Inc (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion in cash. The chipmaker intends to enhance its long-term margins with the buyout of CA, a leading IT management software provider. The buyout is subject to CA shareholder nod and other customary regulatory approvals from Japan, European Union and the United States.Broadcom’s move of shifting headquarters to San Jose, CA from Singapore, will aid it to pursue the acquisition of Islandia, NY-based CA. The base-shift is anticipated to make the regulatory environment less complicated for Broadcom. Moreover, the company can reap the benefits of cost reduction as well as lessened competition. However, the Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) deal still hasn’t materialized despite re-domiciliation. The issue remains a concern even for the ongoing CA agreement.Nevertheless, after fulfilling the regulatory approvals, Broadcom expects the deal to close in fourth quarter of 2018. Following the buyout, chipmaker anticipates the buyout to boost long-term adjusted EBITDA margins by more than 55%. The company envisionsthe acquisition to be immediately accretive, enabling it to continue earnings in double digit CAGR.Moreover, on a combined basis, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be roughly $23.9 billion in the last 12 months and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $11.6 billionFollowing the news, Broadcom’s shares were down almost 9% in pre-market trade, while that of CA went up approximately 18%. Shares of Broadcom were down owing to high debt level which the company will incur in regard to the acquisition. Moreover, its shares have returned just 0.9% in the past year underperforming the industry’s rally of 1.8%.How Will Broadcom Pay $18.9 Billion in Cash?Broadcom will incur a new committed debt to finance $18 billion while the remaining will be paid from cash on hand. Consequently, CA shareholders will obtain $44.50 per share in cash, approximately 19.6% premium over the $37.21 price on Jul 11, 2018 after market close.Notably, as on May 6, 2018, cash & cash equivalents of Broadcom were $8.2 billion compared with $7.1 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $17.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, which was flat compared with the preceding quarter level.What Prompted The Chipmaker to Bid For a Software Company?The increasing demand of IT management software solutions persuaded Broadcom to pick CA. This out-of-the-box move from the chipmaker took the shareholders, investors and analysts by surprise. Broadcom’s CEO and president Hock Tan said, “This transaction represents an important building block as we create one of the world’s leading infrastructure technology companies.”CA has been benefiting from higher Mainframe new sales as well as solid demand for its recently launched Trusted Access Manager for Z, a Mainframe solution. The previous buyouts have enhanced the software providers’ IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, the depth of its product portfolio and the increased efficiency offered by it has witnessed solid adoption, strengthening its business model.CA’s substantial customer base will enable Broadcom to explore the infrastructure software market and expand its TAM. The company attempts to expand mission critical technology solutions portfolio on the heels of CA’s mainframe and enterprise software businesses.Our TakeConsidering its business line, we are of the opinion that Broadcom is foraying into unfamiliar territory with this buyout. We remain inquisitive as to how it will integrate CA’s software business with the chipmaker’s methodologies. The move is in contrast with Broadcom’s previous acquisitions and it will be interesting to observe its strategy to capitalize on the potential of growing software business.However, diversification of end market and customer base bodes well for the long haul. This is anticipated to add resilience to Broadcom’s current business model.Zacks Rank & Key PickBroadcom carriesa Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You may consider Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), from the same industry. The company has a long-term EPS growth rate of 15%.

87,AVGO,"Semiconductor giant Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) has decided to buy mainframe and infrastructure software provider CA Inc (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion or $44.50 per share in cash, representing a 20% premium to the company’s closing price on Wednesday. Government approvals are pending.Rationale for CACA hasn’t done so well in the last few years. Revenues have declined consistently between 2013 and 2016, more or less flat-lining last year and picking up in its fiscal 2018 due to the contribution from acquisitions. Gross profit shows a similar pattern. While the EBIT has picked up this year, the consistently rising interest and taxes have depressed its earnings performance.The company intended to modernize its solutions by incorporating automation, data, analytics and security into its products through organic product development or acquisitions with a customer focus. It also recently announced a headcount reduction of 800 to align with its changing strategy. Since Broadcom is a master at integrations, it makes sense for the company to turn the reins over to somebody with more experience. So there’s good reason for CA shareholders to cheer, which they did, sending shares soaring yesterday, after the news broke.What’s In It For BroadcomBroadcom on the other hand is a semiconductor company that has mainly grown by acquiring companies in the same industry and then trimming them down to maximize efficiencies. There isn’t much in its past to suggest that it would head into software next. So investors are understandably concerned about how this integration will go and also, whether the company will succeed in its diversification-beyond-semis strategy. No wonder then that the shares plummeted following the announcement.But there are some positives as well.First, CA is in trimming mode, which works nicely with Broadcom CEO Hock Tan’s line of thinking. So some of the work that he would need to do is already being done.Second, semiconductor deals of the kind Broadcom pursues are getting harder and harder to come by because of the significant amount of consolidation the industry has already seen. The current deals on the stage are very high-profile, intended to capture product roadmaps and including a higher element of risk. The payback period is also relatively more uncertain.Third, software is the future. Even hardware companies generally have software integration units, but the way technology is advancing, software opportunities are opening up in every sphere of life as individuals, companies and other entities are all increasingly turning to the cloud with always-connected devices to store, process and retrieve their information that is then used in everyday decision making. For an acquisitive technology company to completely pass up this opportunity may not be such a good idea.Fourth, CA’s mainframe business is likely to generate a steady flow of revenues with better visibility. The infrastructure market is big and expanding, so there’s room for multiple players to grow. Augmenting with other deals in the space could help Broadcom become an important player.  ConclusionIt’s a daring move for Broadcom, especially considering its unproven software capabilities and the price tag (roughly 4.5X its 2018 revenue). But the good thing is, it will be immediately accretive.Another concern is whether Broadcom will be able to balance its cost-cutting itch with the need to invest resources in R&D because that is a software company’s life blood.Whether it will succeed in this effort is anybody’s guess, but it’s a good time to try.   RecommendationsBoth CA and Broadcom carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So better buys would be buy-ranked companies like Autohome (ATHM  -  Free Report), TTM Technologies (TTMI  -  Free Report), Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Cyberark Software (CYBR  -  Free Report).

88,AVGO,"Shares of Xiaomi Corp. declined 5.9% at the beginning of its first day of trading on Jul 9, at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Chinese smartphone manufacturer managed to raise just $54 billion, far below its expectations. In what was touted be one of the biggest IPOs of the year, this definitely is a disappointing start for the world’s fourth-largest mobile phone maker.Interestingly, Xiaomi’s debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange comes three days after the United States and China imposed tariffs of $34 billion on each other, thus waging a trade war against each other. Xiaomi’s IPO was being seen as an important tech listing among Internet giants from China like Tencent, which also plans to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange. The disappointing start to Xiaomi’s stock saw the Shenzhen Component Index, which tracks technology and other new economy firms, falling to its lowest level in three and a half years on Jul 5. Top of FormThat said, Xiaomi was perhaps being overvalued and might just have given an indication that IPOs of tech companies may not enjoy lofty valuations in the tariff-trauma that mat grip the markets. However, tech stocks have been performing well and it’s still too early to say that trade war has started taking its toll on players in this corner.Xiaomi’s IPO Disappoints Xiaomi’s disappointing debut comes as a time when the U.S.-China trade war has just begun. At the same time, Chinese stocks have been taking a hit with the Shanghai Composite Exchange officially entering bear market in the last week of June. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has declined more than 10% since early June.Given this scenario, doubts over Xiaomi’s lofty valuation started cropping up days after the company filed for its IPO. People close to the deal had initially expected that Xiaomi could raise at least $10 billion at a valuation of $100 billion that would have made it the biggest global offering since Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) made its debut at the NYSE four years ago.Xiaomi had priced its IPO at a price higher than tech giants such as Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report). However, it managed to open trade with a valuation of only $54 billion. Understandably, Xiaomi’s debut proves that investors have realized that at $100 billion, the company was being overvalued.Moreover, apart from trade war fears, what may have gone against Xiaomi is investors’ skepticism toward the company’s usual business model. Questions have also been raised over Xiaomi’s ability to increase profit margins in the future given that most of its smartphone are targeted at the low end of the market.Trade War May Not Really Affect Tech Companies The United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on Jul 6. China retaliated with tariffs on an equal amount of goods. This definitely has made investors jittery. However, the list doesn’t contain products commonly purchased by Americans such as televisions and mobile phones.Interestingly, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) despite losing a patent infringement case in a Chinese court last week, which could be a result of the trade dispute, said that it won’t impact the company much. This saw the company’s shares rise 0.7% on Jul 6. Micron has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.One of the biggest reasons behind this is that perhaps China knows that it cannot make microchips on their own and will have to rely on U.S. companies. The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market.Semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) are among the top 16 U.S. companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China.Summing UpXiaomi’s disappointing debut might just be an indication that IPOs of tech companies may not live up to lofty valuations in the near term. Tech stocks are already reeling under trade war fears, which could possibly be another reason that went against Xiaomi.That said, it may be too early to assess if trade war will really take its toll on tech companies, as China depends heavily on U.S.-manufactured microchips. Naturally, imposing higher tariffs will adversely affect China itself.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

89,AVGO,"The United States formally imposed the first set of tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports on Jul 6. The trade war has finally been triggered, with China firing counter tariffs on an equal amount on imports from the United States.And if President Donald Trump does what he said he will do, the war will only intensify, with his additional tariffs that could reach an estimated worth of $500 billion Chinese goods. It now needs to be seen, who gains and who loses from the trade war, given that both countries have drawn up a long list of goods and services that will be impacted by higher import duties.Relief for Domestic Steel, Aluminum ManufacturersIn March, Trump announced tariffs of 25% and 10% on imported steel and aluminum, respectively, from China. The announcement came with the objective of protecting domestic steel and aluminum industry by increasing production, which will eventually help create more jobs.Trump’s decision was cheered by domestic steelmakers, as they stand to benefit from the newly imposed tariffs. On Thursday, shares of United States Steel Corporation X and Nucor Corporation NUE jumped 3.1% and 2.1%, respectively, while Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD surged 3.3%. United States Steel Corporation has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Similarly, shares of Alcoa Corporation (AA  -  Free Report), Kaiser Aluminum Corporation (KALU  -  Free Report) and Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) jumped 2.4%, 1% and 0.2%, respectively, on Thursday.Manufacturing Sector to Suffer                                         American companies that earn huge revenues from China or sell products to that country will be hit by tariffs of 15% to 25%. Heavy equipment manufacturers and airplane makers are at the highest risk. Last year, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) earned 13% of its revenues from China. Moreover, the company also entered into a deal with a state-run Chinese company to sell 300 planes for $37 billion.Excavator and earth-moving manufacturing company Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) has more than 20 facilities in China. Other heavy-equipment manufacturers like Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) too will be hit hard as it will find it hard to manufacture equipment with higher-priced steel.Tough Time for Automakers Not only the automakers but the overall auto sector, comprising carmakers, auto parts and transportation companies will bear the brunt of tariffs. For them, the tariffs are more like a double-edged sword. While producing vehicles in the United States will attract higher tariffs in China, producing vehicles in China and importing them back to the United States means paying higher import duty.Almost 30% of General Motors Company’s (GM  -  Free Report) U.S. unit sales are imported from Mexico and China, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) imports 20% of its vehicles from these two countries. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) manufactures almost 50% of its vehicles in the United States, while the rest is imported from its Mexico and Canada plants. Tech Companies to Take a HitMany tech companies earn a significant portion of their revenues from China. Thus, a trade war will definitely affect tech companies, particularly chipmakers with significant exposure to China.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. Higher tariffs will take a toll on the revenues of these semiconductor manufacturers. Qualcomm has tie-ups with a large number of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) too generates almost 60% of its revenues from China.Similarly, other semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel Corporation INTC are among the top 16 U.S. companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

On Monday, President Donald Trump ordered United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs of 10%. Trump also threatened China that the United States would impose tariffs on additional $200 billion goods if China tried to retaliate.Consequently, China too said that it would have to take comprehensive measures to counter United States’ trade moves. This once again dented investors’ confidence and rattled markets. Shares of chipmakers, which heavily depend on China for a large portion of their revenues, tumbled on the news.

92,AVGO,"The U.S-China trade spat has started taking its toll on tech companies, particularly chipmaker stocks. On Jun 19, President Donald Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs. Consequently, China too said that it would have to take comprehensive measures to counter U.S. trade moves.This has resulted in stocks tumbling once again. Given that China accounts for a large portion of revenues for a number of U.S. tech companies, which include chipmakers, mobile phones and technology-based service providers, there are high chances of these players suffering significantly.Trade War Fears EscalateOn Jun 15, Trump announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods including semiconductors. China wasted no time in retaliating with tariffs on $34 billion U.S. goods. Markets were further rattled on Jun 19, after Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs of 10%.This further escalated trade war fears, resulting in huge sell offs. Tech stocks have been suffering particularly as China accounts for a large portion of revenues for a number of U.S. companies.Apple Fears the Worst Bite Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on up to $50 billion of Chinese goods including semiconductors could make Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) one of the biggest victims of a U.S.-China trade war. Apple is the most successful U.S. tech company in China. In 2017, the iPhone maker generated approximately 20% of its revenues from China, shipping more than 41 million iPhone to China in 2017. Moreover, Apple operates its services like Apple Music and App Store in China.  A trade war could result in China banning Apple’s services, which it did in 2016 by shutting down iTunes Movies and iBooks Store. Services are becoming an integral part of Apple’s business in a slowing smartphone market. Another increasing concern is: what if China bans Apple citing concerns of national security just like the United Stated cautioned customers not to buy Chinese mobile phone maker Huawei on fears of being spied by the Chinese? This would hurt Apple’s business severely. Shares of Apple declined 1.6% on Jun 19.Chipmakers to Bear the BruntChipmakers with significant exposure to China were hit on Tuesday, following Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on semiconductors. Telecommunication equipment maker Lumentum Holdings Inc.’s (LITE  -  Free Report) shares tumbled 3%, while Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) plummeted 0.8%.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market.

93,AVGO,"Shares of Wall Street superstar Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened slightly lower on Monday, just two days before the company is set to release its third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results. So let’s take a look to see why the semiconductor giant looks like a strong buy stock that investors might want to consider scooping up before Micron reports on Wednesday afternoon.Recent News J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analysts reiterated their overweight rating for Micron stock on Monday, pointing directly to strong demand for memory in the cloud computing market. The analyst also reaffirmed his $82 price target, which marked a 41% upside from Friday's closing price of $58.23 per share.""Stay long Micron heading into earnings,” Harlan Sur wrote in a note to clients. “We see further upside in Micron shares as the team is executing well in an overall constructive S/D [supply/demand] memory environment… demand fundamentals likely to remain strong driven by robust cloud data center spending.""The banking power’s Micron update comes just a few weeks after Micron announced that it is set to produce and ship the “industry's first 4bits/cell 3D NAND technology” along with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). Micron also said it would repurchase $10 billion of outstanding common stock as part of a new plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders starting in fiscal 2019. “The data-driven economy will transform nearly every industry, and drive secular growth in demand for memory and storage,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement.Investors should remember that stock repurchase plans often indicate that a company’s executives and board members believe shares are relatively cheap or at least a solid deal at their current price.Stock MovementMicron stock has skyrocketed nearly 371% over the last two years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 34% climb. Shares of Micron have also greatly outperformed its industry’s roughly 105% surge, which includes the likes of Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Year to date, Micron stock has surged 41%, compared to its industry’s roughly 17% climb. Investors should note that MU has dipped 4.2% over the last three months, against its industry’s 6.5% gain. This recent dip helps make Micron stock look more attractive simply because it is cheaper, but that’s just the start.ValuationComing into Monday, Micron stock was trading at 5.5X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a huge discount compared to its industry’s 12.7X and the S&P’s 17.3X. If we dive a little deeper, Micron’s valuation picture looks even better. Over the last two years, Micron stock has traded as high as 32.5X and as low as 4.2X, with a two-year median of 6.2X. Furthermore, Micron stock looks like a steal compared to Nvidia’s two-year median of 38.6X. With all that said, investors should be able to say with confidence that Micron stock is a great value investment, and it looks even better based on its impressive growth prospects.OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s quarterly revenues to pop 38.3% to hit $7.7 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s full-year revenues are projected to soar nearly 46% to reach $29.62 billion.Transitioning to the other end of the income statement, Micron’s quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket nearly 94% to touch $3.14 per share. And if that growth projection didn’t impress investors enough, Micron’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 132% to reach $11.53 per share.Earnings Revision Activity Investors should also note that Micron’s earnings estimate revisions activity has been extremely positive recently. MU has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for its third-quarter, against zero downward changes, all within the last 30 days. This helped lift Micron’s Q3 estimate by $0.28 per share. Within this same timeframe, Micron earned the same upward revisions ratio for its full-year earnings, which lifted its estimate by $0.49 per share.Bottom Line Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” Grade for Value and “Bs” for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Investors should remember that not only does MU stock present great value at the moment, it also sits below its 52-week high. Lastly, Micron is expected to expand both its top and bottom lines in a major way, while looking poised to surge in a growth industry.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

94,AVGO,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) has laid off around 1,100 employees post its buyout of Brocade Communication Systems. The acquisition worth $5.5 billion was completed in November 2017. Notably, the deal bolstered Broadcom’s position in the storage area networking space.Further retrenchment may be in order after the company evaluates its resources. The San Jose, CA based chipmaker might restructure the company’s business accordingly and bring about the desired reduction in costs.Per Reuters, Broadcom has spent $143 million in its first two fiscal 2018 quarters in restructuring charges, majorly comprising employee termination costs. The company is likely to pay a significant amount of its employee termination costs in its current quarter.Shares of Broadcom have returned 15.7% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 18.7%.Recent DevelopmentsBroadcom recently strengthened its partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) in server storage. The companies will collaborate to demonstrate U.3 reference platform, SFF-TA-1001 at HPE Discover. The U.3 universal drive cage will feature Toshiba U.3 facilitated SAS, SATA and NVMe drives.Broadcom also announced that it has developed the approved SFF-TA-1005 Universal Backplane Management (“UBM”) specification. The company developed the platform co-sponsored by HPE, Dell EMC and 19 other members. The platform will enhance simplicity and provide clarity to the management of SATA, SAS and NVMe drives.We believe Broadcom’s collaborations poise it well to expand data center server storage capabilities. We believe an expanding portfolio bodes well for Broadcom in the long run.Upbeat Q2, View PositiveBroadcom put up an impressive second-quarter fiscal 2018 show, in the past week. Both earnings and revenues surpassed estimates. The company delivered earnings of $4.88 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents. The figure improved 32.2% from the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP revenues from continuing operations came in at $5.014 billion, up 20% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the figure came ahead of Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.003 billion.The company also provided promising revenue guidance. For third-quarter fiscal 2018, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $5.05 billion (+/- $75 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.06 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13.3%.Impact of the Restructuring Processes on MarginsBroadcom’s focus on networking products from cloud and data centers as well and broadband access products is helping it to accelerate gross profit. In second-quarter 2018, gross margin increased 330 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 66.6% in the quarter.We believe the company’s cost minimizing initiatives are likely to positively impact margins going forward.Northbound RevisionsBroadcom is witnessing positive revisions. In the past seven days, third-quarter fiscal 2018 estimates witnessed 10 upward revisions against merely one in the other direction, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising from $4.61 to $4.83 per share. The figure represents a year-over-year earnings growth of 17.8%.To ConcludeBroadcom is benefiting from robust demand of its wireless solutions and expanding product portfolio. Increasing collaborations as well as initiatives in reducing costs hold promise.However, customer concentration woes and intensifying competition witnessed across most of the markets in which the company operates remain concerns.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBroadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc.

96,AVGO,"If you are still holding on to shares of Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. One such stock is Broadcom as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past one year and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the year. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Notably, the stock has returned just 6.3% in a year’s time, substantially underperforming the 10.6% rally of its industry.Let’s delve deeper and find out what is taking this company down.Why Broadcom Should be AvoidedBroadcom operates in a highly competitive market. The company faces significant competition in most of its operating markets that negatively impacts top-line growth. Pricing pressure also keeps margin under pressure. In the FBAR technology market, the company faces significant competition from Skyworks surface acoustic wave (“SAW”) filters. Well-established companies like Cavium and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) are its competitors in the wired infrastructure market. We expect intensifying competition to keep profitability under pressure at least in the near-term.Broadcom’s frequent acquisitions have escalated integration risks. Moreover, we note that the large acquisitions negatively impacted its balance sheet in the form of high level of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $39.3 billion or almost 71.5% of total assets as of May 6, 2018.Buyouts have also negatively impacted Broadcom’s balance sheet, as high indebtedness adds to the risk of investing in the company. As of May 6, 2018, the company had total debt of $17.59 billion.For the full year 2018, we have seen 12 estimates moving south in the past 60 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend downward from $19.84 per share to its current level of $19.47.Additionally, for the current quarter, Broadcom has seen 10 downward estimate revisions, dragging the consensus estimate down to $4.60 per share from $4.75 per share in the past 60 days.Further a significant portion of Broadcom’s revenue comes from a handful of customers including Foxconn, which accounted for 14% of net revenues in fiscal 2017. Top five direct customers accounted for 40% of the company’s top-line in fiscal 2017 as compared with 30% reported in fiscal 2017. Loss of any of these top five customers can significantly hurt top-line growth. Apple (including sales to the contract manufacturer) contributed more than 20% of revenues in fiscal 2016. The exposure has increased considerably from the past year (15% in fiscal 2016) and it has not been enough to boost pricing power that continues to hurt margins.Moreover, due to the significant exposure, Broadcom’s share price movement depends heavily on Apple’s results (primarily on iPhone’s performance), which doesn’t bode well for the investors.So, it may not be a good decision to retain this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t intend to wait for a long time.Key PicksAmazon.com, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimates is pegged at $5 billon.Broadcom is increasing traction in 10G technology to support broadband video delivery. We believe that increase in demand for networking products from cloud and data centers as well as broadband access products, will positively impact Wired Infrastructure revenues in the to-be-reported-quarter.The company is also benefiting from strong demand for Wi-Fi chips and radio frequency solutions from smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Going forward, Purley product cycle, robust demand from enterprise and datacenters along with recovery in HDD demand will aid Enterprise Storage segment. The segment will also include Brocade Fiber Channel SAN business that is expected to generate a partial quarter revenues contribution.Broadcom believes that the storage business will benefit from strong adoption of All-Flash arrays in storage appliances infrastructure that utilizes the company’s PCI Express and NVMe technology.Industrial shipments and resale are likely to grow, which will drive segmental revenues in the second quarter.Factors to ConsiderSegmental Details & Strong Product PortfolioBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. Last quarter, Wireless Communications (41% of total revenues) were up 88% year over year and 23% quarter over quarter to roughly $2.21 billion. Strong growth was driven by the ramp-up in shipments of next-generation platform from the company’s large North American smartphone customers. Higher dollar content in this platform also drove top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wireless Communications segment revenues are pegged at $1.36 billion.Coming to the Enterprise Storage (19% of total revenues) increased 40% from the year-ago quarter and 54% sequentially to $991 million. The increase was due to the contribution from the recently acquired Brocade Fibre Channel switch business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Enterprise Storage segment revenues are pegged at $1.12 Billion.Moving forward, Broadcom recently announced the launch of the latest NVMe and automation know-hows as well as Brocade G630 switch and Brocade FC32-64 port blade for the Brocade X6 director.Broadcom’s expanding product portfolio makes it well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G.We believe that the company’s extensive product portfolio, which serves multiple applications within four primary end markets (Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial & Other), will positively impact the to-be-quarter’s results.Other Positives Early in the first quarter, Broadcom completed the long-delayed Brocade acquisition. It completed the divestiture of Brocade's campus WiFi and switch business to Arris for 800 million in cash. Moreover, it sold Brocade's headquarter building in Santa Clara for approximately 225 million in cash. The addition of Brocade will help the company further penetrate the FC SAN market and garner competitive prowess, going forward.Broadcom recently concluded the redomiciliation procedure of the company from Singapore to the State of Delaware in the United States. The now U.S. company is headquartered in San Jose, CA.Broadcom’s recent move will aid it to pursue the Qualcomm acquisition aggressively once more. The base-shift will also make the regulatory environment uncomplicated for Broadcom. Going forward, we believe that if the deal goes ahead Broadcom can reap the benefits of cost reduction as well as reduced competition.Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will empower Broadcom’s growth prospects.A possible merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm might create the world's third-largest semiconductor company, trailing Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung.Broadcom Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Broadcom Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Broadcom Limited QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Broadcomis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

100,AVGO,"The week after a long weekend always seems to fly by, and this short week was particularly hectic with North Korean updates, more political uncertainty in Europe, and new trade war tensions between the U.S. and some of its allies. Therefore, many investors might have missed some of this week’s biggest earnings reports, which means they will want to pay closer attention next week.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy Zacks tool is a great one-stop-shop that investors can utilize to help properly prepare for the market events set to impact their portfolios.The week of June 4 features some big names in the tech space, which includes Palo Alto Networks (PANW  -  Free Report) and Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report). There are also a number of other companies prepared to report their quarterly financial results (also read: Upcoming Earnings Reports to Watch: PANW, AMBA, AVGO).Today, we are going to look at three of these stocks to give investors an idea of what they should expect next week to help them see if they might want to buy any of these stocks ahead of earnings.1.      United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report)Shares of this North American wholesale distributor of natural and organic foods are up 10.5% over the last year and over 4% in the last 12 weeks. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for United Natural Foods’ quarterly revenues to climb by 8.9% to hit $2.58 billion. Moving on to the opposite end of the income statement, the company is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings surge nearly 21% to $0.93 per share.Coming into Friday, UNFI stock was trading at 13.2X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared to the S&P 500’s 16.7X. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports “A” grades for Value, Growth, and Moment in our Style Scores system. United Natural Foods is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results after market close on Wednesday, Jun 6.2.       Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report)Restoration Hardware has seen its stock price soar 70.7% over the last year and 22.6% during the last 12 weeks. RH stock is also currently trading at 16.1X, marking the slightest of discounts compared to the S&P 500. With that said, investors should note that RH has traded as high as 37.6X forward earnings over the last year, with a one-year median of 19.2X—meaning the stock presents strong comparative value to where it has traded throughout most of the year.The furniture and home décor retailer is projected to see its quarterly revenues hit $564.06 million, which would mark just a 0.35% climb. Investors will be much more pleased to note that Restoration Hardware’s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to skyrocket from $0.05 per share in the year-ago period to $1.01 per share. Restoration Hardware, which is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to report its first-quarter earnings results on Thursday, May 7.3.       Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report)Shares of this discount retailer have climbed 36% this year, but the company has seen its stock price dip 1.8% over the last four weeks in a sign that investors might be expecting a slow quarter. However, our estimates are calling for Five Below to report Q1 revenues of $292.29 million. This would represent 25.5% top-line growth. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar 113% to touch $0.32 per share.With that said, Five Below is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), based partly on the fact that it has seen its earnings estimates come in slightly lower ahead of its Wednesday, June 6 earnings release. This means investors might want to stay away from Five Below stock because even the slightest earnings miss can sometimes lead to falling stock prices, especially in the near-term.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

103,AVGO,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened lower on Wednesday after two days of gains on the back of some major announcements, including a new deal with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). With that said, let’s dive into why the chip giant’s stock might be worth buying right now.Stock Price MovementMicron stock has skyrocketed 408% over the last two years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 31% climb. Shares of Micron also greatly outperformed its industry’s 99% surge, which includes the likes of Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), and more.Over the last year, Micron stock has soared 101%, compared to its industry’s roughly 35% surge. Furthermore, shares of Micron have climbed over 21% in the last three months, while its broader industry is up just 3.5%.Micron’s run of success might deter some investors since it could be hard to replicate this kind of growth. Still, despite Micron’s insane and sustained run, investors should note that the company closed Tuesday below its 52-week high. And there are plenty more reasons to be excited about Micron stock, including its growth prospects and current valuation picture.Recent NewsBut before we jump into growth, it is worth taking a look at some company updates. Micron and Intel announced on Monday that they will produce and ship the “industry's first 4bits/cell 3D NAND technology,” while also noting that they made progress on the development of the third-generation 96-tier 3D NAND structure—which provides a 50% increase in layers.The company also said it would repurchase $10 billion of outstanding common stock as part of a new plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders starting in fiscal 2019. “The data-driven economy will transform nearly every industry, and drive secular growth in demand for memory and storage,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.Furthermore, Micron upped its guidance and now expects current quarter revenues to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion, up from its previous guidance of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion.Growth OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates don’t necessarily reflect Micron’s updated quarterly revenue outlook just yet. But investors will be pleased to note that our current estimate of $7.44 billion, would mark a nearly 34% climb from the year-ago period. Looking a bit further ahead, the company’s full-year revenues are projected to soar nearly 44% to reach $29.22 billion.Transitioning to the other end of the income statement, Micron’s quarterly earnings are projected to skyrocket roughly 81% to touch $2.93 per share. And if that growth projection didn’t impress investors enough, Micron’s full-year earnings are expected to soar over 127% to reach $11.27 per share.ValuationNow that we have covered Micron’s recent business updates, stock price movement, and growth outlook, it’s time to move onto its current valuation, which is impressive, to say the least.Coming into Wednesday, Micron stock was trading at 5.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a massive discount compared to its industry’s 13.2X. Over the last two years, Micron stock has traded as high as 32.5X and as low as 4.2X. Micron stock has traded at a one-year median of 5.5X, against its industry’s 13.9X. Furthermore, Micron stock looks even cheaper compared to Nvidia’s one-year median of 45.6X. Therefore, investors should be able to say with confidence that Micron stock is a great value investment at the moment in a semiconductor market that is set to keep on booming.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

104,AVGO,"U.S. tech companies can finally breathe easy, at least for the time being. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said that the U.S.-China trade conflict has been put on hold. This certainly is good news for U.S. tech companies, particularly chipmakers, which have been reeling under pressure since the two countries sparked fears of a trade war by imposing tariffs and counter tariffs on imports from the two countries.U.S. tech companies generate an estimated more than $100 billion in revenues from China annually. Understandably, the tech sector stands to suffer the most, as the trade war has increasingly focused on technology and intellectual property rights. However, both countries are now initiating talks and making efforts to pull back from an undesired trade war. Given this scenario U.S. chipmakers stand to gain the most. So, it makes good sense to invest in semiconductor stocks.Sigh of Relief for Tech Companies  President Donald Trump in late March announced that the United States would be imposing tariffs on Chinese imports worth $150 billion for alleged violation of intellectual property rights. Consequently, China too announced retaliatory tariffs. However, both countries since then have cooled down on their stance and are now negotiating to avoid a much-feared trade war. On May 20, Mnuchin said, “We are putting the trade war on hold.”This certainly will bring a sigh of relief for U.S. tech companies, as tech companies stand to suffer the most if trade war takes place. U.S. tech companies generate an estimated $100-$150 billion in revenues annually from China, with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) alone generating $105.5 billion from China. Other companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Qualcomm, Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) too make a significant portion of their revenues from China.U.S. tech companies have been reeling under fears of a trade war for quite some time now, which saw their shares taking a hit. However, now that both the United States and China are working on a possible solution to avoid a trade war, it definitely will boost the morale of tech companies.Biggest Gainers if Trade War is AvertedTech companies undoubtedly will be one of the biggest gainers if a trade war is avoided. From large caps to medium and small caps, a number of U.S. tech companies have operations in China. Naturally, companies who have their assembly plants in China stand to gain the most if the trade negotiations fall into place.Also, the Commerce Department last month imposed a ban on American companies from selling components to Chinese company ZTE for seven years, accusing it of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against North Korea and Iran.While this made the company announce that it was ceasing operations, the ban can also have an adverse affect on American chipmakers, as an export ban would definitely hurt the revenues of U.S. chipmakers. However, with Trump tweeting on Sunday that he is working with Chinese president Xi Jinping to get ZTE back into business, U.S. chipmakers have ample reasons to party.Our ChoicesIt goes without saying that after suffering over the last couple of months as a result of huge selloffs owing to fears of a trade war, U.S. chip stocks will stand to gain from a mutual agreement between Trump and Xi Jinping. While we wait for an amicable solution through negotiations, let’sadd tech stocks for quick gains.Now, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is the worldwide leader in graphics processors and media communications devices.

105,AVGO,"President Trump is contemplating issuing an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications equipment makers from selling products in the United States, per a Reuters report date May 2. Imposition of selling restrictions stems from U.S. administration’s concern for national security and will primarily target Chinese telecom equipment behemoths Huawei Technologies and ZTE.The Trump administration had previously barred U.S. companies from selling products to Chinese counterparts due to apprehensions of Chinese spying on Americans utilizing these high-tech products. This move is evidence of the fiercely aggressive stance that the U.S. government is taking to protect innovative next-generation products of the U.S. tech giants.However, the move does not sit well with U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports as it will raise prices of telecom equipment utilized by telecom service providers. Nevertheless, a hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. wireless equipment manufacturers. That is why investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom SpaceTrump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of state-of-the-art products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Notably, the Chinese government patronizes most of these big manufacturers. These companies have become serious threat to the U.S. economic and military supremacy.  China runs a massive $375 billion yearly trade surplus against United States.Huwaei, ZTE Targeted EarlierIn fact, the U.S. government made AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) drop Huawei smartphones from its offerings while Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) was barred from selling its chipsets to either Huawei or ZTE. On Mar 12, Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed $117 billion takeover bid of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) for Qualcomm.The government argued that third party entities, especially, Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts.Our Top PicksPresident Trump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry. The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese dragon is of foremost importance to the American eagle.At this stage, investors will be better off to investing in U.S. wireless equipment manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks with favourable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with strong growth potential.Chart below depicts price performance of our five picks year to date.Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

106,AVGO,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd TSM hit the entire technology industry hard after the company reported Q1 results on Apr 19 before market open. The world’s biggest contract chipmaker, cut its full-year revenue target to the low end of its prior guidance of 10-15% thanks to “softer demand for smartphones and uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining market.”Management noted that ‘the China market started to pickup in smartphones, but TSMC’s smartphone segment, which is very high end, was softer.” The company’s revenue forecast target for the second quarter came in the range of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, falling shy of analysts’ expectation of $8.8 billion.Notably, TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry company, which makes chips for tech biggies like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) (renowned for smartphones) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) (beneficiary of the cryptocurrency rally).TSMC mentioned that there were order cuts from the current Apple iPhone X processor. Management also indicated that continuous feeble demand from the high-end mobile sector may adversely impact the second-quarter 2018 results of Taiwan Semiconductor in spite of strength in cryptocurrency mining.JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Gokul Hariharan estimated that Taiwan Semiconductor’s Apple-oriented revenues may decline about 50%in the second quarter after a 30% decrease in the first quarter. TSMC shares plunged about 5.6% on Apr 19 and 1.5% on Apr 20 while Apple shares lost more than 2.8% and 4.1%, respectively.Other Evidence of Softening Smartphone DemandIMF said that the smartphone-driven tech cycle probably had topped in late 2015. And now saturation in demandin developed markets and lengthening of upgrade cycles are weighing on overall smartphone sales.On a year-over-year basis, Apple logged a decline (5%) in iPhone salesin the fourth quarter of 2017 and Samsung saw a unit decline of 3.6%. IMF even noted that China’s domestic smartphone market shrunk for the first time in 2017.Bloodbath in Semiconductor Stocks Taiwan Semiconductor’s guidance cut triggered a selloff in the entire semiconductor space. On Apr 19, Applied Materials Inc. AMAT lost about 6.5%, STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM  -  Free Report) fell about 4.3% and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) retreated about 2.7% (read: 5 Reason Why FANG ETFs Lost Their Charm in March).Against this backdrop, we expect the below-mentioned ETFs to see rough trading in the coming days.Semiconductor ETFsVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) (down 5.6% in the last two days (as of Apr 20)), iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) (down 5.5% since Apr 19) and PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI  -  Free Report) (down 5.7% since Apr 19) are likely to be pressured in the near term.Apple ETFsETFs which have a considerable exposure to Apple may also underperform. These funds include iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW  -  Free Report) (down 2.8% in the last two days (as pf Apr 20)), Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) (down 2.5% since Apr 19) and Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT  -  Free Report) (down 2.6% since Apr 19) (see all Technology ETFs here).Smartphone ETFWho can forget the pure-play smartphone ETF, First Trust Nasdaq Smartphone Index Fund (FONE  -  Free Report)?

107,AVGO,"The semiconductor corner of the broad technology market was badly hit last week amid a spate of negative news from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research LRCX.Taiwan Semiconductor reduced its target for sales growth in the global semiconductor industry this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Notably, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3% on Apr 19, marking the biggest one-day drop for the index since Feb 8. In the past week, the index was down 4.4%.Additionally, the analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch dampened the mood by cutting the price target on chipmakers with heavy exposure to Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone business, including Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Cirrus Logic (CRUS  -  Free Report) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report). The analyst expects chip stocks to go 4-7% lower (read: Should You Snap Up Downtrodden Semiconductor ETFs Now?).As a result, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report) shed more than 4% each last week and clearly underperformed the broad technology fund (XLK  -  Free Report) by a wide margin. XLK lost just 0.2% in the same time frame. The weak trend might continue this earnings season given the lack of positive Earnings ESP but a series of positive estimate revision could provide some upside.According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Most of the chipmakers like Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials AMAT are less likely to surprise this quarter while NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) is poised to beat estimates. Let’s delve into the earnings picture of those that have a higher allocation to the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q1 earnings unfold. SOXX is largely concentrated on the five firms, with a combined share of 35.5%, followed by 27.8% for SMH and 24.5% for PSI.Inside Our Earnings PredictionTexas Instruments is set to report on Apr 24, after market close. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.39%, indicating lesser chances of beating estimates this quarter. The earnings estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter has gone up by couple of cents in the past 90 days. The earnings surprise track over the past four quarters is also good, with an average beat of 7.04%. The stock has a VGM Score of B (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -3.12%, indicating a lower chance of beating estimates this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 has been revised downward by 18 cents over the past three months.

108,AVGO,"Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), a multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment firm, saw its shares drop 4.5% on Thursday. The company has had problems closing a deal with NXP (NXP  -  Free Report), a Dutch semiconductor company, forcing them to withdraw and refile a previously set merger application with Chinese authorities.Qualcomm is currently awaiting approval from China, the last of the required global regulators, to move through with the merger.Meanwhile, news of up to 1,500 layoffs as a means to save money has spawned doubt and rattled investors. Along with this, increased competition with Broadcam (AVGO  -  Free Report), another chip manufacturing company, has shaken previous confidence in the company.This announcement and subsequent drop on the day is sticking true to the trend for Qualcomm in recent months. Year to date, shares have dropped 20.7%, mostly as a result of this failed merger and its consequences.Although the stock has steadily declined, it might still be attractive to some investors. But with “C” grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system, Qualcomm shares look shaky for a few reasons.The company’s P/E of 16.5 and P/CF of 11.5 beat industry averages, but its P/B ratio of 3.4 is almost twice the average of its industry. In similar fashion, while the company has cash flow of $4.80 per share—almost four times the industry average—it also holds a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8, which is a significant premium to the industry average. This discrepancy is what leads to Qualcomm’s average grade for Value.And if potential investors were looking for strong analyst opinions, they would be met with disappointment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Qualcomm’s full-year earnings has moved just a penny higher over the past 60 days, while our consensus projection for its next fiscal year has actually moved a penny lower over that time.Bottom LineQualcomm has been struggling in the stock market since the start of this year. A gradual decline in the midst of merger complications, layoffs, and lack of public confidence has hurt the company over the past few months, especially today.While there are some positive numbers that support respectable Value and Growth, they are counteracted by statistics that negate the same measures. Overall, mixed analyst sentiment has caused this stock to receive a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

109,AVGO,"Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) has hit a roadblock with the Chinese Ministry of Communications (MOFCOM) saying that Qualcomm must make more concessions for local players. Qualcomm resubmitted a revised proposition this week, giving the government another 180 days to decide.While deteriorating U.S.-China trade relations may be partly responsible for the Chinese government’s apathy, there are other important considerations.China’s stated goal is to become self-sufficient in chip production and the government also has some ambitious goals in self-driving technology, artificial intelligence and mobile. As a result, it has invested billions of dollars into homegrown companies and the kind of educational institutions that will churn out very high volumes of researchers.Naturally, the government won’t do anything to upset its plans, and certainly not anything that will strengthen international players vis-a-vis the local players it has so painstakingly grown. So when those local players petition the government that they will be adversely impacted by the deal, especially in the areas of self-driving cars and mobile payments, there’s no way the government won’t take notice.In Qualcomm’s case, it’s more about expansion into emerging markets like self-driving cars and IoT at a time when growth in its core mobile phone business is declining. True that it has a leading share of the standard essential patents in 5G and is already partnered with most handset makers and telecoms for the standard. But this may not in itself satisfy investors given its already-leading position in the slowing market. And particularly since its fallout with Apple means a necessarily negative impact.   Qualcomm also has another problem: in defending its stand against Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) hostile takeover, the company has touted its 5G strength and growth prospects resulting from the NXP acquisition. Now if the deal doesn’t go through as planned, investors might actually go ahead and replace the board as Broadcom threatened to do earlier. So for Qualcomm it’s an existential issue.The Chinese government is likely to take its time and whether or not the deal goes through as planned by yearend depends entirely on the concessions Qualcomm has agreed to this time. Qualcomm and Broadcom have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while NXP has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). So it’s better to take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here instead.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

111,AVGO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AVGO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsBroadcom Limited reported impressive first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Earnings of $5.12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. The figure improved 41% from the year-ago quarter and 11.5% sequentially.Non-GAAP revenues from continuing operations were $5.33 billion, which increased 28% from the year-ago quarter and 10% on a sequential basis. The figure was almost in line with management’s guidance and slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.25 billion.The company also approved a quarterly interim cash dividend of $1.75 per ordinary share, payable on Mar 29, 2018.Segment RevenuesWired Infrastructure revenues (35% of total revenues) were $1.88 billion, down 10% from the year-ago quarter and 13% sequentially. The decline was primarily due to seasonal weakness in demand for broadband access and set-top box products.Broadcom stated that a slowdown in demand for optical products from access and metro networks hurt the top line. However, demand for data centers and cloud shipments were strong in the quarter.Wireless Communications (41% of total revenues) were up 88% year over year and 23% quarter over quarter to roughly $2.21 billion. The strong growth was driven by the ramp-up in shipments of next-generation platform from the company’s large North American smartphone customers. Higher dollar content in this platform also drove top-line growth.Enterprise Storage (19% of total revenues) increased 40% from the year-ago quarter and 54% sequentially to $991 million. The increase was due to the contribution from the recently acquired Brocade Fibre Channel switch business.Further, servers and storage connectivity business reported strong results, driven by an increase in demand from Intel Corporation’s Purley server launch cycle.Industrial & other (5% of total revenues) soared 40% year over year but declined 2% sequentially to $251 million. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a significant increase in IP licensing revenues. Industrial resale continued to grow at a double-digit rate.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 240 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and 150 bps to 64.8%. The increase was due to a favorable product mix, driven by better-than-expected revenues from the Brocade fiber channel, SAN switches.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 12.6% year over year and 13.9% sequentially to $883 million.Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined 230 bps from the year-ago quarter, thanks to the lower research & development expenses and selling, general & administrative expenses. Sequentially, operating expenses fell 100 bps.Operating margin expanded 470 bps from the year-ago quarter and 90 bps from the previous quarter to 48.2%.LiquidityAs of Feb 4, 2018, cash & cash equivalents were $7.1 billion compared with $11.2 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $17.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, up slightly $17.4 billion from the previous quarter.Broadcom generated cash flow from operations of roughly $1.7 billion, down $2 billion from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $220 million, down from $233 million in the previous quarter.AcquisitionEarly in the first quarter, Broadcom completed the long-delayed Brocade acquisition. It completed the divestiture of Brocade's campus WiFi and switch business to Arris for 800 million in cash. Moreover, it sold Brocade's headquarter building in Santa Clara for approximately 225 million in cash.Donald J. Trump has released an order, asking Qualcomm Inc. to immediately and permanently abandon its proposed takeover by Broadcom on grounds of national security concerns.The presidential order put an end to the tech deal on grounds of national security. The deal would have affected United States' leading position in creating technology and setting standards for next-generation mobile phone communications as China is steadily taking a lead in the space.Recently, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigated and reviewed Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion hostile takeover offer for Qualcomm. GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $5 billion (+/- $75 million).The company project growth to be driven by increasing traction of 10G technology to support broadband video delivery. Also, the company expects an increase in demand for networking products from cloud and data centers, as well and broadband access products, to positively impact Wired Infrastructure revenues. The set-top box is expected to be flat.Wireless Communications revenues are projected to experience a seasonal decline, sequentially, owing to the weak demand from the large North American customers. For the rest of 2018, Broadcom expects a significant increase in FBAR content, driven by the need for additional filtering in the antenna.However, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth-driver for the segment.Management stated that Enterprise Storage segment results in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 will benefit from Purley product cycle, robust demand from enterprise and datacenters and recovery in HDD demand. The segment will also include Brocade Fiber Channel SAN business that is expected to generate a partial quarter revenues contribution.The company expects double-digit sequential growth in industrial product revenues and projects growth in resale.Broadcom believes that the storage business will benefit from strong adoption of All-Flash arrays in storage appliances infrastructure that uses the company’s PCI Express and NVMe technology.Industrial shipments and resale are likely to grow, which will drive segmental revenues in the second quarter. For the rest of 2018, strong adoption and ramp up of the company’s optical isolation product will continue to drive growth for electric vehicles.Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 66% (+/- 1%) while non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $890 million.The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $190 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Over the long term, Broadcom targets capital expenditure to be 3% of revenues.Note: The EPS data mentioned in the text of this section differs from the rest of report due to the difference in calculation or consideration of one-time items.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

113,AVGO,"Shares of Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) slumped nearly 5.5% in morning trading Thursday after UBS initiated coverage of the trendy stock with a sell rating. The analyst team, led by Timothy Arcuri, are apparently bearish on Micron due to “cyclical memory concerns and big estimate cuts.”Arcuri argued that Micron’s supply chain has struggled to keep inventory growth on pace with revenue expansion over the four quarters, a phenomenon which has helped create a “very favorable cyclical backdrop” for the semiconductor business. However, the analyst feels this factor is rapidly waning and will soon become a headwind.UBS also assigned a sell rating to chip behemoth Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). Meanwhile, the firm initiated coverage of three semiconductor plays—Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Marvel Technology (MRVL  -  Free Report), and KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report)—with buy ratings.Arcuri’s concern that cyclical trends could eventually become headwinds is one that frequently looms above the semiconductor industry. Decades of progress in personal, business, and mobile computing have allowed analysts and investors to pick up on recurring factors that both drive growth and cause pullbacks.However, those that are bullish on Micron believe that new secular trends are enough to outweigh these cyclical factors, and company management is working to shift the rhetoric by painting a new picture of its business.“The dealer market today is very different from the PC-dominated market of the past,” said Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in the company’s latest earnings report. “More specifically, memory is making possible applications such as AI and VR, and enabling new cloud-based business models which deliver a fundamental value far in excess of a price per bit.”Memory remains a heavily-commoditized segment of the technology sector, thanks in large part to cyclical trends like those mentioned by Arcuri. But for those that believe in the power of these new secular trends, this means that Micron is trading at extremely attractive valuation levels.For instance, MU is currently sporting a Forward P/E of just 5.2, which comes in at a significant discount to the average of 18.8 displayed by our broader “Computer and Technology” sector. Micron is also sporting an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.It is also worth noting that, despite Arcuri’s bearish sentiment, analysts have been largely optimistic about Micron over the past month. In fact, the company has witnessed nine positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates within the last 30 days, lifting its Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.48. This positive revision activity has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want more market analysis from this author?

114,AVGO,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) recently concluded the redomiciliation procedure of the company from Singapore to the State of Delaware in the United States. The now US company is headquartered in San Jose, CA.The newly issued common shares of Broadcom Inc are matched one-for-one with the existing ordinary shares of Broadcom Limited, as on Apr 4 post the market close. The new common stock of Broadcom will continue trading under the NASDAQ ticker “AVGO” from Apr 5. Furthermore, the company expects day-to-day functioning and management of its business operations to remain unaffected.Broadcom's President and CEO, Hock Tan informed that the company will invest $3 billion and $6 billion annually in research & engineering and manufacturing, respectively. Tan further anticipates that the company will pay additional taxes amounting to “several hundred million dollars” to the United States. President Trump’s “America first” policy has gained spirit with this announcement.Notably, the news of redomiciliation interestingly comes in the wake of Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) annual shareholder meeting which was postponed to Apr 5 by Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”). Qualcomm’s shareholders are now expected to take a better voting decision.Brief HistoryTrump had blocked the company’s revised acquisition bid of $117 million, or $79 per share, for Qualcomm. The presidential order had put an end to what could have been the biggest ever tech deal, on grounds of national security. The rejection stemmed from Trump’s concern of conceding China the upper hand in mobile cell phone communications.The order had also disqualified Broadcom's 15 proposed candidates from standing for election as directors of Qualcomm. It restricted Qualcomm from accepting the nomination or votes for any of these 15 candidates.The U.S. Treasury's CFIUS had outlined key concerns in a letter dated Mar 5, 2018 to both Broadcom and Qualcomm related to their proposed merger deal. The decision of the secretive government panel reflected an aggressive stance by the administration to protect major American corporate names from being acquired by non-U.S. entities.Can Qualcomm Acquisition be a Reality?Acquisitions have played a significant role in deciding Broadcom’s growth trajectory. Brocade acquisition is likely to boost its position in the storage area networking (“SAN”) space.Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) | Broadcom Limited QuoteBroadcom’s recent move will aid it to pursue the Qualcomm acquisition aggressively once more. The base-shift will also make the regulatory environment uncomplicated for Broadcom. Going forward, we believe that if the deal goes ahead Broadcom can reap the benefits of cost reduction as well as reduced competition.Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will empower Broadcom’s growth prospects.A possible merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm might create the world's third-largest semiconductor company, lagging Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung. However, this would affect competition in the industry.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBoth Broadcom and Qualcomm carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the Electronics and Semiconductor industry is Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report), currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Mellanox is 15%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

116,AVGO,"After a stellar ride, the technology sector witnessed wild swings in March thanks to the decline in FANG stocks and other high-technology names. The tech onslaught stemmed from a slew of negative news from some of the key companies in the space.Behind The PlungeThe initial panic was created by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) after the data breach report that sparked concerns about data privacy and security, and will likely lead to increased scrutiny and possible regulatory pressure. Then, Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) announced the suspension of self-driving tests, raising concerns over the new growth areas in the space and pushing shares down. Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) also dropped on expectations of further regulation on its social media platform while Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) touched a one-year low on Moody’s downgrade. All these news have raised concerns over the growth of the hottest technology trends like autonomous cars and artificial intelligence.Adding to the woes is the decline in Amazon shares late last week that has shed about $30 billion from its market value on a single day. News that President Donald Trump is looking to target the e-commerce giant over antitrust or competition laws and is considering ways to change the tax treatment took toll on the stock. As a result, the S&P Technology Sector was off 4% in March and is likely to see rough trading this month as well.Trade War Fears ReignitedFading trade war fears between the two largest economies, United States and China, seems back on the table with the start of April. China has retaliated against Donald Trump’s taxes on imported steel and aluminum with its own tariff of up to 25% on a series of 128 products worth $3 billion from the United States, including pork and wine, effective today. The Trump administration, looking to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies, is expected to unveil the list of Chinese imports targeted for U.S. tariffs this week.Trump has already signed an executive memorandum to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports targeting the technology, telecom, and apparel sectors. The round of sanctions and retaliation could trigger a global trade war, hurting the global economy and corporate profits at big U.S. exporters. In particular, technology stocks, which are the biggest contributors of the nine-year bull market and a Trump rally, are expected to be hit hard as most of the tech companies, especially semiconductor manufacturers and software companies, have large operations in the Chinese market.Given this, we have highlighted five tech stocks to stay away from given their huge exposure to China. In spite of their double-digit projected earnings growth and positive estimate revisions for this year as well as a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), these stocks are vulnerable to the ongoing trade jitters.Skyworks Solutions Inc.

117,AVGO,"Buoyed by the tax reform in the United States and a resurgent Europe, first-quarter 2018 recorded an all-time high tally of $1.2 trillion for global mergers and acquisition (M&A) activities. This portrays an intense consolidation wave across diverse markets, as most firms aim to capitalize on bullish macroeconomic sentiments to pursue transformative deals.According to Thomson Reuters data, M&A surged 67% year over year although total number of transactions declined 10% to 10,338. This implies that the average deal size increased with clarity on tax and solid equity and debt markets, all of which swelled corporate cash coffers and helped top management to loosen the purse strings. The transactions were also not concentrated in any particular geographic region and were well spread out as M&A volume doubled in Europe, while increasing 67% and 11% in the United States and Asia, respectively.A $67 billion deal inked by U.S. health insurer Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) to acquire pharmacy chain Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) was the biggest M&A deal in the quarter. This was followed by a $38.5 billion deal by German energy firm E.ON SE to acquire the renewable energy business of RWE Aktiengesellschaft.Despite the game-changing transactions, the quarter witnessed intense volatility in equity markets as U.S. President Trump imposed trade tariffs on Chinese goods. This perhaps robbed some companies suitable acquisition opportunities as corporate valuations remained high and management became more cautious to trade at inflated price levels.Regulatory risks also increased during the quarter as exemplified by the heightened threat perceived by the U.S. government in the proposed hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) for domestic chip-maker QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). The transaction was blocked on concerns of national security as government feared that it would lose its technological prowess to the Chinese counterparts.The quarter further witnessed uncertainty on antitrust activities as the U.S. Department of Justice thwarted the $85-billion deal by AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) to acquire Time Warner Inc. . Concerns were raised about how the deal would affect two different sectors and the deal, therefore, was summarily rejected.Nonetheless, the first quarter made a perfect start to the year and is likely to give more firepower to the government as well as to top management of firms to pursue more strategic transactions and swim with the tide.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

118,AVGO,"After a deadly accident involving Uber’s autonomous car in Arizona on Mar 18, the fate of self-driving car technology is in question. Arizona banned Uber from testing vehicles on public roads and the California Department of Motor Vehicles said that Uber has indicated it will not renew its permit to test autonomous vehicles in California.Chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report) said that it has suspended self-driving car tests across the globe, following the Uber debacle. Moreover, a recent accident involving a Tesla Model X has raised concerns over the current progress in self-driving car technology.NvidiaShares of Nvidia suffered huge losses following the announcement, settling 7.8% lower at the end of trading on Mar 27, wiping $11 billion off market cap. The company has seen great support from investors in the past year as self-driving car enthusiasts were encouraged by the company’s leading position as a provider of chips for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence.In fiscal fourth quarter, Nvidia reported revenues of $132 million from its automotive segment, 4.5% of total revenues. However, the company bore the brunt of the recent spate of events. ""Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being,"" per a Reuters article citing Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics.TeslaEarlier last week, a Tesla Model X was involved in a fatal accident that killed the driver and raised concerns over the company’s fate. Although it’s not clear if Tesla’s partial autonomous driving system had been activated at the time of accident, U.S. authorities are examining the situation to judge the cause of the accident.  At a time when Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) is already dealing with doubts over whether it will be able to meet its production targets for the Model 3 sedan, this latest incident adds to Musk’s pressure. The United States Transportation Safety board indicated that it is investigating the accident to evaluate if the mishap was caused by the driver’s negligence or due to the activation of the Autopilot feature.News of the investigation did not fare well for Elon Musk’s company, as shares of Tesla declined 8.2% at the end of trading on Mar 27. “You’ve got the NTSB investigating a new crash, Nvidia suspending autonomous testing, and Tesla can’t make the Model 3. When the stock goes lower like this, it gets harder to raise capital. It’s going to be harder for them to raise money,” per a Bloomberg article citing John Thompson, the chief executive officer of Vilas Capital Management LLC.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the stocks discussed (read: 4 ETFs to Join The Sustainable Investing Trend).ARK Industrial Innovation ETF (ARKQ  -  Free Report)This fund does not track any index in particular as it is an actively managed ETF seeking long-term capital appreciation.

119,AVGO,"President Donald Trump is likely to impose tariffs on China by this weekend. Information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries that are expected to bear the brunt of U.S. tariffs.Notably, the implementation of these tariffs stems from the Trump administration’s concern that manufacturing by Chinese companies for these sectors is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft.Consequently, U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of telecom equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector. However, a hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. wireless equipment manufacturers.Further, this move highlights the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to safeguard next-generation innovative products of these blue-collar industries of the country. That is why investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom Space Trump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat United States as the primary developer and supplier of state-of-the-art products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Notably, most of the big manufacturers of these products are fully patronized by the Chinese government. These companies have become serious threat to the U.S. economic and military supremacy.  China runs a massive $375 billion trade surplus against United States.On Mar 12, Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed $117 billion takeover bid of Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) for Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), U.S. chipset giant and a global leader for setting wireless standards.The government argued that third party entities, especially, the Chinese tech giants like Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts. (Read More: Is the Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal in Jeopardy? Winners & Losers)In recent months, the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has blocked takeover deals of U.S. companies MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC  -  Free Report) by Chinese counterparts. In fact, in January 2018, the security officials of Trump administration contemplated the prospect of the government building its own 5G network to combat China’s economic and cyber threat.Strong Domestic Wireless Infrastructure MarketA growing U.S. economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. This in turn has provided a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless gear manufacturers.On Dec 21, SNS Research reported that the wireless network infrastructure industry is expected to grow at a rate of 2% over the next three years. Per projections, the market will witness an annual spending of $56 billion by 2020, up from $53 billion in 2017. Per the report, the next-generation 5G wireless network is anticipated to account for more than 40% of wireless infrastructure spending by the end of 2025.Our PicksTrump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry. The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese dragon is of foremost importance to the American eagle.At this stage, investors will be better off to investing in U.S. wireless equipment manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China. At this stage, we have narrowed down our search to the following stocks with favourable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with strong growth potential.Chart below shows the performance our five picks in the last three months. NETGEAR Inc.

124,AVGO,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over three consecutive trading sessions. Investors remained concerned over the prospects of a trade war following President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s decision to dismiss Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added to investors’ jitters. Ultimately, investors looking to pick up blue chip stocks on the dip helped the index finish in the green on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.8% on last Friday, moving past the 25,000 mark for the first time since Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data and lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and curbed rate hike fears. The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase.The index gained 3.3% last week. President Trump signed his tariff plan into law per which fresh levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports will be imposed. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the NAFTA with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday. Investors remained concerned about the prospects of a trade war following Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets.Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.The index lost 0.6% on Tuesday after the Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) to abandon the planned takeover of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. This development significantly reduced rate hike fears.The index decreased 1% on Wednesday, ending in the red for the third consecutive trading day following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5%, weighing on the Dow, which registered a one-day decline of around 250 points. Shares of 3M declined 1.4%.The index rebounded on Thursday, increasing 0.5%. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day.Components Moving the Index Apple Inc.

126,AVGO,"""The proposed takeover of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) by the Purchaser (Broadcom - (AVGO  -  Free Report) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,"" the presidential order read.The order was purportedly based on the national security findings of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), but some news reports indicated that no formal order had reached the President and the decision appeared to have been made beforehand.Other reports quoted CFIUS as saying, ""A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,"" and ""While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.""According to a Jefferies report, which cited LexInnova research, Qualcomm is estimated to have a 15% share of 5G-essential patents, Nokia (NOK  -  Free Report) 11% and all of China 10%.At any rate, the presidential order can’t be challenged, nor can the findings of the CFIUS, although the CFIUS jurisdiction can be challenged.Broadcom is doing none of the above and instead stepping away from the deal, including the nomination of directors to replace the current board and focusing on its redomiciling plans. This is a win for the Trump administration because it will bring back tax revenue. There will be a negative impact on Broadcom because the tax rates in the U.S. are higher.On the positive side, Broadcom, once it gets rid of its foreign ownership/control, will be able to pursue most acquisitions in the U.S. without interference from the CFIUS or other regulatory scrutiny (other than the standard procedures).This was quite an unprecedented move wherein Qualcomm management approached the CFIUS to block the deal and the President moved to stop it even before there was an agreement between the companies. It shows that all is far from well at Qualcomm where shareholders were in favor of the deal that management and the board opposed.So now management have their work cut out: to convince shareholders that Qualcomm is worth much more than Broadcom was willing to pay. And they need to complete the NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) acquisition as soon as possible.Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(INTC  -  Free Report) is now rumored to show interest in Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report). Post President Donald Trump’s intervention into Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, chances of a possible merger has brightened up between the two big chip-makers.Intel Corporation Price Intel Corporation Price | Intel Corporation QuoteIntel carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Rationale Behind the Rumored DealBroadcom has been hogging the headlines of late with its hostile bid for Qualcomm. However, the deal has finally come to a conclusion, with President Trump prohibiting the proposed takeover on grounds of national security concerns. The rejection stems from Trump’s concern of conceding China the upper hand in 5G communications technology.Intel was skeptical that a Broadcom-Qualcomm combination could have posed serious competitive threats to its growing data centric business. Reportedly, the second-largest chipmaker had been planning to launch a bid for Broadcom since last year, which, however it postponed due to the ongoing Brocade integration.Further, Intel took a wait & watch policy after Broadcom announced the hostile bid for Qualcomm. We believe that Broadcom’s failed attempt to buy Qualcomm can now encourage Intel to make a bid as the acquisition willprovide its significant competitive advantage in the chip market.Further, a significant portion of Broadcom’s revenues come from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), which contributed more than 10% of revenues in fiscal 2017. Hence, grabbing Broadcom will improve Intel’s foothold into Apple’s supplier chain.We believe that this can be a major incentive for Intel to bid for Broadcom’s assets, which will improve its position in the mobile communications market.3 Technology Stocks at Risk The possibility of Intel acquiring Broadcomhas raised concerns among the chipmakers namely Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report), Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report).Let’s dig into the details on how these semiconductor companies will be hurt by Intel-Broadcom deal:Firstly, Skyworks Solutions, a designer as well as a manufacturer of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors,stands to get hurt from Intel-Broadcom deal. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is significantly dependent on Apple, which accounts for about 40% of Skyworks’ revenues.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price | Skyworks Solutions, Inc. QuoteSkyworks has won contracts in recent times from multiple Tier 1 original equipment manufacturers (OEM) including Apple. The company’s growing presence into Internet of Things (IoT), connected cars, and 5G are significant growth drivers.However, Intel-Broadcom deal can put this ambition into jeopardy. The sheer size of the combined entity will put significant pricing pressure on Skyworks leading to declining margin profile.Secondly, let’s gauge the impact of this possible deal on Qorvo. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) companyis a leading provider of core technologies and radio frequency (RF) solutions for mobile, infrastructure and aerospace/defense applications. A significant portion of Qorvo’s revenues come from a handful of customers including Apple and Huawei, which contributed 34% and 11% of its revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2017.Qorvo, Inc. Price Qorvo, Inc. Price | Qorvo, Inc. QuoteQorvo’s BAW filters, antenna tuners, RF front end modules and envelope tracking power management solution were used in Huawei’s flagship Mate 10 device. Moreover, the company tested the industry’s first RF front end module addressing 5G standalone and 5G non-standalone requirements.During the quarter,  Qorvo was selected as a provider of front-end power amplifiers (PA) to Qualcomm for its Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Reference Design. This will help the company penetrate deeper into the automotive industry.However, Broadcom’s Wireless Communications segment serves the smartphone market with similar products that include a broad variety of RF semiconductor devices, connectivity solutions and custom touch controllers is the closest competitor to Qorvo.Hence, it’s obvious that if Intel acquires Broadcom, it will intensify the competition for Qorvo.Lastly, Micron remains one of the outstanding performers in the semiconductor space. Notably, this Zacks Rank #2 is witnessing improved pricing as well as elevated demand for DRAM and NAND chips. Mobile Business Unit (“MBU”) which includes Micron’s DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash products that are sold to smartphone, feature phone, and tablet mobile-device manufacturers accounted for 22% of fiscal 2017 revenues. Moreover, Micron recently added Apple to its customer roster.Micron Technology, Inc. Price Micron Technology, Inc. Price | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteIf Intel buys Broadcom the combined strength will pose significant threat to Micron's position in the Flash-based products market. Further, the combination can help Intel grab share from the company in Apple’s supply chain base.Bottom LineWhile Apple stands to gain from the deal, Skyworks, Qorvoand Micron could lose out if it goes through. This explains their opposing stands on the issue even as the fate of this rumored deal hangs in the balance.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

128,AVGO,"All the three key indexes started the day strongly after in-line consumer-inflation data subdued rate hike fears. However, benchmarks finished in negative territory on Tuesday after Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom to abandon the planned takeover of Qualcomm, following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.6%, or 156.64 points, to close at 25,178.61. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,783.02. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,588.33, gaining 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7% to close at 15.67. A total of 6.52 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.2 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Tillerson Replaced With CIA Director PompeoOn Tuesday, President Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Inc. (XOM), from his position. Tillerson will be replaced with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, while Pompeo’s position will be taken over by Gina Haspel, CIA’s deputy director. Haspel will become the first woman director of the CIA. Tillerson’s ouster had a broad-based negative impact on key indexes with the Dow registering a decline of more than 170 points, while the Nasdaq ended its seven day long streak of gains.Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, gained 0.2% last month, also in line with the consensus estimate of 0.2%. Core CPI’s gain was less than January’s increase of 0.3%.Although, an increase in the key rate seems certain this month, in line consumer inflation data reduced concerns over the pace of Fed rate hikes this year. Following this development, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) declined 1.1%, becoming the second worst performing sector among the S&P 500. Dow components from this sector, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) fell 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively.Broadcom Biggest Laggard In The S&P 500Shares of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) slumped 5% after the White House issued a statement saying that the “proposed takeover” of QUALCOMM by Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) “is prohibited.” Citing concerns over national security signed an Executive Order late on Monday, President Trump ordered both the companies to ""immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover.""Broadcom was the worst performing stock among both the S&P 500 and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). The sector fell 1.2% with two of its key holdings, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc.

130,AVGO,"After opening higher on the back of a strong February CPI, stocks tumbled into the red in early afternoon trading Tuesday. Some investors appear spooked by the latest political drama in the U.S., including the Trump administration’s decision to block the proposed Broadcom-Qualcomm merger and Rex Tillerson’s departure from the State Department.Through 1:45pm EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 0.15% on the day, while the broader S&P 500 index was about 0.44% lower than its Monday close. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the day’s losers, slumping more than 0.80%.One of the worst-performing tech stocks of the day was Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which dropped more than 4.5% in morning trading after President Donald Trump shut down the chipmaker’s proposed merger with Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report).In a presidential order released on Monday, Trump said “credible evidence” led him to conclude that Singapore-based Broadcom’s buyout of Qualcomm would have impaired the national security of the United States. The deal, if it had gone through, would have marked the largest technology acquisition in history.On Tuesday, President Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), from his position. Tillerson was considered to be a level-headed businessman with an appreciation for global deals, so his firing could be another indication that the White House intends to shake up trade policy.“The worry is with the Tillerson ouster and Broadcom blockage from the Trump administration that this will add fuel to the fire in a battle versus China on the horizon over the coming 12 to 18 months,” said GBH Insights analyst Dan Ives in a note.The Trump administration has already raised concerns about an impending trade war with China by implementing new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Metal exports to America are not a huge piece of China’s economy, but the tariffs were seen as a direct challenge to the Asian nation.But those tariffs will likely impact U.S.-based metal importers the most, leaving plenty of tech firms unscathed. However, Washington’s latest moves, including Tillerson’s departure and the rejection of the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, could spell volatility for the sector.“While most tech names including FANG stocks are relatively insulated from any China worries/headwinds, this is enough of a near term concern for tech investors to take some profits after a golden run over the last few weeks with many of these names making new highs,” Ives added.Want more market analysis from this author?

131,AVGO,"Donald J. Trump has released an order, asking Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) to immediately and permanently abandon its proposed takeover by Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report). The Presidential Order put an end to what could have been the biggest ever tech deal, on grounds of national security. The deal would have affected United States' leading position in creating technology and setting standards for next generation mobile phone communications, as China is steadily taking a lead in the space.Apart from the dismissal of the proposed takeover, any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition or takeover, whether made directly or indirectly, shall also be restrained.The order also disqualified Broadcom's 15 proposed candidates from standing for election as directors of Qualcomm. It restricted Qualcomm from accepting the nomination of or votes for any of these 15 candidates.Meanwhile,Qualcomm has been ordered to reschedule its 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on an earlier date, based on the required 10-day notice period from the issue of the written order. Shareholders of record as on Jan 8, 2018 are eligible to attend the meeting. The new date is expected to be Mar 23 instead of Apr 5.The White House further demanded a confirmation in writing from both the companies about the termination of the pending takeover in compliance with the order.Last week, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigated and reviewed Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion hostile takeover offer for Qualcomm.

132,AVGO,"The semiconductor space remained largely unaffected by the broad market sell-off seen in early February. This is because the semiconductor industry is clearly leading the broad technology space this year on encouraging fundamentals, solid corporate earnings, strong outlook and investors’ continued appreciation of value-centric traditional stocks. The rally has strengthened courtesy of a series of consolidation, which pushed several chip stocks and ETFs to new highs.Below we discuss some strong reasons for investing in semiconductor ETFs.Hot TrendsSemiconductors  are the most important driver of overall technology growth as these are used in cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies are fueling huge growth in the space (read: How to Invest in the Hottest Technologies With ETFs).Additionally, the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) technology – the next wireless revolution - will likely create further growth opportunities.Encouraging FundamentalsThe twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing chip stocks higher. This is because companies like Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the chipmakers are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase shareholder payouts. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically performs well in a maturing economic cycle.ConsolidationThe semiconductor space has been witnessing an increase in mergers and acquisitions talks. The latest development is that Intel might launch an offer to acquire Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), which was running after Qualcomm for months and now Trump has blocked its $117 billion bid due to national security concerns. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is trying to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NXPI, which was announced in October 2016 (read: Broadcom Launches Bid for Qualcomm: Semiconductor ETFs Surge).Marvell Technology Group (MRVL  -  Free Report) is also in the process of acquiring smaller rival Cavium Inc. CAVM.O for about $6 billion. The transaction is expected to be completed by mid-2018. Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report) also announced to buy Microsemi Corp  for $8.35 billion early this month. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.Strong OutlookAfter generating record annual sales in 2017, the global semiconductor industry  begun 2018 on a strong note, posting its highest-ever January sales and 18th consecutive month of year-over-year sales increase, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS). The agency expects global semiconductor revenues to rise 7% year over year in 2018.Per Gartner, worldwide semiconductor revenues are expected to grow 7.5% to $451 billion this year buoyed by higher prices for both DRAM and NAND flash memory.Impressive EarningsPer the latest Earnings Trends report, earnings growth for the broad technology sector turned out to be very strong, with total Q4 earnings up 23.7% on 11.1% higher revenues. Semiconductors have contributed the most with 68.8% earnings growth, followed by 51.1% growth in miscellaneous technology (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Cheap ValuationPer a MarketWatch article, semiconductors, as a group, are still cheaper than the S&P 500. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is now trading at 16.1 times the consensus earnings estimates for the next 12 months, while the S&P 500 is trading at 17 times the estimates.ETFs to TapIn view of the reasons discussed above, we strongly believe that investors should consider semiconductor ETFs. Below, we have highlighted them. All these have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy):iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 firms with heavy concentration on the top five firms accounting for a combined 38.3% share. It has amassed $1.6 billion in its asset base and trades in a solid average volume of around 589,000 shares a day. The fund charges 48 bps in fees a year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Crushed S&P 500 in 9-Year Bull Run).VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to 26 securities by tracking the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. It is concentrated on the top two firms with double-digit exposure each. The product has managed assets worth $1.3 billion and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. It is heavily traded with a volume of more than 4.5 million shares per day and has Zacks ETF Rank #2.PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, holding 30 securities in its basket, with each accounting for less than 6.1% of the assets. The product has AUM of $372.1 million and sees moderate average daily volume of 101,000 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.63%. PSI has a Zacks ETF Rank #1.SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, holding 36 stocks in its portfolio. It is widely spread across a number of securities, with none holding more than 3.77% share. The fund has AUM of $334.7 million and an average daily volume of about 119,000 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1.First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to the most-liquid U.S. semiconductor securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index.

133,AVGO,"Benchmarks closed mostly in the red on Monday with both the Dow and S&P 500 declining, while the Nasdaq increased over the day. Ever since President Trump imposed fresh levies on steel and aluminum imports investors have been concerned over prospects of a trade war. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets. However, tech-heavy index Nasdaq managed to end at new highs for second straight day following an investor friendly jobs report on Friday.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.6%, or 156.64 points, to close at 25,178.61. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,783.02. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,588.33, gaining 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7% to close at 15.67. A total of 6.52 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.2 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Trump’s Tariff Law to Initiate Trade War?On Mar 8, President Trump signed his tariff plan into law, which will come into effect from Mar 23. Per this law, fresh levies have been imposed on steel and aluminum imported from other countries. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the two countries.However, Trump’s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries with similar kind of moves. This in turn had a negative impact on the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) which declined 1.2%, becoming the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.Nasdaq Hits All-Time High For Second Straight DayThe tech-based index hit an all-time high for the second consecutive trading day. Shares of Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) rose 3.6% after a statement from the White House stated that the “proposed takeover” of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) by Broadcom “is prohibited.” President Trump signed an Executive Order late on Monday, which ordered both the companies to ""immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover.""Broadcom was the second best performing stock among the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK).

134,AVGO,"Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) has been dominating headlines with its proposed merger with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). The status of that deal has finally come to a conclusion, with President Trump’s order to immediately prohibit the proposed takeover on grounds of national security concerns.Trump’s move came after an engrossing week which reflected Broadcom’s roaring plans to move to the United States, Qualcomm’s executive chairman stepping down from being enthusiastically involved in the company and chip giant Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) getting involved in the argument.The rejection stems from Trump’s concern of conceding China the upper hand in mobile cell phone communications. As Qualcomm emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China's Huawei Technologies Co, the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would be a clear signal of losing technology-knowhow for this sector to China. This in turn makes Qualcomm a valued company.The DealIn the beginning, Broadcom had offered $70 per share for a total value of $130 billion that was subsequently rejected by Qualcomm. After the rejection, Broadcom presented the ‘best and final offer’ of $82 per share, which was rejected again.Broadcom made yet another acquisition offer recently for Qualcomm. The bid now stands at $117 million, or $79 per share, down from $82 per share previously.Broadcom intended to go ahead with the deal in order to reap the benefits of cost reduction.  Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will provide significant advantage to Broadcom. Moreover, Broadcom is eyeing this cash cow for its patent licenses, which amounted to more than $5 billion at the end of 2017.CFIUS ObjectionThe U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) has outlined key concerns in a letter dated Mar 5, 2018 to both Broadcom and Qualcomm related to their proposed merger deal.The decision of the regulatory body is unprecedented in view of the fact that Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion (net of debt) bid for a hostile takeover of Qualcomm has not been finalized so far. The decision of the secretive government panel reflects an aggressive position by the administration to protect major American corporate names from being acquired by non-U.S. entities.Several Concerns Regarding the DealQualcomm is U.S. mobile chipset giant and a global leader for setting wireless standards, Broadcom is based in Singapore, notwithstanding the fact that the company expressed its desire in last November to shift its legal headquarter to the United States.Qualcomm generally spends more than 20% of its revenues on R&D every year. Massive investment in R&D is an integral part of Qualcomm to maintain its global leadership position in the smartphone chipset market.  Compromising Qualcomm's assets through arrangements with ""third party foreign entities,"" will significantly affect national security of the United States.It appears that members of the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) are concerned that the emergence of Huawei as a major supplier of communications equipment and Broadcom’s chances of selling parts of Qualcomm to Huawei or another Chinese firm to bring down costs could see important communications technology get transferred to the Chinese.Redomicile Plan to Help Qualcomm BidBroadcom had announced its intent to redomicile in the United States. The company is currently incorporated in Singapore with headquarters there as well as in San Jose, CA.The redomiciling will help Broadcom to aggressively pursue the Qualcomm bid that was recently rejected. Qualcomm believes that the current offer undervalues the company. It is also uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.We note that being an overseas-based company, Broadcom is subjected to scrutiny by the CFIUS.The redomiciling will at least make the regulatory environment smooth for Broadcom, which remains committed to pursue the hostile Qualcomm bid.Broadcom Limited Price Broadcom Limited Price | Broadcom Limited QuoteConclusionAlthough the buyout will make Broadcom the largest entity in the tech segment, it is likely to face anti-trust regulation issues for the same.If the deal is cancelled on account of regulatory opposition, Broadcom will pay $8 billion for the disruption caused.

135,AVGO,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 15. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2%. Broadcombeat earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.54%.Broadcom’s expanding product portfolio makes it well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. The company is also benefiting from strong demand for Wi-Fi chips and radio frequency solutions from smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).The company’s shares have returned 17.2% year over year, substantially outperforming the 11.3% rally of the industry.It has been dominating headlines thanks to its proposed merger with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). The status of that deal has finally come to a conclusion, with President Trump’s order to immediately prohibit the proposed takeover on grounds of national security concerns. But investors will certainly want to focus on Broadcom’s latest results to gauge its financial health as the deal gets terminated.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderSegmental Details & Strong Product PortfolioBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. Last quarter, Wireless Communications (37% of total revenues) were up 33.4% year over year and 40% quarter over quarter to roughly $1.80 billion. Strong growth was driven by the ramp up in shipments of next-generation platform from the company’s large North American smartphone customer. Higher dollar content in this platform also drove top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wireless Communications segment revenues are currently pegged at $1.93 billion.Coming to the, Enterprise Storage Segment (13% of total revenues) it increased 15% from the year-ago quarter but plunged 12.2% sequentially to $645 million. The sequential decline was due to lower hard-drive disks (HDDs). However, strong growth expectation in the server and storage connectivity business will completely mitigate the negative impact from HDDs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Enterprise Storage segment revenues are currently pegged at $937 million.Moving forward, the company’s has launched its first-ever silicon-proven 7nm intellectual property (“IP”) targeting application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) platform for deep learning and networking markets.We believe that the company’s extensive product portfolio, which serves multiple applications within four primary end markets (Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial & Other), will help it to positively impact to-be-quarter’s results.Acquisitions Plays an Important RoleAcquisitions have played a significant role in deciding Broadcom’s growth trajectory. The long-delayed Brocade acquisition will boost its position in the storage area networking (“SAN”) space.Broadcom was also targeting Qualcomm. Recently, the company made another acquisition offer for Qualcomm. The bid now stands at $117 million, or $79 per share, down from $82 per share previously.However, the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) has outlined key concerns in a letter dated Mar 5, 2018 to both Broadcom and Qualcomm Inc. related to their proposed merger deal.The decision of the secretive government panel reflects an aggressive position by the administration to protect major American corporate names from being acquired by non-U.S. entities.Broadcom has also stated its intention to redomicile in the United States that will help it pursue the Qualcomm acquisition again more aggressively. The move will also smoothen regulatory hurdles. Going forward, we believe that if the deal goes ahead Broadcom can reap the benefits of cost reduction. We note that it was able to derive cost cutting and financial engineering benefits from its merger with Avago Technologies.Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will provide significant advantage to Broadcom.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

137,AVGO,"Keeping its earnings streak alive, Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Quarterly revenues and earnings not only came ahead of the mid-point of the company’s guided ranges but also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Additionally, the top and bottom lines marked a significant year-over-year improvement. Per the company, this growth stemmed from better sales execution and efficient cost management.Marvell president and CEO Matt Murphy stated in a press release that ""Our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year results continue to demonstrate that Marvell's strategy is working and that our team is executing it very well.”Quarter DetailsMarvell’s revenues increased 8.7% year over year to $615.4 million surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $611.6 million. Moreover, reported revenues came ahead of the mid-point of management’s guided range of $595-$625 million (mid-point $610 million).In the end markets, storage revenues (53% of total revenues) grew 4% year over year and 3% sequentially on better-than-expected demand at the SSD (Solid-State Drive) segments, along with elevated demand from enterprise and data-center operators.The networking business (25%) increased 5% year over year and 3% sequentially mainly due to increase in the network of processor product line, i.e. switch, PHY and embedded.Revenues from connectivity (14%) climbed 31% year over year, primarily driven by solid demand for “high-end voice-enabled” and home media streaming applications. However, sequentially, the segment’s revenues slipped 16%. Other product (8%) revenues during the quarter grew 20% year over year and 5% sequentially.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marvell Technology Group Ltd. QuoteMarvell’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $383.1 million, up 17% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin also increased from 57.8% to 62.3% on a year-over-year basis, primarily buoyed by a favorable product mix and higher revenue base. Gross margin also came in marginally higher than management’s expectation of 62%.Non-GAAP operating expenses rose 2.4% year over year to $217.6 million and were within the company’s expectations of $215-$220 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 210 basis points to 35.4%. Marvell’s non-GAAP operating margins came in at 26.9% compared with 20.3% reported in the year-ago quarter. The results were positively influenced by higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.The company reported non-GAAP net income of approximately $164.8 million during the quarter as compared with $118.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter. On per-share basis, non-GAAP earnings came in at 32 cents, up 45.5% from the year-earlier quarter’s earnings of 22 cents. Quarterly non-GAAP earnings also came ahead of the mid-point of management guided range of 29-33 cents (mid-point 31 cents) as well as beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Balance SheetMarvell exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.841 billion as compared with $1.732 billion in the previous quarter. The company carries no long-term debt. Cash from operating activities during the fiscal amounted to $571.1 million.During the fiscal, Marvell repurchased stocks worth $527.6 million and paid dividend of $119.3 million to its shareholders.OutlookMarvell projects first-quarter fiscal 2019 revenues in the range of $585-$615 million (mid-point $600 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $595 million.Management expects GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 62% and 63%, respectively. GAAP operating expenses are expected to lie between $250 million and $260 million, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $215 million.The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 29-33 cents (mid-point 31 cents), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 29 cents. On GAAP basis, earnings are projected to come between 22 cents and 26 cents per share.Our TakeMarvell ended fiscal 2018 on an impressive note, reporting better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the company provided encouraging fiscal first-quarter earnings guidance.Though macro headwinds and stringent regulations might put its financials under pressure in the near term, we believe strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products will act as a catalyst. This will be supported by growth from the company’s wide range of the recently-launched Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.In an effort to expand offerings beyond hard disk drives to high growth areas such as data centers and wireless communications, Marvell entered into an agreement to acquire Cavium in the last quarter. This buyout will provide the company an opportunity to expand its offerings and access newer markets.The company’s current restructuring initiative will help Marvell improve cloud infrastructure and applications, which are projected to drive the top line. The latest buyback scheme also reflects sound financial position and favorable prospects.Nonetheless, intensifying competition in the High Definition (HD) storage drive market makes us increasingly cautious about the stock’s prospects. In the HD storage drive market, Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) is Marvell’s main competitor as these two are the primary SoC (system on a chip) suppliers. Also, NXP Semiconductors, QUALCOMM (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments offer various components to the market.Given the fact that Broadcom has been trying to acquire Qualcomm, while the latter is already in process to buy NXP Semiconductor, the former will become a bigger entity, along with enhanced capabilities, which can supply SoCs as well as components. This might dampen Marvell’s long-term prospects.Therefore, despite the company’s strong quarterly results, Marvell’s shares declined roughly 3% during yesterday’s after-hour trade. The stock has unperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. Marvell has gained 12%, while the industry recorded growth of 12.7%. Currently, Marvell has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the semiconductor space is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

138,AVGO,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced its plan of opening an innovation hub in Zurich, Switzerland. Accenture defines its innovation hub as a place where clients can “work side-by-side” with the company’s professionals “to ideate, rapidly prototype and launch solutions”, in order to meet the requirements of the fast-evolving digital world.Innovation hub is an integral part of Accenture Innovation Architecture which brings in “together capabilities – from research, ventures and labs to studios, innovation centers and delivery centers – to develop and deliver disruptive innovations for clients, and to scale them faster.”The Zurich innovation hub will house all the five key elements — Accenture Studios, Accenture Interactive Studio, Fjord Studio, Liquid Studio and Accenture Extended Reality. The facility which is located at St. Annagasse 9 is just a seven-minute walk from the company’s city headquarter at Fraumünsterstrasse.Accenture’s recent move is believed to be part of its broader strategy to open new facilities across different parts of the world to provide clients access to its deep industry knowledge, leading technology capabilities and business acumen. Earlier this January, the company opened two innovation hubs — one in Tokyo, Japan, and the other in Boston, the United States.This strategy will help Accenture have more offices near client headquarters. We believe with these footprint-expansion moves, the company will be able to help clients create, manage, integrate and analyze value-focused solutions, thereby reducing cost and giving clients increased response to change.The company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by continued focus on innovative product roll outs, continued investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions. In addition, we believe regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company’s revenue stream.Accenture’s shares have appreciated 28.7% in a year’s time, outperforming 17.7% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (ASX  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report). Mellanox Technologies sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Advanced Semiconductor Engineering and Broadcom carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

139,AVGO,"Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm (read: Qualcomm Raises NXP Bid, Broadcom Responds) has raised a few red flags over at the White House. According to news reports, the government has asked and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has agreed to postpone for 30 days its shareholders’ meeting (supposed to be held yesterday) where shareholders were expected to vote in favor of replacing its current board with Broadcom-selected directors.The deal is now up for national security review even before it has been signed in an unprecedented move by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). While Broadcom has said that it was engineered by Qualcomm, it’s worth noting that it has reportedly been working with CFIUS for the past year. The company now says that since it is bringing its headquarters back from Singapore to the U.S., it soon won’t be subject to CFIUS directions anyway. Why Is CFIUS Objecting?It appears that members of the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are concerned that the emergence of Huawei as a major supplier of communications equipment and Broadcom’s chances of selling parts of Qualcomm to Huawei or another Chinese firm to bring down costs could see important communications technology get transferred to the Chinese.The treasury department under which CFIUS is organized has issued a letter pointing to the importance of having a well-known and trusted company “hold the dominant role that Qualcomm does in the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.” Huawei already owns 10% of the patents for the 5G standard and if it could gain access to Qualcomm’s patents, this would significantly increase its share. “A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,” the letter read.  Republican Senator John Cornyn also indicated in a letter to theTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin last week that in this context, Broadcom’s determination to take over Qualcomm in a hostile bid appeared significant.ConclusionQualcomm is set to maintain dominance in the 5G standard, as it recently brought a large number of carriers and handset makers to adopt its technologies. It has also made peace with Samsung, a major customer that played a big role in its legal troubles with the Korean FTC.The company’s need for Broadcom isn’t clear because cost cutting isn’t going to help it stay at the leading edge. Senator Cornyn’s concerns seem justified under the circumstances.However, that doesn’t mean a deal won’t take place. As Broadcom pointed out, it may soon be outside CFIUS’s jurisdiction. It’s not exactly anti-competitive because the companies operate in adjacent but different segments of the semiconductor market.Moreover, customer losses, if they occur, will not be a problem for Qualcomm investors who are cashing out. While Qualcomm customers are concerned about the takeover, they may not be in a position to sway investor opinion if the deal is sweet enough for investors.The board has a big task ahead to convince the owners that the company is worth more than what Broadcom is willing to pay.Both Qualcomm and Broadcom shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Semiconductor stocks worth buying instead are Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), or Diodes (DIOD  -  Free Report), or Ichor Holdings (ICHR  -  Free Report), which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

140,AVGO,"In a rare intervention by the government, the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has outlined key concerns in a letter dated Mar 5, 2018 to both Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) related to their proposed merger deal. CFISU will closely review the deal and has asked Qualcomm to postpone shareholders' meeting for a month.The decision of the regulatory body is unprecedented in view of the fact that Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion (net of debt) bid for a hostile takeover of Qualcomm has not been finalized so far. The decision of the secretive government panel reflects an aggressive position by the administration to protect major American corporate names from being acquired by non-U.S. entities.Importantly, several U.S. tech giants have taken a stand on the deal. While Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) will be a beneficiary if the deal goes through, both Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Google of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) opposed the deal.U.S. Treasury Raises Several ConcernsFirst, while Qualcomm is U.S. mobile chipset giant and a global leader for setting wireless standards, Broadcom is based in Singapore, notwithstanding the fact that the company expressed its desire in last November to shift its legal headquarter to the United States.Second, Broadcom has a reputation of reducing R&D expenditures. Analysts have estimated that the company needs to raise more than $100 billion in debt to complete the proposed deal. Consequently, management may be tempted to cut R&D expenditures in order to service debt. Qualcomm generally spends more than 20% of its revenues on R&D every year.Third, massive investment in R&D is an integral part of Qualcomm to maintain its global leadership position in the smarphone chipset market.  Compromising Qualcomm's assets through arrangements with ""third party foreign entities,"" will significantly affect national security of the United States.The third party entities, especially, the Chinese tech giants like Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts. Qualcomm has issued and applied more than 130,000 patents primarily in smartphone areas.Both Broadcom and Qualcomm currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Winners and LosersIf the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal sees light of the day, smartphone giant Apple may be a major beneficiary. Qualcomm which provides chipset for iPhone and iPAD is currently engaged in $1 billion legal battle related to royalty payment with Apple. But Broadcom expressed desire to resolve the litigation amicably if the deal goes through.Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google of Alphabet have raised concern about the proposed merger. These two tech giants consider an independent Qualcomm as being more closely aligned with their interests than a Broadcom-owned Qualcomm.For Google, most of the Android-based smartphones and tablets run on Qualcomm’s chipset. Consequently, a decline in chipset standard will be detrimental to Google. Similarly, Microsoft recently unveils first Windows 10 OS based PCs using Qualcomm’s chipset.Telecom M&A to Become TougherThe decision will have a strong bearing on the merger and acquisition (M&A) activities in the telecom space.On one hand, President Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his tenure. The telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change. A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC), helmed by Ajit Pai, exercising lesser restrictions, certainly augurs well for the telecom industry.On the other hand, a sheer protectionist strategy like national security reflects growing concern by Trump administration over the flurry of deals in the United States by foreign companies.The government seems highly concerned about the fact that United States may lose its edge in areas like technology and telecom to China and other Asian countries. In recent months, CFIUS has blocked takeover deals of U.S. companies MoneyGram and Lattice Semiconductor by Chinese counterparts.Importantly, In January 2018, security officials of Trump administration have considered the prospect of the government building its own 5G network to combat China’s economic and cyber threat.Bottom LineWhile the U.S. tech industry is divided about the potential impact of the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, the U.S. government expressed severe concern about the potential risk of an unnamed actor, possibly Huawei, working through Broadcom to hurt U.S. national security.While Apple stands to gain from the deal, Microsoft and Alphabet could lose out if it goes through. This explains their opposing stands on the issue even as the fate of this key deal hangs in the balance.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

141,AVGO,"The Semiconductor industry is undergoing a massive consolidation wave. A huge number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worth hundreds of billion dollars have taken place over the last few years.Consolidation is natural in a mature industry like semiconductor which is now more than 60 years old. This industry is currently plagued with two huge challenges, which include escalating costs of producing chips for devices and a sluggish growth rate.With continued innovation over the decades, the size of chips has shrunk to that of a few atoms, while the costs of producing these have flared up. Moreover, escalating costs for designing, packaging and testing are becoming unaffordable for most companies, especially for the smaller firms.Additionally, the industry has been countering a sluggish growth-rate challenge despite  big trends like Internet of Things (IoT) which is believed to add an extraordinary volume in sales of electronic devices. Over the last 15-20 years, the semiconductor industry has recorded growth at an annualized rate of less than 5%.M&A is the RescueIn such a turbulent environment, semiconductor companies need to be huge in order to compete effectively. Therefore, these companies have resorted to M&A in an effort to grab more market share, cut costs, boost productivity and improve investment returns through scale economies.Over the last 24 months, the industry has witnessed more than 10 major mergers and acquisitions which have a combined worth of more than $100 billion, such as the buyout of Altera by Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and purchase of Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) by Avago, which retained the name of the acquired company.The acquisition of Altera has helped Intel get a chip technology which the latter, otherwise, did not have i.e. field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This technology has strengthened its server offerings which enjoy huge demand from data-center operators. Also, FPGAs are very useful in IoT implementation which is a big trend in the technology sector, at the moment.Similarly, the Avago-Broadcom merger has made the current Broadcom the leading diversified communications semiconductor company in the world. This alliance has also resulted in annualized cost synergies of approximately $750 million — a perfect example of enhancing market share and improving economies of scale through M&A activity.Industry Signaling a New Consolidation WaveThe last few months have been eventful for the industry in terms of M&A activities like buyout of Cavium by Marvell Technology and Microchip (MCHP  -  Free Report) taking over Microsemi . The most interesting is Broadcom’s aggressive approach of buying QUALCOMM (QCOM) which, looking at the current scenario, seems to be turning out as a hostile takeover.All the recent M&A events are hinting toward a new wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry in the near future.Grab this Emerging OpportunityM&A announcements generally result in a massive surge of the targeted company’s share prices, thereby providing investors an opportunity to make huge money overnight. As the consolidation cycle for the semiconductor industry does not seem to end any time soon, it is wise to stay focused on stocks that can be a potential takeover target.We, at Zacks, have searched four semiconductor stocks which might get an acquisition offer in few months’ time.The first stock in our list is Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) which is a specialist in making audio-chips. However, for the past few quarters this company has not been performing well due to its overdependence on a single customer — Apple Inc. — which accounts for more than 75% of its total revenues.Apple’s latest iPhone X sales have remained below expectations, in turn hurting Cirrus Logic’s overall financial performance. Due to this, the company’s shares have plummeted in a year’s time. The stock is currently trading near its 52-week low and has lost 17.8% of its value over the past year. Also, the company is highly undervalued as it trades at a forward P/E multiple of 10.1x, which is a significant discount to the industry average of 14x.We believe there is no such problem in the company’s business model. It is a good takeover target for companies which are specialized in providing hardware to smartphone makers like Qualcomm. Moreover, the cheap valuation makes it an attractive buyout opportunity.Smart Global Holdings Inc. (SGH  -  Free Report), which is a leading provider of DRAM memory to the Brazil market, is another semiconductor company which looks like a potential takeover target. Although the company was founded 25 years back, it got listed in May 2017. The company’s last three quarterly results have been stellar, thanks to elevated demand as well as prices of DRAMs. According to various research reports, the prospects of DRAM memory chip makers will remain bright this year due to supply shortage.Furthermore, although the stock has soared a whopping 182% in the last year, it is still undervalued given the fact that it currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of just 7.6x, significantly lower than the industry average of 14x. Moreover, the company has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 15%, much higher than the industry average of 10.2%.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) may also be another acquisition target as the company is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market. Over the coming years, we expect an increasing number of PCs/servers to use the flash-based solid state technology for storage. The storage market has been witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data.Various research firms suggest NAND (non-volatile storage technology) demand will remain very strong in 2018 as well. This demand will also rise further and might even surpass the manufacturing capacity, leading to periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term. Marvell has been benefiting from this growing demand for SSD products.Further, although the stock has appreciated 47.9% in a year’s time, it is still undervalued given the fact that it currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of just 17.8x, significantly lower than its industry average of 24.9x. Moreover, the company has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 16.3%, way higher than the industry average of 9.1%.Another potential pick is MaxLinear, Inc. (MXL  -  Free Report), which is a provider of radio-frequency analog and mixed signal semiconductor SoC solutions for broadband communication applications offering small silicon die-size, and low power consumption. The company recorded a 31% increase in its last quarter revenues which indicates that its increased investment toward sales and marketing are paying off. We believe although elevated expenses are hurting its near-term profitability, these will have long-term benefits.The stock currently trades near to its 52-week low and has lost 9.8% of its value over the past year. Also, the company has a forward P/E multiple of 14.2x, which is almost in line with the industry average of 14x.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

142,AVGO,"Per a FierceWireless report, the United States’ government — through its Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) — has finally intervened into Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) proposed $117 billion hostile takeover offer of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). CFIUS is an inter-agency committee of the U.S. government that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in U.S. companies or operations.Per a recent CFIUS order, Qualcomm has postponed its 2018 annual shareholders’ meeting from Mar 6 to Apr 5. The delayed meeting gives each side a chance to present its case to Qualcomm shareholders. Meanwhile, CFIUS will also investigate and review the proposed takeover deal by Broadcom.The government has raised concerns that the proposed takeover is likely to raise national security issues and potentially affect the United States’ role in the development of 5G wireless network technology, as China is forging ahead to take a lead in the space.Broadcom’s Efforts and Threats from ChinaBroadcom has been trying for the past three-four months to takeover Qualcomm with its multiple bids. On Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom initially offered $70 per share, of which $60 was to be paid in cash and the rest in shares. The revised offer, which is Broadcom’s ""best and final offer,"" values each share at $82 ($60 a share in cash and the rest in shares).However, Broadcom’s attempts to acquire Qualcomm for creating a wireless powerhouse was thwarted again when its revised bid was rejected unanimously by Qualcomm’s board of directors, on grounds of inadequacy and potential antitrust hurdles.Since this is an unsolicited, hostile bid to take control of the company, Broadcom is also looking to replace the entire Qualcomm board with 11 people of its own choosing.Moreover, if Broadcom is successful in acquiring Qualcomm, it is expected to break up Qualcomm and sell the pieces to a Chinese firm. Thus, national wireless carriers would be left with no choice other than buying Chinese equipment.This could potentially affect the U.S. position in the emerging market for 5G services, thus paving the way for Chinese companies to gain an upper hand in the sector. The U.S. market will be left with only some of the small existing number of equipment suppliers.Consequently, if Broadcom succeeds in the takeover, it might be a major loss to the nation. On the other hand, Broadcom’s successful takeover of Qualcomm might also be the biggest tech deal. The proposed combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm may create the world's third-largest semiconductor company, lagging Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung.The semiconductor industry is locked up in a race of mergers and acquisitions. We currently await updates on this front as to which side the CFIUS decision turns up.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Qualcomm performed pretty well. Shares of Qualcomm have soared 27.1% outpacing the industry’s rally of 16.9%. Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderQualcomm carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Double-digit growth in all three major geographies is instrumental in driving the total annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of the company.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARR is $2.02 billion, up 26.5% from the reported number in the year-ago quarter.Strong adoption of products is driving subscription revenues for the company. Cloud subscriptions are driven by robust performance of BIM 360 and Fusion tools.The company’s focus to fast integrate new technology into Fusion 360, advancement of BIM 360 platform and the growth of its Forge platform are positives.  Also, renewal opportunities for cloud are high in the quarter.Autodesk is also gaining from the Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) program. The company anticipates strong EBA sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, the company continues to expect decline in maintenance plan subscriptions. Additionally, slowdown in cloud subscription is a headwind.Although the company plans to keep spending unchanged over the next year, it remains concerned about increasing foreign exchange headwinds, which might weigh heavily on its expenses. Moreover, its restructuring plan will remain an overhang on margins.Autodesk, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Autodesk, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Autodesk, Inc.

148,AVGO,"Last week, I wrote about how Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) softened its rejection of Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) bid by meeting with its key people: Qualcomm Meets Broadcom After Rejecting Its Revised Offer. But the company reportedly hasn’t said much since then, either to Broadcom representatives or to the public. Its response has instead been to raise the offer for NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) from $110 to $127.50 per share in cash.Raising the price irked Broadcom, which put out a statement saying, “Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders."" It has also said that it will reduce the cash portion of its own bid for Qualcomm by $3 if it buys NXP at the new price. It’s new offer for the company is $117 billion, reports Reuters.Qualcomm Needs to Buy NXPQualcomm may be able to close the deal at the new price, as it has now got agreements from nine big shareholders, including Eliott Managementand Soroban Capital Partners that had been pushing for a higher price. These investors together control a 28% stake. If 70% of the shares are tendered, Qualcomm can buy out the entire company in a two-step process as agreed with its board.If NXP shareholders don’t approve the deal, the company will pay $1.3 billion to Qualcomm as cancellation fee and if Qualcomm can’t find the resources or acquire the necessary government approval, it will have to pay NXP $2 billion (China’s MOFCOM is the only regulator left to approve the deal). At any rate, NXP share prices remain close to (slightly below) the revised offer price, so most investors seem happy with it.The financial considerations aside, NXP solves many problems for the leading mobile chip maker. The company is the leading supplier of automotive chips and has also built capabilities in IoT. Qualcomm on the other hand, leads in mobile chip technology and is attempting to make inroads into Intel’s computing territory. While the mobile phone market is slowing down, automotive and IoT applications, where Intel is building capabilities, represent growth opportunities for the company.There’s also been some talk about strained ties with its top customer Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), but Qualcomm is taking this one case at a time. In principle, Apple isn’t saying Qualcomm violated the law, but that the law needs to be changed because it unduly favors companies licensing IP on FRAND terms.The fact that Qualcomm withheld a billion dollars it promised Apple as rebate for using its chips exclusively is a different story. In the meantime, Qualcomm’s receivables are also increasing as Apple continues to use its technology without payment.While its dispute with Apple escalates, Qualcomm has managed to settle things in Korea with Samsung, the main plaintiff in the Korean FTC case. It’s of course unclear as of now, but Apple could find it more difficult to get the law changed if others across the industry don’t have issue with it. Notably, Qualcomm recently announced 5G partnerships with carriers and handset makers that included most of its current customers but not Apple.Why Broadcom Wants Qualcomm At AllBroadcom, on the other hand, has a great track record integrating acquisitions (although Qualcomm is by far the largest, so it will be that much harder). Its philosophy is to take out extra costs and increase efficiency of operations. In all probability this is what it wants to do with Qualcomm as well. Qualcomm’s licensing business is naturally high-margin but Broadcom may be able to reduce costs at the chip making division.The other thing it could do is agree to Apple’s demand that it pay lower royalties and thereby retain a key customer.ConclusionThe two companies don’t seem to operate at the same level. Broadcom is more about efficient operations (though Qualcomm’s IP won’t hurt of course). Qualcomm on the other hand is more aggressive; it has a good R&D team and wants to keep investing in it. It wants to go after markets that are likely to generate strong growth and it doesn’t mind taking a few risks.The kind of mindset that has driven Qualcomm’s success and likely will drive it going forward isn’t the same as the one driving Broadcom. But then Hock Tan has been exceptionally successful at integrations, so it could be a good combination, you never know.Qualcomm shares have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The bid now stands at $117 million, or $79 per share, down from $82 per share previously.Broadcom lowered its bid as a result of Qualcomm increasing its offer to acquire NXP Semiconductors for $44 billion. The company believes that Qualcomm's latest bid overvalues NXP.Earlier Broadcom had offered $70 per share for a total value of $130 billion that was subsequently rejected by Qualcomm. After the rejection, Broadcom presented the ‘best and final offer’ of $82 per share, which was rejected again.Per Qualcomm, the sole reason for the repeated rejection of the offer was an undervalued deal.Why Broadcom Wants to Acquire the ChipmakerBroadcom intends to go ahead with the deal in order to reap the benefits of cost reduction. We note that it was able to derive cost cutting and financial engineering benefits from its merger with Avago Technologies.Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will provide significant advantage to Broadcom. Moreover, Broadcom is eyeing this cash cow for its patent licenses, which amounted to more than $5 billion at the end of 2017.Although the buyout will make Broadcom the largest entity in the tech segment, it is likely to face anti-trust regulation issues for the same. However, Broadcom plans to sell two of Qualcomm’s businesses, namely the Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones to avoid such an issue.If the deal is cancelled on account of regulatory opposition, Broadcom will pay $8 billion for the disruption caused. Broadcom expects to obtain necessary approvals to close the deal within a year. If it takes longer, it will pay 6% a year of the amount to be paid in cash as compensation.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBroadcom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the semiconductor industry are NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

150,AVGO,"SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Feb 26.The company’s bottom-line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missing the same in other two. Consequently, it recorded an average miss of 5.93%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that SBA Communications is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements.Zacks ESP: SBA Communications has an Earnings ESP of +24.82%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 22 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 18 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carriers a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of SBA Communications’ favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat at the company.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are impressed with SBA Communications’ innovative network expansion methodologies which have helped it to substantially add subscribers and compete against market behemoths like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) in the global wireless tower market.Wireless services are advancing rapidly in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. SBA Communications effectively addresses this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is anticipated to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video. SBA Communications is a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the United States and internationally, offering wireless customers in-depth management experience, scale and resources.The company offers wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks. Its services include site identification and acquisition as well as obtaining zoning approvals and permitting networks representing all technologies. SBA Communications also provides a broad range of cell site equipment installation, optimization and integration services. The company’s extensive site development experience includes participation in the development of more than 45,000 communication sites.Buoyed by such tailwinds, SBA Communications’ share price gained 15.9% in the past six months surpassing the industry’s growth of 10.7%.Meanwhile, customer concentration is very high for SBA Communications and the top four among its customers, namely, Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, account for majority of its total quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will lead to a significant material impact on the company’s top line. Moreover, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may cause significant financial fluctuations.SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SBA Communications Corporation QuoteKey PickBroadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) has the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 7.

151,AVGO,"Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) CEO Steve Mollenkopf, CFO George Davis and Chairman Paul Jacobs and other office bearers met Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) representatives in a two-hour meeting. Neither party said anything about what transpired at the meeting but Broadcom representatives reportedly came away with the feeling that they were listened to without comment. Qualcomm representatives said that the board would meet to discuss the next steps.The Broadcom OfferBroadcom’s attempt to acquire Qualcomm to create a wireless powerhouse was thwarted yet again when its revised bid was rejected unanimously by Qualcomm’s board of directors.  In November, Broadcom offered $70 a share, of which $60 was to be paid in cash and the rest in shares. The revised offer, which is Broadcom’s ""best and final offer"", values each share at $82 ($60 a share in cash and the rest in shares).Considering the fact that the deal reduces competition, there’s a good chance that regulators in several countries will oppose it. If the deal is cancelled on account of regulatory opposition, Broadcom will pay $8 billion for the disruption caused.Broadcom expects to obtain necessary approvals to close the deal within a year. If it takes longer, it will pay 6% a year of the amount to be paid in cash as compensation.Since this is an unsolicited, hostile bid to take over control of the company, Broadcom is also looking to replace the entire Qualcomm board with 11 people of its own choosing. Shareholders will cast their votes on Mar 6. Is Qualcomm’s Concern Justified?Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs stated in the open letter to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, “Your proposal ascribes no value to our accretive NXP acquisition, no value for the expected resolution of our current licensing disputes and no value for the significant opportunity in 5G,"" and “Your proposal is inferior relative to our prospects as an independent company and is significantly below both trading and transaction multiples in our sector.” Moreover, the bid contains ""serious deficiencies in value and certainty.""It’s true that the automotive and IoT segments are greatly expanding Qualcomm’s addressable market, being new areas it is expanding into. Moreover, Qualcomm has also taken a lead in 5G technology development and recently announced agreements with 19 carriers and 18 handset OEMs, so it’s clearly getting ready to charge into the market. Any merger-related disruption in this schedule, or if it resulted in the loss of major customers, could come in the way of its capturing the dominant share of the market that it is targeting. So it’s true that if after this disruption, the merger doesn’t go through because of regulatory opposition, the amount proposed to be paid wouldn’t compensate Qualcomm adequately.  Also note that customers won’t be thrilled with the combination because it has the potential to become even more dominant in the wireless market, thereby driving up prices.  Summing UpQualcomm was initially not considering a buyout offer at all but it has now softened its stand because some shareholders have expressed interest in the deal should it prove to be truly attractive. Broadcom for its part, and especially CEO Hock Tan has considerable experience wrapping up acquisitions although the size of this deal makes it a different animal altogether. Whether the hostile bid for the company will be successful is still an open question.Qualcomm shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while Broadcom shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Semiconductor peers worth buying instead are #1 (Strong Buy)-ranked Cabot Microelectronics Corp. (CCMP  -  Free Report), or #2 (Buy)-ranked Diodes Inc. (DIOD  -  Free Report) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report).

153,AVGO,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) and Advanced ICU Care recently expanded their multi-year partnership by signing a new 12-year agreement. The joint venture will leverage Philips’ tele-ICU technology to assist power nine virtual care hubs in monitoring about 1,000 ICU beds across the United States.The latest collaboration is built upon the long-term strategic partnership between the two companies. This will enable both companies to deliver the top level of care to the most critically ill patients, thus enhancing clinical outcomes. In fact, Advanced ICU Care’s Care-as-a-Service model along with Philips’ advanced remote monitoring and health informatics technology will offer a turnkey approach toward the adoption of tele-ICU.Advanced ICU Care has both capabilities and experiences in providing the tele-ICU services across broad range of Electronic Health Record implementations and various hospital systems in a simultaneous way. Also, the tele-ICU programs are supported by intensivists and critical care nurses of the company’s increasing number of virtual care centers. Notably, the company’s intensivist care sustains patients in more than 65 hospitals in the United States supported by a technology stack, including the latest version of Philips eCareManager.Our TakeIn recent times, Philips has broadened its presence in the healthcare markets and expects this segment to be a long-term growth driver. Meanwhile, the company’s focus on improving its enterprise wide solutions for health systems and collaboration with health care organizations is anticipated to enhance its stronghold in the healthcare industry. Going forward, the company believes that the recent product launches might propel mid-to-high single-digit growth in Personal Health solutions. Moreover, the company remains optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends since Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment sales are acting as major profit churners.Further, Philips recently completed the buyout of VitalHealth that would complement Philips Wellcentive’s solutions, including health informatics and patient engagement programs. Also, the company announced deals to acquire Electrical Geodesics, Respiratory Technologies and Australian Pharmacy Sleep Services. We believe that steady traction of these offerings and the latest acquisitions will prove beneficial to the top-line performance.In a year’s time, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 29.9%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 17.4%. However, the company’s near-term profitability is likely to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market on a global scale. Additionally, due to the uncertainties like slowing government spending and events surrounding the ACA (Affordable Care Act) legislation Philips expects the United States to witness low-single digit growth. Furthermore, country-specific risks for China like anti-corruption initiatives, slow GDP growth and centralized tendering are likely to dampen the prospects of the healthcare industry, thwarting its growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are DST Systems, Inc. , Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and CDK Global, Inc. (CDK  -  Free Report). While DST Systems sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Broadcom and CDK Global carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

155,AVGO,"The massive sell-off that started earlier this month due to the fear of faster rate hikes in 2018 seems to have subsided as reflected in the last few trading days. Investors are beginning to gain confidence due to robust U.S. economic fundamentals and yet another impressive earnings season hinting at a brighter future.We are at the tail end of the fourth-quarter 2017 reporting cycle, which has provided an encouraging picture of all-around strength and momentum. We have positive earnings and sales surprises coming from an above-average proportion of companies. Further, positive estimate revisions for the current quarter have been overwhelming, indicating there is more room for growth in future.With the overall scenario so bright, it is of little wonder that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end the reporting cycle with earnings growth, per the latest Zacks Earnings Preview. Of these, one is the widely-diversified Zacks Computer and Technology sector. The bottom line for this sector is projected to increase 22.6% on 10.6% higher revenues.The solid growth projections can be mainly attributed to the rising demand for cloud-based platforms, rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.The sector is poised to witness tremendous growth this earnings season, and there is a high probability that various tech stocks will report better-than-expected results. It commonly happens that an earnings beat boosts investors’ confidence in the stock, which is reflected in its rapid price appreciation.Going ahead, the technology sector is likely to grow further in 2018, as evident from the recent forecast provided by Gartner Inc. (IT) on worldwide IT spending. The latest report from the independent research firm projects global IT spending to reach $3.7 trillion this year, representing an increase of 4.3% from $3.5 trillion projected in 2017.However, in our opinion, the major push will come from the recently-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or the tax bill as it will bring double benefit for tech companies. Firstly, it will boost corporate earnings and secondly, as companies across other sectors might utilize savings from lower tax, as well as cash repatriations for technological upgradation, this will again be conducive for the tech stocks.Therefore, now it is wise to invest in such stocks, in order to catch the post-earnings rally. However, this is easier said than done. Striking the right chord needs a fair amount of luck.Then How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of companies in the tech sector, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat on earnings could be a daunting task. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you. You could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks which have the best chances to surprise with their next earnings announcement.

156,AVGO,"Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16.Last quarter, normalized funds from operations (FFO) of 55 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, the company delivered an average negative surprise of 0.63% in the trailing four quarters.However, FFO increased 10% year over year driven by 2.4% increase in revenues, which totaled $966 million. The figure beat the consensus mark of $958 million.The strong year-over-year performance can primarily be attributed to synergies from Recall Holdings acquisition, transformation initiatives and continued strong performance of its storage rental business. Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain’s strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are key catalysts.The company is investing a lot in setting up data center business. Notably, the acquisition of FORTRUST will add 9 MW of existing capacity and opportunity for further expansion in the future.Combined with the data center facility in North Virginia, the company will have 30 megawatts of capacity by year end, per management. Moreover, Iron Mountain’s announcement to acquire data centers in London and Singapore will help it gain ground in the international markets.Further, the acquisition of OEC Records Management significantly expands the company’s presence in India. The acquisition adds 16 facilities in 10 cities and 3.6 million cubic feet of storage.However, Iron Mountain’s Service revenues remain modest due to falling activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Further, the company’s highly-leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Iron Mountain’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 57 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Iron Mountain carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

167,AVGO,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) declined 6.18% to $61.88 on Feb 5.The decline was led by Qualcomm’s apprehensions of losing share in the chipset market and various license disputes.Let’s take a look at each of the aforementioned factors.Will Qualcomm Lose Chipset Market Dominance?Tech giant Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is reportedly looking for alternative chipset suppliers for its next-generation iPhones. Apple might choose Intel for its comparatively less-expensive modem chips. Notably, a shift to Intel will help Apple save around $105 million. This will help Apple reduce production costs for the next-generation iPhones, which will lower retail price.Additionally, Qualcomm is engaged in an ongoing year-long $1-billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments with Apple. The dispute continues to get bitter with multiple counter moves from the companies. Also, Apple is one of the major buyers of Qualcomm’s chipsets. To this end, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (“QCT”) segment accounts for more than 70% of total revenues. The segment reports operating results for chipset sales and system software for wireless voice and data communications. This segment accounted for 76.65% of total revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Qualcomm will face a major loss if Apple discards its chipsets.Meanwhile, Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), which is planning to acquire Qualcomm, is likely to face the risk of being left out of Apple’s ecosystem. Apple is expected to shift from Broadcom to Qorvo or STMicroelectronics, to opt for high-frequency filtering technology or wireless charging in its 12th-generation handsets.We believe that Apple is moving from 'best available' to 'good enough' to maintain standard iPhone functionality.Product Licensee DisputesQualcomm’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 and fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 GAAP and Non-GAAP results were affected by the dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Qualcomm Technology Licensing (“QTL”) segment generated revenues of $1,299 million, down 28% year over year. EBT margin was 68% compared with 85% in the prior-year quarter. The aforementioned factors have led to the disappointing performance of the QTL segment. The first quarter of fiscal 2018 GAAP results include $6.0 billion charge or $4.03 per share, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Legislation) in the United States and $1.2 billion charge or 76 cents imposed by the European Commission (EC). Qualcomm’s licensees are likely to take such actions until the disputes are resolved.Zacks Rank & Price Performance On Feb 6, Qualcomm has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, Qualcomm has been portraying a disappointing price performance in the past three months. The company’s shares have declined 3.7% against the industry’s rally of 0.3%. When compared with the market at large, the stock compares unfavorably with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 2.3%. Our TakeQualcomm’s diverse product portfolio in the semiconductor business instills optimism. Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturer of wireless chipset based on baseband technology. The company has been striving to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with multiple technological achievements and launches. Qualcomm, Verizon and Ericsson jointly completed the first Massive MIMO (Multiple Input-Multiple Output) trial with a fully-compatible customer device. Qualcomm achieved a 5G data connection with the Snapdragon X50 5G modem chipset on 28GHz mmWave spectrum. Additionally, Qualcomm is teaming with Verizon and Novatel Wireless for 5G NR mmWave technology trial. Notably, Qualcomm Technologies has been at the forefront of driving Gigabit LTE and 5G in the industry.Recently, Qualcomm received regulatory nod from South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission and European Commission for the pending NXP Semiconductors (NXPI  -  Free Report) buyout. China is yet to approve the deal.Despite the ongoing lawsuit, it is unlikely that Qualcomm will be completely out of Apple's ecosystem. This is because the company’s 5G technologies are likely to surpass Intel's, which will put Qualcomm in a competitive position. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

168,AVGO,"The telecom industry had a stellar run on the bourse last week as most of the key stocks traded in the green.On the earnings front, U.S. telecom behemoth AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) reported strong financial numbers in the fourth quarter of 2017 with both the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported 4.1 million total wireless net adds, with 2.7 million in the U.S. (this was driven by connected devices, postpaid phones and prepaid) and 1.3 million in Mexico. In the reported quarter, AT&T lost 147,000 satellite TV customers and 60,000 U-verse TV customers. However, it gained 368,000 DIRECTV NOW connections.In a separate development, AT&T is reportedly terminating ownership of multiple millimeter wave spectrum (mmWave) licenses gained from the acquisition of FiberTower. Per a settlement, AT&T’s FiberTower has agreed to return all of its 24 GHz spectrum licenses (total 121) and a portion of its 39GHz licenses to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission).AT&T will have access to 479 of FiberTower’s 39 GHz spectrum licenses, estimated around 360 MHz of spectrum in total. Additionally, the company will have to pay $27 million to the U.S. Treasury to settle the FiberTower dispute.Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), the largest mobile chipset manufacturer worldwide, reported impressive financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 24, 2017), with both the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. During the quarter, the company shipped approximately 237 million CDMA-based MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets, up 9% year over year.Moreover, Qualcomm signed a memorandum of understanding with four leading Chinese handset developers for a multi-year sale of RF Front-End solutions. The value of the deal is more than $2 billion. However, the company also received a bad news. The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, has slapped a fine of €997 million (approximately $1.24 billion) on Qualcomm over anticompetitive practices related to mobile chipset sale.The EC claims that an iPhone/iPad modem exclusivity deal between Qualcomm and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which lasted from 2011 till the end of 2016, amounted to anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm abused its dominant market position for 4G LTE chipset and payed significantly to Apple to secure modem exclusivity.Only a week ago, in a major relief to Qualcomm, the EC gave its nod to the company for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. Meanwhile, the company is facing a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) of a massive $130 billion.Canadian telecom giant Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI  -  Free Report), reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line missing the same. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company added 72,000 postpaid wireless subscribers.Quarterly postpaid ARPA (average revenue per account) was around $99.59 compared with $94.36 in the year-ago quarter. The monthly churn rate was 1.48% compared with 1.35% in the prior-year quarter. Rogers Communications carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Read the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Jan 25, 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories  1.    On a GAAP basis, AT&T reported net income of $19,037 million or $3.08 cents per share compared with $2,437 million or 39 cents from the year-ago quarter.

The largest mobile chipset maker is also facing $1 billion lawsuit from Apple in the United States related to royalty and rebate payments. (Read more: Qualcomm Fined by EC, Signs MoU With 4 Handset Developers ) 5.    Millimeter wave spectrum is likely to play a major role in the deployment of 5G infrastructure. In the last few years, they have gained popularity due to the industry’s inclination toward 5G network technology. Notably, they can transmit more data at higher speeds with lower response times. Consequently, wireless carriers like AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and other market incumbents are planning to centralize their 5G-related operations in millimeter wave bands. The recent loss of millimeter wave spectrum licenses raises several questions on AT&T’s plans of offering standards-based mobile 5G services in various U.S. markets by late 2018.

170,AVGO,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017) results, after the closing bell on Jan 31.The company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters. Earnings met the consensus estimate in the remaining two, resulting in an average beat of 6.31%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayQualcomm operates in a highly competitive global mobile semiconductor market with incumbents like Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report). Stiff competition in the wireless baseband chipset market has forced the largest mobile chipset manufacturer in diversifying into the lucrative IoT market.In August 2017, Qualcomm announced the acquisition of Scyfer B.V., a company affiliated with the University of Amsterdam and which focuses on cutting-edge machine learning techniques. It specializes in building Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions for companies worldwide and in a number of different industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare and finance. The acquisition of Scyfer will aid Qualcomm to advance its AI research and development.In July 2017, the company made available the Qualcomm Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine software development kit for developers from multiple industries—mobile, automotive, healthcare, security and imaging—to acquire tools for delivering on-device neural network-driven user experiences. With such booming prospects and strategic ideas, Qualcomm visualizes a world where AI would make devices, machines, automobiles and make things more intelligent, simplifying and enriching people’s daily lives.2017 has been a mixed year for Qualcomm. The company has been trying to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with, multiple technological achievements and launches. Management has taken significant steps to reduce cost by $1 billion per annum.Buoyed by such tailwinds, Qualcomm’s shares have gained 26.42%, outpacing the industry’s growth of 16.05% over the past three months.  On the other hand, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market may hurt Qualcomm’s profits in the future. The company is facing severe competitive threat from its closest rival, Intel, which has been redesigning its chipsets for the mobile computing market. Intel started delivering multi-mode LTE baseband modem. Competition is also likely to emanate from formidable rivals like Broadcom and Nvidia.Broadcom already introduced its LTE baseband chipset in the market, while Nvidia launched Tegra 4i, its LTE-integrated application processor. Also, opposition from low-cost chip suppliers like Mediatek of Taiwan, VIA Technologies of China and Spreadtrum Communications is a concern. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next 4–5 years, major part of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may exert pressure on Qualcomm’s margins.The $1-billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments, filed by tech giant Apple Inc. (in January 2017) against Qualcomm with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, is getting uglier day by day. Since January 2017, there had been a number of counter attacks from either side. Initially, Apple had accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.Meanwhile, Apple has garnered the support of Silicon Valley biggies and its suppliers in its nasty legal spat with Qualcomm. Apple’s suppliers have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, accusing Qualcomm of “violating” the U.S Antitrust Law. They have claimed that Qualcomm continues to extract additional licensing money over assembling of iPhones. With so many twists and turns, we remain eager to see how this dispute actually pans out in the coming days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Qualcomm is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Qualcomm has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 90 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company has not witnessed any estimate revisions.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated Quote Key PickAnalog Devices has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat. It is expected to report first quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Feb 21. Analog Devices has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and a Zacks Rank #2.

171,AVGO,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently signed a memorandum of understanding with four leading Chinese handset developers, namely, Lenovo Mobile Communication Technology, Ltd., Guangdong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp., Ltd., vivo Communication Technology Co., Ltd. and Xiaomi Communications Co., Ltd., for a multi-year sale of RF Front-End solutions. The value of the deal is more than $2 billion. Notably, China is the most important market for Qualcomm after the United States.However, the company also received a bad news. The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, has slapped a fine of €997 million (approximately $1.24 billion) on Qualcomm over anticompetitive practices related to mobile chipset sale. The EC claims that an iPhone/iPad modem exclusivity deal between Qualcomm and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which lasted from 2011 to the end of 2016, amounted to anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm abused its dominant market position for 4G LTE chipset and payed significantly to Apple to secure modem exclusivity.Another Major Recent DevelopmentOnly a week ago, in a major relief to Qualcomm, the EC gave its nod to the company for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. At the same time, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission also gave its nod for the deal. Notably, the deal has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities. Only China is left to give its approval, which Qualcomm believes it will get very soon.The major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market for smartphones and tablets. NXP, on the other hand, manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Likely Effect on Broadcom’s Hostile BidOn Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom submitted a bid to acquire Qualcomm for a consideration of $130 billion (including $25 billion in net debt). On Nov 13, Qualcomm’s board of directors turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy, as it is currently the largest mobile chipset maker globally. Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.4 billion against which Broadcom’s paltry $105 billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Broadcom has since proposed replacing Qualcomm's board of directors and the matter will be put to a shareholder vote in March 2018. With NXP almost in its kitty, the enlarged Qualcomm could make it more difficult for Broadcom to take over the company.Moreover, the EC’s decision to fine Qualcomm $1.24 billion on charges that it offered discounts in exchange for chip purchase commitments will also raise questions on its business practices. The EC's ruling comes 13 months after South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $853 million for alleged antitrust violations. The largest mobile chipset maker is also facing $1 billion lawsuit from Apple in the United States related to royalty and rebate payments.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

172,AVGO,"On Jan 22, we issued an updated research report on Neenah, WI.-based Plexus Corp. (PLXS  -  Free Report), a leading provider of electronic contract manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).Plexus recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Revenues improved on a year-over-year basis but earnings declined. Both the top and the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.38%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plexus has moved downward in the past seven days. Earnings estimates for the second quarter decreased 10.8% to 74 cents. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved down 4.7% to $3.25 over the same time frame.Notably, its shares have gained 13% in the past year, slightly underperforming the industry's 14.8% rally. Key FactorsPlexus is gaining from a significant number of program wins. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Plexus won 44 new manufacturing programs worth approximately $200 million. It added over $794 million in revenues in the trailing four quarters from new wins.The healthcare segment was driven by two large customer wins in the last quarter. Strength in semiconductor capital equipment space is also boosting the industrial segment. We believe new program wins, together with global expansion, will drive growth over the long term.Plexus Corp. Revenue (TTM) Plexus Corp. Revenue (TTM) | Plexus Corp. QuoteHowever, Plexus’s dependence on a few large customers for a major part of its revenues exposes the company to customer concentration risks. The company’s recent loss of one of its key networking customers impacted results of its Communication segment.Weakness in the communication segment is a big concern, given that approximately 19% of its revenues in fiscal 2017 came from this sector. Besides, softness in the security business is adversely impacting the Aerospace/Defense sector.Given the competitive nature of the industry, the loss of any one of its key customers, or individual projects with these customers, would severely impact results, going forward.Increasing investment for new programs remains a drag on profitability. Operating margin is expected to remain under pressure in the near term.Zacks RankPlexus has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), The Trade Desk (TTD  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) are some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector.

174,AVGO,"Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report) recently announced that its executive vice president and chief financial officer, Mark Garrett will step down this year.Adobe also announced the retirement of its executive vice president and general counsel, Mike Dillon, which will happen this year.However, both of them will stay with the company until their suitable successors are appointed.Garrett, 60, joined Adobe in 2007 and has played an instrumental role in the transformation of the cloud-based software provider to a subscription-focused business. During his term at the company, recurring revenues have grown to more than 85% from 5% in a span of 10 years.Guidance UpdatedAdobe also updated its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2018.The company said that owing to the latest changes in United States tax laws related to repatriation of foreign earnings, re-measurement of deferred tax assets and revision in the tax rate to 17% compared with its previous target of about 9%, it will incur a one-time charge of roughly $85 million in the first quarter.Adobe now expects to earn $1.05 a share, or $1.43 on an adjusted basis, in the first quarter compared to the previously estimated profit of $1.15 a share or $1.27 on an adjusted basis.However, these changes are going to benefit Adobe over the long haul. These will significantly boost fiscal 2018 earnings due to lower corporate tax rate.Adobe now expects to earn $4.72 a share, or $6.20 a share on an adjusted basis, up from the previously forecast $4.40 a share or $5.50 on an adjusted basis for fiscal 2018. Revenues are expected to be around $8.73 billion.Shares of Adobe rose 1.08% on Monday following the news. The stock has gained 76.4% in the past 12 months, substantially outperforming the 39.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Benefits of the Tax ActAccess to offshore cash reserves will present tremendous investment opportunities to the company to expand its business, according to CFO Garrett. As of Dec 1, roughly 89% of the cash held by the company or $5.82 billion was parked offshore.Adobe is expanding its campuses in the Bay Area and Utah to accommodate its growing employee base.

In addition, the Astro buyout is expected to enable the company to leverage the console gaming market and help accelerate the long-term growth of business.However, the rising trend of smaller, mobile computing devices with touch interfaces and the declining popularity of desktop PCs have rapidly changed the market and usage models for PC peripherals and webcams.

176,AVGO,"The Q4 earnings season is off to a stellar start and is likely to pick up pace with more releases flowing in. This has helped most of the leading benchmark indices to trade near record highs. The stock market euphoria is likely to extend further on tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data, boosting corporate earnings, stoking investments and trickling down to employees in some instances.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm. It offers a wide range of services to tenants, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multi-family and other types of commercial real estates in all major metropolitan areas across the globe.

179,AVGO,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is reportedly bringing HomePod, a smart speaker integrated with Siri and aimed at the home automation market, in February.It has been a while since the product was unveiled at the Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June 2017.Taiwan-based Inventec, one of the two component suppliers of the smart speaker, made the announcement.  Foxconn Technology Group is the other supplier.Apple’s Entry into the Smart Speaker MarketApple’s launch of HomePad will help it take on other smart speakers like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo and Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Home launched more than three years and one year ago, respectively. HomePod has functions similar to Echo and Home.Interestingly, it is also integrated with Apple Music. We believe Apple’s foray into the smart speaker market will help it gain more subscriptions for Apple Music, which has seen phenomenal growth with more than 30 million subscribers.Additionally, HomePod will also support Siri, which has fallen behind in the race owing to Apple’s aversion to opening itself to third-party developers, according to analysts. With HomePod, Siri will be able to “serve as a home hub for controlling smart products, playing music, and more.”Moreover, Apple is working on the music quality and expects this to be the differentiator compared with other home speakers available in the market. In fact, a few months back it was reported that Apple was working on integrating the next generation of HomePod with face ID technology.According to ReportsnReports.com, the smart speaker market will witness a CAGR of 34.44% over a period from 2018 to 2023 to reach $11.79 billion by 2023.According to a September report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Amazon dominates the market with 15 million units sold, followed by Google Home with 5 million units sold.However, HomePod suppliers believe its sales to surpass 10 million soon after initial release. Moreover, they expect Apple to become a leader in the smart speaker market if 20% of the world’s 100 million iPhone users purchase it.Shares of Apple have gained 48.6% in the past year, slightly outperforming the industry’s 48.5% rally.Is Pricing a Concern?As with all Apple products, price point remains a concern. HomePod carries a price tag of $349, heftier than Echo and Google Home, which are priced at $179 and $129, respectively. Analysts observe that Apple is already late to the party and such a hefty price tag might prove to be an impediment.Nonetheless, we note that Apple’s brand is something that gives it an edge over its competitors.Apple commands a strong user base with exceptional brand loyalty. It is widely perceived that Apple users refuse to switch to any other platform that isn’t running on iOS.Apple’s Services segment, which includes revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, is in top gear. With the launch of HomePod, we expect it to spell big opportunity for the company.Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc.

180,AVGO,"Profitability analysis is considered one of the most effective tools to determine a company’s ability to provide bullish returns, after meeting all business-related costs. This analysis helps differentiate a profitable company from a loss-making one.The best accounting tool to understand a company’s profitability position is ratio analysis. Generally, there are four key profitability ratios — gross income ratio, operating income ratio, pre-tax profit margin and net income ratio. Here, we have used the most effective and frequently used profitability ratio — net income ratio.Net Income RatioNet income ratio gives us the exact profit level of a company. It reflects the percentage of net income to total sales revenues. Using net income ratio, one can determine a company’s capability to bear all its operating and non-operating expenses from its sales revenues. A higher net income ratio usually implies a company’s ability to generate ample sales revenues and successfully manage all business functions.Screening ParametersNet income ratio is not the only indicator of future winners. So, we have added a few more criteria to arrive at a winning strategy.Zacks Rank equal to #1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks are allowed.

181,AVGO,"In a major relief to Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, gave its nod for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. At the same time, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission has also given its nod for the deal. Notably, the deal has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities. Only China is left to give its approval, which Qualcomm believes it will get very soon.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP.In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The regulator had conducted an in-depth probe to see if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.Concessions Offered by QualcommQualcomm agreed to grant rivals licenses to NXP's transport fare collection technology for eight years. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) and secure element patents except for defensive purposes as well as for its own baseband chipset. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable smartphones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.Qualcomm has told the EC that it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents as well as some nonessential patents for near-field communications services, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer. These third-party buyers would be obliged for three years to grant others royalty-free licenses to use those patents. Qualcomm will acquire a few of NXP's other nonstandard essential NFC patents though it would also be obliged to grant royalty-free licenses to others for use of those patents.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. In fact, the company’s business has remained stagnant for the last couple of years.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Likely Effect on Broadcom’s Hostile BidOn Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom submitted a bid to acquire Qualcomm for a consideration of $130 billion (including $25 billion in net debt). On Nov 13, Qualcomm’s board of directors turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently the largest mobile chipset maker globally. Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.4 billion against which Broadcom’s paltry $105 billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Broadcom has since proposed replacing Qualcomm's board of directors and the matter will be put to a shareholder vote in March 2018. With NXP almost in its kitty, the enlarged Qualcomm could make it more difficult for Broadcom to take over the company.NXP is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners.The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Also, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have gained 31.9%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.6% over the past 90 days.

182,AVGO,"As the fourth-quarter earnings season is warming up, the focus is back on the major S&P 500 sectors. Earnings growth is expected to be strong for the technology sector, with total earnings expected to be up 14.1% on the back of an 8.6% increase in revenues. (Read More)Strong earnings outlook from the tech sector puts the spotlight on one of its best-performing sub-sectors, semiconductors. The semiconductor sector has performed favorably over the last one year, with iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) rising 6.2%. The leading sector gainers for the period are Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Micron (MU  -  Free Report), which have increased 49.5% and 98.3% in the past year, respectively.   Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) and Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report earnings on Jan 23 and Jan 25, respectively. In this context, comparing these two stocks from the broader industry would be pertinent. Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Texas Instruments carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceThe broader industry has performed strongly over a year, increasing 52.3% versus the S&P 500’s 23.6% gains. Texas Instruments has outperformed both the broader industry and the S&P 500, increasing 55.7% over the same period. In contrast, Intel has posted an increase of only 20.4%. EBITDA MarginThe most appropriate profitability ratio to evaluate these two semiconductor giants is EBITDA margin. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is ideal to compare two companies from the same industry but with different capital structures. Thus, EBITDA margin shows what percentage EBITDA makes up of total revenues. It provides investors with a good idea about both the cash flow and the operating profitability of a company. For the last year, the broader industry has an EBITDA margin of 42.2%. Coming to the individual EBITDA margin ratios, Intel’s reading of 41.43% is lower than that of Texas Instruments’ 46.47%. Clearly, Texas Instruments stands out in terms of profitability.Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term liabilities. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and compares it to that of the current level of liabilities. In the last 12 months, Intel has a current ratio of 1.6, which is lower than the industry average of 1.7 as well as Texas Instrument’s reading of 3.99. It is evident that Texas Instruments is more solvent than Intel. ValuationThe most appropriate valuation metric for a capital-intensive industry like semiconductor is the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio. This ratio successfully captures the fluctuation in earnings experienced by the sector. First, it is important to consider where the industry as a whole stands from a valuation perspective. Here, we can see that with a Price-to-Book ratio of 4.56, the broader industry is marginally overvalued compared with the S&P 500, which has a value of 3.95. Coming to the two chipmakers, Texas Instruments is overvalued relative to the broader industry, while Intel is less pricey than the same. Texas Instruments has a P/B ratio of 10.44, while Intel possesses a P/B ratio of only 2.94. On the valuation count, Intel holds a strong edge over its smaller rival Texas Instruments.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Texas Instruments and Intel have delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters. However, Intel stands out with an average earnings surprise of 9.8%, which is higher than Texas Instrument’s level of 9.2%.When considering Earnings ESP, Texas Instruments is better placed with a value of 1.06% while Intel has an ESP value of -0.9%. At the same time, Texas Instruments’ earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 1% over the last 30 days, while that for Intel has remained unchanged. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Intelholds an edge over Texas Instruments when considering dividend yield and valuations. However, when considering price performance, current ratio and EBITDA margin, Texas Instruments is clearly a better stock.Moreover, although Texas Instruments’ earnings performance is marginally lower than that of Intel, it has a strong ESP and witnessed better earnings estimate revisions. What clinches the case for Texas Instruments is the fact that it holds a higher Zacks Rank and better ESP value than Intel.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Recently, the company announced that it’ll begin pushing Amazon Music service to Australia and New Zealand from Feb 1. The new subscribers will get a 90-day free trial and it will be available on all widely used platforms. The service will be later charged $5 a month.Also, Amazon announced that it has started accepting pre-orders in Australia for Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Plus devices for $149 AUD, $220 AUD and $79 AUD, respectively. To attract customers, the company has also discounted all three devices by $30 AUD for a limited period.

Let's Discover New MarketsApparently, Amazon has been putting in a lot of effort to search for new markets for its Alexa powered devices and its services like Music and Prime. The rate at which the company is penetrating new markets makes us optimistic. In December, the company had announced that it’s expanding in 28 new countries.This growing presence will help Amazon maintain its dominance in the smart speakers market. It already holds almost 70% share in the market, per eMarketer.Our TakeAmazon Alexa powered Echo devices have been one its best performing products so far, evident from their performance in the holiday season. Per the company’s statement, Echo Dot was the top-selling product on Amazon.com during the holiday season. Also, Per TechCrunch, which quoted Voicebot, it is estimated that Amazon sold more than 20 million Alexa devices and 1 million non-Echo smart speakers with Alexa built-in through the third quarter of 2017.These devices support Amazon’s bottom line even after sale by complementing Amazon’s other services. Per Cowen & Co. consumer tracking survey, 84% of the Echo users in the United States use it for listening to music.  Expanding in new countries will help in increasing its Music Unlimited user base. Consequently, its recurring revenue base will improve.Moreover, we believe that the expansion will not only help Amazon to sell products in these countries  but also help it to get a lot of user data that it can utilize to provide more customer-oriented services in these countries.

190,AVGO,"Nutanix Inc. (NTNX  -  Free Report) is looking to offer $400 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes in a private placement. The notes are slated to mature in 2023. The notes will be offered to institutional buyers qualifying under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The offering is subject to certain market conditions.Notably, the company is looking to grant preliminary buyers the privilege of buying another $60 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes within a period of 13 days (from and including) of the date of first issuance of the notes.These notes, once placed, will be an unsecured senior liability of Nutanix, interest for which will be paid in arrears semi-annually.

191,AVGO,"The fourth quarter of 2017 earnings has just begun with few companies reporting their results. Moreover, earnings releases are scattered in this quarter. However, the earnings calendar is not the same for all companies.One such stock is Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report), which is expected to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 31, 2018, after the market closes.2017 has been a mixed year for the leading wireless chipset manufacturer. Qualcomm has been trying to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with multiple technological achievements and launches. On the flip side, the company has been involved in various legal brawls related to unfair business practices or licensing royalty payments.2018 seems to be a booming year for Qualcomm as the stock is soaring high. Shares of Qualcomm rose 4.48% to $68.25 on Jan 16.The stock soared on the back of the following crucial factors —lofty revenues, profit outlook for 2019, an alternative share buyback plan if bid to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) fails, cost reduction plans and expected earnings/savings by resolving current licensing disputes.Notably, Qualcomm is striving to win back shareholders’ support on the back of the aforementioned strategies, to reject the hostile takeover bid from Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report).Let’s have a closer view on each of the aforementioned factorsHiked Guidance for 2019Qualcomm unveiled a better-than expected outlook for revenues and profit margins for 2019. Adjusted profit per share is estimated in the range of $6.75-$7.50. Revenues are forecast in the rangeof $35-$37 billion. Per a Thomson Reuters report, the numbers have topped analyst’s estimates of a profit of $3.79 on revenues of $23.59 billion.The company plans to achieve the profit target through its new $1-billion cost reduction plan, gains from the NXP Semiconductors deal and by resolving current licensing disputes, especially with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Excluding royalty revenues and certain product revenues from Apple and other licensing disputes, Qualcomm expects to earn $5.25 in 2019.NXP Buyout or Share Buyback: What’s Ahead?Announced in October 2016, Qualcomm is closer to the proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors N.V. The combined entity is likely to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it will reinstate the merged entity as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Per the deal, Qualcomm will pay $110 per NXP Semiconductor share in cash, which includes an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion). So far, the deal has already received approval from the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission and the retail shareholders of NXP Semiconductors.However, the deal is under a thorough investigation by the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC). To get through EC, Qualcomm has revised its proposed deal to takeover NXP Semiconductors. Also, the company extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP Semiconductors.Moreover, the deal is currently facing strong opposition from the institutional shareholders of NXP semiconductors. To this end, Qualcomm has chalked huge share buyback plans to enhance shareholders' wealth, as an alternative option if the pending deal does not go through. Let’s wait and see what is ahead for the year-long pending deal.Cost-Cutting PlansQualcomm claims to have saved around $1.4 billion through its previous cost-cutting plan announced in July 2015. Moreover, the company is planning to organize a new $1-billion cost reduction plan. The company aims to reduce expenses in four main areas, including selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). The company is also hopeful about some of its 5G technology investments which will strategically lower spending in research and development.Zacks Rank & Price Performance Qualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Qualcomm has been portraying an impressive price performance in the past six months. Shares of Qualcomm returned 21.3% outpacing the industry’s rally of 10.5%. When compared with the market at large, the stock looks good compared with S&P500 index’s gain of 12.8%.Our ConcernsQualcomm’s improved guidance and cost cutting plans for 2019 look impressive. The targets are highly dependent on the deployment and launch of the next-generation 5G networks. Moreover, Qualcomm’s updated Snapdragon processors and applications have helped the company retain leadership in the global wireless baseband chipset market. The company has been working hard to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity.5G wireless network along with fully compatible devices is expected to be launched by 2020. It is yet to be seen whether the company succeeds in achieving its hefty targets.Meanwhile, there is no possibility of a near-term settlement between Qualcomm and Apple, since no such initiatives are being undertaken by the companies. However, Qualcomm is expected to seek a quick settlement as the dispute with Apple and other licensee disputes have affected the company’s third and fourth quarters and fiscal 2017 GAAP and Non-GAAP results.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

193,AVGO,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s (BABA  -  Free Report) Taobao was recently put on United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) annual list of world’s most “notorious markets”, for the second consecutive year, along with 24 other online markets and 18 physical markets.Alleged sale of counterfeit products on the online shopping platform and the challenges faced by the right(s) holders in removing and stopping sale of such illegal products are the reasons  behind Taobao  being blacklisted.USTR said in its report, “A high volume of infringing products reportedly continue to be offered for sale and sold on Taobao.com and stakeholders continue to report challenges and burdens associated with IP enforcement on the platform.”Also, the agency recommended ways through which Alibaba Group can improve its position by stating, “Simplifying processes for right holders to register and request enforcement action; making good faith takedown procedures generally available; and reducing Taobao’s timelines for takedowns and issuing penalties for counterfeit sellers.”Moreover, it stressed on the fact that Alibaba’s efforts to protect brands and IP appeared to be more biased toward global brands, neglecting small and medium businesses.To defend the company, Alibaba’s President Mike Evans spoke up in a blog post, “In light of all this, it’s clear that no matter how much action we take and progress we make, the USTR is not actually interested in seeing tangible results. Therefore, our inclusion on its list is not an accurate representation of Alibaba’s results in protecting brands and IP, and we have no other choice but to conclude that this is a deeply flawed, biased and politicized process.”Notably, shares of Alibaba have gained 95.3% in the past 12 months, substantially outperforming its industry’s 61.9% surge.Our TakeAlibaba dominates the Chinese e-commerce market with a share of 80%. For some time, the company has been taking steps to strengthen its position outside China, especially in the United States. In pursuance of this strategy, Alibaba made its first foray into the U.S. retail market in June this year with the launch of a low-profile website with an American name — 11Main.com — a platform for smaller sellers to hawk their wares.The company has also dealt with lot of copyright and intellectual property infringement issues in the recent past and has closed 240,000 online stores on Taobao on suspicion of infringement last year. Moreover, the company said that it witnessed a sharp decline in the number of complaints after this move. In its annual report on intellectual property protection in 2017, the company claimed that transactions involving suspicion of fake goods went down to 1.49 out of every 10,000 transactions.The recent report may have a negative impact on the company’s reputation and its international expansion strategy, as it is making all efforts to strengthen its position in the United States. Also, the decision of blacklisting it will make it more difficult for the company to win the trust of U.S. and global brands.The e-commerce market in the United States is expected to grow at a double-digit rate over the next few years and if the company wishes to tap this growth, it’ll have to take some steps to improve its position.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlibaba has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) are some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

194,AVGO,"Recently, Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) announced that it is set to exclusively premiere July Hygreck’s debut film, Blockbuster on the platform.The romantic comedy, starring Charlotte Gabris and Syrus Shahidi in the leading role, will be available on the streaming platform from Jan 24.Per the blog post, “If you like laughters, if like a good cry, if you like life, if you like Paris, if you like romantic comedies, if you like big blockbusters, if you like small blockbusters: you are going to like our Blockbuster.”Bringing the French original movie to the platform marks the company’s focus on international markets, which has been the key growth driver for it.Notably, shares of Netflix have gained 65.5% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 18.7% rally.Growing International FootprintNetflix’s efforts to rapidly expand internationally and into original regional content have paid off.Reportedly, 4.45 million new subscribers were added overseas in the last reported quarter. International Streaming revenues (44.5% of total revenue) soared 55.6% year over year to $1.327 billion driven by an increase in paid members in the third quarter. The company expects to add another 5.05 million international subscribers in the fourth quarter.Netflix’s investment in producing films is also beneficial for the company. The company’s portfolio of original films improved with the addition of Death Note, Naked and To the Bone to its platform in the third quarter.Per Nielsen data, which was quoted by Bloomberg, Bright released in December, starring Will Smith and Joel Edgerton, was made with a budget of $90 million. It went on to attract 11 million views in the first three days of its release.The company also stated that Bright had more international viewers than domestic ones. This bodes well for Netflix since it is looking to expand its international presence as the domestic market approaches saturation.Netflix, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Netflix, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Netflix, Inc. QuoteMoreover, an original German series named Dark and the second season of The Crown series – based on the life of Queen Elizabeth II – launched by the company in the fourth quarter of 2017 are gaining popularity worldwide.Besides, the company’s upcoming eight-episode musical series named The Eddy shot in Paris and with dialogues in French and Arabic apart from English will help it attract more international subscribers. Not only will this boost its top line but also help it to sustain share price momentum, in our view.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNetflix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NetApp Inc.

200,AVGO,"Shares of Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) soared recently following a bullish research note from Morgan Stanley, which has given a boost to investors’ confidence. Shares of Expedia raced to a high of $131.23 following Morgan Stanley’s favorable report and ultimately closed at $129.41 on Jan 11, gaining 1.8% during the day.In its report, Morgan Stanley upgraded shares of Expedia to overweight from an equal one, based on the company’s decisive efforts to expand in the overseas markets by acquiring properties beyond the largest hotels to serve its customers better. Analyst Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley expects the shares to return almost 23% in the upcoming 12 months and reach a target of $160.Nowak said in a report that the firm is ""planting seeds for faster growth"" by buying up properties in the international markets. He also added, “We are bullish about Expedia's recent strategic investments to increase its global property supply. We are particularly positive on Expedia's more refined hotel supply strategy, given we believe Expedia's non-vacation rental supply count is still roughly 50 percent of Priceline's ... and increased selection should lead to higher conversion and an increased ability to bid on Google keywords to drive traffic and user growth.""Nowak also seemed optimistic about Expedia’s HomeAway platform. According to him, the company is progressing well by integrating 95,000 listings of HomeAway, thus making the total count on Expedia platform 500,000.  This in turn also improves the supply of instantly bookable properties. Moreover, Nowak expects HomeAway to generate 27 percent room night growth in 2018.Also, management sees great potential in HomeAway business, which is why Expedia is making continuous investments in it. Hotel acquisition ramped up in 2017 with the company having announced to add 80,000 properties last year. Going forward, the company expects to do a step change as well. These positives will ultimately help drive the company’s capacity to grow revenues.Apparently, Nowak sees 2018 as an investment year and expects Expedia’s strategic investments to pay off in 2019.The stock has gained 9.6% in the past 12 months, underperforming the 22.2% rally of the S&P 500 index.Our TakeExpedia is well-positioned in the online travel and alternative accommodation space. The company has been snapping up companies to increase its penetration in the existing markets while expand in others and also eliminate competition. We believe, HomeAway has significant growth prospects as it is relatively disorganized but competition is also intense, given the success of Airbnb and Priceline. Moreover, the growing number of travelers around the world and the company’s efforts to capitalize on this density by adding inventory, collaborating with local players and stepping up its own marketing efforts, makes us optimistic about the company’s future.Zacks Rank & Key PicksExpedia has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

201,AVGO,"Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently entered into an agreement to purchase Mackevision, an Emmy award winning company for visual effect related work on the famous television series, Game of Thrones. Gimv is one of the notable selling shareholders. However, the deal is subject to customary closing conditions and its terms have been kept under wraps.Though the acquisition looks slightly out of place for Accenture, but the firm is aiming at improving the capabilities of Accenture Interactive platform, part of the company's digital marketing-services arm. Its foothold in the interactive content space will be bolstered with the buy-out of this producer of computer generated imagery (CGI) content based on its animation and 3D visualization abilities.The combination of the two companies will enhance Accenture’s abilities to address the requirements of the next-generation customer experiences, innovative content generation and extended reality applications, thereby boosting Accenture’s top line.Accenture stock has gained 37.4% over a year, outperforming the 32.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. Per the press release, “Mackevision’s creation, visualization and production services are used for online product configurators, digital and print catalogues, virtual showrooms, point-of-sale kiosks, augmented and virtual reality experiences, as well as broadcast video and feature films. Mackevision has developed a differentiated ability to leverage engineering data to construct ‘digital twins’ of complex physical products.”Mackevision is capable of producing all types of visual content from the “digital twins” courtesy of the latest technologies in CGI, augmented reality and virtual reality, which improves consumer experience and product designing.Accenture is striving toward delivering a wider portfolio of services related to smart and connected products or platforms based on the capabilities of creating a digital imagery. Thus, the acquisition of Mackevision seems apt.Additionally, with a strong clientele having the likes of Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Hyundai, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, the addition of Mackevision holds promise for Accenture and its revenue growth.Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM)  Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) | Accenture PLC Quote To ConcludeAccenture which recently launched the Accenture Extended Reality (XR) practice is expected to benefit from the acquisition as it expands its presence in the industry.  Per the industry analyst firm IDC, the XR industry is expected to reach $162 billion by 2020, and Accenture is on the right track to tap the opportunities with these initiatives.Accenture has been boosting its digital marketing space in an inorganic way for a long time. Over the last five years, Accenture has acquired more than 17 businesses and integrated into this segment. Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we anticipate Accenture’s investment in digital marketing capabilities to be conducive to long-term growth.Notably, these acquisitions have also helped the company gain a competitive edge over other digital marketing service providers, such as International Business Machines Corp., Dell and Deloitte.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAccenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the sector are NetApp, Inc.

203,AVGO,"The primary purpose of a business is to generate profits that can be reinvested in the expansion or utilization of rewarding shareholders. Net profit margin is an effective tool for the measurement of profits generated by a business.Net Profit Margin = Net profit /Sales * 100.In simple terms, net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs, interest, depreciation, taxes and other expenses. In fact, net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost-control measures.Also, higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders. Net margin helps investors judge the risk involved in an investment. Creditors also view it as crucial to determining a company’s ability to pay off debts.Moreover, a higher net profit margin compared to its peers lends the company a competitive edge.Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.However, net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls. The metric varies widely from industry to industry. While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries, it is not that important for technology companies.Moreover, the difference in accounting treatment of various items — especially non-cash expenses like depreciation and stock-based compensation — makes comparison a daunting task.Further, for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding, higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit. In such cases, the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company’s performance.The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought-after elements in a business model.Apart from these, we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy.Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months – Most Recent (%) greater than equal to 0: High net profit margin indicates solid profitability.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/(F-1) greater than equal to 0: It indicates earnings growth.Average Broker Rating (1-5) equal to 1: A rating of #1 indicates brokers’ extreme bullishness on the stock.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than peers in all types of market environment.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screen:Singapore-based Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) designs, develops and supplies a range of complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products worldwide.

204,AVGO,"Seagate Technology Plc’s (STX  -  Free Report) shares have added about 4.1% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the last year, its shares have gained 41.4%, while the industry recorded growth of 31.7%.Will the recent positive trend continue driving the stock over the long haul or is it due for a pullback? Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the fundamentals and trends in order to get a better hold on the important drivers.Growth DriversSeagate recently announced preliminary results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The storage solutions provider expects higher revenues and margins in the quarter due to greater demand for its HDD products and operational efficiencies.It now expects revenues to be approximately $2.9 billion compared with an increase of 3-5% guided previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues is pegged at $2.74 billion. The improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in exabyte demand.The company expects exabyte shipments to be roughly 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 30%. Further, operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis are projected to be in the range of $390-$444 million. Previously, the company expected non-GAAP operating expenses to decrease 2-3% with cost cutting initiatives.According to Dave Mosley, Chief Executive Officer of Seagate, “Our revenue growth and strong portfolio profitability in the December quarter reflect solid demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions, particularly for our cloud-based environments.”Another factor that bolstered share price was Seagate’s agreement with Toshiba, per which the latter will provide Seagate with NAND supply, consequently helping in innovation of hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD) and hybrid solutions. This will improve competitive position in the flash memory market.Seagate is also gaining from the increasing adoption of its Nearline HDDs. We believe that Nearline’s rapid adoption will boost Seagate’s competitive position against Western Digital.Further, the company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology are a catalyst.Notably, with the huge transformations in the storage industry mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has provided a boost to the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is beneficial for Seagate.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Seagate's current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.27 per share, up from earnings of $1.15 per share earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is currently pegged at $4.28 per share compared with $4.06 projected seven days ago.Style Scores Look GreatMicron currently sports an A grade for Value, Growth and Momentum, lifting its overall VGM score to A.ValuationOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 11.0x, significantly lower than the industry average of 16.4x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, lower the P/E of a stock, the better for investors.OutlookNotably, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 2.5%. Additionally, the stock has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 18.9%.To ConcludeIn our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

205,AVGO,"Shares of Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report) touched a 52-week high of $187.27, eventually closing a bit lower at $187.11 on Jan 10.The stock has gained 71.7% in last year, substantially outperforming the 36.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s strong fundamentals and solid quarterly results.Compelling Product LinesAcrobat is one of the company’s most successful product lines with a huge installed base of satisfied customers. A portion of the business has historically been dependent on GDP growth and it’s doing well, owing to improving economic conditions and stronger IT spending in the United States and Europe. Cloud-based EchoSign solution is also a significant contributor to Acrobat revenues.Furthermore, Adobe continues to be the market leader in the Digital Media space. Notably, the company has been witnessing robust growth across its Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud segments as evident from the record number of new subscriptions registered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Notably, the advertising, entertainment and other content-creation markets are becoming increasingly digitalized and in our opinion the company is well capitalizing on this trend.We believe that Adobe’s Creative Cloud offering, marketed as a subscription model with attractive monthly pricing, will continue to drive revenues in the coming years. Moreover, its strong guidance for the upcoming quarter due to higher demand for its Creative and Marketing Cloud products keeps us optimistic.Increased adoption of cloud computing, social media and mobile devices, as well as the emergence of big data analytics is benefiting Adobe’s Digital Marketing segment.To tap the growing opportunity in this space, Adobe has resorted to acquisitions of companies such as Neolane, Omniture, Day Software, Demdose, Auditude and Efficient Frontier. Acquisitions have helped it to provide analytics, experience management, targeting, social relevance and spend optimization.Continued InnovationAdobe is committed to adding new products to its portfolio. At Max Creativity Conference in October 2017, Adobe introduced several applications for design, video and photography segments including Adobe XD, Character Animator abd Lightroom CC.The company is also working on artificial intelligence and machine learning front. The company has invested heavily in Sensei, its artificial intelligence and machine learning framework and expects to leverage its existing offerings with it.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company’s better-than-expected quarterly results for the last several quarters have kept investors optimistic about its growth prospects. Notably, in the trailing four quarters, Adobe has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 9%.The stock has witnessed upward earnings estimate revision for the first quarter and fiscal 2018 in the last 30 days. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.26 per share, up 2 cents from $1.24 projected 30 days ago. Similarly, for fiscal 2018, the consensus estimate has moved up by 2 cents to $5.49 over the same time frame.Our TakeGiven Adobe’s dominance in the creative cloud space, its leading position in the Marketing Cloud and strong margin growth, we expect the company to continue to report strong results in the near future. Its creative cloud offering, marketed as a subscription model with attractive monthly pricing, will continue to be a catalyst for revenue growth in the coming years.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAdobe Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Broadcom Ltd.

206,AVGO,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) recently acquired Kilopass Technology, a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial, and Internet of Things (IoT) areas.Per the press release, “Kilopass Technology's one-transistor (1T) and two-transistor (2T) bitcell OTP NVM IP complements Synopsys' existing DesignWare® OTP and MTP NVM IP solutions with support for up to 4-Mbit OTP instances in 180-nm to 7-nm process technologies.”The buyout will help Synopsys offer a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions. The customers are expected to gain from the combined force of the two companies, while the robust portfolio is expected to be a top-line booster for Synopsys going ahead.Synopsys stock has gained 46.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the 36.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Synopsys’ Inorganic Tuck-InsSynopsys has made a few important acquisitions to build its product portfolio and stimulate growth. Also, since intense competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate, acquisitions have helped the company to boost revenues.Notably, Kilopass is the company’s second acquisition aimed at expanding its designware IP portfolio within the last three months. In October 2017, Synopsys acquired Sidense Corporation, which also deals with OTP NVM IP.Last year, Synopsys also acquired QuantumWise, which works on delivering software tools for atomic-scale modeling of materials. The integration of QuantumWise with Synopsys' Sentaurus TCAD will aid Synopsys to better manage simulation tasks and analyze simulation results.The company also completed the buyout of Black Duck Software, which is a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. Black Duck’s flagship product, Software Composition Analysis is anticipated to enhance Synopsys’ solutions as well as broaden its clientele, thus boosting the top line.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteConclusionThe acquisitions have expanded the company’s product suite, thereby driving the company’s top line. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter revenues that jumped 9.9% year over year to $696.6 million.We believe the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys are likely to drive its near-term performance. The company’s recent product launches and deal wins will boost results, going ahead.However, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keeps us on the sidelines. Moreover, escalating costs and expenses, which are putting pressure on margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability. Further, customer concentration risk remains a huge concern for the company.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSynopsys has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the sector are NetApp, Inc.

210,AVGO,"While all tech companies have their eyes on the biggest tech show of the year, Customer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is silently enhancing its capabilities through acquisitions. Though the company has not made any announcement regarding this, it was the to-be-acquired company — Attic Labs — which revealed this news on its website. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Attic Labs was founded in 2015 by Aaron Boodman and Rafael Weinstein. According to Crunchbase, the start-up has raised $8.1 million Series A in 2016 from Greylock Partners and Harrison Metal. Attic Labs is known for its Noms tool, an open-source decentralized database, which helps users replicate information as well as edit them across multiple machines and consequently, easily sync the information.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionUpon completion of the acquisition, Attic Labs’ team will be integrated with Salesforce’s Quip division. Quip is Salesforce’s document-collaboration platform which was acquired in 2016, for a total consideration of $750 million. The division offers a similar platform like Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Docs, which enables users to share and edit documents.Noms has much more advanced features than similar kind of tools, including Git. Like Git, Noms also retain all previous versions and facilitate synchronization of all edited versions as per requirements. However, the main features which make it a superior tool are that it stores only structured data, not files or directories, and secondly, it supports very large data sets.Therefore, we believe the additional features embedded with Noms make it a feasible acquisition for Salesforce. This buyout will enhance Salesforce’s Quip division capabilities and the additional features may attract organizations to opt for this service, instead of Git.Bottom LineAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Although, the company remained almost silent throughout last year on the acquisition front (just one — Sequence), it may repeat the likes of 2016, when it bought 12 companies, this year to boost its capabilities, and grab newer and larger markets.We believe Salesforce’s continued focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run.Notably, Salesforce has returned 47.5% over the past year, significantly outperforming its industry’s gain of 38%. Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Broadcom and Mellanox have expected long-term EPS growth rates of 13.8% and 16%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

211,AVGO,"A successful investor understands the importance of retaining well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.International Business Machines Corp (IBM  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 12.1% in the past three months, substantially outperforming the 10.3% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the factors aiding the performance.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryIBM has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 3.4%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 4.95%.Valuation Looks ImpressiveOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 11.8x, significantly lower than the industry’s average of 74.4x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, the lower the P/E of a stock, the better it is for a value investor.Other Driving FactorsIBM is involved in a number of Blockchain initiatives as the technology gains rapid mainstream adoption. The company is currently the dominant player in the blockchain market. Recently, CNBC quoted Juniper Research, which placed IBM above Microsoft Corporation in blockchain-related advancements.The company uses hyperledger technology for its blockchain applications and is also a key member of the Hyperledger committee. This enables the company to gain access to prior notification of any changes in the underlying infrastructure.IBM has been winning significant deals in recent times. The company has struck bank guarantee deals with ANZ and Westpac as well as a multi-line insurance contract with American International Group and Standard Chartered PLC.It has also inked a deal with global food suppliers and another one with automobile manufacturer, ZF Friedrichshafen to enhance its Car e-Wallet technology.This apart, IBM is also focusing on cloud computing which is evident from the fact that it continues to open data centers aggressively. Globally, the company owns 60 data centers across 19 countries.The cloud computing market bodes well for IBM. Most recently, Forbes mentioned that the cloud computing market will be worth $162 billion in 2020 from $67 billion in 2015, at a CAGR of 19%.IBM remains focused on solidifying footprint in the market, which is evident from expanding data centers. The company recently opened data centers (two in London, one in San Jose and one in Sydney) that are equipped with the required cloud infrastructure to help clients develop cognitive artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT).We believe this will improve IBM’s competitive position in the cloud computing market currently dominated by Amazon’s Web Services and Microsoft Corp.Risks RemainHowever, IBM is having a tough time, given the ongoing and heavily time-consuming business model transition to cloud.  Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns.Moreover, intensifying competition in most of the markets is a major concern.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksIBM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

212,AVGO,"A history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Now, with the biggest tax overhaul in decades, the appeal for these stocks have increased on optimism that the new tax structure would prompt dividend hikes. This has made the investment case for dividend growth stocks even stronger.Inside The Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:New York-based Evercore Inc. (EVR  -  Free Report) operates as an independent investment banking advisory firm in the United States, Europe, Latin America and internationally.

213,AVGO,"3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) recently announced that KALLISTA, a designer and producer of luxury kitchen and bath products, launched the Grid sink faucet at KBIS 2018. The sink faucet was produced by 3rd Dimension with the help of 3D Systems’ 3D printing materials and technology.The company’s 3D printing technology helped designers to create the faucet in a unique geometry, enabling it to build the spout by creating an open form and discreet interior channels, facilitating easy flow of water through the base. 3D printing specialist, 3rd Dimension, produced the faucets by utilizing 3D Systems’ ProX DMP 320 high-performance metal additive manufacturing system.Moreover, the faucets are printed with the company’s LaserForm 316L, a high quality stainless steel 316 powder material that prevents rust and corrosion. 3rd Dimension’s engineering proficiency as well as experience with the 3D Systems ProX DMP 320 facilitated the production of the Grid faucet easily.Our TakeWith the 3D printing industry booming, 3D Systems’ leading position in this market presents a favorable long-term growth opportunity. As a matter of fact, majority of the company’s customers are shifting from prototyping to end use production, using 3D printing technology and the company believes that it is well positioned to aid them in their transformation. Moving ahead, it is of the opinion that robust demand for production printers, materials and software will continue to act as major catalystsCurrently, the company is witnessing robust prospects across most of its end business. 3D Systems remains especially bullish on the prospects of its healthcare business. Consistent demand for printers and materials for medical and dental customers fueled growth of this segment. Moreover, the company believes material science will be a key catalyst in the transition to 3D production and is investing large sums in materials innovation across portfolio to capitalize on the trend.However, during the third quarter, revenues from 3D printing products and services were significantly undermined due to persistently challenging market conditions. These factors adversely impacted customers' capital investment cycles and reduced demand across most geographies. Further, its performance in Americas and Asia Pacific was very weak.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock declined 27.1% in the last three months, in sharp contrast to 10.9% growth recorded by the industry. Going forward, the company believes investment in IT and go-to-market initiatives will result in higher expenses, consequently restricting near-term operating income growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), Avid Technology, Inc. (AVID  -  Free Report) and ASML Holding N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report). While Broadcom sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Avid Technology and ASML Holding carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

214,AVGO,"Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) unveiled a new suit of network-driven solution that supports wireless 5G networks called Sky5.Sky5 solution is a platform that deals with revolutionary 5G applications. According to the press release, “Our Sky5 solutions will address new 5G waveforms and spectrum, enhanced carrier aggregation, dual connectivity (4G/5G) and massive MIMO requirements while delivering unmatched levels of integration and performance, all underpinned by Skyworks’ intellectual property, operational scale and financial strength.”Advantage of 5GIts common knowledge that 5G has achieved rapid momentum over the past year. In the near future, operators will likely need to support zillions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices which are expected to be wirelessly connected. This has huge technical implications, and its implementation will entail huge time and costs.5G, which marks a revolution in the field of communications and technology, is anticipated to accumulate connections starting 2020. By 2021, there should be 25 million 5G connections worldwide. Moreover, 5G mobile handsets will be available for sale in the market by 2020, following a broader rollout of the technology.Moreover, per May 2017 Research and Markets report, the 5G network infrastructure market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 70% between 2019 and 2025. This will ultimately account for $28 billion in annual spending by the end of 2025.The 5G network will provide 50 times the throughput of the currently available 4G LTE network. Further, 5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless network. Consequently, such 5G-enabled solutions are likely to last longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts. Consequently,Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize on the 5G based infrastructures with a rising demand for high-performance analog solutions in new markets.Bottom line The manufacturer of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors’ strength is further intensified by increased demand for highly integrated solutions as customers implement the next level of functionality for higher bandwidth.With a customer base comprising the likes of Cisco in MIMO gateways, Nintendo in its Switch Gaming console; Fitbit, Garmin and LG, the company is on strong growth trajectory. Notably, the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle is also a major positive.Skyworks’ shares have returned 29.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 22.7%. However, customer concentration remains a risk as a significant portion of Skyworks’ revenues comes from a handful of customers, particularly Apple. Moreover, slow growth rate of the smartphone market and piled up inventories with Chinese smartphone providers remain headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSkyworks currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

216,AVGO,"The semiconductor corner of the broad technology market continued its winning streak with the start of the New Year. This is especially true as the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index climbed 6.8% in the first few days of 2018 trading compared with gains of 4.6% for the S&P 500 Information Technology S&P 500 index and 2.8% for the S&P 500 Index (read: S&P 500 Tops 2,700: ETFs & Stocks Outperforming to Start 2018).As semiconductors have been the most important driver of the overall technology growth, it is now used in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies are fueling huge growth in the space.In fact, global semiconductor sales picked up 21.5% year over year to reach its highest-ever monthly sales of $37.7 billion in November, and are on track to surpass $400 billion for the first time, representing growth of 20.6% year over year for 2017, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS). The agency expects sales growth to slow down modestly to 7% in 2018, as the so-called ""super-cycle"" in chip demand will fade slightly (read: Bitcoin ETFs: What Lies Ahead in 2018?).While this is true, a combination of other factors like a stabilizing PC market and waves of consolidation would boost semiconductor stocks higher. While Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) rejected Broadcom's (AVGO  -  Free Report) initial buyout offer worth $130 billion in late 2017, the latter is still in the fight to acquire the communications’ chipmaker.

220,AVGO,"Every investor wishes to have a magical portfolio of stocks with a one-way ticket to success. But this is easier said than done. And when the market is as volatile as it is now, things may take a turn for the worse any moment.No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are, equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them. While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah, others fall victim to ad hoc strategies.One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others. However, even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment. Particularly, one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified.So, wouldn’t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further?Here’s how to execute it:One should primarily look for stocks that are witnessing price increase. Actually, stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward.If a stock is continuously moving higher, there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers. So, looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set is rational.However, recent price strength alone cannot create magic. Therefore, you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy.Here’s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners.Screening Parameters:Percentage Change in Price (4 Weeks) greater than zero: This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks.Percentage Change Price (12 Weeks) greater than 10: This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months. This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period.Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock’s future performance.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Current Price/ 52-Week High-Low Range more than 85%: This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52-week highs. It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through this screen:Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) is among the world's largest global manufacturers of differentiated and commodity chemical products for a variety of industrial and consumer applications. The stock delivered an average positive earnings surprise of approximately 32.7% in the trailing four quarters.Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) is a designer, developer and supplier of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions. The stock came up with an average positive earnings surprise of approximately 4.5% in the trailing four quarters.Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report) is a home building and construction company. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 82.5%.Kingstone Companies, Inc. (KINS  -  Free Report) is an insurance company. It focuses on automobile, motorcycle and homeowners insurance and its customer base is primarily individuals rather than businesses. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.8%.IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones S.A.

221,AVGO,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) recently announced new developer tools that will allow gadget makers to integrate Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant, in their products.With the newly announced developer tool called “Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit,” developers of Bluetooth compatible wearable products like headphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers, other audio devices, and more, will now be able to build Alexa into their devices. The kit is already being used by several of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) including Bose, Jabra, iHome, Linkplay, Sugr, Librewireless, Beyerdynamic, Bowers and Wilkins.Amazon mentioned that Bose’s Alexa powered products are already under development. The company is assisting Amazon to create and refine the new kit, which Amazon will make available for developers around the world this summer. The Mobile Accessory Kit will empower brands like Bose to catch up with the likes of Apple and Google, who have already integrated their own voice assistants into their Bluetooth headphones.Brian Maguire, Director of Product Management at Bose, said in a statement, “Accessing Alexa’s music, information, and vast number of skills on our headphones will become easier than ever, and we’re looking forward to bringing our collaboration to life.”Notably, Shares of Amazon have gained 54.3% in the past 12 months, underperforming its industry’s 60.2% surge.Amazon also partnered with Vuzix Corp., which is set to present its Alexa powered augmented-reality smartglasses at CES 2018 next week, according to Bloomberg.

It will support various types of devices and incorporates Amazon’s proprietary software technology for “Alexa” wake word recognition. The company said Whirlpool has already created some Alexa using kitchen appliances and will make Alexa powered microwaves available soon.Our TakeThis move shows how Amazon intends to reap the benefits from Alexa. The company is looking beyond home products and wants to make Alexa become an integral part of people’s daily lives. Amazon wants to get ahead of its competitors to capture the most of the market by offering equipment manufacturers access to Alexa. None of its competitors have tried to make their voice assistants commercial at this scale and the strategy looks promising to us.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAmazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) are some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector.

222,AVGO,"A successful portfolio manager is aware of the importance of having well-performing stocks in one’s portfolio. Indicators of a stock’s continued performance include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is CyberArk Software Ltd. (CYBR  -  Free Report). Though there are a few concerns, these are short lived. The stock has the potential to perform well over the long run.Though the stock did not perform well last year, but looking at the healthy demand for cyber security solutions and the company’s impressive third-quarter 2017 results, the stock seems to have considerable upside potential.CyberArk has lost 15.9% of its value year to date against 19.2% growth of its industry.Let’s take a look at what’s going in favor of the stock.Rise in Cyber Security DemandThe company is benefiting from the surge in demand for cyber security following cyber attacks that jolted the world last year.The long list of data breaches has brought to light the fact that a company’s financial well-being, brands and reputation are today increasingly exposed to sophisticated cyber threats.  The rapid emergence of of cloud computing and the idea of sharing resources to lower cost have further increased demand for adequate security policies, protocols and products.Per a recent report by MarketsandMarkets, the cyber security market is expected witness CAGR of 11% from $137.85 billion in 2017 to $231.94 billion by 2022. We believe that CyberArk with its portfolio of cyber security products is well poised to enjoy the growth prospects.Impressive Third-Quarter Results and GuidanceCyberArk reported impressive results for the third quarter and raised guidance for the full year 2017. These indicate that its ongoing investment in sales and marketing strategies are paying off.Furthermore, it should be noted that in the second quarter of 2017, the company had reported the slowest revenue growth rate of 14% since its listing in September 2014. Prior to that, it was around 25%. Therefore, its third quarter actual growth rate, along with the  fourth quarter projection of around 18% suggests a revival. This makes us optimistic about its long-term revenue prospects.CyberArk Software Ltd. Revenue (TTM) CyberArk Software Ltd. Revenue (TTM) | CyberArk Software Ltd. QuoteStrong Balance SheetCyberArk has a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity position and no debt obligations. The increasing liquidity and cash flow trend reflects that the company is making investments in the right direction. Moreover, since it carries no long-term debt, the cash is available for pursuing strategic acquisitions, investment in growth initiatives and distribution to shareholders.However, there are a few concerns related to the stock.Decelerating Revenue GrowthDuring fourth-quarter 2016, and the first and second quarters of 2017, year-over-year growth rates were 25%, 26% and 14%, respectively. The decelerating revenue growth trend hurt investors’ confidence as evident from its share price performance.Increasing Operating ExpensesHigher operating expenses have been hurting its profitability. Escalated operating expenses mainly stem from increased investment toward enhancing product offerings and expanding sales capabilities. Though these investments will have long-term benefits, we expect these  to remain a drag on the bottom line in the near term.    We believe, the combination of the above discussed factors along with a long-term earnings growth rate of 21.7% makes this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s position in investors’ portfolio secured as of now.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

223,AVGO,"Shares of Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $33.78 on Jan 4, closing marginally lower at $33.76. The company has gained 37.7% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 24.8%. The stock has a market cap of $27.64 billion.What’s Behind the Rally?The rally in shares can be accredited to Corning’s leadership in glass substrates, strong relationships and share buyback policy and acquisition of 3M’s communication market division.With increasing demand for efficient data networks for mobile devices, Corning’s fiber optic solutions business has seen significant growth. Itis expected to act as a key growth catalyst over the next few years.The company has also been benefiting from its innovations in the glass substrate industry. Corning’s generation 10 substrates, which use EAGLE XG formulation, not only provides superior picture quality but also minimize its effect on the environment.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been an investor favorite. Through its strategy and capital allocation framework, Corning plans to return $12.5 billion to its shareholders through buyback in the near term. Its buyback policy has made it easier for the company to grow EPS.Successful Acquisitions and Product AdoptionsCorning recently announced that it has agreed to take over 3M Company’s Communication Markets Division completely in an all-cash deal for approximately $900 million. Acquisition of 3M’s communication market division will not only strengthen the company’s Optical Communications worldwide market access but also expand Corning’s product portfolio. Moreover, the company expects the deal to add 7-9 cents to 2019 earnings.Considering growth witnessed by the Optical Communications market in the last few years, this deal will boost Corning’s revenues and increase overall market share. In the recently reported third-quarter 2017 results, Optical Communications segment generated 35.3% of total revenues. Reported segment revenues increased 15.3% year over year and 4% on a sequential basis to $917 million on the back of strong demand for both enterprise and carrier products.Further, Ford’s use of Corning Gorilla Glass for its Ford GT is aiding the company to successfully penetrate the 6 billion-square-foot auto glazing market. Corning has also announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to manufacture, develop and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. This venture has allowed the company to move forward in the value chain beyond glass to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a leading producer.Encouraging Earnings Surprise HistoryCorning outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 8.74%.Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 7.1%.To ConcludeCorning is benefiting from robust performance of its Optical Communications and specialty material business lines.

226,AVGO,"Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) has generated significant returns for investors in the past year and has the potential to exceed expectations going ahead.The stock has soared 60.6% last year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 44.1%.Let’s check out the reasons for this impressive surge in share price and see why Marvell is likely to maintain the momentum next year as well.Key Growth DriversWe believe that strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products could be a catalyst. This will be supported by growth from the company’s wide range of newly-launched Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.Moreover, Marvell’s recent deal to acquire Cavium will expand its offerings beyond hard disk drives and microprocessors and help it to enter high growth areas such as data centers and wireless communications.The company’s recent introduction of a comprehensive wireless product portfolio named 802.11ax is also expected to be beneficial for the top line going ahead.Additionally, Marvell is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market. In the coming years, it projects an increase in the number of PCs/servers to use flash-based solid state technology for storage. The storage market is witnessing a steady rise in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data. NAND (non-volatile storage technology) demand is likely to remain robust in 2018 as well.Marvell is benefiting from increasing demand for SSD products. This is evident from the sequential increase in the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues from the storage end market, which accounted for the majority of total revenues.The company’s current restructuring initiative will also help Marvell improve cloud infrastructure and applications, which are projected to drive the top line. The latest buyback scheme also reflects sound financial position and favorable prospects.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Revenue (TTM) Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Revenue (TTM) | Marvell Technology Group Ltd. QuoteImpressive GuidanceApart from the company’s back-to-back quarters of better-than-expected bottom-line results, an encouraging fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 outlook provided on the last quarterly earnings conference call also makes us optimistic about its near-term performance.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryMarvell has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 10.1%.Attractive ValuationFrom a valuation perspective, the stock looks attractive as it is currently trading significantly lower than the industry average, based on a forward earnings estimate. This signifies huge upward potential. Marvell currently trades at a forward P/E of 19.3x compared with the industry group average of 22.4x.Hence, there is still much momentum left in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which is also evident from its long-term earnings growth rate of 16.3%.All these positives make Marvell’s stock worth considering.Key PicksA few top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term EPS growth rate for NVIDIA, Broadcom and Micron is projected to be 10.3%, 13.8% and 10%, respectively.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

227,AVGO,"Holding onto shares of Pegasystems Inc. (PEGA  -  Free Report) might not be a good option. Shares of Pegasystems have lost 17.6% in the past six months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 17.1%. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock might continue to witness a downside. A key reason for this is the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year 2017, we have seen two estimates move south in the past 60 days with no upward revisions. This resulted in the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 91 cents a share 60 days ago to its current level of 73 cents.Lower-Than-Expected Results & Stretched Valuations The company reported fiscal third-quarter 2018 non-GAAP revenues of $179.81 million, which declined 2% from the year-ago quarter and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $198 million. This decline was due to the shift in the company’s recurring revenue mix.Pegasystems Inc. Revenue (TTM) Pegasystems Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Pegasystems Inc. QuotePEGA’s trailing 12 month price earnings (P/E) ratio is 111.74, while the industry's average trailing 12-month P/E ratio is lower at 29.26. This implies that the stock is currently overvalued.Intensive Competition &Unimpressive Earnings Surprise HistoryWith increasing global foothold, the company has been adversely affected by foreign exchange rate volatility as well as intensive competition.Moreover, Pegasystems failed to outperform the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 18.68%.Considering the aforementioned factors, it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio, at least for now.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc(NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NetApp, NVIDIA and Broadcom have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 11.34%, 10.25% and 13.75%, respectively.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

228,AVGO,"Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google division is looking to divest Zagat, its restaurant review guide for the United States. Per Reuters, the company has been involved in informal talks with multiple companies to offload Zagat in recent months.Google is yet to finalize a price and deadline for the divestiture. According to sources, if a deal happens, it would involve the Zagat brand as well as its website. Notably, the Internet giant bought Zagat way back in 2011 for $151 million.Currently, Zagat is part of Google Maps and a small team looks after Zagat.com, which is a free service. It includes reviews into Maps’ restaurant listings.Notably, shares of Alphabet have gained 35.1% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 28.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.  Divestitures Strengthening PortfolioAlphabet has been trimming its portfolio for quite some time, a strategy that has helped it to focus on efficiently managing its core assets.In February 2017, Alphabet announced its plan to sell Terra Bella, the satellite imaging business (then known as Skybox Imaging) it acquired in 2014 for $500 million, to Planet Labs, a San Francisco-based private satellite operator. The deal was completed in April 2017.Moreover, in June 2017, Alphabet sold two of its robotics firms, Boston Dynamics and Tokyo-based Schaft to SoftBank Group.Acquisitions Drive Top-line GrowthAlphabet’s top-line growth has not only been driven by its strength in core search business but also supported by the successful integration of major acquisitions (AdMob, DoubleClick, YouTube, ITA and Nest to name a few). These provided Alphabet with the technology for sustained growth in the highly dynamic and competitive markets in which it operates.Alphabet’s acquisition of part of HTC’s mobile division team reflects management’s focus on developing hardware capabilities. This will eventually help the company compete better against handset makers like Samsung, LG, and Huawei.Alphabet spent $130 million on acquisitions in the last quarter.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) are some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector. All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

229,AVGO,"After a banner year, Wall Street’s tech big cheese continues to scale new highs in 2018. Computer and software makers, Internet players and chipmakers are having a ball after the repatriation tax holiday in the GOP’s plan is expected to boost stock prices of these companies, while also stimulating the U.S. economy.And if a few worrywarts feel that the stock of the tech biggies have become pricey relative to earnings, then the continued strength in profits and sales might drive share prices higher. This calls for investing in this space for handsome returns.Tech Stocks Soar in New YearTech stocks have easily outperformed the broader equity market’s rally last year. While the Nasdaq soared 29.6%, the broader S&P 500 gained 21.8%. Tech stocks marched higher this year as well, with the Nasdaq closing above the coveted 7,000 mark. The tech-rich index raced to a fresh 1000-point milestone in around eight months, a pace not seen since the tech boom period.Tech heavyweights Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) collectively contributed almost two-third of the points that helped the Nasdaq climb from one 1000-point to another, as per stock-market research firm Birinyi Associates.But, will the lofty valuation lead to a fall in 2018? Wall Street analysts mostly disagree, and rightly so. Netflix is poised for a bigger rise this year as it is far ahead of peers in building subscription video services. The company is also rumored to be acquired by Apple, which may drive its stock further north. Apple, by the way, is benefitting from steady iPhone sales, spurt in services segment and resurgence in Mac and iPad sales.Amazon’s juggernaut, in the meanwhile, seems unstoppable. The company has already shipped more than 5 billion items from its Prime membership service to subscribers and is on the verge of buying Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) following its purchase of Whole Foods.While Alphabet’s strong advertising revenues and improving paid click growth remain growth drivers, Microsoft’s rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365 will remain a key catalyst in the near future. And when it comes to Facebook, the company’s efforts in mobile and live videos continue to pay off.Semiconductor Stocks RallyA steady rally among semiconductors supported the broader tech sector at the beginning of this year, while the PHLX Semiconductor index gained nearly 40% last year. These makers of computer chips utilized in everything from smartphones to self-driving cars, in fact, recently got a boost from a survey by the Semiconductor Industry Association. The report showed that worldwide chip sales climbed 21.5% in November from a year earlier.While all the major semiconductors made headway in recent times, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has progressed by leaps and bounds. The world’s leading graphics chipmaker’s commendable position in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learning and driverless cars industry are making investors optimistic about its prospects.Catalysts Behind the SurgeThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, which mostly supported the gains among the manufacturers of internal technologies —the semiconductor makers and the software industry.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States was among the world’s highest. This explains why most of the tech majors stash cash overseas. In fact, a Nikkei Asian Review showed that combined overseas cash reserves of major tech companies exceeded the Japanese government’s overall tax revenues in fiscal 2016.But, the headline-grabbing move of the bill was slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This in turn will make tech players repatriate trillions of dollars held abroad and eventually drive their after-tax earnings. Tech companies can also use this extra cash for research and development and M&A activities.Top 5 Tech Behemoths to Buy NowInvestors, thus, should double down on the hottest tech behemoths after they cross one record after another, primarily, backed by favorable government policy.

Its latest inorganic addition is Morningstar, Inc.’s 15(c) board consulting services business. The financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.This business segment of Morningstar helps “ boards of directors and executive teams of mutual funds” in meeting their 15(c) fiduciary duties for the process of reviewing and approving the fee related agreements with each investment advisor. The buyout will help Broadridge in better serving its fund board clients.The company in its press release revealed that, “This acquisition will enable Broadridge to provide its fund board clients the ability to benchmark funds using both Morningstar and Lipper data via an objective, independent source in order to better assess their fund advisors and sub-advisors.”The acquisition is anticipated to strengthen Broadridge’s ability to provide a comprehensive source for financial data required for the fulfillment of governance related responsibilities by the board of directors of mutual funds.Dan Cwenar, Broadridge’s head of buy-side data and analytics stated, “This acquisition broadens the breadth and depth of the data-driven solutions Broadridge provides to the investment management industry and underscores our commitment to providing innovative services to help clients get ahead of today’s challenges and capitalize on tomorrow’s opportunities.”Share PriceBroadridge stock has gained 36.9% over the past year, substantially outperforming the 6.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors Driving the StockAcquisitions have been key catalysts for Broadridge’s growth.

The company recently joined forces with Wealthsimple, a Canadian digital investing service to step into the “robo-advisory” market. The company also formed a strategic alliance with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to build a new solution that can store documents and data in a repository, which will be further used for machine learning and artificial intelligence.Furthermore, Broadridge’s product launches, share repurchase programs and regular dividend payment policies look encouraging.

232,AVGO,"On Jan 2, we issued an updated research report on Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report).Notably, Paylocity holds a significant position in the payroll processing and human capital management market backed by its strong product suite.The robust product portfolio has helped in expansion of the company’s clientele, which eventually resulted in 25% year-over-year growth in fiscal first-quarter 2018 revenues.Key Catalysts in DetailThe company’s Software as a Service (SaaS) based human capital management (HCM) services have aided top-line growth. We also remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology.SaaS HCM solutions that minimize data integrity issues across applications and ease implementations compared to those offered by traditional software providers are being adopted by organizations on a large scale.According to Gartner, the global SaaS market is expected to increase at a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (2016–2020) of 15.65%. With its SaaS-based applications, we think that Paylocity is well positioned to lead the market.For the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services contributed significantly to its revenues. Hence, regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovation, will continue to boost the company’s top line.Paylocity Holding Corporation Revenue (TTM) Paylocity Holding Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Paylocity Holding Corporation QuoteAdditionally, we believe, that growth of Paylocity’s Affordable Care Act (ACA) dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability is another tailwind and will carry the trend going ahead.Furthermore, Paylocity is a cash-rich company with a strong balance sheet. Since it has no debt on its balance sheet, the existing cash can be used for pursuing strategic acquisitions, investment in growth initiatives and rewarding shareholders.Shares of Paylocity have surged 55.1% the last year, outperforming the 28.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.To ConcludeWe believe that with a strong balance sheet, an enriched SaaS based product portfolio and an increasing client base, the company is well poised to enjoy steady growth going ahead.Zacks Rank and Key PicksPaylocity has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc.

233,AVGO,"As one of the largest hard disk drive producers in the United States, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) is riding on its acquisitions and an expanding SSD storage market. Here is why you should add this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock to your portfolio.Western Digital has returned 3.1% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s gain of 2%. The company is experiencing robust demand in end markets as well as strong growth prospects for flash-based storage products.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryWestern Digital outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 8.43%.Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 25.1%.Expanding SSD Market & Cloud DeploymentWestern Digital has been expanding into the SSD storage market due to declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices in the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs. Due to the expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital’s long-term prospects look exciting.Anticipating potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is investing heavily to deliver high capacity storage devices that will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications. Additionally, the company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, which enables the user to manage and store huge volumes of digital data.Acquisitions Driving GrowthWestern Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company’s growth and also helped it to gain traction in SSD.  Additionally it has allowed the company to step in to the NAND products market, which, owing to its strong demand, will drive the company’s revenues.Moreover, the company’s acquisition of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio.ValuationMoreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Western Digital currently trades at a forward P/E of 6.52x as against the industry group average of 16.10x.ConclusionManagement is particularly positive about the company’s flash-based storage segment and joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind for Western Digital.With expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data and growing exposure to the SMB space, shares of Western Digital look well poised for the long term.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

234,AVGO,"Shares of ON Semiconductor Corporation’s (ON  -  Free Report) have been moving north backed by strong automotive, industrial and communications end-markets. The company has been expanding its product portfolio supported by inorganic growth strategies and successful integrations. However, increasing debt burden continues to erode margins amid stiff competition.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has returned 65.6% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 25.8%.The company reported third-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of 25 cents per share, much higher than the year-ago earnings of 2 cents per share. Earnings also increased 14% sequentially.The company reported revenues of $1.39 billion, which surged 46% year over year and 4% from the previous quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong demand and adoption of the company’s diversified product portfolio for automotive, industrial and communications end-markets. Management is particularly positive about the strong operating model followed by ON Semi.ON Semiconductor Corporation Revenue (TTM) ON Semiconductor Corporation Revenue (TTM) | ON Semiconductor Corporation QuoteIn the last 60 days, fiscal 2017 estimates were revised upward, taking the Zacks Consensus Estimate up from $1.40 per share to $1.44 per share.Valuation Looks ImpressiveOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 14.68x, significantly lower than the Zacks industry’s average of 27x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Therefore, the lower the P/E of a stock, the better it is for a value investor.Product Additions and Acquisitions - Key CatalystsThe company is quite active on the mergers and acquisitions front. Its acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor’s CMOS image sensor business unit, AMI Semiconductor and CMD have expanded its product breadth. These acquisitions have also given the company exposure to new end markets along with higher margin capabilities.ON Semi’s automotive segment is a strong growth driver as evident from the strong booking trends in the last few quarters. Moreover, decreasing oil prices and attractive product offerings are further aiding revenues.In view of rising product demand, ON Semi launched three image sensors for ADAS and real view applications alongside its low energy Bluetooth technology and Smart Passive Sensors (SPS). These will strengthen its Internet of Things (IoT) development kit platform’s capabilities.

235,AVGO,"With a major overhaul in tax laws in more than 30 years, U.S. corporates are expected to see a significant increase in their cash pile. While the slashing of the corporate tax from 35% to 21% will lead to a rise in profit after tax, a cash repatriation window will allow multinational corporations to bring in cash stashed in foreign countries. Boosted by the surge in domestic cash, many companies may opt for mergers & acquisitions (M&A), share buybacks or dividend pay-out next year or beyond.Here we will focus on stocks, which are expected to pay better dividends in 2018 than their industry peers and also have growth prospects. While the upside momentum of the market may continue amid strong manufacturing data, rising corporate profits and interest rates, risks of a downside remain. In such an environment, investors can add these stocks to their portfolio to enjoy a steady stream of cashGenerally, companies paying dividends are financially stable accruing profits in established markets. Share buyback programs and dividend payouts boost investor confidence in the company, thereby raising its market value. However, with interest rates rising in the United States, some amount of cash may flow to the debt market. However, this does not weaken the prospects of dividend investing. With investors getting worried about the Bull Run and many even expecting a correction, dividend paying companies are better bets for 2018.7 Amazing Dividend StocksIt is no easy task to select outperformers given the vast size of the market. Therefore, we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, we are also taking into account VGM Score. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. With our Style Score system, we have identified stocks that have potential to beat the market.The score allows one to streamline their search to select winners by eliminating the negative aspects. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM score, we have chosen large-cap companies. This lowers the risk of the portfolio as these companies are less susceptible to market volatility. Moreover, the companies have seen EPS, sales and dividend payout increase in the last five years. Although, past growth is not an indicator of future movement, it helps to select companies that have a higher probability of paying dividends. The companies have also performed better than the S&P 500 this year. However, these have a low PEG ratio, which suggests room for upside.Here are seven of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, and sells computer, networking, and communications platforms worldwide.

236,AVGO,"The U.S. markets enjoyed a strong and steady rally for most of 2017 backed by strong earnings numbers in consecutive quarters and robust economic growth. This bull run is expected to continue in 2018 as well given an improved outlook for the economy provided by the Fed and the recent tax overhaul with lower corporate taxes.Amid these, laying a wager on stocks based on profit numbers appears a good option. But looking beyond profits and figuring out a company’s efficiency in generating cash flows can be far more rewarding. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality, and is the key for its existence, development and success.To understand this efficiency, one needs to consider a company’s net cash flow. In any business, cash moves in and out. It is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually making. Experiencing a positive cash flow denotes an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This provides the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company’s future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management’s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business.As a result, while picking stocks, go beyond profits and make sure to look for companies with dependable and increasing cash flows.Screening Parameters:To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time, we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5-year average cash flow per common share. This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time.In addition to this we chose:Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company’s future performance.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This sieves out low-priced stocks.VGM Score of B or better: This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks. Importantly, this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their individual industry categories.Here are four out of nine stocks that qualified the screening:Ingles Markets, Incorporated (IMKTA  -  Free Report), headquartered in Asheville, NC, is a leading supermarket chain with operations in the southeastern United States. The company has a VGM Score of A.The stock has experienced positive estimate revisions, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings moving 16.3% north in a month’s time.Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report), headquartered in The Woodlands, TX, is a global manufacturer of differentiated and commodity chemical products for a variety of industrial and consumer applications.

(SORL  -  Free Report), headquartered in China, specializes in the development, production and distribution of automotive brake systems and other key safety-related auto parts. The company's customer base consists of original equipment manufacturers, aftermarket distributors and international customers. The company has a VGM Score of B.The stock has experienced solid estimate revisions.

The company has a VGM Score of B.Broadcom has a long-term growth rate of 13.8%.

237,AVGO,"There are some companies that put in sustained efforts to stay ahead of the curve even in the face of intense competitive pressure. Acxiom Corporation (ACXM  -  Free Report) is one such company that has been continuously growing through acquisitions and partnerships. Though the stock faces a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Shares of Acxiom have gained 11.1% in the past three months, slightly outperforming the industry’s rally of 8.8%.The company’s robust segment performance, strategic partnerships and expanding customer base are key catalysts.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryAcxiom has an impressive earnings surprise history.

Such high level of competition can lead to unwanted price cuts, higher advertising expenses and changes in marketing mix and affect the company’s revenues and margins.Financial sector services form a significant portion of Acxiom’s revenues and any slowdown or can have an adverse impact on the company’s overall performance.Zacks Rank &Stock to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report).

238,AVGO,"Workiva (WK  -  Free Report) shares have been witnessing a downside since the company reported third-quarter 2017 results.Shares of Workiva have merely returned 3.6% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 10.6%.Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what’s taking a toll on this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company.Growth ImpedimentsAnalysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock in the past couple of months with all estimates moving south and no movement in the opposite direction. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter declined from a loss of 15 cents to 22 cents.The company also provided a not-so-encouraging guidance. For fourth-quarter 2017, total revenues are anticipated between $53 million and $53.4 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $53.3 million. Non-GAAP operating loss is expected in the range of $8.8-$9.2 million.Workiva Inc. Revenue (TTM) Workiva Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Workiva Inc.

239,AVGO,"The primary motive of any investor is to generate maximum returns. Investors are thus always on the lookout for companies that are raking in solid profits.Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company’s profitability. A proper analysis of the same reveals how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it.Net Profit Margin = Net profit /Sales * 100.In simple terms, net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs, interest, depreciation, taxes and other expenses. In fact, net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost-control measures.Also, higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders. Further, strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well-skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business.Moreover, a higher net profit margin compared to its peers lends the company a competitive edge.Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.However, net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls. The metric varies widely from industry to industry. While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries, it is not that important for technology companies.Moreover, the difference in accounting treatment of various items — especially non-cash expenses like depreciation and stock-based compensation — makes comparison a daunting task.Further, for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding, higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit. In such cases, the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company’s performance.The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought-after elements in a business model.Apart from these, we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy.Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months – Most Recent (%) greater than equal to 0: High net profit margin indicates solid profitability.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/(F-1) greater than equal to 0: It indicates earnings growth.Average Broker Rating (1-5) equal to 1: A rating of #1 indicates brokers’ extreme bullishness on the stock.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than peers in all types of market environment.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 29 stocks that qualified the screen:Singapore-based Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) designs, develops and supplies a range of complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products worldwide.

240,AVGO,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 26, 2017 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), ESCO International, Inc. (WCC  -  Free Report), Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report).Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog: 4 Tech Stocks on Sale: Should You Buy for 2018?The United States Senate just passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, marking President Donald Trump’s first major legislative conquest. The highlight of the reform is the slash in corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% that is expected to boost the bottom line of the companies.However, the technology sector is unlikely to benefit much from the reforms owing to the fact that  it already enjoys several tax benefits and therefore has a lower effective tax rate. Citing S&P Global data, Bloomberg stated, “Among sectors, the 18.5 percent effective tax rate enjoyed by the group is the third-lowest among U.S. large caps.”This was also evident from the sector’s not so impressive run in early December 2017 when investors were moving their funds into sectors which had higher scope for gains. As a matter of fact, just after the Republican Senate passed the bill with a 51-49 majority on Dec 2 morning, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined approximately 2% in next two trading days.Nevertheless, we believe that the technology sector, which has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, augmented/virtual reality devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) related software is capable of  regaining momentum in 2018.In fact, investors also soon realized that the early December plunge across the technology sector is an opportunity to invest in stocks that were too pricey earlier.Here are a few stocks that saw a decline in their prices in early December following a shift in investors’ focus toward other sectors. But these stocks enjoy strong fundamentals and thus are well poised for growth.Broadcom Ltd. is one such stock which is still available at discount compared with with Dec 1 closing price. We believe that the company has several driving factors, which can help it gain going ahead.The company is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. The trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2018. Moreover, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment. Additionally, Broadcom’s focus on multiple target markets mitigates operating risks and lessens the exposure to volatility in any single market. Based on its expanding product portfolio, the company is well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G.The company’s Zack’s Rank #1 and VGM Score of B are further testaments to its upside potential. The VGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum, across the board.Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.Our next choice is WESCO International, Inc., which, like Broadcom, is also available at discount compared with its Dec 1 closing price.We believe the company is benefiting from strength across all end markets and geographic regions, improved sales execution and positive pricing. The company continues with its focus on delivering above-average sales growth, profitability improvement, strong cash flow generation and increasing shareholder value. Moreover, its comprehensive portfolio of products and services, and a sizable global footprint are further tailwinds for the company.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, which makes the stock an attractive pick at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another stock which is still lower than its Dec 1 closing price is Stratasys Ltd. The significant discount, at which the stock is available when coupled with its strong fundamentals, makes it a good buy.The company seems to be well poised for steady growth backed by its turnaround strategies, which include launching innovative products, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. These initiatives are paving the way for the company to excel in the 3D printing industry, which is anticipated to witness CAGR of 25.76% through 2017 to 2023 and reach $32.78 billion.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, which further indicate its upside potential.Western Digital Corp. is one stock that has already covered up its early December loss. The company is poised to benefit from robust demand in end markets as well as strong growth prospects for flash-based storage products. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is also driving top-line growth. We note that the company is gaining from strong demand for both hard drive and NAND-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications.Additionally, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A.Investing in these selected technology stocks can prove to be beneficial for investors in 2018 amid President Donald Trump’s corporate tax rate cut, which is believed to least  favor the sector.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

242,AVGO,"On Dec 14, we issued an updated research report on Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (SIMO  -  Free Report), a leading developer of microcontroller ICs for NAND flash storage devices and specialty RF ICs for mobile devices.Notably, shares of SIMO have returned 32.8%, outperforming the industry’s 23.5% rally.NAND supply constraint has negatively impacted Silicon Motion’s results in the last year except third-quarter 2017. The constraints affected module maker customers, hyperscale customers, and NAND flash partners last quarter.However, since the last quarter, NAND supply is improving, which has cooled off the price rise, thereby driving demand for SSD controller. The effect of this was well reflected in SIMO’s last quarterly results. The company witnessed a 50% sequential increase in its SSD solutions revenues, mainly driven by strong growth in sales of Shannon hyper-scale SSDs and Ferri industrial SSDs.Shawn Kim of Morgan Stanley in his latest report noted that NAND flash memory chips are at their peak and may start falling early next year. This further boosted the demand for SSD controller and we believe that SIMO is well positioned to grab this opportunity.SIMO is active on the acquisitions front too. The company’s buyouts include FCI, Centronix mobile tv and Shannon systems. These acquisitions have helped the company to increase its foothold in the mobile communications market.Moreover, the company outshines its peers in providing resources for research and development. It develops affordable versions of TLC NAND flash as well as high-density 3D NAND. Moreover, SIMO’s robust liquidity position has allowed the company to undertake diligent capital deployment initiatives that supplement long-term growth.Nonetheless, intensifying competition in the USB flash drive controller market remains a major headwind.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSIMO carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for Broadcom, NVIDIA and Intel is projected to be 13.8%, 10.3% and 8.4%, respectively.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

243,AVGO,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 19. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 9.8%. Over the last four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of approximately 11%.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $2.20, which represents an approximately seven-fold jump from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 32 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved up 5 cents in the last 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $6.39 billion, up 60.9% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see what are the key factors this overwhelming fiscal first-quarter results.Improved DRAM Demand & Pricing to Bolster RevenuesThe main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improved prices for DRAM. Increased pricing is mainly driven by better product-mix optimization, and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.Notably, DRAM generates majority of the company’s revenues, and in fiscal 2017 it contributed approximately 64%. The company witnessed a year-over-year surge of 80% in the fiscal 2017 DRAM revenues.Smartphone makers and cloud data-center operators will be the key growth drivers for DRAM chips. As per data compiled by DRAMeXchange, smartphones witnessed an increase of 33.4% in DRAM content this year, to an average of 3.2 GB per device. As smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) plan to roll out devices with higher capacity and more demanding applications like AR and AI, demand for DRAM is likely to grow much faster.Moreover, server DRAM demand is anticipated to remain strong as cloud data-center customers seek innovative solutions to reduce the workload. The high-density modules based on advanced manufacturing nodes have come to the market, urging server OEMs to overhaul and shift to new technology for better results. This is likely to drive Micron’s top- and bottom-line results in the to-be-reported quarter.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteNAND Supply Shortage to Propel RevenuesOver the past year, NAND prices have been flaring up due to shortage of supply. The company has well benefited from this and in fiscal 2017, it registered an approximately 50% jump in NAND revenues. According, to Shawn Kim of Morgan Stanley, NAND prices are currently at peak levels.We believe any elevation in prices will have a favorable influence on the company’s top line, the benefit of which will likely trickle down to the bottom line. The benefit from improved pricing was well reflected in the company’s last quarterly results as well. We anticipate these benefits to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter also.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

244,AVGO,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Impinj, Inc. (PI  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in PI.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from as loss of 16 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 21 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Impinj has seen one downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 20 cents a share from a loss of 16 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15.1% in the past month.Impinj, Inc.

245,AVGO,"The technology space continues to be investors’ favorite due to its dynamic nature. This field is anticipated to grow faster than ever before. Therefore, if you invest right, you can reap the benefits over time.Below we have evaluated one technology company that has demonstrated remarkable share price performance this year so far. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) has generated significant returns for investors in the year-to-date period and has the potential to exceed expectations in the days ahead as well.The stock has soared a whopping 91.8% in the year so far, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of just 19.3%.Let’s check out the reasons for this impressive surge in share price and consider why Micron will continue its momentum in the next year as well.Improved DRAM Demand & PricingThe main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improved prices for DRAM. Notably, DRAM generates majority of the company’s revenues and in fiscal 2017 it contributed approximately 64%. The company witnessed a year-over-year surge of 80% in the fiscal 2017 DRAM revenues.Increased pricing is mainly driven by better product-mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles. DRAMeXchange projects that demand for DRAM will jump 20.6% in 2018 from an estimated increase of 19.6% in 2017. The primary driver is expected to be higher storage demand from smartphones and servers.Smartphones witnessed an increase of 33.4% in DRAM content this year, to an average of 3.2 GB per device. As smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) plan to launch devices with higher capacity and more demanding applications like AR and AI, demand for DRAM is likely to grow much faster.Moreover, server DRAM demand is anticipated to remain strong as Cloud Data-Center customers seek innovative solutions to reduce their workload. The high-density modules based on advanced manufacturing nodes have come to the market, urging server OEMs to overhaul and shift to new technology for better results. This also provides significant growth opportunity for Micron.Tumbling NAND Prices to Have Lesser ImpactThe last two weeks didn’t go well for majority of the memory chip makers after analyst Shawn Kim of Morgan Stanley noted that NAND flash memory chip prices are at peak levels, but may start declining from the beginning of 2018 due to a supply glut. Investors seemed worried about Micron too as it also sales NAND chips.However, we believe the fall in NAND prices will have the least impact on Micron’s financials due to its less exposure in the segment. Various analysts also believe the company is well positioned to lower its NAND production costs, through which it can safeguard margins and bottom-line results from loss of revenues due to declining prices.Attractive ValuationOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 5.5x, significantly lower than the industry average of 16x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Therefore, lower the P/E of a stock, the better for a value investor.Hence, we believe there is still much momentum left in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, which is quite evident from its VGM Style Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.Some other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), all sporting Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

246,AVGO,"One of the most-favored approaches for investors with a high-risk appetite is the Driehaus strategy. Investors can pick momentum stocks using it to eke out satisfactory returns. The strategy was formulated by Richard Driehaus using the buy high and sell higher principle. Its success has helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

247,AVGO,"Achieving profit is no doubt a company’s goal, but having a healthy cash flow is imperative to its existence, development and success. And why not? Even a company generating profits succumbs to failure and faces bankruptcy while meeting its obligations if it has a dearth of cash flow. But one can efficiently tide over any market mayhem if it has the cash to shield it.Indeed, cash is the lifeblood of any business and indicates a company’s true financial health. It offers the flexibility to make decisions, the means to make potential investments and the fuel to run its growth engine.To understand this efficiency, one needs to consider a company’s net cash flow. In any business, cash moves in and out. It is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually making. Experiencing a positive cash flow denotes an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This provides the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company’s future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management’s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business.As a result, while picking stocks, go beyond profits and make sure to look for companies with dependable and increasing cash flows.Screening Parameters:To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time, we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5-year average cash flow per common share. This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time.In addition to this we chose:Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company’s future performance.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This sieves out low-priced stocks.VGM Score of B or better: This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks. Importantly, this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their individual industry categories.Here are four out of nine stocks that qualified the screening:SORL Auto Parts, Inc. (SORL  -  Free Report), headquartered in China, specializes in the development, production and distribution of automotive brake systems and other key safety related auto parts. The company's customer base consists of original equipment manufacturers, aftermarket distributors and international customers. The company has a VGM Score of A.The stock has experienced solid estimate revisions.

248,AVGO,"Regardless of whether it is a young company or a renowned corporation, unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for the top brass of any organization. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only nine. Here are the top four stocks:Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. (OLLI  -  Free Report) operates as a retailer of brand name merchandise. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its estimated growth rate for this year is 24.4%, higher than the industry’s gain of 7.4%.Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) operates variety retail stores in the United States and Canada. It operates in two segments, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. The company’s estimated growth rate for this year is 26.6%, higher than the industry’s gain of 13.4%.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners, and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) digital services.

249,AVGO,"Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company’s profits. A proper analysis of the same reveals how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it.A higher net margin reflects the company’s efficiency at converting sales into actual profits.Net Profit Margin = Net profit /Sales * 100.In simple terms, net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs, interest, depreciation, taxes and other expenses. In fact, net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost-control measures.Also, higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders. Further, strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well-skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business.Moreover, a higher net profit margin as compared to peers lends a company competitive edge.Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.However, net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls. The metric varies widely from industry to industry. While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries, it is not that important for technology companies.Moreover, the difference in accounting treatment of various items — especially non-cash expenses like depreciation and stock-based compensation — makes comparison a daunting task.Further, for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding, higher interest expenses usually weigh on the net profit. In such cases, the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company’s performance.The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought-after elements in a business model.Apart from these, we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy.Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months – Most Recent (%) greater than equal to 0: High net profit margin indicates solid profitability.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/(F-1) greater than equal to 0: It indicates earnings growth.Average Broker Rating (1-5) equal to 1: A rating of #1 indicates brokers’ extreme bullishness on the stock.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than peers in all types of market environment.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 25 stocks that qualified the screen:France-based Arkema SA (ARKAY  -  Free Report) is engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of vinyl, industrial chemicals, and performance products.

Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year increased 4.7%.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryBroadcom has an impressive earnings surprise history.

On Nov 6, the company had offered $70 per share, which was rejected by Qualcomm’s board as it undermined the company’s value.However, Broadcom remains committed to pursue the Qualcomm acquisition. On Dec 4, Broadcom notified Qualcomm of its intention to nominate 11 individuals for election to Qualcomm’s board at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders on Mar 6, 2018.  The company has also announced its intent to redomicile in the United States that will help it pursue the Qualcomm acquisition more aggressively. The move will help it to clear regulatory hurdles.Other Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Red Hat (RHT  -  Free Report) each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

252,AVGO,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of long-delayed acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems. The Singapore-based company paid almost $5.5 million for Brocade that will now operate as an indirect subsidiary led by Jack Rondoni. The deal boosts Broadcom’s position in the storage area networking space.The transaction announced in November 2016 faced strict regulatory hurdles in the United States, the European Union (EU) and China. Interoperability and the misuse of competitors’ information were the primary objections to the deal.Notably, Brocade competes directly with Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), while the company is a supplier for the same. Hence, Cisco was evidently apprehensive about disclosure of confidential information to its competitor.Brocade Sold Assets to Gain ApprovalIn order to satisfy regulators, Brocade divested its Ruckus Wireless and ICX Switch business to ARRIS for $800 million in cash. These businesses directly competed with Cisco.Moreover, Brocade sold its data-center switching, routing and analytics business to Extreme Networks Inc. (EXTR  -  Free Report) for $55 million. Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) | Broadcom Limited QuoteFinally, Broadcom won the approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in July after it agreed to build a firewall to prevent misuse of Cisco’s information. Moreover, the company also agreed to separate the production facility currently working for Cisco.Further, FTC will be appointing someone to monitor Broadcom-Brocade for five years to ensure that Cisco’s information is safe. The period may be extended for another five years.Redomicile Plan to Help Qualcomm BidEarlier this month, Broadcom announced its intent to redomicile in the United States. The company is currently incorporated in Singapore with headquarters there as well as in San Jose, CA.The redomiciling will help Broadcom to aggressively pursue the Qualcomm bid that was recently rejected. Qualcomm believes that the current offer undervalues the company. It is also uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.We note that being an overseas-based company, Broadcom is subjected to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).The redomiciling will at least make the regulatory environment smooth for Broadcom, which remains committed to pursue the Qualcomm bid.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBroadcom has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Smart Global Holdings Inc. (SGH  -  Free Report) is a stock worth considering in the sector. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

253,AVGO,"The U.S. telecom industry remained rather subdued last week. Nevertheless, a few developments are worth taking note of.T-Mobile US Inc.’s (TMUS  -  Free Report) rating was recently upgraded to Ba2 (in certain metrics) by credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service. Moreover, the company’s rating outlook has been confirmed stable.Moody's upgraded T-Mobile US' corporate family rating (CFR) to Ba2 from Ba3.The company’s probability of default rating was upgraded to Ba2-PD from Ba3-PD. Its senior secured rating was upgraded to Baa2 from Baa3 and its senior unsecured rating to Ba2 from Ba3. The Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating (SGL-1) was affirmed.Qualcomm Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) board of directors rejected the recent $130-billion (includes $25 billion of net debt) takeover offer by Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report). The offer was turned down on grounds of inadequacy, as Qualcomm is currently a leading player in the mobile chipset market. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) is reportedly planning to make its unlimited services more attractive by offering free access to online video streaming service provider, Hulu. Basic services of Hulu include TV series, movies, original content and other programming with limited or no commercials. Sprint carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(ATC TIPL, formerly Viom) — plans to add 20,000 communications sites.On the earnings front, Windstream Holdings Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report) reported disappointing results in third-quarter 2017. The company’s bottom and top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Leading Canadian telecom operator TELUS Corp.

The merger could have created pressure on T-Mobile US’ credit metrics, on materialization. The company’s innovative network expansion methodologies and improvement plans, stellar network performance, deployment of LTE-U technology and offering of attractive unlimited data are key factors behind the upgraded ratings.  (Read more: T-Mobile US Upgraded to Ba2 by Moody's, Outlook Stable)2.  Broadcom’s successful takeover of Qualcomm could have been the biggest tech deal. If the deal were to go through, it would have made Broadcom the world's third-largest semiconductor company, behind Intel and Samsung. However,we believe Broadcom might have to raise the value of the buyout offer to impress Qualcomm’s shareholders. We currently await updates on this front if Broadcom raises its offer or engages in a proxy battle with Qualcomm.  (Read more: Qualcomm Rejects Broadcom's $130B Takeover Offer)3.    Sprint’s offering of Hulu is expected to be officially launched on Nov, 17 and will be available to new and existing Sprint unlimited subscribers.

The offering is anticipated to strengthen Sprint’s position in the already competitive domestic wireless industry.  (Read more: Sprint's Unlimited Plan to Offer Free Access to Hulu)4.    American Tower is optimistic about the expansion of mobile broadband services in India, with participation in the Digital India initiative. The company generates more than 50% of the organic core revenue growth from its Indian, EMEA and Latin American markets. American Tower is hopeful that the addition of these two high-quality portfolios will contribute to long-term leasing growth in India. The country’s leading mobile operators are presently focused on accelerating their 4G network deployments.  (Read more: American Tower to Acquire Tower Business From Telcos in India)5.    Net income of TELUS on a GAAP basis was approximately $294.89 million, increasing 4.2% year over year.

254,AVGO,"The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, recently announced that its decision on the proposed merger between Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) may come in 2018.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP.In June 2017, the EC launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will conduct an in-depth probe to assess if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.Earlier, the EC had twice halted its review of the deal -- once in June and again in August. Initially, Qualcomm had anticipated that the buyout deal would be closed by the end of 2017. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.On Oct 5, 2017, the U.S. mobile chipset giant had submitted its new proposal to the EC. According to Reuters, “Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.”Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August, Elliot Management had disclosed to having accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Also, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), which submitted a $135 billion (including debt) to acquire Qualcomm in Nov. 6, 2017.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have gained 25.2%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.5% over the past 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

255,AVGO,"Markets eked out gains on Monday to close slightly higher. While tax woes continued to worry investors, gains were capped further after shares of General Electric plummeted to a five year low after releasing weak EPS guidance for 2018. However, gains for Boeing and Mattel boosted the markets. Meanwhile, the investors closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia. Speaking in Manila Trump commented that he would make an important announcement regarding trade on Wednesday in Washington.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased a little less than 0.1%, to close at 23,439.70. The S&P 500 Index (INX) gained 0.1% to close at 2,584.84. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,757.60, gaining 0.1%. A total of 6.2 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.7 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. The CBOE VIX increased 1.9% to close at 11.5.Tax Woes Keep Investors on TenterhooksLate last week, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Also, per House Republicans, the top individual tax rate would be 39.6%, whereas the Senate version puts the ceiling rate at 38.5%. Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans weighed on investor sentiment.The two versions of the tax Bill will be scrutinized and debated upon before reaching on a conclusion. Such a confused state of affairs dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, market watchers speculated that no formal decision was likely on the tax Bill before Thanksgiving, with some even speculating such a decision would only take place beyond Christmas. Such events dampened investor sentiment and capped gains for the markets.However, market analysts commented that major indexes are still trading at appreciably high levels. Such a run has been largely due to stupendous corporate earnings and a burgeoning U.S. economy.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow eked out meager gains, advancing 17.49 points to end in positive territory. Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) contributed to most of the gains for the Dow. The aero-giant’s shares gained 0.6% after it won a contract from Dubai airline Emirates for a provisional order of about 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. This deal is worth a sizeable $15.1 billion. BA possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) tanked 7.2% to hit a five year low after the company announced weaker-than-expected EPS guidance for 2018. For the next year, the electric giant expects EPS in the range of $1.00-$1.07, which is significantly lower than the 2017 guidance of $1.05-$1.10 a share. The company also reduced its dividend by 50% in a bid to focus more on health care, aviation and energy business segments. Such a decline in the shares of GE weighed both on the Dow and the S&P 500.The S&P 500 gained 0.1% to end in the green. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, eight ended in positive territory. Shares of Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) surged 20.7% after Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) approached the former for a potential takeover. Such gains for the toymaker boosted the S&P 500. However, gains for the benchmark was capped after shares of GE declined and weighed on the S&P 500.Meanwhile, Nasdaq also gained 0.1% to end in the green. The tech-heavy index was boosted by gains for the shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), which advanced 0.2%, 0.3% and 1.6%, respectively.Investors Have a Keen Eye on Trump’s Visit to AsiaMarket watchers closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia. On his 13-day visit to the continent, Trump has given hints regarding a ‘major statement’ on trade that he is expected to make on Wednesday in Washington. Speaking in Manila at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, Trump also mentioned that that he would announce details regarding the meetings he had with supreme leaders of China, South Korea and ‘lots of other places’, refusing to divulge any further details about the announcement.Stocks That Made HeadlinesCenovus Sells Weyburn Assets to Whitecap ResourcesCenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery operation, Weyburn oil facility in Saskatchewan to Whitecap Resources Inc, based in western Canada.

256,AVGO,"Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) board of directors rejected the recent $130-billion (includes $25 billion of net debt) takeover offer by Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report). Qualcomm turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently a leading player in the chipset market.  Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.2 billion against which Broadcom’s paltry $105-billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.The proposal was forwarded on Nov 6, 2017, wherein Broadcom offered to acquire Qualcomm’s outstanding shares for a consideration of $60 in cash and $10 in Broadcom stock.Qualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Chipset Sales Drive GrowthQualcomm’s updated Snapdragon processors and applications have helped the company retain leadership in the global wireless baseband chipset market. Qualcomm is teaming up with Verizon Communications Inc and Novatel Wireless for 5G NR mmWave technology trial. This marks Qualcomm’s leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity.Moreover, the company’s foray into areas like automotive, networking and mobile computing are favorable for prospects within the semiconductor industry. Such strategic business moves can be attributed to the shipment of approximately 220 million chipsets (up 4.1% year over year). This was also above the midpoint of 215 million, which was the fourth-quarter chipset outlook issued previously by management.The company is also confident about its ability to create significant additional value for stockholders, on the back of continuous growth in segments and the transition to 5G network.Legal Disputes Weigh on QualcommQualcomm has been facing regulatory proceedings of late. The company continues to receive charges for unfair business practices and licensing royalty payments. In May 2017, Qualcomm settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited by paying $940 million. In December 2016, South Korea's regulatory authority for economic competition, Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), imposed an administrative fine of approximately 1.03 trillion South Korean Won (approximately $865 million) on Qualcomm due to unfair business practices. Meanwhile, the ongoing $1-billion lawsuit dispute with tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) continues to get bitter with time, which is affecting the company’s margins.Accordingly, Qualcomm’s fourth-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings plummeted 90%. The company's fourth-quarter revenues dipped 5%. Qualcomm’s full-year revenues fell 5% to $22.3 billion. Additionally, full-year earnings per share on a GAAP basis declined 57% to $1.65. Notably, its ongoing dispute and the related actions undertaken by Apple and its contract manufacturers have affected the company’s third and fourth quarters as well as fiscal 2017 GAAP and Non-GAAP results. Moreover, the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee, who failed to pay royalties due in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, has affected the company’s margins. Qualcomm expects these licensees to continue to take such actions in the future until the disputes are resolved.Bottom LineBroadcom’s successful takeover of Qualcomm might have been the biggest tech deal. The combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm would have created the world's third-largest semiconductor company, lagging Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung.We believe Broadcom might have to raise the value of the buyout offer to impress Qualcomm’s shareholders. We currently await updates on this front if Broadcom raises its offer or engages in a proxy battle with Qualcomm.Price Performance Qualcomm portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of the company have returned 23.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 4.5%.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

257,AVGO,"Early news to start the week ahead of today’s opening bell begins with a dividend cut to one of the U.S.'s biggest companies: General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) has announced it is slashing its dividend in half, to 12 cents per share. This comes as a surprise to much of the market, although under new leadership — CEO John Flannery replaced Jeff Immelt on August 1st of this year — we see number-crunchers at the company Thomas Edison once helped found seeing too much capital going out the door when it ought to be put to use internally.An investor meeting at GE commences at this hour to discuss this move, which had actually put GE shares in the green by roughly 1.5% this morning before reversing trend and sending the stock down 1.6%. Year to date, GE shares are down almost 33%. Also, guidance for full-year 2018 have been ratcheted down, from $1.16 per share previously to a range of $1.00-1.07 today.Singles Day OutperformsOver the weekend, while Americans celebrated Veterans Day (mostly by watching football and drinking beer), China procured the “single” largest shopping day in history: Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) alone brought in $25.3 billion on Saturday, with other Chinese online merchants such as JD.com (JD  -  Free Report) now joining in the fun. Compare this with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime Day, which most recently brought in a record amount of revenue for its 30-hour sale: $1 billion.What began as more or less a protest against commercial holidays like Valentine’s Day, “Singles Day,” which began in 2009, is now more broadly known the world over as the “Global Shopping Festival.” As this marketing bonanza continues to grow year after year, we also see some truly remarkable figures, such as 90% — NINETY PERCENT — of Singles Day purchases having been made via mobile. If this doesn’t inspire retailers to go strong into mobile sales from this point forward, they’re clearly just not paying attention.Markets Lower on Asia WeaknessIndexes in Asia overnight sold off, including in Japan and South Korea. We also see selling pressure on the British pound as Brexit processes make their way through the python. Calls for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to step down after just a year at 10 Downing Street — with the re-emergence of “fringier” characters on the British political scene like former Mayor of London Boris Johnson — now illustrate the possible reality of a “hard Brexit” analysts had been fearing since the surprise EU secession vote a year and a half ago.Japan’s sell-off continues from what looks essentially like a technical move, following multi-year highs in its market tapping out late last week. The Nikkei index fell by the largest amount since early April, without much to assign blame to but profit-taking and valuation correction. The Japanese yen is increasing in value against virtually al other major currencies, which may create market headwinds as Japanese products and services grow more expensive on the global market.Qualcomm Rejects BroadcomAs widely expected, Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has rejected rival chip-maker Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) offer to buy the similarly-sized company for $70 per share. Qualcomm naturally considers the offer too low, and also cited present regulatory uncertainties as reasons for the thumbs-down to Broadcom. We await a follow-up move from Broadcom, but without any indication whether the company will make a more generous offer or simply let this go.

259,AVGO,"Yesterday, after the bell, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report) announced solid results, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9% on the top line and 41.5% on the bottom line. Both numbers were up strong double-digits from the same quarter last year.The Gaming segment that contributes more than two-thirds of its total volume, grew 25%, as the company saw strength across regions and form factors. Management also called out strength in the Nintendo Switch console and cryptocurrencies as drivers. The Data Center segment, which accounts for most of the balance, saw the strongest growth of 109%, testimony to NVIDIA’s growing position at cloud service providers and prowess in high performance computing (HPC). The emerging Professional Visualization segment grew 15%, as VR adoption at defense and automotive customers increased and demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations and grew.Coming off the strong results, management raised the quarterly dividend and promised to return $1.25 billion in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases.Guidance was also encouraging with revenue expectations of $2.65 billion for the January quarter bettering the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 billion.Investors responded to the news by sending share prices up 3.2% in extended trading. But is the stock a buy at these levels? Let’s find out:The share price has increased 8.7% over the past month compared to the industry’s 13.6%. The S&P 500 has however has grown much slower, at 1.9%. Over the past year, the S&P 500 has gained steadily to trade close to its 52-week high, but NVIDIA shares have been far more volatile. Significantly, its median value of 94.3% is higher than the S&P 500’s 91.6% although both NVDA and the S&P 500 are currently trading considerably higher than their median levels.The industry has a much lower median value, although it is currently trading closer to its 52-week high. These comparisons seem to indicate that there is room for further upside in NVDA shares. P/EThe forward 12 months price-to-earnings ratio for NVDA is currently 53.3X compared to the S&P 500 average of 18.8X and the industry average of 20.0X. The high, low and median values are also higher. Moreover, the trend lines indicate that NVDA is clearly overvalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry. P/SThe trailing 12 months price to sales ratio tells the same story. The P/S ratio for NVDA is currently 15.6X, which is higher than the S&P 500’s 3.15 but much lower than the X industry’s 6.25. The median of 3.34 is slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s 3.4 and the industry’s 5.0X. The highs and lows also indicate that NVDA is overvalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry. P/CFIn terms of cash flow, NVDA’s valuation of 56.4X is much higher than the S&P 500’s 23.1X and the industry’s 25.0X. Moreover, the highs, lows and median values are also much higher. Look at Its Peers…While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) is NVIDIA’s closest competitor when it comes to GPUs, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) is the one that it is increasingly pitted against as both companies look for growth in the data center, self-driving cars and other IoT. So let’s compare the two first.Intel’s current P/E based on forward 12 months earnings is just 14.2X, its price to sales ratio is 3.6X and its price to cash flow is 18.4X. So NVDA is obviously overvalued compared to Intel. A comparison with another semiconductor company Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) shows that this chipmaker has a P/E based on forward 12 months earnings of 21.7X, a price to sales ratio of 6.7X and a price to cash flow of 21.6X. Here too, NVDA looks overvalued. ConclusionIt’s true that NVDA has a solid pipeline that should continue to generate strong growth for years to come. But given the strong competition from companies like Intel and ongoing consolidation in the space, it could soon see many other competitors in Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), etc.So the high valuation with respect to the S&P 500, the industry in which it operates and a couple of its semiconductor peers, is good reason for caution. Or at least, it’s good reason to go for Intel or Texas Instruments instead. Both these companies have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here - that’s better than the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) assigned to NVIDIA.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

260,AVGO,"The Dow notched up minor gains over the week, before ultimately declining on concerns related to Trump’s tax proposals. Mergers and acquisitions related reports helped the index notch up fresh records even though movements continued to occur within a tight band. Ultimately, prospects of a delay in the implementation of tax cuts proposals dragged the index downward toward the end of the week.Last Week’s PerformanceThe index gained 0.1% last Friday on the back of strong earnings performance from Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) Better-than-expected earnings and favorable quarterly outlook from the tech giant led all the three key U.S. indexes to new record highs despite mixed jobs data. Additionally, the ISM services index hit its highest level in more than 12 years, which in turn boosted the broader markets.The index gained 0.5% over last week. Benchmarks closed in positive territory for the week after the Fed chose not to hike rates this month. Moreover, the Fed offered a positive view about the U.S. economy and said that it has been improving at a ‘solid rate.’Also, House Republicans finally revealed a detailed framework for the new tax policy, which also boosted sentiments. Additionally, upbeat earnings results also led the markets higher.The Dow This WeekThe index inched up by 0.04% on Monday following news of a possible merger between Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). This is the 26th trading day when all-time high was achieved by all the three key U.S. indexes in 2017, marking the highest number of record highs achieved in a single year. Additionally, optimism over President Trump’s tax cut plans and upbeat third quarter earnings also boosted investor sentiment.The index once gained 0.04% on Tuesday to finish at a fresh record high. Weak profit forecasts from key stocks pulled the consumer discretionary sector downward, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. Also, decline in bond yields weighed on financials and concerns over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans resulted in a small-cap stock selloff.Meanwhile, reports emerged that The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) was in talks recently with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) to acquire a large part of the latter’s entertainment business. Although, there is no certainty whether the deal will go through, shares of Walt Disney increased 1% following this development. Gains in Walt Disney boosted the blue-chip index to close on a new high.The index increased 0.03% on Wednesday, settling at yet another all-time high even as Apple’s market value jumped over the $900 billion mark for the first time ever. However, concerns remained over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans after Republicans lost elections to the governorship of Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday. These factors, along with declining bond yields weighed on bank stocks.The index declined by 0.4% on Thursday following concerns over a likely delay in the Trump administration’s tax cut plans. The Senate Finance Committee released a tax plan which aims to reduce corporate tax rate to 20% but not before 2019, in contrast to the 2018 deadline proposed by the House Republicans.Although, investors turned jittery following concerns that tax cut may be delayed, markets curtailed some of the day’s declines after the House Ways and Committee passed a bill to reframe the tax reforms.Components Moving the Index Disney reported negative earnings surprise in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 after beating the estimate in the trailing three quarters. Moreover, the company’s top-line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter.The company’s adjusted earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.07 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 and also decreased 3% year over year. Moreover, revenues came in at $12,779 million, down 3% year over year and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,149 million.The company’s disappointing results in the quarter was primarily caused by dismal performance of Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products & Interactive Media, which overshadowed growth at Parks and Resorts.Even though the company reported dismal results, shares inched up nearly 1% during the after-hour trading session on Nov 10 after the company announced that it has sealed a deal with Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy.Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Canadian unit is progressing with its shale play development in the East Kaybob region located in Duvernay formation of west-central Alberta. It will be the company's first shale play development in Canada.Of the 330,000 acres in the formation, Chevron Canada holds 70% operating stakes, where it plans to start development in about 55,000 acres of the liquid-rich Duvernay. It has been almost eight years since the company registered its presence in Duvernay and is now one the biggest landholders in the basin.Chevron used its experience of operating in the North American shale assets during appraisal drilling for the project. The company has yet to provide the financial details of the project, which is expected to come online during the second half of 2019.Canadian shale plays – like Duvernay and Montney – continue to remain attractive to players like Chevron as it is much cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in these formations compared to the costly oil sands. Apart from the assets in the Duvernay formation, Chevron has stakes in the Liard and Horn River basins located in Western Canada. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This deal is among the several agreements concluded during President Trump’s state visit to China.According to the state owned company, which is a lessor of airplanes to China’s airlines, the deal includes the supply of 40 B-777s and B-787s as well as 260 B-737s. Boeing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).However, some analysts opined that this agreement could overlap with a similar 300 plane deal struck during the Chinese president’s visit to the United States in 2015. The deal concluded at that time encompassed the supply of 50 wide body aircraft and 190 B-737s as well as the lease of another 60 B-737s.General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) has inked three engine and aviation agreements worth $3.5 billion with Chinese partners during President Trump’s state visit to China, which is aimed at boosting trade between the United States and China. These agreements were finalized in the presence of Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping.Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) GE signed a $1.4 billion deal for engines and repairs with Juneyao Airlines Co Ltd.

Investors have possibly priced in the impact of such tax relief measures and any unwelcome news will lead to losses in the short term. However, the current market rally is mostly a product of a resilient U.S. economy and strong earnings performances. It is likely that stocks will return to their winning ways after a brief interlude caused by such tax plan jitters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

262,AVGO,"Believe it or not, Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) is looking to buy Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), at least according to people familiar with the matter. But if the rumors are right, the company could pay $70-$80 a share in cash and stock, valuing the company at over a $100 billion, the largest semiconductor deal ever. It’s possible that regulators will not approve the deal on competitive considerations, but just in case they don’t, there’s much going for both the companies-  Rationale for the DealThere are a number of reasons why the deal makes sense.  First, Qualcomm is one of the largest semiconductor companies, as is Broadcom, so their combination will create a semiconductor giant like Intel or Samsung with greater resources to tap emerging opportunities.Second, being the leading supplier of modem chips having also made some progress in 5G, Qualcomm brings Broadcom important technology to round out its portfolio. Not only that – there is very little product overlap despite the fact that both target the market for mobile devices. Smartphone growth rates have been coming down recently because of increased penetration, but other markets like IoT, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and cloud computing continue to emerge. A combined company with much greater product breadth, a larger client roster and scope for greater integration of technology should do better in this landscape.   Third, Qualcomm has a large number of standard essential patents that it licenses on the basis of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. It also has several other patents that do not form part of standards but that it bundles with standard essential patents. So on the one hand, Qualcomm shouldn’t have to license all patents at standard essential rates, while on the other, it needs to offer greater clarity on the amount it’s charging for the non-standard technology that forms part of the bundle. It also needs to allow companies to build or second source their own non-standard technology.The practice has drawn ire from a number of foreign governments and now, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and its suppliers have ganged up against it. What’s worse, Apple is roping in others like Samsung, so Qualcomm’s legal problems are mounting. Apple phones use Qualcomm technology, but Apple and its suppliers have also stopped paying Qualcomm on this pretext while second sourcing from Intel.This has of course been a big blow to Qualcomm’s revenue and profits. The acquisition has the potential to bring another big semiconductor player on Qualcomm’s side. It can also lead to a resolution of the conflict.Fourth, Broadcom management has a lot of experience with acquisitions, which have been the most consistent pillar of growth for the company. The biggest of these was the Avago-Broadcom merger, which retained the Broadcom name post closure. Before that, it made more than 50 smaller acquisitions over the course of a decade. Management is also known for cost control, so the combined entity may see greater fiscal discipline, which could be a good way to extract profits.Fifth, the chances of prolonged litigation have pressured Qualcomm’s share prices, so the deal will be a good return on investment for shareholders.    Possible Deal BreakersBoth Qualcomm and Broadcom are in the middle of other acquisitions. Qualcomm is looking to buy NXP, the shareholders of which are asking for a higher price. Broadcom is trying to acquire Brocade  (a much smaller deal). There could be many glitches along the way.   The second concern is regulatory. Qualcomm is quite a dominant player in its own field and Broadcom further expands that field. In a way, since they aren’t competitors, there may not be anti-competitive concerns. But on the other hand, the two together will be a mobile chip making powerhouse, which may be something regulators will consider.  Last WordsThese may be some of the biggest acquisitions we have talked about, but consolidation in the space will likely continue in the foreseeable future because chip development and verification isn’t getting any cheaper. Also, companies generally compete on their ability to deliver energy efficient chips that are also more powerful, fast and durable while being cheap. This naturally benefits larger players that can invest heavily in R&D and then manufacture on scale.On the other hand, some of the biggest propositions have been shot down by regulators, such as Applied Materials’ attempt to buy Tokyo Electron, or more recently, Lam Research’s (LRCX  -  Free Report) attempt to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report).Broadcom has apparently been trying to acquire Qualcomm for some time, but its previous attempts weren’t attractive to Qualcomm management.

263,AVGO,"Per a recent report by Forbes, U.S. mobile chipset giant, Qualcomm Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) is facing a few problems.In October 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with NXP to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would bel paying $110 per NXP share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.Per the report, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP’s outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to just 6.9% in August. Notably, at least 70% of NXP’s total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.Meanwhile, in June 2017, the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC), launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in-depth if the deal could lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has a 90-working-days’ time limit, until Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company’s business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have decreased 12.11% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.51% in the last three months. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

264,AVGO,"It seems that Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) is on track to unveil its latest iPhone right before the holiday season.Per media reports, Apple will host its product announcement event on Sep 12. Apple usually holds a big event in September to reveal its latest offerings, which start retailing a week after the event.Reportedly, at this year’s event, Apple will be announcing three new phones. iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are updates to its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions unveiled last year. In addition to these, a mega edition, widely labeled as iPhone 8, will likely be introduced to the world, per reports.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteApple’s Mega iPhone For some time now, Apple’s mega edition phone has caught the fancy of one and all. Apple is likely to make a big innovation leap with iPhone 8. The phone is rumored to have features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C) and higher storage options. The camera is likely to be far better than its predecessors.Reportedly, iPhone 8 will be the first of its kind to support OLED display. Per reports, the company has ordered nearly 100 million OLED screens from Samsung Electronics. OLED display is being increasingly adopted as it comes with improved brightness, contrast and efficiency compared with LCD or Plasma displays. Television sets have long been equipped with OLED displays. Smartphones are fast catching up now.The revolutionary iPhone released first in June 2007 had changed the world forever. The iPhone was the first phone to have a touch screen and was a ""breakthrough internet device"".  The original iPhone was powered by an ARM-based 1176JZ (F)-S processor and had a PowerVR MBX Lite 3D graphics chip. It had a 1400mAH battery.Upon release, the phone received a terrific response. Following that, the success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled. Apple has sold over a billion iPhones across the globe. However, over the past few quarters, Apple’s iPhone sales have been marred by increasing competition from cheaper handsets like Oppo and Vivo.Since the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared to the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 826% while the industry saw a rally of 382.3%.Delay Rumors Losing FizzLast month, it was widely reported that there could be a delay in the launch as the company faces technological issues involving fingerprint and 3D sensors. Consequently, analysts had lowered their iPhone shipment expectations for the quarter ending September.Expectations regarding the upcoming iPhone 8 are humongous, as it will mark the tenth anniversary of the first iPhone. Analysts have already dubbed sales of iPhone 8 as a “super cycle.” Hence, any delay can severely impact Apple’s quarterly results.The latest developments assuage concerns regarding a delay in the launch to a great extent. Per a Barron’s report, “the consensus sales estimate for Apple’s fiscal year ending September 2018 has climbed to 247 million units from 239 million since the end of March. That would mark 14% growth from the current fiscal year.”Also, Apple had given an upbeat guidance along with its third quarter fiscal 2017 results for the quarter ending in September, thereby widely alleviating fears of a delay in the launch of the next edition iPhone. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company forecasts revenues in a range of $49–$52 billion compared with $46.9 billion reported in the year-ago quarter when it released iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.Plus, if we go by Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) recent results, reported a couple of days back, the concerns are further mitigated. Broadcom supplies chips for iPhones. The company recently reported better-than-expected third quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company’s Wireless Communications (28.7% of total revenue) revenues were up 27.3% year over year and 11.6% quarter over quarter to $1.28 billion.Broadcom’s top line benefited from the rise in production volumes of the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s (Apple) next-gen platform (iPhone). Management noted that increase in total dollar content in the upcoming platform drove revenues.Further, management noted that Wireless Communications revenues are expected to grow strongly in the fourth quarter, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. The upside is likely to be driven by higher dollar content in the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s next-gen platform. This implies that iPhone 8 will be up for sale in September.Will Price Prove to be a Deterrent to Sales?Nonetheless, it is the price point that might prove to be an impediment as observed by various analysts. Reportedly, iPhone 8 could be priced more than $1,000 dollars. Many analysts argue that the existing iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions with 256GB storage carry price tags of $849 and $969, respectively. So a price tag north of $1000 should not be considered unreasonable for a fully redesigned OLED iPhone 8.iPhone (4GB model) was priced at $499 way back in 2007, which was unheard of back then. Yet, Apple scored a home run with iPhone. The power of Apple’s fan base cannot be undermined.Other Things to Watch Out For at the EventApart from the new iPhones, per media reports, Apple could launch a new Apple watch. Then there could a new Apple 4K TV. Apple is likely to speak at length about iOS 11 and new MacOS and watchOS.At the WWDC earlier this year, Apple gave a sneak peek into its AR efforts. The company also displayed an augmented reality (AR) tool called ARKit. We expect more on this at the September event along with HomePod.At present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report) and The Trade Desk, Inc. (TTD  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

265,AVGO,"The U.S. equity market remained skittish over the last few days as the nation faced one of the worst tropical storms in 50 years — Hurricane Harvey. In addition to catastrophic flooding, the Category 4 storm ravaged properties and caused widespread damage to various industries. As sublime tensions within and outside the country continue to raise an element of caution, investors are on the lookout for ‘cash cow’ stocks that will offer high returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products.

266,AVGO,"Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) is collaborating with The Cornucopia Project and ripe.io to aid crop quality, yield and profitability enhancement initiatives.The Cornucopia Project is a Peterborough, NH-based nonprofit organization that conducts agricultural and garden projects for students from elementary to high school.San Francisco, CA-based ripe.io focuses on integrating Blockchain consisting of a framework of distributed ledgers, application program interface (API), Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors, and connected food supply chain workflow with the food system.We observe that Analog Devices shares have rallied 9.2% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 15.2%.Deal DetailsThe collaboration aims to train students and farmers on how to monitor crop quality as they move from “Farm to Fork,” thus facilitating improved decision making. While financing will be done by all three, Analog Devices and ripe.io are in charge of technical training.Most importantly, Analog Devices will make available a prototype version of its crop monitoring solution for use in the project. It is a sensor-to-cloud, IoT solution that boosts farmers with improved decision making on the basis of collected knowledge from near-real-time monitoring.ripe.io, on the other hand, is providing its block chain technology aiming to develop a fresh produce supply chain with farmers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, food service and end consumers.Kevin Carlin, Vice President, Automation, Energy and Sensors at Analog Devices stated that the project is an expansion of the company’s ‘Internet of Tomatoes’ program that aims at improving farmers’ decision making on farming cycle and quality of produce.Analog Devices, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Analog Devices, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Analog Devices, Inc. QuoteOur TakeWe believe the move is intended to increase the popularity of Analog Devices’ crop monitoring solution offering.Funding training projects does initially act as a drain on cash balance and weighs on margins but can be fruitful in the long term if used tactfully. Given that Analog Devices has a strong market position across industrial, communications infrastructure and consumer markets, moves like this could help it attract new customers and keep the existing ones hooked on its services.The company has been strengthening its balance sheet, expanding margins and improving cash generation capacity through continued focus on product innovation. This is required especially when it’s increasingly facing tough competition from the likes of Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report).Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

267,AVGO,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) reported impressive third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Earnings were $4.10 per share in the reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. The figure surged 43% from the year-ago quarter and 11.2% sequentially.Non-GAAP revenues from continuing operations were $4.47 billion, which increased 17.5% from the year-ago quarter and 6.3% on a sequential basis. The figure was in line with management’s guidance and better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The strong top-line growth was driven by robust performance by the wireless business, which is expected to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter. Higher industrial re-sales also drove revenues. Foxconn was the only direct customer that contributed more than 10% revenues in the reported quarter.Broadcom now expects fourth-quarter revenue growth in the double-digit range on a year-over-year basis, much similar to the second and third quarter. Gross margin is expected to contract slightly due to unfavorable product mix (higher mix of low margin wireless business). Broadcom Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Broadcom Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Broadcom Limited QuoteHowever, management adopted a cautious stance over growth from end-markets in the long haul. Broadcom operates in relatively matured end markets that are likely to reach closer to GDP rates or in the low single digits over the long term. The company believes that change in market share will not have much positive impact on top-line growth. However, technological superiority will help the company gain more content that will drive revenues.Nevertheless, Broadcom believes that the current growth rate will be difficult to sustain over the long term. Notably, the stock has returned a massive 44.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 26.3% gain of the industry it belongs to.     Segment RevenuesWired Infrastructure revenues (49.5% of total revenue) were $2.21 billion, up 7.1% from the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenues increased 4.5%, almost in line with management’s guidance.Revenues were driven by seasonally strong demand for set-top box products as well as merchant and custom silicon products from datacenters. Strong adoption of Jericho and Tomahawk helped the company gain strong market position in the network connectivity business.However, management witnessed softness in demand for optical and broadband access products from Chinese customers.Wireless Communications (28.7% of total revenue) revenues were up 27.3% year over year and 11.6% quarter over quarter to $1.28 billion. The top line benefited from the rise in production volumes of the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s (Apple) next-gen platform (iPhone). Management noted that increase in total dollar content in the upcoming platform drove revenues.Enterprise Storage (16.5% of total revenue) revenues increased 39.5% from the year-ago quarter and 3.2% sequentially to $735 million. Revenues benefited from strong demand for the company’s Hard Disk Drive (HDD) products.Industrial & other (5.3% of total revenue) revenues increased 17.8% year over year and 6.3% sequentially to $238 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues from Intellectual Property (IP). Management noted that re-sales of its industrial products was significantly strong, which is anticipated to continue.Operating DetailsGross margin expanded 290 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and 20 bps sequentially to 63.3% owing to favorable product mix. The figure was 30 bps better than management’s guidance.Operating expenses declined 5% year over year and 3.9% to $768 million, lower than management’s guidance of approximately $787 million.Operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 410 bps from the year-ago quarter driven by lower research & development expenses (down 290 bps) and selling, general & administrative expenses (down 110 bps). Sequentially, operating expenses declined 180 bps.Operating margin expanded 690 bps from the year-ago quarter and 200 bps from the previous quarter to 46.1%. The figure surpassed management’s long-term target of 45%.    LiquidityAs of Jul 30, 2017, cash & cash equivalents were $5.5 billion as compared with $4.3 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $13.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, almost unchanged from the previous quarter.Broadcom generated cash flow from operations of $1.7 billion, up $73 million from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $255 million, slightly down from $256 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was almost $1.4 billion (31% of net revenues).AcquisitionBroadcom continues to proceed with the acquisition of Brocade, which is anticipated to be concluded in the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2017. Most recently, the company received conditional approval in China.Management still expects Brocade to generate approximately $1.3 billion plus in revenues and $900 million plus of EBITDA on a run rate post integration.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $4.8 billion (+/- $75 million). The revenue figure reflects almost 7% sequential growth.Management anticipates Wired Infrastructure business revenues to decline sequentially due to seasonal weakness in demand for broadband access products industry wide.Wireless Communications revenues are anticipated to grow strongly in the fourth quarter, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. The upside is likely to be driven by higher dollar content in the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s next-gen platform.Despite delayed shipments to this large customer, management expects first-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues to be similar to that of the current quarter.Moreover, Broadcom expects sharp decline in demand for its HDD products, driven by the start of an anticipated correction in a hard disk drive market. This will hurt Enterprise Storage revenues in the current quarter. However, strong growth expectation in the server and storage connectivity business will fully offset this negative impact from HDDs. Enterprise Storage revenues are projected to report double-digit growth.Management expects Industrial re-sales to continue to trend up strongly in the fourth quarter.Gross margin is anticipated to be 63% (+/- 1%), while operating expenses are expected to be approximately $780 million.The company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $230 million.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

270,AVGO,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.82%. Earnings surged almost 46% from the year-ago quarter and 1.7% sequentially to $3.69 per share, driven by solid top-line growth.Non-GAAP revenues from continuing operations were $4.20 billion, which was better than management’s guidance and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.10 billion. The figure increased 17.9% from the year-ago quarter and 1.3% on a sequential basis.For third-quarter fiscal 2017, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $4.45 billion (+/- $75 million). The figure reflects almost 6% sequential growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $4.44 billion.Broadcom has been one of the consistent performers in the semiconductor space. We note that the company delivered positive earnings surprises in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.34%.Broadcom Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Broadcom Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Broadcom Limited QuoteThe stock has gained 41.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 23% rally of the industry it belongs to. However, we note that the Brocade acquisition is now expected to close in October instead of July. The company cited extended CFIUS review behind the delay. We believe that this will remain an overhang on the stock in the near term.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderBroadcom’s extensive product portfolio serves multiple applications within four primary end markets – wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial & others. The company’s focus on multiple target markets and geographies mitigates operating risks and lessens exposure to volatility in any single market.We note that seasonal strength in broadband access and sustained cloud data center spending is positive. Moreover, the company's expanding portfolio is a key driver. Further, anticipated content increase at Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) upcoming iPhone will drive earnings growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Broadcom is likely to beat earnings in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.

271,AVGO,"Q2 earnings season is finally wrapping up, and for the most part, results have been strong across the board. In fact, we’ve seen broad-based growth reaching the double digit level for the second quarter in a row, an abundance of earnings surprises, and favorable trends on the revisions front.At this point, well over 90% of the S&P 500 members have reported their latest results, but there are still several marquee reports to anticipate. Indeed, the upcoming week will include a handful of market favorites and bellwether brands, meaning that investors will need to be paying attention.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week—one of the last busy weeks of the earnings season—and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of August 21:·         Salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report)) – August 22 – After Market CloseSalesforce, a cloud computing giant and global leader in customer relations solutions, is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on August 22. While currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments might prove to be challenges, Salesforce remains a dominant industry force with diverse cloud offerings and strong client satisfaction.Heading into its report, Salesforce currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, surprise prediction is difficult; however, the stock does sport an “A” grade for growth, and investors should be pleased with the company’s year-over-year comparisons this quarter. According to our current consensus estimates, Salesforce is expected to report EPS growth of 18.3% and sales growth of 23.5% for its latest fiscal period. ·         HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report)) – August 23 – After Market CloseA result of the 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company into two publicly traded entities, HP Inc. is focused on the brand’s PC and printing products and services. The company is scheduled to post its third-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes on August 23. While the glory days of the PC are long gone, HP’s restructuring initiatives are finally starting to pay off, and its stock has been steadily rising all year.As we approach HP’s report date, the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While its Earnings ESP is at 0.00%, the company does have an “A” grade for Value, which is a bit of a rarity in today’s tech world. HP has also been able to post five-straight quarters of shipment growth, and if it can continue that momentum, it could be another solid report from the legacy PC brand. ·         Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report)) – August 24 – After Market CloseUlta, the nation’s largest beauty retailer, will release its second-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on August 24. A long-time beacon of hope in the struggling retail industry, Ulta has slumped significantly since its last report. Still, the company has a strong earnings surprise track record and holds exciting growth prospects.However, with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -1.69%, it’s clear that analyst sentiment is not strong heading into the report. Current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 24.2% and sales growth of 20.4% this quarter, and investors should keep their eye on the company’s online and same-store sales figures after the results are in. ·         Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report)) – August 24 – After Market CloseBroadcom, a key supplier for Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), will report its third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on August 24. Despite rumors of an iPhone 8 delay, this semiconductor maker has soared more than 43% year-to-date and is looking to add to its streak of 12-straight earnings beats.Broadcom is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth. Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 41.2% and sales growth of 32.6% this quarter, and it will be interesting to note if the company reveals any additional info about the production schedule for the upcoming iPhone.Of course, these are just a few of the nearly two-hundred companies that are expected to report next week. However, these major announcements should provide investors with a better sense of how earnings season is wrapping up across the board.

272,AVGO,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 23. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.6%. Notably, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and came in line once, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 3%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in November 2015 enabled HP to make customized approach for its businesses which was not possible when it operated as a single entity. The company is working on product innovation and differentiation, as well as enhancing the capabilities of the printing business to stabilize its top line.Over the past one year, the company rolled out various models under its PC product lines of EliteBook, Spectre and Pavilion Wave. Apart from this, it is focusing on its pricing actions and marketing and sales activities which have helped in stimulating demand for the company’s PC products in the market.The impact of these initiatives is well indicated by the fact that the company has gained its top position once again by replacing Lenovo, per Gartner’s recently released data on PC shipment for second-quarter 2017. Also, the last-quarter growth in the company’s PC shipments was its fifth quarter of consecutive year-over-year improvement, after several quarters of decline.HP’s efforts to turn around the business have been commendable and seem to be in the right direction as indicated by the results of the last few quarters. We believe that the benefit of the aforementioned initiatives will have a positive impact on the to-be-reported quarterly results also.However, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain concerns. Competition from the likes of Dell, Lenovo and Apple also add to its woes.HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  HP Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HP Inc.

On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 10.3% mainly on the back of higher demand emanating from the U.S. tax season and better-than-expected growth in QuickBooks Online.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIntuit provides financial, accounting and tax preparation as well as software and related services for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals in the United States and internationally.We are positive about the company’s growing SMB exposure and believe that its strategic acquisitions will boost the segment. Increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another catalyst.The company has also restructured business to focus on the QuickBooks services. It expects to continue investing in this portfolio, which might hurt its near-term profitability.Stiff competition from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Software Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit’s tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.Intuit Inc.
