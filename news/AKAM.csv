1,AKAM,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year. GE stock rebounded after falling to multiyear lows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

North America sales rose 3%, bucking three straight quarters of year-over-year declines. The world's largest athletic apparel brand also announced a $15 billion share buyback program. Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%.

Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS.

Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though.

3,AKAM,"While software, semiconductor and internet stocks have enjoyed a productive 2018, cloud computing has had its share of success, too, making First Trust Cloud Computing (SKYY) a leading ETF.Cloud computing is a field that crosses into various industry groups. Companies in IBD's data storage, networking, online retail, enterprise software and other groups are part of the First Trust Cloud Computing portfolio. The ETF breaks down its holdings by software (nearly 39%), internet software and services (14.8%), communications equipment (14.2%) and a few other industries.Only some of the fund's holdings are pure-play cloud companies. First Trust says the holdings are divided among three classes. One is pure plays, another is companies that support cloud providers, and a third type is large companies with broad operations that indirectly use or support cloud computing. That last segment's weight in the portfolio is capped at 10%.With many of the technology giants among its 30 holdings, First Trust Cloud Computing is predominantly a large-cap ETF. The median market capitalization is $40.38 billion. It excludes stocks with less than $100 million in market cap.The largest component is Netflix (NFLX), with more than 7% of the portfolio. Netflix, which started as a DVD rent-by-mail service, is now predominantly a streaming video service. The stock is up more than 70% from a breakout to new highs at the start of the year.Amazon.com (AMZN), the No. 2 holding, may be best known for online retail, but it has a bustling cloud business. In its Q1 earnings report, Amazon said its cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, had revenue of $5.44 billion. That was up 49% and above estimates of about $5.3 billion.Other holdings are Akamai Technologies (AKAM), whose technology improves streaming content; network optimization expert F5 Networks (FFIV); Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in customer management software on demand; and Zynga (ZNGA), whose games are played on social networks and mobile devices.The ETF on May 7 cleared the 51.26 buy point of a cup-with-handle base and remains in buy range. The relative strength line is trending higher and near new highs, which can be read as a positive sign.Long term, the ETF has been a solid investment. Shares have climbed about 65% since they broke out to new highs nearly two years ago. That July 2016 breakout was important because the ETF beat resistance around 31 that had dogged shares for more than a year.Most of First Trust Cloud Computing's ascent in that time has been smooth, partly because the broad market saw little volatility in 2017. This year, the ETF has been more volatile, reflecting the general market. Shares have slid 12% and 11% in two corrections this year.RELATED:Active Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexAmazon Stock Jumps As Earnings Slaughter Views, Prime Fee RaisedSalesforce.com Price Target Hiked; MuleSoft To Spur Cloud Computing

Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.The global feedback loop of investor confidence darkened abruptly this week, with last week's late losses in the U.S. reverberating through Asia and Europe on Monday, then slamming back into U.S. stocks as investors also factored in the probability of the Federal Reserve rolling out an accelerated rate hike schedule and news of strict sanctions imposed on one of the largest U.S. banks.The result sent all three major U.S. indexes below support at their 50-day moving averages, and the Dow to a record point loss for the day. The loss Monday was the Dow's  worst one-day percentage decline since August 2011.On Tuesday, Japanese investors kept up the selling as Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunged 4.7%, its worst single-day performance since November 2016.

TAL has held up well so far versus the volatile market, keeping above its 10-week line of support and within a three-month base pattern. Sina had pulled back more than 8% below a 119.30 cup-base buy point, tripping the automatic sell rule.Chip names were sharply mixed.

27,AKAM,"Investors in the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (HACK) woke up Aug. 1 to find their fund had a new name, ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF, and tracks a new index.XIn a stunning development, the fund's advisor, ETF Management Group, had rebranded the entire family of PureFunds ETFs with the ETFMG name, and began following indexes from a new firm called Prime Indexes.Since the change, $36 million has flowed out of HACK, which has $1.1 billion in assets, according to Morningstar Inc. The outflow has coincided with a pullback in cybersecurity stocks and the ETFs that invest in them.While HACK's old and new indexes both track the same securities, there were some slight changes in the new index to conform with a new methodology and improve implied liquidity, said Sam Masucci, chief executive of ETF Management Group. The change had little effect on the share price.The story highlights the issues small asset managers without infrastructure can run into. ETF MG is known as the advisor. It provides the infrastructure for operating the ETF and portfolio management, as well as manages the third-party relationships with outsourced services, such as custodians, legal and auditing. ETF MG has 13 funds on the market.PureFunds was the sponsor, covering most of the costs. Typically, the sponsor's role is branding, marketing and consumer education. ETF MG is now the sponsor.Unlike the ETFs of most small asset managers, when HACK launched in 2014 it was an immediate hit. It quickly gathered $1 billion in assets. Andrew Chanin, Pure Funds' chief executive, was lauded as an ETF wunderkind. Altogether, PureFunds launched eight funds with ETF MG, six of which will continue under the ETF MG name. The other two were closed in July.""People come to us with ideas that we turn into ETFs and operate. We are a comprehensive service company,"" said Masucci. ""Their role is market education. With more than a dozen partners, we've only had one that went this direction.""Masucci said the dispute started in April when the board voted to lower the fund's expense ratio to 0.6% from 0.75% in order to better compete with First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR), which charges 0.6%. At the point, HACK had $950 million in assets, while CIBR had $218 million.""I alerted Andrew, and the Nasdaq and Andrew sued us,"" said Masucci. ""When Andrew sued us he violated provisions in our agreement precluding him from taking any actions that interfered with the operation of the fund. We would have not terminated them if they had not sued us.""Masucci also said that Chanin did not originate the idea for the fund. He said that came from Kris Monaco and his team at ETF Ventures, a division of ISE, which was later acquired by Nasdaq. Masucci said Nasdaq disbanded the ETF Ventures team. Monaco, who was instrumental in creating the index that PureFunds ISE Cyber Security tracked, is one of the founders of Prime Indexes, which is providing the new index for the fund.Chanin disputes the claims by ETF MG. He said PureFunds and ISE were partners and they hired ETF MG, not the other way around. And that it was PureFunds and its partners that helped cover the fund's expenses.In the complaint filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, PureFunds claims that ETF MG was retained to ""empower"" PureFunds to launch their ETFs. PureFunds alleges that ETF MG ""trumped up false securities violations"" with the purpose of obtaining control of the PureFunds business to pocket millions in annual revenue. It also alleges that ETF MG reduced the ""profit"" that PureFunds was to receive from ""their ETFs.""""The pressure on asset managers to reduce their fees is as great as it's ever been,"" said Ben Johnson, Morningstar's director of global ETFs research. ""The vast majority of flows are going into the ones with absolute rock-bottom expense ratios. That's the trend.""HACK has risen 10.4% this year, but is down 4.8% in the past three months. CIBR, which was launched in June 2015, is up 8.3% this year, but also down 4.8% the past three months.CIBR now has $275.6 million in assets.The two funds have similar top holdings. HACK's 39 holdings as of Aug. 15 were topped by Cisco Systems (CSCO) at 4.75%, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) at 4.49% and Symantec (SYMC) at 4.12%. CIBR top holdings were Palo Alto Networks at 6.87%, Cisco Systems at 6.31%, and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) at 6.09%.The other funds affected by the change, with assets and expense ratios:RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Today

""While management enacts new initiatives to shore up a leaking margin structure, investors must assess whether the pressures are cyclical or secular.""A rival of Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper had edged up in after-hours trading after the company reported second-quarter earnings but reversed after its earnings call. Juniper has been seeking a turnaround under its new chief executive, Rami Rahim. It's aiming to sell more networking gear to cloud-computing providers such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB).IBD'S TAKE: For an up-to-the-minute look at which good stocks are trading in heavy volume and making big moves, the place to check is IBD's Stocks on the Move. ""Company guidance of full-year revenue growth of about 5% implies a sharp second half slowdown on more difficult comparisons,"" said Steven Milunovich, a UBS analyst in a report.

39,AKAM,"There's no shortage of star power in First Trust Nasdaq-100-Technology Sector ETF (QTEC), with Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) among its holdings.Indeed, the exchange traded fund is a way to gain exposure to the biggest brands in technology, and those stocks are performing well. Because it's culled from the Nasdaq 100 (the largest nonfinancial stocks in the composite), the ETF is predominantly a big-cap fund, with a median market cap of $32 billion.More than 40% of the fund is in chip stocks. About one-fourth is in software, 17% in internet companies and the rest in hardware, services and telecom stocks. The fund's hardware stocks have been shining.Western Digital (WDC) has surged more than 130% from a low in May 2016. The data storage stock broke out of a base March 30 and remains near a 81.77 buy point. Rival Seagate Technology (STX) has risen more than 160% from its May low. Apple may be flagging the past couple of weeks, but shares have rallied about 20% from a breakout past a 118.12 entry in January.The internet components haven't exactly impressed. Alphabet — the parent company of Google — Yahoo (YHOO), Baidu (BIDU), Akamai (AKAM) and NetEase (NTES) have printed mediocre charts for months. Facebook, though, is still trending moderately upward.Despite relative strength in the sector, the ETF's semiconductor stocks have been mixed.What about the sector's outlook? Much depends on consumer reception to new products, such as the next iPhone model, and corporate spending on information technology. Earlier this month, Nomura analysts saw strength in that area.""Our early-April survey of 50 global CIOs offered a significantly improved view of 2017 IT spending vs. our October survey,"" the firm noted. ""This suggests the economic and financial upticks since October may prove resilient. The top spending drivers, security and cloud, remain key themes.""The tech sector is turning in the third-highest earnings growth rate of 11 S&P sectors at 13.0%, according to FactSet.The 35 companies in the ETF are about evenly distributed in terms of weighting, each accounting for 1.5% to 3.2% of the portfolio. That leaves the fund less exposed to risk from a single holding.The ETF has made an impressive run since it broke out of a long consolidation and started making new highs last July. Today, shares are finding support at the 50-day moving average. That leaves investors with an opportunity to buy shares, although it needs to be treated as a secondary entry, not as favorable as a base breakout. The most recent of those was in November, when First Trust Nasdaq-100-Tech Sector was trading at 51.65.RELATED:Robotics ETF Taps Growth In Manufacturing, Drones, Other AreasThis Cloud-Computing ETF Is Loaded With FANG Stocks

The move earned Conoco an upgrade to buy, from hold, along with an 8% price target increase from UBS. Cenovus shares dived 13%.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) slumped 4% in big trade.

""They make very attractive margins on their legacy DTV business today.""Offering an internet-based alternative will mean lower costs, particularly for equipment, so they can justify a lower price. But that doesn't mean they can justify pricing at razor thin margins. That would be cutting off their nose to spite their face.""Nomura Securities weighed in on Friday, saying AT&T might bite the bullet on mid-single-digit profit margins and sell DirecTV Now for $55 monthly. UBS analyst John Hodulik earlier estimated that AT&T could sell DirecTV Now for $50 a month.""We view DirecTV Now as a potential game-changer, but with two caveats: The customer is not locked into a contract and Hulu is expected to launch a competing OTT product in early 2017,"" Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a research report Friday.Hulu's live streaming service is expected to cost around $40 a month.IBD'S TAKE: High-dividend paying stocks such as AT&T and Verizon have cooled off amid talk that interest rates may rise. Some large cap companies, such as Facebook or Edwards Lifesciences, offer faster growth. Check out the IBD Big Cap 20.Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS)and Comcast. Time Warner (TWX) recently bought a 10% stake in Hulu.At a Goldman Sachs conference in September, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said DirecTV Now will roll out at a ""very, very aggressive price point. Stephenson said AT&T will accept thinner margins than usual in the pay TV business.Still, there's wiggle room in AT&T's comments because DirecTV Now has been described at a fat bundle, with a lot of content, not a skinny bundle with fewer channels. AT&T announced plans for DirecTV Now in January.Programming will be AT&T's biggest cost. AT&T has lined up content from most media firms, with the exception of CBS (CBS) and 21st Century Fox Entertainment, analysts say. But there may be other costs.William Power, an analyst at William Blair, says AT&T might use Akamai Technologies' (AKAM) content delivery network to whisk Internet video to homes.Akamai's services might be needed because AT&T's DirecTV Now will stream live TV, including sports. AT&T will provide one or two data streams per household. For wireless customers, DirecTV Now usage will not count toward monthly data caps.UBS estimates DirecTV Now could have 2.5 million customers by 2020. Hodulik is cautious on forecasts because OTT competition will likely heat up.""We believe Amazon is well underway with developing a linear TV service, and we doubt that Apple (AAPL) has permanently shelved its plans,"" he said in a research report.AT&T stock fell 0.6% to 38.87 in the stock market today.RELATED:AT&T Downgraded On Apple iPhone Competition, Comcast Wireless EntryIPhone 7 Bottom Line: 'Apple's Gain, Carriers' Pain'

59,AKAM,"Comcast (CMCSA) and Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), are becoming bigger players in the content delivery network market, posing a challenge to CDN leader Akamai Technologies (AKAM), according to Goldman Sachs.CDNs increase the speed of e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices.“Amazon is growing its Cloudfront CDN to an estimated $1.8 billion in 2016 revenues and shifting its own video delivery from independent CDNs to its own network, and startups like Fastly are growing share,” Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini said in a research report.AWS is part of the e-commerce giant’s fast-growing cloud computing business. Amazon stock surged to an all-time high on Tuesday, as the Wall Street Journal reported that Salesforce.com (CRM) was building a new service that uses AWS.AWS was a big reason Amazon reported its highest sales growth in nearly four years when it posted first-quarter earnings on April 28, sending the stock up nearly 10% the following day.Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock, with a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95, where 99 is highest. Akamai has a 59 CR.Bellini, who has a sell rating on Akamai stock, attended the 2016 Content Delivery Summit in New York on Monday, gaining views on market trends.“A key takeaway was that the competitive landscape remains intense, as Comcast looks to triple its CDN capacity next year,” wrote Bellini.Comcast, the No. 1 cable TV company, has been expanding commercial services to businesses. Comcast moved into CDN services in late 2014, Bellini noted.One market trend could work in Comcast’s favor, said the Goldman Sachs analyst. “Multi-CDN deployments were a key theme of the conference,"" she wrote, ""with new startups making it easy to route traffic across multiple CDNs.”Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the No. 1 provider of CDN services. Worries that big customers such as Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) are shifting more of their data traffic to their own CDNs have pressured Akamai stock.Aside from AWS and Comcast, Akamai competes with Level 3 Communications (LVLT), Limelight Networks (LLNW), and Verizon Communications (VZ), as well as startups Fastly and CloudFlare.

60,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) late Tuesday reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped expectations, though its current-quarter revenue guidance slightly missed Wall Street expectations.Still, Akamai stock was up 7.5% in early trading in the stock market today, touching a four-month high of 57.50. Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the biggest provider of content delivery network (CDN) services. Worries that customers such as Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) are shifting some of their data traffic to their own CDNs has pressured Akamai stock, and analysts have lowered Q1 estimates.Akamai said Q1 EPS ex items rose 8% to 66 cents per share, with revenue also rising 8% to $567.7 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled 63 cents and $564 million.For Q2, Akamai forecasts revenue of $574 million at its midpoint of guidance and adjusted profit of 62 cents to 65 cents per share vs. consensus estimates of $578.4 million and 65 cents.“Revenue guidance is slightly under consensus, due to year-over-year decline in revenue from two major media delivery customers (Apple and Facebook) that are taking more of their volume in-house,” Michael Olson, a Piper Jaffray analyst, said in a research report. “Importantly, the impact from these customers is becoming less material as they go from 11% of revenue in 2015 to around 6% in 2016.”Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says Akamai’s guidance might be too conservative.“While we appreciate management’s decision to err on the side of being overly cautious after its surprising revelation regarding these two customers on its Q3 (2015) call, it highlights management’s lack of visibility with its own top customers,” he said in a report.Akamai competes with Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Limelight Networks (LLNW), as well as startups Fastly and CloudFlare. Verizon Communications (VZ), Amazon.com‘s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services,  IBM (IBM) and Comcast (CMCSA)  are also emerging as new rivals in some parts of the CDN market.""Akamai has been very clear that the first half of 2016 would be marked by slower growth in the media segment, but then it expects (Internet TV) video to begin to accelerate growth. Similar to other large, secular growth opportunities, it is often difficult to project the exact timing of the opportunity, but we believe growth from (Internet TV) will begin to manifest in second half 2016,"" said Michael Bowen, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report.

Akamai’s global CDN helps Apple, Facebook and other speed up video streaming, e-commerce transactions and business software downloads over the Internet. Apple, though, is among the big tech companies that has been developing its own CDN, while also using other CDN providers.Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital , is modelling a 3.5% year-over-year decline in sales for Akamai’s media and entertainment business but a 15% rise in cloud-security revenue.“We are looking for $207 million, or a 3.5%  (media segment) decline, as two of the company’s largest media customers (likely Apple, Facebook) transition off the Akamai platform. The concern over whether additional top media customers will migrate off Akamai remains the most material overhang on the stock,” Mahaney said in a research report. “Security is becoming an increasingly meaningful part of the financial story, accounting for 12% of revenue in 2015. We are modeling 45% year-over-year growth to $79.8 million.”Akamai competes with Level 3 Communications (LVLT), and Limelight Networks (LLNW) as well as startups Fastly and CloudFlare. Verizon Communications (VZ) (IBD), Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services,  IBM (IBM) and Comcast (CMCSA) also are emerging as new rivals in some parts of the CDN market.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate Q1 EPS of $564 million, up 7% from the year-earlier period.

IBM, though, seems to be moving onto Akamai’s turf, says Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan.At the NAB show, IBM took the wraps off Aspera FASPStream, software that IBM says streams live broadcast video over “commodity Internet networks.”  IBM also unveiled an enterprise CDN product that lets companies broadcast live streaming video within their corporate firewalls.IBM’s initial clients for the video streaming products include AOL, part of Verizon Communications (VZ); the Canadian Broadcasting Co., Comic-Con and Mazda.“We’re not in the CDN business like Akamai,” Braxton Jarratt, who leads IBM’s cloud video unit, told TechCrunch. He added, though, that IBM has substantial cloud and software resources.IBM has made a few video streaming-related acquisitions.At NAB, Akamai announced the opening of a broadcast operations control center to support customers' over-the-top (OTT) video streaming. Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) also looms as a new rival of Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai.

Shares have edged up about 4% in 2016 but are down 24% in the past 12 months.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the No. 1 provider of content delivery network (CDN) services to media and entertainment companies. Akamai’s CDN technology speeds up e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices.Akamai has expanded into higher-margin cloud infrastructure services and security, aiming to offset price cuts in the CDN business.“We believe the company can continue to see double-digit revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) growth driven primarily by cloud security and Web performance,” wrote Mahaney in a research report. “Excluding the company’s two largest media customers (presumably Apple and Facebook), we expect media delivery to remain in the very low double digits/very high single digits.“Given deceleration in revenue contribution from Akamai’s top two media customers (Apple and Facebook) in 2016, our estimates call for 9% year-over-year topline growth in 2016.  The company would need to grow 20% over the next four years to reach its $5 billion target. This would be impressive acceleration. Management has pointed to (Internet video) volumes, international revenue and strategic M&A as the key levers to support this growth inflection.""Amazon Web Services, part of the e-commerce leader, is not yet a serious rival to Akamai, while Microsoft has partnered with Akamai, noted Mahaney. Microsoft and Amazon are Akamai customers, though both also  operate commercial CDNs.“Microsoft and Akamai recently announced a partnership whereby (Microsoft’s) Azure CDN would leverage Akamai’s platform. Microsoft already uses Akamai for delivering software updates to the Xbox platform as well as updates to Office products, such as Windows 10 and Office 365,"" Mahaney wrote. ""Amazon’s use of Akamai is unknown, but since the company’s commercial CDN, AWS CloudFront, targets the low end of the market, we suspect Amazon leverages Akamai for large applications that have a high-performance standard and are delivered globally.”On Apple, Mahaney added: “We believe Akamai’s material OTT (over-the-top video) investments in 2015 targeted a potential Apple TV launch in Q4 2015 that never materialized. If Apple can make the economics work and moves forward with a new OTT offering, we expect Akamai will deliver a portion of this content.”IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group ranks No. 88 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Akamai has a composite rating of 67 out of a possible 99.Image provided by Shutterstock.

66,AKAM,"Interest in cable TV cord-cutting and cord-shaving is on the rise, according to a new survey by Robert W. Baird & Co.In its semiannual video trends survey, 51% of respondents said they are considering canceling or reducing their pay TV service. That’s up from 47% in Q3 2015 and 46% a year ago, Baird analyst William Power said in a research note Wednesday.“Consistent with our past surveys, price remains far and away the No.1 dissatisfaction with traditional cable service, followed by streaming alternatives and paying for more channels than you need, all of which feed the OTT (over-the-top TV) opportunity,” Power said.Netflix (NFLX) remains the clear leader in the Internet streaming-video market, but Amazon.com is gaining fast, Power said.Almost half of Netflix subscribers said they view Netflix as a substitute to traditional TV, though 82% of Netflix subscribers still subscribe to cable or satellite.Survey respondents picked “Orange Is the New Black” as the most-watched Netflix original show, followed by “House of Cards,” “Making a Murderer,” “Daredevil” and “Narcos.”Baird surveyed 1,300 U.S. Internet users, which skewed the results toward younger consumers.Roughly 15% of those surveyed were cord-cutters or cord-nevers who didn’t subscribe to traditional pay TV services.“Due in part to the online nature of our survey and its bias toward a younger demographic, Netflix penetration of 75% of respondents is much higher than Netflix’s actual U.S. household penetration of close to 50%, and we expect Amazon’s (AMZN) penetration of 52% of our sample is also significantly higher than actual,” Power said.Netflix penetration in the first quarter was unchanged from the Q3 2015 survey. But the Amazon Prime subscriber rate of 52% was up from 45% six months ago, Baird said.Akamai Technologies (AKAM), a leading enabler of streaming services, “should be well positioned to benefit from increased streaming,” Power said.Power rates Netflix stock neutral and Akamai stock outperform. He does not have a rating on Amazon. Akamai stock rose 2.1% Wednesday and Netflix stock rose 1.5%, while Amazon shares fell a fraction.

67,AKAM,"Many millennials suffer from video buffer rage more frequently than road rage, says a survey by IneoQuest, a provider of quality monitoring and assurance services for Internet video companies.Fifty-one percent of the 1,000 consumers surveyed who watch streaming video have experienced “a state of uncontrollable fury or violent anger”  as a result of buffering problems, says IneoQuest. And more than one-third of those surveyed under age 35 have had meltdowns when video streaming stops.But the next time your Netflix (NFLX) movie or YouTube video streams inconsistently, don’t automatically  blame your Internet service provider such as Comcast (CMCSA), AT&T (T) or Verizon Communications (VZ), says Kurt Michel, senior marketing director at Mansfield, Mass.-based IneoQuest.The problem could be with the content itself and the server that is providing it;  the mobile device or PC; or there could be an issue with the CDN (content delivery network) that Internet video companies such as Netflix or Hulu use. CDN providers include Akamai Technologies (AKAM), Limelight Networks (LLNW) and Level 3 Communications (LVLT).According to IneoQuest’s study, in many cases viewers were not able to begin playing streaming content at all, with 27% of respondents claiming that buffering most often occurs before a video starts and 34% experiencing buffering in the first 15 seconds.  More than 40% of consumers say they will wait only 10 seconds or less before clicking out of a buffering video.Nearly a quarter of all consumers surveyed said buffering during live sporting events causes the most rage.

68,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is sticking with its revenue target of $5 billion by 2020-21. At its investor day on Monday, the company said that it has enough cash to pursue stock repurchases as well as acquisitions.“We could do both -- M&A or share buybacks,” said Akamai CFO Jim Benson. He said that Akamai has about $1.5 billion in cash.Akamai did not change Q1 guidance calling for profit in a range of 61 cents to 64 cents per share and revenue of $562 million at its midpoint, up 7% from $526.5 million a year earlier.Akamai’s 2015 revenue rose 12% to $2.2 billion.“Although Akamai expects a lower overall growth rate for 2016, management is maintaining its long-term revenue goal of $5 billion by 2020, which implies a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 18%,” said Jim Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a report.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the biggest provider of content delivery network services to media and entertainment companies. Akamai’s CDN technology speeds up e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices.Akamai has expanded into higher-margin cloud infrastructure services and security, aiming to offset price cuts in the CDN business that averages 15% to 20% a year.At the investor day in Boston, Akamai said that it expects to grow sales overseas as well as to corporate customers.“The media business was de-emphasized relative to last year and is beginning to be overshadowed by the performance and security businesses,” said Michael Bowen, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report.Akamai’s stock is up about 4% in 2016. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 59 out of a possible 99.Akamai competes with Limelight Networks (LLNW) and Level 3 Communications (LVLT) as well as Verizon Communications (VZ). Verizon carries a high Composite Rating of 98 and makes IBD's Big Cap 20 weekly screen of large-cap growth stocks.

70,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) stock jumped Wednesday after the CDN services provider late Tuesday reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped analysts’  lowered expectations and gave in-line current-quarter profit  guidance.Shares of Cambridge-based Akamai were up 23% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 49. Akamai is the biggest provider of content-delivery network (CDN) services to media and entertainment companies.Akamai said it earned 72 cents per share in Q4, up 3% from the year-earlier period, with revenue rising 8% to $579.2 million. Analysts had modeled EPS of 62 cents and revenue of $569 million.The beat included a 6-cent tax benefit. Akamai bought back $100 million in its own stock, lowering share count and boosting EPS.Even with Wednesday’s gain, Akamai stock is down 7% in 2016. The stock had plunged 47% through Tuesday’s market close since Oct. 27, when the company  gave disappointing December-quarter guidance.For the current quarter, Akamai forecasts revenue of $562 million at the midpoint of its range, with adjusted EPS of 61 cents to 64 cents, vs. consensus estimates of $568 million and 63 cents.Full-year 2015 revenue rose 12% to $2.2 billion. On the company's earnings conference call, management backed off of its 2020 revenue goal of $5 billion, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., in a research note. Akamai’s technology speeds up video streaming to mobile devices, e-commerce transactions and business software downloads. Akamai has expanded into higher-margin cloud-infrastructure services and security, aiming to offset price cuts in the CDN business that average 15% to 20% a year.“The security segment, now at a $300 million (annual revenue) run rate, provided the (Q4) upside,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a report.Akamai’s stock has been pressured as some big customers shift to their own internal CDNs. Apple (AAPL), believed to be Akamai's biggest customer, and Facebook (FB) have been moving data traffic to their own CDNs.Akamai has renegotiated contracts and lowered prices in some cases, says Tim Horan, an analyst at Oppenheimer.“The top two customers (likely Apple/Facebook) represented an average of 13% of revenue and likely closer to 11% in Q4, but that should decrease to 6% by mid-2016,” wrote Horan in a report. “The next two (likely Microsoft (MSFT)/Google) likely represent 5% and have likely re-priced. This should result in less revenue volatility in the second half of 2016, with upside if overall traffic volumes pick up.” Google is the main business of Alphabet (GOOGL). He says Akamai could gain from video streaming tied to the Olympics this summer, the presidential election and National Football League games.Aside from longtime rivals Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Limelight Networks (LLNW), Akamai is facing increased competition from Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), as well as Verizon Communications (VZ).

Travel sites TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Expedia (EXPE) gave back 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively, on Friday.

76,AKAM,"Will Apple (AAPL) muscle in on Amazon Web Services?Apple’s huge data center build-out might be setting the stage for a jump into cloud computing services for enterprise customers, speculates Oppenheimer.Apple’s capital spending is expected to jump some 34% in 2016 to $15 billion, with about $4 billion going to warehouse-sized data centers packed with computer servers.Morgan Stanley this week said Apple might shift some cloud business away from AWS as competition in consumer products intensifies with parent Amazon.com (AMZN).Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan, in a research report, goes a step further, saying Apple might start its own infrastructure as a service (IaaS) business as it targets the corporate market. IBM (IBM) and Apple have partnered for enterprise marketing.“Looking at Apple’s capex trajectory and recent continued data center builds, we believe there is a possibility the company is setting up an infrastructure as a service offering,” wrote Horan.  “While we realize this is not Apple’s core competency, it is obvious it has built out its own CDN network and will continue to expand it.""It is also apparent to us that by building out an IaaS offering to businesses, Apple may be able to drive its hardware business into the enterprise. This would be an interesting development and is certainly a wild card.”Apple plans to open a massive data center in Mesa, Ariz. It also wants to expand a large data center in Reno, Nev.Amazon expanded into cloud computing by leveraging the massive Internet infrastructure that it had built to support its e-commerce business. Apple launched iCloud for consumers, but additional server capacity could be used for corporate cloud services.Aside from Amazon's AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google are the biggest providers of IaaS services. The other big investor in data centers is Facebook (FB), as it whisks more video to mobile devices.“From (Facebook-owned) Instagram/WhatsApp to Google Hangouts, Web-scale consumer-facing companies are leveraging cloud computing and superior network architectures to become de facto communications companies, and they are spending the capital to do so,” Horan said.Apple has also built its own content delivery network, making it less dependent on Akamai Technologies (AKAM), the leading provider of CDN services.Horan sees upside in data center expansion for companies such as Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Zayo Group (ZAYO).

While Apple's launch of an over-the-top (OTT) video service may have been delayed until 2016, Akamai stands to benefit from a wide array of Web video launches, says Deutsche Bank analyst Vijay Bhagavath in a research report.""We see a $500 million a year opportunity for Akamai in TV OTT, as the long tail (NBC, CBS (CBS), HBO, ESPN, Apple, Dish-Sling (DISH), Comcast (CMCSA), Hulu) generate the next 10% or more of Internet video traffic,"" said Bhagavath.Bhagavath joins other bullish Wall Street analysts in saying Akamai's network investments and higher capital spending will pay off.Pacific Crest Securities says Apple will still need Akamai if it expands its own CDN capabilities.

""If Apple signs up tens of millions of subscribers and gives a large percentage of the delivery to third-party CDNs like Akamai, then the numbers could start to add up. But Apple would be lucky to get a few million subs, within a few quarters, with what is expected to be a pared-down selection of content available.""Apple is still in talks with programmers over rights to live broadcasts and a limited number of cable TV channels.Deutsche Bank's Bhagavath expects many companies to jump into Internet video. He raised his price target on Akamai to 80 from 77.As more U.S. households cut the cord and use only broadband to get TV, ""we note a base of 11 million broadband homes in the U.S., growing 10% year over year (SNL Kagan data), is a significant and growing viewer base for the exabytes of Internet Video traffic that Akamai could monetize over the next few years,"" he said.Akamai gets a strong Composite Rating of 90 out of a possible 99 from IBD.

215,AKAM,"F5 Networks (FFIV), a maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs), has continued its winning ways under new CEO Manuel Rivelo, boosting revenue and profit by capitalizing on high demand for new software and security services to guard against digital data breaches. The Seattle-based company, whose client base ranges from the U.S. government to Facebook (FB), is the No. 1 seller of ADCs. The electronic devices direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, helping to make websites and communication networks faster and more efficient.F5 has in recent years expanded its ties with customers by also selling them security products and services, and continues to do so under Rivelo. Demand in this arena is mounting amid a torrent of headlines about major organizations suffering cyberattacks that resulted in costly data breaches. In recent months alone, cybercriminals have infiltrated systems at Harvard University, health insurer Anthem (WLP), and the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management.F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). The company is part of IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, which also includes Rackspace Hosting (RAX), Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Equinix (EQIX).""It's just going to keep growing and growing,"" U.S. Global Investors trader Mike Matousek told IBD, referring to demand for data security. He said investors are increasingly interested in companies such as F5 because they are continuously hearing that organizations fear the worst when it comes to cybersecurity and view as vital their ongoing investments in the latest technology to thwart breaches.Investors See Opportunity""So there's more opportunity here,"" Matousek said. ""There's a lot of potential ahead.""F5's stock is up about 14% over the past year. The company in July posted fiscal third-quarter revenue of $483.6 million, up 10% from a year earlier, and GAAP net income of $93.2 million, up 8.7%. On a per-share non-GAAP basis, earnings rose 5% to $1.67.The sales trajectory is expected to continue. For the quarter ending Sept. 30, F5 set a revenue goal of $500 million to $510 million.A company executive told IBD that F5 does not break out the percentage of its product revenue generated by its security business. But during the company's earnings call in July, F5 executives said software sales, which are often linked with security services, have more than doubled over the past three years and now make up about a third of revenue. Customers, the company said, are moving more of their systems into the cloud, via software, and need accompanying security protections.Rivelo, a former Cisco Systems executive, officially took the helm at F5 on July 1. But he began leading the company after his promotion, from executive vice president of strategic solutions to CEO, was announced last spring. He replaced John McAdam, who had been F5 Networks' chief executive for about 15 years.Rivelo was not available to comment for this article, but during the earnings call he said F5's security business will remain ""a major growth driver"" for the company.Given the spate of highly publicized cyberattacks, he added, ""more customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure applications, manage user policy and access, and mitigate application attacks across traditional data centers, and public and private clouds.""Rivelo said in F5's third quarter alone it established major new business relationships on the security front with a branch of the U.S. government and ""a prestigious medical research group,"" among others.New Global Sales ChiefCFO Andy Reinland told investors recently that security ""continues to be key for us. And we're going to continue to incentivize the sales force to really push that."" This week F5 named John DiLullo to lead global sales, reporting to Rivelo.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management and an observer of companies affected by cyberattacks including banks, said in an interview that ""it is hard to see where the threat ends.""He said regulators of various industries and leaders of major governments around the world are increasingly paying attention to cybersecurity and likely will over time join forces to create stronger global security standards. This, he said, should make it easier for companies and governments to work together to combat cybercriminals.Should all of that materialize in coming years, Paulsen said, it could help more companies get beyond playing catch-up on the security front and instead make investments to continuously stay ahead of criminals. This, he said, could ultimately minimize the number of high-profile breaches. But it would not diminish the need for high-level security services.Looking For Acquisitions""It's never going to go away,"" he said of the threat of attacks. ""They aren't going to just shut this down, but the good guys are going to get better and better at this.""Toward that end, F5 said it is on the lookout for acquisitions that can fortify its suite of products and help drive more growth.""We look for a nice technology tuck-in that we can bring in, integrate the code into the platform, and then offer it as part of a platform solution,"" Rivelo said at an August conference. ""We do aggressively look at companies ... We look at them every week.""He said sellers' pricing expectations are currently a bit lofty. ""In general, right now it's a little heated,"" Rivelo said of the M&A market. But if F5 finds an appealing and affordable target, ""we'll bring it on board to accelerate our roadmap and our vision.""

238,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) stock has shot up 20% in 2015 ahead of Q1 earnings, at nearly 15-year highs, but analyst consensus estimates are trending lower than Q4 because of currency headwinds.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the biggest provider of content delivery network services to media and entertainment companies. While its Q4 earnings were boosted by holiday e-commerce, Q1 results typically are seasonally weaker because of slower data traffic growth.Also, Akamai garners more than a quarter of its revenue outside the U.S. With the euro and yen having weakened vs. the dollar, currency exchange rates have weighed on the Q1 results of many tech firms, include Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) in their respective reports last week.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Akamai's Q1 profit will grow 6% to 61 cents per share, on revenue of $526 million, up 16%. Akamai's sales rose 27% year over year in Q4 to $536 million, while EPS rose 27% to 70 cents.In 2014, Akamai's results were boosted by the Sochi Olympics, as video streaming increased, making comparisons with this year's Q1 tougher, analysts say. Akamai in January forecast Q1 revenue of $517 million to $534 million.""We expect Akamai to report Q1 2015 results slightly ahead of estimates despite a $3 million FX headwind relative to guidance,"" said Cowen & Co. analyst Colby Synesael in a research report. ""Akamai has exceeded the high-end of its revenue guidance seven of the past eight quarters.""That said, we also believe it could provide Q2 2015 guidance slightly below expectations due to substantial FX headwinds, but also believe its business continues to show strong underlying trends that could make it a moot point.""Akamai's technology speeds up e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices, among other things.""While Q1 is usually seasonally weak, year-over-year comparisons will be affected by the benefit of the Sochi Olympics last year as well as large gaming releases,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said in a report. ""While we recognize comparisons will be difficult, we believe traffic growth will continue to be strong given the increased penetration of over-the-top video and digital gaming.""Akamai has expanded into cloud infrastructure services and security. Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, said in a recent report that Akamai has set ""an internal target of $1 billion in (annual) security revenue.""Akamai faces stiff competition from Level 3 Communications (LVLT), Limelight Networks and, through its EdgeCast acquisition last year, Verizon Communications (VZ). Verizon rival AT&T (T) is now a key Akamai partner, analysts say.Akamai stock was up 1% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 77, its highest point since August 2000.

The Fort Lauderdale-headquartered software developer is still in buying range, 4% above a 69.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Among leaders, most of the IBD 50 list posted modest gains and losses — with a couple of dramatic exceptions.Ambarella (AMBA) led the list with a 9% rebound. The stock tumbled 21% Monday, following a short-seller's report on Friday that questioned the stock's valuation. The stock remains extended after a mid-May rebound from 10-week support and is well above its 10-week moving average.At the bottom of the group, burger joint Sonic (SONC) dived 11% in massive trade. Fiscal third quarter sales and profits met consensus expectations, but full-year earnings guidance didn't. The sell-off stopped at a test of the stock's 10-week moving average, seriously damaging efforts to shape a three-month cup base.

361,AKAM,"F5 Networks' (FFIV) fiscal Q1 EPS is expected to rise 22% with revenue up 15%, as analysts expect upside from F5's push into computer security products.Seattle-based F5 is slated to report December-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday.The data center gear maker is expected to earn $1.49 per share, up from 1.22 in the year-earlier quarter, estimate analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Analysts are modeling revenue of $467.3 million, up from $370.3 million.F5 is the No. 1 seller of ADCs, electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers. Application Delivery Controllers optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks. Analysts expect F5 to get a boost from security products sold to large companies. F5 bundles security and other software with its data-center hardware.Phone companies and government agencies are also among F5's customers.""Telco remains a wild card and typically represents 20% to 25% of sales in a quarter,"" Tim Long, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a research report.William Blair analyst Jason Ader, in a research note Tuesday, said his firm's survey of 44 value-added resellers found that enterprise spending accelerated in Q4 following a prolonged period of underinvestment and that ""feedback on F5 remained strong, with resellers reporting vigorous data center activity, product refreshes and growing security attach rates.""F5 stock rose 43% in 2014, and it ranks No. 41 in the latest IBD 50 listing of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.F5 stock edged up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 127, but shares are down 2.5% this year. The stock is trading below its 128.40 November breakout.IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group ranks No. 39 out of 197 industry groups. Besides F5, it includes Rackspace Hosting (RAX), Akamai Technologies (AKAM), Equinix (EQIX)and SolarWinds (SWI).For the current quarter, fiscal Q2, analysts estimate F5 will report EPS growth of 20% on revenue growth of 14%.""March tends to be seasonally weaker,"" said Mark Sue, an analyst at RBC Capital, in a research report.Amid currency weakness in Europe and Japan, exchange rates are expected to be a factor for a wide range of companies reporting earnings and might affect guidance by F5 and others, analysts say.F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Riverbed Technology (RVBD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). Aside from F5's security push, analysts have been upbeat on its prospects in software-defined networking, or SDN, which centralizes control of network security, storage systems and servers connected to networks.

384,AKAM,"F5 Networks soared in 2014 and looks poised for another strong run this year. Demand is mounting for its security products as clients do more business via digital means and require heightened protection from hackers.Though not solely a security provider, Seattle-based F5 (FFIV) says that it is well-positioned to meet increasing needs on that front, needs amplified in 2014 by a range of breaches, from a cyberattack on banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to the infamous attack on Sony (SNE) and release of its executives' internal emails.Cooper Werner, F5's senior vice president of finance, told investors recently that the percentage of the company's product revenue tied to its security business reached 36% in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. It marked a 41% year-over-year jump.""Obviously, this is probably the biggest driver to our overall growth,"" Werner said while speaking at an investor conference hosted by Barclays in December.In its latest completed fiscal year, F5's revenue climbed 17% to $1.73 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project top-line growth of 13% for the current fiscal year.Upselling SafetyF5, whose clients include big online operators such as Facebook (FB) and Pandora Media (P), is the leading seller of application delivery controllers. ADCs are electronic devices that, in a nutshell, efficiently direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, enhancing the work processed in these areas and boosting website and communication network speeds.Werner said that F5 has worked to deepen business relationships with its ADC clients by also offering them data-center security products and services.In short, F5 views security ""as a natural extension of its ADC offerings, to help applications perform efficiently"" and make them ""more secure,"" as UBS analyst Amitabh Passi summed it up in a research note to clients.With demand now surging for data center protections, F5 finds itself at the center of what many observers expect will prove a long-running trend.""All it takes is a read of the headlines to see why demand for data security is on the rise and will continue to rise,"" BMO Private Bank Chief Investment Officer Jack Ablin told IBD.""I think that is the next frontier,"" Ablin said. He added that companies staking their ground now stand to be well-positioned to capitalize on the secular trend.F5's stock surged nearly 44% in 2014. It finished the final trading day of the year at $130 per share. It currently trades near 128.F5 is the No. 3 company by market cap after Equinix (EQIX) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) in the Internet-Network Solutions industry group, which ranks No. 38 out of 197 groups that IBD tracks. The next largest players in the category are Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and SolarWinds (SWI). With an IBD Composite Rating of 98, F5 is one of the highest-rated companies in the Internet-Network Solutions group, topped only by Rackspace and SolarWinds, each of which gets a 99.A global survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that information security breaches skyrocketed in 2014, leaping 48% from 2013 to 42.8 million detected incidents. Total financial losses attributed to security compromises jumped 34% over 2013, the PWC survey said.""The rise in security incidents would account for some of this increase in financial losses, of course. But another explanation might be that today's more sophisticated compromises often extend beyond IT to other areas of the business, and financial losses may now include remediation of more customer impacts and not just operational disruptions,"" PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report. Companies and organizations ""must remain vigilant and agile in the face of a continually evolving threat landscape.""GBT Capital Management Chairman Gary Townsend told IBD that cyberattack concerns are deepening and spreading across sectors, making security a top priority for companies of all sizes. ""One needs to be concerned about it everywhere,"" he said. ""No one is immune from attack.""Demand OutlookDeutsche Bank analysts said in a December note that their recent checks on F5 suggested ""no incremental slowdown in demand"" for the company's services, indicating that results for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 are likely to be strong. The analysts cited ""an expanding order pipeline"" for application and cloud-based security products from Fortune 500 companies.Depending on the traffic level and the number of servers needed to manage it, F5 charges between $50,000 and $300,000 for its ADCs. Competitors include Citrix Systems (CTXS) and A10 Networks (ATEN). F5 also sells virtual ADCs that run in clients' data centers as opposed to on F5's own hardware.Analysts on average anticipate that F5 will report earnings per share of $1.49 for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, which would be up 22% year over year, on sales of $467 million, which would be up 15%. The Deutsche Bank analysts anticipate that the momentum will continue. ""We see 2015 as a positive year,"" they wrote. The analysts have a buy rating on F5, with a $150 price target.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, recently raised his price target on F5 to $162 from $153 and kept an outperform rating. In a December research note, Bracelin cited F5's ""increasingly strategic positioning in security headed into the new year.""Acquisitions have augmented F5's growth. In 2014, the company bought Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services. And in 2013, it acquired Versafe, whose software guards Web applications from malware and fraud. Analysts anticipate more deals to come, providing an additional reason to expect growth.Speaking at the Barclays conference in December, Edward Eames, F5's executive vice president of business operations, said that the company could continue on the M&A path, with a focus on small, add-on deals.""I think we're very happy with the small technology purchase — and then fold that into the company and add it into our product line,"" Eames said.""And that's definitely the strategy we have going forward. So I don't think we'd be looking for larger M&A,"" he said. ""But yes, security, cloud — perhaps services and subscription around the two, as well — would all be focus areas, and we are continuing to look.""

The next largest players are three highly rated firms: F5 Networks (FFIV), Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and SolarWinds (SWI).Akamai's Media Delivery Solutions category posted a revenue increase of 22% for the third quarter. More double-digit growth lies ahead as people increasingly weave online activities into their daily routines, Benson says.Akamai's global network of servers stores copies of online content in order to expedite delivery to its clients' customers. Those end users experience relatively few video streaming interruptions and faster downloads because Akamai's services effectively route them around Internet congestion, Benson says. Akamai also provides a range of software updates such as the routine upgrades issued for products like Apple's (AAPL) iPads.""We believe it will continue,"" Benson said, referring to the robust demand for Akamai's media services. The business, he added, ""has been a nice growth accelerant for the company.""At the same time, as corporate clients of myriad stripes — from online retailers to banking companies — capitalize on cloud-based service and handle more customer transactions online, they want higher levels of security to guard against hackers and data breaches.Headlines about breaches at banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and retailers like Home Depot (HD) have called attention to the need for cybersecurity and lifted demand for Akamai's services, Benson says.What Akamai provides in this regard are firewalls for Web applications and added layers of protection around clients' data centers. The company, he says, detects breaches at the edge of its network, ""far from customers' data centers. ... (and) we thwart the attacks.""Akamai's Performance and Security Solutions segment generated 29% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter.Benson says that Akamai does about 70% of its business in the U.S., but he added that its international operations, in Asia and Europe, are growing at a faster rate. He cites strong demand for its services in Japan, Korea and Singapore.Sinha says that Akamai should benefit from solid demand as its clients recognize that they must defend against security threats and as end users demand high-level online video, gaming and social media.""They have major tailwinds at their back,"" Sinha said.Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says that gaming and social media should continue to boost Akamai. ""Clearly, we're seeing acceleration in media delivery,"" he said. ""That's really where they have outperformed this year.""He expects growth on those fronts to build into long-term trends. ""That's the bull case for this story,"" Synesael said.Tough FieldAll of that noted, Akamai's story is not free of headwinds.The company has formidable competition that includes Limelight Networks (LLNW), Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Verizon Communications (VZ).It could also lose some ground with one of its most prominent clients, Apple, Synesael says. Apple, which accounts for 6% of Akamai's revenue by Synesael's estimation, is building its own internal content delivery network.""The concern is, are they going to shift more in-house in 2015?"" Synesael said of Apple, adding that other Akamai clients could make similar moves.After reporting third-quarter results, Akamai executives conceded to analysts that because the firm's media business is based on traffic volumes, its growth from one quarter to the next could be bumpy, given that gaming and software releases, as well as the adoption of new social media and video platform upgrades, tend to vary.But over the course of several coming quarters, Benson expects that favorable tech trends will continue to advance in Akamai's favor.""We are not opportunity constrained,"" he said.

The major indexes have been trading in a tight range over the past couple of weeks.Even leading stocks tend to follow the general path of the major stock market averages. Even without looking at the S&P 500 index, looking at a chart of Apple, Nvidia, Splunk, Charles Schwab or Microsoft at investors.com or Marketsmith would give a general idea of the bench mark index's recent performance. That's because the charts include the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.As the stock market drifted, Apple pulled back into buy range from its double-bottom breakout. But on Wednesday, the IBD Leaderboard stock rose 0.6% to 188.36, just above the 5% chase zone from its 179.04 entry. Investors shouldn't buy an extended stock because of the higher risk of a pullback. It's possible that Apple could dip back into the entry area.Apple nudged higher in the premarket though.Hot chipmaker Nvidia also has retreated into the buy zone from a double-bottom breakout, and at one point appeared poised to test the 239.35 entry. But Nvidia, an IBD 50 stock, rose 2.1% on Wednesday to 247.54. Nvdia stock rose a fraction early Thursday.Charles Schwab, which cleared a cup base on May 9 in low volume, has held in that range ever since.

This week Microsoft stock has been back in the buy zone. Shares rose 1.2% to 98.66 on Wednesday, after falling as low as 96.32 intraday. The stock got a price target hike for Microsoft's cloud computing strength.Microsoft was little changed early Thursday.While investors want to see their stocks surge every day, sideways action isn't bad. The volatile stock market has led to sloppy stock patterns. So tight action could be positive. Apple, for instance, could form a bullish three-weeks-tight pattern if it continues to consolidate tightly. Go a little longer and these stocks in buy range could provide base-on-base formations.However, there is a risk with a stock hovering just in buy range. While you're waiting for the stock to take off again, something bad could happen. It could be earnings or some other stock-specific news. Or it could be sector or market related.

678,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is winning analyst praise heading into 2017 on views that its big investments in web infrastructure to deliver streaming video pay off, as well as its security-related acquisitions.Guggenheim Securities on Thursday initiated coverage of Akamai with a buy rating. Oppenheimer and William Blair recently named Akamai as among their top stock picks.Shares closed down 0.7% at 67.37 in the stock market today. Akamai stock is forming a cup base, with a buy point of 71.14 and has risen 28% in 2016, though the company is garnering less revenue from traditional customers such as Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT).Akamai is the biggest provider of content delivery network, or CDN, services, which increase the speed of e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices. Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have been developing their own CDNs.IBD'S TAKE: Akamai's recent jump gave it spot on IBD Swing Trader on Dec. 14, but just at a half position. But it then got a full position on Tuesday. See Swing Trader for the very top prospects for shorter-term gains. AT&T launched a new streaming service branded DirecTV Now in late November. There may be upside for Akamai as AT&T's subscribers grow, analysts say.""AT&T's push into the over-the-top (OTT) video market could accelerate subscriber adoption of OTT services, which would benefit Akamai,"" said Michael Bowen, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, in a research report late Wednesday.Akamai's other video streaming customers are said to include Major League Baseball, Dish Network's (DISH) Sling and Ooyala.One wild card is how much video traffic Akamai might handle for new streaming services with live broadcast content coming from Hulu, Google's (GOOGL) YouTube and Amazon.com (AMZN), analysts say.Jonathan Schildkraut, an analyst at Guggenhiem, initiated coverage with a buy rating and price target of 75.""We expect investor focus to return to AKAM's core value proposition — that its unique, highly distributed, edge-based network architecture is superior not only for distributing content (including live OTT video), but also for the delivery of other services including web performance, security and longer-term cloud applications,"" Schildkraut said in his research report.Akamai on Wednesday made another security-related purchase, acquiring startup Cyberfend.Akamai's global network of computer servers store copies of website content for fast delivery to end users. Akamai has expanded into higher-margin services, such as cloud infrastructure and security, amid falling prices in its older CDN business.Longtime customers continue to shift web traffic to their own CDNs. Akamai's top six internet platform accounts (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix (NFLX)) accounted for 10% of its revenue in Q3, down from 17% in the year-earlier quarter, analysts say.RELATED: Akamai Security Business Shines, Offsets Apple, Facebook ShiftDish Network Taps Netflix As Streaming Battle Heats UpWill The Launch Of AT&T DirecTV Now Herald Net Neutrality's End?Hulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCU

Jim Suva, a Citigroup analyst, upgraded F5 Networks to buy from neutral and hiked his price target to 175 from 143.""We see F5 Networks, Electronics for Imaging (EFII), NetApp (NTAP) and Benchmark Electronics (BHE) as potential M&A targets,"" said Suva in his research report Wednesday.F5 Networks stock had jumped nearly 47% to 142.40 in 2016 as of Tuesday, well extended from its last buy point of 125.01 touched in July. Shares of F5 Networks have traded well above its 50-day moving average since its last earnings report, in late October.IBD'S TAKE: Both F5 Networks and Akamai belong to IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, which is ranked No. 134 out of 197 industry groups.  Gigamon, which had been the group's leader, has dropped out of the IBD 50, where chip maker Nvidia is the top-rated stock.Akamai's stock has climbed 19% in 2016 through Tuesday, despite slowing revenue and EPS growth. The stock has been forming a flat base, with a buy point of 71.14.Akamai closed 2.8% higher at 66.99 in the stock market today. F5 rose 1.2% to end at 144.08.""Akamai has done a good job diversifying into cloud security and we believe that high 30% growth for the product category is achievable over the next couple of years,"" said Horan in his research report.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai's CDN (content delivery network) services increase the speed of e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices.""Akamai  could also be a viable acquisition target for any company looking to create unique/highly secure cloud capabilities, but we do not believe it is for sale,"" Horan wrote. ""We believe Akamai would be a great fit for Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and many other companies looking to break into the cloud services space.""Suva rates F5 Networks as Citigroup's ""top stock pick in IT hardware."" ""We shift Cisco Systems lower, still maintaining a buy rating, given the (potential) tax benefits from Trump administration"" Suva said in a report.Seattle-based F5 Networks is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs) — electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers.

683,AKAM,"Selling stocks at the top is a worthy goal for swing trading but easier said than done. Combining the context of the stock market indexes with the price action in individual stocks can inform your selling decisions. That was how a sell in Akamai Technologies ended up within 1% from its recent top.Your success in a swing trade doesn't just depend on a single decision or metric. It starts with buying right. Then determining your holding rules. Finally, how to maximize your profits or reduce your losses when selling stocks.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) formed a classic cup-with-handle pattern in March and April. It joined IBD's SwingTrader after breaking out on June 5 at 78.43 with double its average volume (1). The stop loss was a little different on this one. Normally, a stop loss at the low of the entry day is appropriate. A drop below that level usually signals the stock may need more time to consolidate. For swing trading, we'd rather take the small loss and move on to a new opportunity. That helps us maximize profits in our shorter time frame.For Akamai, a stop loss at the entry day low was too tight, less than 1.5%. If you make your stop too tight, a loss is more likely due to a brief shakeout. In this case, we moved the stop loss to the prior day's low for a 3% risk percentage. A proper stop loss is essential for holding a stock.That extra room came in handy since the stock did challenge the low of the entry day the very next session (2). Two days later, Akamai fell again. This time it fell below the 5-day moving average and re-challenged the entry day low but reversed strongly (3). A tighter stop loss would mean taking a loss in this trade and missing the subsequent move. It also demonstrates why we wait to see if the stock closes below the 5-day moving average line or gets support before making our sell decision.After two weeks, we hit our 5% profit goal and took full profits at 82.38 (4). Those familiar with our swing trading strategies may note a departure from our normal routine in selling stocks. Usually, we take half profits at the 5% level and see if we can maximize profits toward a 10% profit goal. Two things influenced the decision for the early sell here.First, the time of the trade. Swing trading looks at a typical trade length of just a couple of weeks. We seek short explosive moves and then take profits on the way up. This often avoids pullbacks that follow. We were already at a trade length of two weeks when we hit the 5% profit goal.Second, the Nasdaq composite was already extended when Akamai Technologies joined SwingTrader. At the time of the sell, the index was holding up well enough but showed difficulty making progress. Market context is a huge factor in determining whether holding or selling stocks is more appropriate. Akamai did have a couple attempts at progress above 83 but couldn't hold it long. Less than a week after the sell and the stock was down 3% from our exit price.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits: Knowing When To Say WhenDon't Be Greedy!

685,AKAM,"Even with the Nasdaq composite logging losses Thursday, IBD Stock Of The Day Interxion (INXN) is bucking tech-stock weakness and retaking a key technical level in heavy volume.Interxion stock rose 1.7% to 65.07 in the stock market today, reclaiming its 50-day moving average with conviction after slipping below that level earlier this week. Retaking the 50-day line in heavy volume is bullish action.Interxion is a Dutch-based company that operates data centers and related services, with its co-location centers serving multiple clients via one physical location.The network solutions firm, a peer of Akamai Technologies (AKAM), is now trading 3% below a flat-base buy point of 67.29.Keep an eye on the relative strength line, which is trending higher Thursday but has yet to reverse a downward trend since peaking in early May. The relative strength line measures price performance vs. the S&P 500. A lagging RS line indicates weakness compared with the broader market. On the upside, Interxion stock had an RS line trending higher from December 2016 to May 2018.This Stock of the Day has been on a considerable run, gaining nearly 70% since breaking out of a cup base in February 2017. With that climb, Interxion's latest base pattern would not be considered an early-stage base. Later-stage bases have a lower chance of success, but they can work.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The CR combines fundamental and technical metrics; a rating of 90 or above is seen as very strong.Another important factor to note is the company's quarterly financials. Interxion earnings in the March quarter missed analyst estimates. EPS growth slowed to 21% from 43% in the December quarter. Revenue increased 17%, a decline from the 34% growth it saw in Q4.However, upcoming quarterly results in a few weeks could provide a catalyst for the stock.

686,AKAM,"The IBD Stock of the Day is Akamai Technologies (AKAM), which is hovering just below a buy point. Akamai is nearing the potential entry just after cloud services rival Amazon (AMZN) moved into its own buy zone last week.The cloud-based internet content delivery provider is trading just below a cup-with-handle buy point of 77.69. The stock first tried to clear that level on May 22, but hit resistance and reversed lower.The buy point for Akamai Technologies, which is in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, remains valid because the stock only fell as much as 3.5% from that level. A sell signal for the stock would be triggered at a 7%-8% loss.Shares rose 1.4% to 77.07 in Monday's stock market trading.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmazon, with its fast-growing Amazon Web Services unit, competes with Akamai in internet content delivery services. Amazon stock cleared a buy point of 1,617.54 on Wednesday. It eclipsed the old peak of 1,638.10 on Thursday, offering another entry point. Both moves came in light volume. Amazon climbed 1.45% Monday to 1,665.27, a new high.Akamai's key customers include software stocks Salesforce (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK), as well as online brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).If and when Akamai attempts a breakout, look for heavy volume on the upside as that indicates support from institutional investors. Also keep an eye out for an upward-sloping relative strength line, which measures a stock's price performance vs. that of the S&P 500. Right now the RS line is trading somewhat sideways. An RS line at a new high during a breakout is a bullish indicator.This base has a handle. When a stock forms a handle on a cup base, that's a positive development. It provides a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock moves higher.Akamai earns an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of 99.

694,AKAM,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all started last week higher but closed the week modestly lower. This sideways stock market action offered a chance for many leading stocks to work on handles in their consolidations. Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) finished handles last week, offering new buy points. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Alibaba (BABA) finished handles on Monday.All five stocks rallied at least 1% on Monday, with Twitter attempting a breakout. The stocks were mixed Tuesday morning.Handles offer a last shakeout of weak holders. When a stock clears a proper handle in strong volume, it's evidence that the stock is ready to advance.Proper handles involve at least five days of moderate declines, though some develop over several weeks. You want to see a gradual drift, ideally in light trade. Heavy trade would imply selling from big institutions. The midpoint of the handle should be above the midpoint of the base. If a handle forms in the lower half of a pattern, there may still be selling pressure as old investors seek to exit with a profit or minimal losses.While handles are most closely associated with cup bases, they also form on double-bottom patterns. Twitter and Akamai stocks are cup-with-handle bases, while the Facebook stock handle is on a double bottom.

As of Monday's close, Alphabet stock has a proper handle with a 1,118.25 entry point.However, the midpoint of the handle is just above the midpoint of the base.

The Dow Jones industrial average lagged, falling 0.2%, weighed down by weakness in Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM).Financials took heat as the 10-year Treasury yield slumped 4 basis points to 2.35%.

707,AKAM,"Stocks opened lower Wednesday in a session that revolved around quarterly reports.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq composite gave up 0.3%, with the latter feeling pull from Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM).Biotech giant Gilead dropped 9%. Gilead reported not-as-bad-as-expected fourth-quarter revenue and earnings, but management's full-year revenue guidance was far below the consensus expectation. Gilead shares have been in steady decline since June 2015, as profits for its controversial hepatitis C drugs started to taper off.Akamai stumbled 11% following strong fourth-quarter results and Q1 guidance that appeared to be in line with expectations.

The thinly traded stock is extended, and has been pounding out new highs since November.Microchip Technology (MCHP) lobbed a 6% advance at the open after a 78% earnings gain and a 60% rise in revenue stomped analysts' fiscal third-quarter targets. The IBD 50 stock is extended from a 66.91 flat base buy point.Walt Disney (DIS) edged up less than 2%. The entertainment giant reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results during Tuesday's after hour session, and Chief Executive Bob Iger reported no plans to leave ahead of his contract expiration in 2018.  Disney shares are in buy range above a 106.36 cup-with-handle buy point.Chip developer Inphi (IPHI) rose 1% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings and revenue growth of better than 50%, and guiding first-quarter growth to more than 70% — all well above analyst projections.

708,AKAM,"A stock you've been watching is up sharply in the morning but its gains are making you hesitate. What if the stock can't maintain the gains and you get caught in a normal pullback? What if you don't buy and the stock just keeps on moving up without you?Starting with a half position can be a strategic compromise that offers a solution. A swing trading strategy poses unique challenges when scaling into positions. Smaller position sizes could mean commissions take a bigger bite out of your trade percentage wise. However, there are still benefits that should not be ignored and can easily outweigh the costs.The fear of a pullback is lessened with a half position since your portfolio would only suffer half the harm. The fear of missing out is alleviated since your starting position at least puts you in the game. If the stock gets even more extended, you can still finish the position with another buy knowing you've already established some profit cushion due to the lower cost purchase. If the stock closes well, you can also use that as feedback that the stock is holding its gains and finish buying the position.This strategy can be especially useful when the market is in transition. Stocks may move up sharply due to news. Presidential election results and the ""Brexit"" vote are two examples from this year where the strategy could have proved useful.Recently, IBD's SwingTrader added the half-position strategy to its product. On Dec. 14, Akamai Technologies was added with a half position (1) as the stock made a ten-day high shortly after the open. At the time it was put on, volume was tracking at its heaviest in a month and the stock was already up more than 4%. The move followed positive action in the tech indexes from the prior day when the Nasdaq composite pushed into new highs and the Nasdaq 100 broke out.Rather than take an all or nothing approach, a half position was taken at 67.85 as a compromise. The stock moved up slightly afterward but then shed more than a percent off its gains. A full position wasn't warranted given the weakness into the close.As it stands, the stock keeps getting just above 68 and then getting turned away. If it can surpass that area of resistance, preferably with confirming volume, the position can be finished with a purchase of another half position. If the stock gets stuck and can't make progress, an exit would leave you with a loss half as large.Subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader can access current alerts and analysis on trades.

711,AKAM,"Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) is trying to pacify employees about its relationship with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) even as it embarks on a new journey with blockchain and completes strategic acquisitions and deals. Here’s the low-down:ICE Contract And The Child Separation PolicyThe technology sector, by virtue of the talent it has attracted from all over the world, has helped the U.S. lead the world. But that also means it has the largest number of immigrant workers. That’s probably why it has been the one most attacked on immigration issues and the one that has had to take the most defensive stand.   So it isn’t surprising that the government’s zero tolerance policy and the lack of a policy on reunification elicited unsupportive comments from all technology leaders. Microsoft’s case was no different.The policy itself isn’t anything new: it entails temporary separation of the family while the parents are either prosecuted and/or the identity of the children as belonging to the family is confirmed. But more stringent enforcement is likely what the government was attempting to do when it reportedly separated as many as 2,000 children from those claiming to be their parents. In any case, the President has since signed an executive order forbidding the separation.  Microsoft was charged by its employees on the basis of a blog post from January where it praised the U.S. ICE for “implementing transformative technologies for homeland security and public safety, and adding that “we’re proud to support this work with our mission-critical cloud.”That blog also said that the ICE would be able to “process data on edge devices or utilize deep learning capabilities to accelerate facial recognition and identification” that “help employees make more informed decisions faster.” This is actually an ideal situation that could minimize the plight of immigrants, but the company has now stepped on the back foot.Nadella’s letter to employees says, “Our current cloud engagement with ICE is supporting legacy mail, calendar, messaging and document management workloads.” It also says, “I want to be clear: Microsoft is not working with the U.S. government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border.”Deploying BlockchainMicrosoft has collaborated with consulting firm EY to build a blockchain tool based on the Quorum permissioned distributed ledger (a system that uses a smaller network of nodes to validate transactions thereby saving system resources).The company claims that the technology can be used by authors, software developers and other creators to collect royalties. If true, it would eliminate a host of middlemen and be greatly beneficial for creators, IP holders and other licensors.Microsoft intends to start using the technology in its online gaming system and is already working with Ubisoft for implementation. The companies believe that this will enable them to process millions of transactions a day, so payments can be made daily instead of the current 45 days.“The scale, complexity and volume of digital rights and royalties transactions makes this a perfect application for blockchains. A blockchain can handle the unique nature of each contract between digital rights owners and licensors can be handled in a scalable, efficient manner with an audit trail for the participants,” according to Paul Brody, EY’s Global Innovation Leader for Blockchain.AI Deal with M&SBritain’s Marks & Spencer Group has partnered with Microsoft to jump-start the digitization of its operations. The company is particularly interested in Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that it intends to incorporate in its stores, as well as across its other operations.Microsoft’s retail prowess came into focus last week with the company announcing its own self-checkout system. Since this too will improve customer experience, M&S may the one of the first to adopt the technology. However, neither company offered details of their collaboration plans.Marks & Spencer CEO Steve Rowe did however put out a statement that said, “We want to be at the forefront of driving value into the customer experience using the power of technology,” and, “Working together with Microsoft to understand the full potential of how technology and artificial intelligence can improve the in-store experience for our customers and the efficiencies of our wider operations could be a game-changer for M&S — and for retail.”Acquiring Social Learning Platform FlipgridMicrosoft has acquired a startup that makes a rather popular app for educators. Called Flipgrid, the app allows people to make videos on any topic for easy sharing with others. The Minneapolis-based startup has less than 30 employees that currently serve 20 million users. Last year, it reported an 800% increase in teacher accounts.While losing a leadership position to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) chromebooks and other classroom tools, Microsoft has always put out products to ensure that it remained in contention. As far as Flipgrid is concerned, the company promises to maintain the brand and allow it to operate across platforms. It is offering the product free for now to anyone who’s willing to use it and schools that already have subscriptions will be refunded on a pro rata basis.The attraction for Flipgrid is of course Microsoft’s resources that will enable it to scale and better reach students and teachers across the world.Acquiring AI Startup BonsaiMicrosoft has finally bought the reinforcement learning startup called Bonsai for an undisclosed sum. Last year, it invested in the company through its Microsoft Ventures unit, now called M12. At the time, ABB, Samsung and Siemens also invested in the company to raise $7.6 million, taking its total funding to $13.6 million.The Berkeley-based startup has 42 employees, all of whom will be moving to Microsoft. The company has previously done some work in the energy, HVAC, robotics and autonomous vehicle sectors. Last year, it developed a new technique for programming industrial control systems that was 45X faster than the competing solution from Google.Reinforcement learning allows a developer to teach a system through a trial and error process by creating a simulated environment. It therefore allows both AI engineers and those less experienced to get involved in the training process.Microsoft is betting that AI adoption will be so fast that there will be a skills gap. So the ability to get more people on the job will be a valuable asset.One-Month Price Performance RecommendationsMicrosoft shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better tech plays include buy-ranked stocks like Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report), NetApp Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), Akamai (AKAM  -  Free Report) and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report).

712,AKAM,"The technology sector, which has showed its immense strength against the trade and tariff threats recently on the FANG surge, has lost its ground following news of a potential curb in Chinese investment. In fact, the sector pushed Wall Street even lower on Jun 27 with the S&P 500 Technology Sector dropping 1.5% and Philadelphia semiconductor index sliding 2.5%.What Happened?The Trump administration is seeking to limit many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to that country. The Treasury Department is working on the rules to block companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in ""industrially significant technology.” The measures are expected to be announced by the end of this week and are intended to counter Beijing's Made in China 2025 strategic plan. Under this plan, China wants to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology, including robotics, aircraft and aircraft components, advanced rail equipment, electrical-generation and transmission equipment and pharmaceuticals and advanced medical devices.As such, the potential move would hurt the tech sector more broadly than just the semiconductors and hit revenues, earnings and stock prices of the tech titans having significant exposure to China.Solid OutlookHowever, the outlook for the technology sector has been encouraging. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts.Additionally, the twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher. Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.How to Buy the DipGiven encouraging long-term trends, investors could definitely tap the current dip in the stocks. While there are many stocks in the space having a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), we have highlighted six big technology names (market cap of more than $10 billion) that have seen their Rank surging to the top rank.All these are backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others and have a potential to beat the ongoing trade turmoil.

713,AKAM,"Shares of Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) fell around 2.5% yesterday, after the company updated guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2018.For second-quarter 2018, the company now envisions revenues between $658 million and $663 million, down from the previous guidance of $658 million and $670 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $665.80 million.  Non-GAAP earnings are now projected in the range of 79-81 cents per share, down from the previous guided range of 79-83 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 80 cents. The company lowered outlook citing a stronger dollar since it issued guidance on Apr 30.Owing to currency headwinds, Akamai now expects full-year 2018 revenues between $2.675 billion and $2.705 as compared with the previous guidance of $2.69 billion and $2.72 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.72 billion. However, non-GAAP earnings are now projected in the range of $3.20 per share to $3.30 per share, up from the previous outlook of $3.15-$3.25 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.27 per share. The increase was primarily due to anticipated expansion in the company's operating margins.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price | Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteBottom LineAkamai is likely to continue witnessing high level of network traffic on its platform, which is a major tailwind for the company. Further, the company completed the Nominum acquisition in November last year. This has helped the company expand presence among carrier and enterprise customers.We believe rising demand for cloud-infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products, and online video and adoption of cloud services on a large scale by data centers pose significant growth opportunities for Akamai.Moreover, expansion of the security-product portfolio will lower Akamai’s dependence on media delivery solutions. Further, rapid growth in security is expected to offset loss of large customers in the CDN space.However, declining revenue contribution from large customers in the Internet Platform group namely Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Google, Microsoft and Netflix due to their do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives remains a concern.Akamai carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

714,AKAM,"Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report) has been having a dismal run on the bourses of late. Over the last three months, the stock has lost 36.5%, underperforming the industry’s decline of 4.9%. The current level also lags the S&P 500’s gain of 16.8%.Here we take a look at some of the major issues plaguing Pitney Bowesat the moment:Negative Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend for Pitney Boweshas been dismal. For the current quarter, one analyst revision moved south compared with no movement in the opposite direction over the last 60 days. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings fell 19.2% to $1.18 per share. The stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating probabilities of underperformance in the near term.Falling MarginsIn the first quarter, segment EBITDA margin contracted 580 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 21.8%.Segment EBIT declined 12.1% from the year-ago quarter to $169.1 million. Segment EBIT margin contracted 580 bps on a year-over-year basis to 17.2%.Global Ecommerce reported a loss of $7.7 million wider than a loss of $4.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The loss can primarily be attributed to higher investments on market growth opportunities and operational excellence initiatives. Presort Services EBIT declined due to higher labor and transportation costs.Consolidated adjusted EBIT declined 12.7% from the year-ago quarter to $119.8 million. Adjusted EBIT margin contracted 420 bps to 12.2%.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company outpaced theZacks Consensus Estimate in only two out of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 4.3%.What is Hurting the Stock?In general, licensed software businesses are always susceptible to swings based on large transactions. Given the scale of Pitney Bowes’ business, it remains vulnerable to those swings. Though the company has taken multiple efforts to broaden the base of its business, fluctuations in license revenues pose as a major headwind.This apart, success in managing relationships with providers, including the costs of outsourcing functions and operations not central to the company’s businesses, may also affect its financial performance adversely.Furthermore, most of the company’s revenues are directly or indirectly subject to regulation and oversight by the USPS (United States Postal Service) and foreign postal authorities. It also depends on a healthy postal sector in its operating regions, which could be influenced by legislative or regulatory changes. Further, adverse changes in postal regulations across key markets and intensifying competition may also affect profitability negatively.Changing business mix is likely to impact the bottom line adversely.

715,AKAM,"Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) division Google is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen presence in the rapidly expanding cloud market with its innovative solutions and products.The company’s cloud computing arm, Google Cloud, has recently unveiled the Beta availability of sole-tenant nodes on Google Compute Engine. This will aid in non-sharing of servers with other customers while launching a virtual machine (VM).This new solution aims at facilitating the launch of VM instances of any shape hassle free and efficient for the users. Its placement algorithm helps the users to find the appropriate location to launch their instances. Further, the users also have the option to select the location of their launch manually.All these features will help the company in attracting new customers to the Google Cloud’s platform which will help in improving its market share. This will further aid top-line growth.Coming to the price performance, shares of Alphabet have returned 8.4% on a year-to-date basis, against the industry’s loss of 2.5%.Intensifying Cloud WarWith the latest launch, the company is likely to gain competitive edge against Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) AWS.Microsoft Azure has also single tenant options named G5-series virtual machines and D15 v2 instances, which provide single VM per physical host for memory-intensive applications.Further, AWS also provides a similar kind of service called Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Instances. It also provides physical hardware to be deployed for VM instances.Consequently, we believe Google Cloud will continue to gain popularity in the market with the support of its innovative skills and expanding portfolio of cloud services. Although AWS retained its position as the leader in cloud market in the recently reported quarter, Google Cloud and Azure have also performed well.According to data from Synergy Research Group, in first-quarter 2018, AWS’ market share was the highest, which came in 33%. However, AWS did not witness any year-over-year growth in market share. Nevertheless, Azure seized 13% market share in the first quarter, up from 10% in the year-ago period.Also, Google cloud improved its market share on a year-over-year basis. It accounted for 6% of the market share, which increased from 5% in the year-ago quarter.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. QuoteGoogle Cloud Gaining TractionGoogle is gaining momentum in the cloud market with help of its expanding services portfolio and effective pricing strategy. Google Cloud now generates more than $1 billion of sales per quarter.Per Markets and Markets data, cloud enterprise market is expected to reach $34.42 billion by 2022 by growing at a CAGR of 28.6% between 2017 and 2022.The sole-tenant nodes are useful in cases where companies have to follow strict compliance and regulatory restrictions. Consequently, the latest solution is likely to gain traction among these kind of companies.Further, the company’s recent buyout of Cask Data enables it to improve the productivity of cloud customers by offering data processing services.We note that new innovative services will continue to benefit the market position of Google by improving its clientele. Also, they will continue to help the company to reap benefits from this growing market.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock that can be considered in the broader technology sector is Akamai Technologies (AKAM  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

717,AKAM,"On Jun 8, 2018, Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) was upgraded to Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

For 2019, the earnings estimate is up 5.3% to $3.76 per share over the same time frame.Moreover, Akamai beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in each of the trailing four quarters.The first-quarter 2018 results were impressive.

The revenues were towards the top end of management’s guided range of $596-$610 million. Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus | Akamai Technologies, Inc. Quote Cloud Security Solutions Growth: Key CatalystWe expect Akamai to benefit from solid cloud security solutions growth.

718,AKAM,"Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) shareholders were proved powerless at the annual meeting, a Pew teen survey showed that teens continue to move away from the platform, exclusive news content for Watch appears to be on the way even as fresh regulatory issues made headlines last week:Facebook Shareholder MeetingAll eight Facebook director nominees were elected at its annual meeting, while all six shareholder proposals were rejected.Voting tallies show that a whopping 83% of outside votes were cast in favor of changing the voting system wherein Zuckerberg controls around 60% of the voting rights. Support for Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg was low at around 65%. It’s obvious that investors, both big and small, are unhappy with the way the company is being run, but the voting structure prevents them from taking any corrective action.Facebook's management opposed all the shareholder proposals, so given Zuckerberg’s control over the company, it was easy to reject them.The shareholder proposals involved reporting on ""fake news"" controversies, closing gender pay gaps, adopting responsible tax principles, establishing a board committee on risk management and two proposals that would in effect have Facebook adopting simple majority voting at shareholder meetings.Norges Bank Investment Management, which runs the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, backed all six shareholder proposals. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services backed five of the six proposals, while advising against appointment of five Facebook directors including Zuckerberg. Vanguard Group Inc and Fidelity Investments didn’t comment on their votes.Facebook earlier said that it had adopted the Rooney Rule to bring diversity to its board.Teens Continue to Dump FacebookA Pew Research survey of 750 teens during a one-month period this spring indicates that Facebook’s popularity with teens continues to decline. Pew said that there are more options today than there were a few years back, which could be partly responsible for the decline.And in case you’re wondering if this is a backlash from the privacy problems at the social network that also isn’t true. The survey showed that teens generally have a positive feeling about the impact of social media with a third of them saying it was good for society and 44% staying neutral.The survey also included YouTube in the mix this time, which wasn’t considered back in 2015 when the last such survey took place.Around 95% of teens have access to a smartphone and 45% are practically always online. So it must be at least a little disheartening for Facebook that 85% of teens said they use YouTube, ahead of 72% for Facebook’s Instagram, 69% for Snapchat, 51% for Facebook (down from 71% in the 2015 survey) and 32% for Twitter.Moreover, when asked which apps they used most often, Snapchat topped the list at 35%, followed by YouTube with 32% and Instagram 15%. Only 10% said they used Facebook most often and 3% chose Twitter. Acquiring Instagram does appear to have been a solid decision.The survey also showed that around 97% of boys and 83% of girls are now gamers.Facebook Watch DevelopmentsFacebook is on the verge of acquiring exclusive news shows from a number of providers including Fox News and CNN for its video-focused Watch platform that officially launched last summer.Now, people familiar with the matter are saying that the Fox show will be hosted by Shepard Smith, but further details aren’t available. Group Nine Media’s Now This is expected to start shows later this year. Talks are also on with News Corp’s Dow Jones & Co., BuzzFeed and digital-media company ATTN.News shows from trusted players might take some of the heat off Facebook for allowing fake news to proliferate on the platform.New Zealand Privacy Regulator PeevedFacebook got on the wrong side of New Zealand’s Privacy Commissioner John Edwards after it refused to comply with an order to submit data relating to certain individuals. Facebook at the time said that the country was subject to Irish laws on privacy and local laws wouldn’t apply.Later, Facebook changed its terms of service and said that U.S. laws would apply to the country along with international markets, since the company was domiciled in the U.S. New Zealand is now rewriting its own privacy laws, so Facebook can be forced to comply.Papua New Guinea Banning FacebookPapua New Guinea, the island nation near Australia, is shutting down Facebook for a month to study the impact of the social network on its people and crack down on the fake accounts, false news and other information that is free-flowing across the platform. Since the Internet penetration is reportedly very low at around 12%, there is unlikely to be a huge impact.Trending Feature ScrappedFacebook has finally decided to scrap the trending news feature that has been a source of embarrassment for the company. Initially rolled out to help users quickly find interesting content that their friends and contacts might also be interested in, the feature has at times promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories, a false story about then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly, and a parody news article about magical iPhone features.Facebook has also been pulled up for promoting a certain political viewpoint through the feature. Moreover, getting rid of human curators only worsened the problem. So it’s good to say goodbye.RecommendationsFacebook shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Stocks worth buying in the same industry are Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), The Trade desk (TTD  -  Free Report), 21Vianet Group (VNET  -  Free Report), Akamai Technologies (AKAM  -  Free Report) and Dropbox (DBX  -  Free Report).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

719,AKAM,"Retail ecommerce remains a fairly small part of total retail right now, but because it is a fast-growing part, it is increasingly accounting for a larger share. Just a year ago, we were looking at a mid-single digit share, but this year, eMarketer thinks that share will be a tenth of global retail sales.Ecommerce sales in Asia will account for 14.7% of total retail sales, with China contributing more than half, followed by Japan with slowing growth rates and then India, which will be the fastest growing. Volumes will double by 2021.This year, ecommerce will account for only 8.8% of total retail sales in Western Europe, but grow to 11.4% by 2021. Germany is the top retail market but the UK the leading ecommerce region.A global discussion is important for the sector because the Internet continues to melt away national barriers, making it ever easier to target overseas customers through established platforms.So the social buying behavior of the Chinese and their increasing preference for luxury brands is relevant for U.S. players, as is Alibaba’s growing dominance in Asia. The Indian opportunity is also not to be ignored, as witnessed in Alibaba’s recent investments, Amazon’s aggressive growth plans and Walmart’s acquisition of a controlling stake in leading local player Flipkart.A closer look at these markets shows a bigger, more mature and sophisticated Chinese market and a faster-growing Indian market offering greater scope for innovation.ChinaAccording to Forrester, China will remain the biggest ecommerce market in the next few years generating 9X the size of the Japanese market and 17X the size of the South Korean market by 2020.China made up 67.1% of mcommerce sales worldwide in 2017 (83% of Asia/Pacific sales), driven by its mobile-first internet audience. Sales are expected to nearly triple from $909.93 billion to $2.595 trillion between 2017 and 2021.With the digital revolution in China, many Chinese have multiple devices they use to research a product or shop on. Virtual reality (VR) has started playing a bigger role, taking consumers from the “VR café” experience they enjoyed in 2016 to devices enabling the experience. Moreover, all the big ecommerce companies like Alibaba, Tencent and LeEco will continue to invest heavily in VR this year.Cross-border trade is another driver, as Chinese youngsters are extremely brand conscious and like to buy foreign goods, especially if they’re from the U.S., South Korea or Japan and especially in categories like food, dairy, personal care and beauty. But local brands are increasingly capturing mind share, especially in electronics and mobile phones. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce says that cross-border transaction value will make up 20% of total Chinese foreign business and continue to grow at over 30% a year.The Ministry also sees a growing number of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities coming online with only 10.6 million of the estimated 159.9 million new users between 2015 and 2018 coming from Tier 1 cities.IndiaAccording to a joint study by The Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) and Deloitte, the digital commerce market in India will expand to over $50 billion in 2018 from $38.5 billion in 2017.Last year was a strong one for the market, helped by mobile device adoption and 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi and high speed broadband technologies.In 2017, 82% of shopping queries were made through mobile devices compared to 76% in 2016 with one out of three customers in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities transacting through mobiles.The apparel segment grew the strongest at 72%, followed by food items at 65%, electronic items at 63%, beauty and personal care products at 52% and home furnishings at 49%. Moreover, 28% of regular shoppers were in the 18-25 age group with 42% in the 26-35 group, 28% in the 36-45 group and 2% in the age group of 45-60. 65% of Online Shoppers are male as against 35% female.eMarketer reported that India’s demonetization of the rupee in late 2016 had a greater-than-expected impact on consumer spending, so retail sales grew 11.8% in 2017.EuropeWestern Europe, particularly the UK does a lot of shopping online although the rest of Europe is slower to catch up. As such, most of the opportunity is in this region. Amazon is the leading player, eBay also has a relatively strong presence and there are some strong local players as well.Latin AmericaFocusEconomics estimates that online sales in the region will grow 19% between 2016 and 2021 (compared to the global average of 11%) with total sales value touching $118 billion at the end of the period. However, the number of online shoppers is expected to increase substantially in the next three years, with the average revenue per user growing from $275 to $330.Internet penetration in the region remains low, of which the number of people doing online transactions is also low (in the mid-twenties percentage range). That’s because there are significant challenges to doing business in the region, including logistics issues, traffic, inadequate infrastructure and limited banking facilities.To top it all, there is stiff competition from a large number of local players, the foremost of which is Mercadolibre, which has operations in 18 markets and 50 million+ unique visitors. While it is still the favorite in the region, growth prospects have drawn global players like Amazon, Walmart and Alibaba.The biggest markets are Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.North AmericaBeing one of the most mature ecommerce markets, the technological assistance in shopping transactions is at an advanced stage. So online transactions take place not only on desktop and mobile devices, but also through smart speaker systems like Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. People are also making the most of a host of omnichannel facilities including order online and pickup at store, shop in-store and accept delivery at home, in-car delivery, lockers, smart and secure entry systems, the Amazon Go concept store and more.Warehouse robotics are on the rise, and AR-supported mobile shopping apps are entering the market. With plenty of work remaining to be done, innovation continues in areas like payments, selection, delivery, logistics and loyalty. The use of artificial intelligence is gaining prominence, not only inside new-age chatbots for customer care and other sales operations but also as part of the algorithm driving search results.In this context, the fine line between advertising and buying continues to fade with advertisers looking to close sales quicker and pushing for better measurability of their campaigns. With Amazon entering the advertising business, this process is likely to be precipitated.Overall, most market watchers agree that the intent to buy on Amazon is higher than on Google Shopping and at least half of product searches now start on Amazon. That doesn’t necessarily mean that Google Shopping is a write-off.For one thing, Amazon generally pushes sellers to lower prices, so it may not always be the best place to generate premium sales or protect the brand image. Second, Amazon doesn’t drive traffic to the seller’s site, so it may not always be satisfactory for big brands. Third, the need to sell online especially given the competition from Amazon, is increasing demand for Google Shopping and driving up prices.Today, for instance, advertisers may be willing to pay up to 10x the amount they paid for the same placement 5 years ago. These factors in combination generally make Google Shopping more suitable for big brands and sellers because they’re the ones that can pay what is required for the visibility.Government data indicates that retail ecommerce has outpaced total retail sales growth in recent times even in bad quarters for the sector. Some of this is on account of the continued shift from offline to online retail, as customers (baby boomers) move to online channels. But it’s also because new consumers (millennials) often start out on online channels.These consumers spend more time in a connected, social environment and take for granted many of the online tools previous generations struggled to understand, appreciate and adopt. Therefore, ecommerce will likely continue to outpace total retail sales in the foreseeable future.Ecommerce Industry at a GlanceThe following diagrams seek to define the broad spectrum of companies primarily dependent on the Internet for the distribution of their goods and services, as well as companies that enable these exchanges:Zacks also breaks down each large sector such as Retail/Wholesale and Computer & Technology into groups of companies such that there are a total of 256 such sub-sectors or industries.These “X” industries are then grouped in two: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry Rank)Therefore the Zacks Industry Rank is a good indicator of investment opportunities within an industry at any given time. Moreover, because stocks in the same X industry have certain common positive or negative factors affecting them, it has been observed that there is some positive correlation between them.As depicted above, the Internet-supported buying and selling process includes four Zacks categorized segments, i.e. Internet - Commerce, Internet - Services and Internet Services - Delivery and Internet – Software/Services.Year to date, the Internet – Commerce segment (Zacks Industry Rank #81) outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The market appreciated 28.0% during the period, compared to the S&P 500’s 2.9%.Revenue growth over the past year (ending March 2018 for which all results are available) was 9.7%, off the seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. EPS before non-recurring items was up 7.5% on a slightly higher share count. Forward earnings estimates for 2018 are up slightly from June 2016 although 2019 estimates are down significantly. They are holding steady on a sequential basis.The Internet Services – Delivery segment (Zacks Industry Rank #73) has appreciated 25.4% year to date.Revenue growth of 44.3% was encouraging. Opex remains high. EPS before non-recurring items was $0.00 compared to -$0.03 the previous year on a share count that increased 15.6%. The debt level has shot up although the debt-to-total capitalization ratio remains manageable at around 37%. The rising intangibles could indicate industry consolidation but increase risk. The current ratio remains above unity.The Internet – Services segment appears to be in the doldrums, having lost 2.0% year to date.The business has a stronger margin profile, with revenue growing 6.6% over the past year and EPS growing 3.9% on a share count that dropped 0.5%. The forward earnings estimate for 2018 is down 3.9% while that for 2019 is up 5.3%.The Internet Software/Services segment (Zacks Industry Rank #100) is up 0.4% year to date.Revenue grew 2.1% off a much smaller base with EPS before non-recurring items dropping 13.4% on a slightly higher share count.Earnings TrendsThe broader Retail sector, of which Internet Commerce is a part, is doing better than the S&P 500 so far this quarter. Revenue growth of 7.1% bettered the S&P 500 average of 5.8% although earnings growth of 2.5% fell short of the S&P 500 average of 6.7%. For the fourth quarter, the sector is expected to report revenue and earnings growth of 8.9% and 7.2%, respectively while the S&P 500 is expected to grow 5.8% on revenue and 14.1% on earnings.The other companies we are discussing in the e-commerce outlook fall under the broader Computer & Technology sector. The sector has done much better than retail so far in the fourth quarter, posting revenue and earnings growth of 8.8% and 21.3%, respectively. For the fourth quarter, it’s expected that revenue and earnings growth will average at 10.6% and 22.6%, respectively. Take Your Pick Zacks methodology helps us find the stocks that have upside potential and a strong industry rank means an above average chance of outperforming.

There’s also a new video of Earth in the background for Apple devices.Encouraging numbers: Apple said that the App Store now has 20 million registered developers on iOS, collectively making about $100 billion in revenues from around 500 million visitors per week. Over 350,000 of iOS apps have been written in Swift. Apple Watch sales grew 60% in 2017. Apple TV users have grown 50% over the past year, as it now offers more than 100 video channels including several new live news and sports channels.HomePod Update and Expansion Apple’s HomePod that launched amidst mixed reviews will launch in Canada, France and Germany on June 18 following its launch in the U.S., UK and Australia.The device is also getting a software update that will support both multi-room audio (by pairing with some model speakers from Bang & Olufsen, Denon, Marantz and Sonos using Apple’s AirPlay 2 streaming tech) and stereo audio playback (by pairing two or more HomePods across the house). Just ask Siri.The HomePod will also let users hear upcoming calendar appointments.Apple Allows Updates to Telegram Messaging AppRussian authorities have been trying to crack down on messaging app Telegram, which has been IP hopping to remain in operation while requesting its 14 million users in Russia (it has 200 million across the world) to use VPNs to avoid detection. Russian law requires that all data from apps be stored in servers inside the country and be shared with authorities.Apple has prevented updates to the app after the authorities reportedly wrote to it to remove the app from the App Store and prevent push notifications. Apple didn’t do either. So it isn’t clear what prompted Apple to block updates globally, or whether at all it was related to the problem in Russia and what caused the change of heart. But Apple generally plays by the rules: it earlier pulled NYT from the App Store in China when required by the government.    Apple Won’t Attend EU HearingApple has said that it didn’t want a public hearing on its tax evasion issue in Ireland, because the court is set to rule on its appeal on June 21 and a public hearing at this juncture could be detrimental to its case. Apple was ordered to pay 13 billion euros (11.4 billion pounds) in back taxes to Ireland. Both Apple and Ireland have appealed the court’s decision, although after much delay, Ireland has finally created an escrow account into which Apple could deposit the disputed taxes and last month, Apple deposited the first instalment into it.Samsung Must Pay Apple $539 MillionThe jury has ruled that Samsung must pay Apple the above amount, around $140 million more than the previous order, for infringing on some of Apple’s design patents. At issue here was whether Apple deserved compensation on the basis of end value of the device or the value of components that were copied. The jury appears to have gone with the latter. This brings a long-awaited end to a case that has been dragging on since 2011 on designs (like rounded corners) that don’t seem particularly patent-worthy today. RecommendationsApple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Technology stocks worth buying instead are Akamai Technologies (AKAM  -  Free Report), NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report), Aspen Technology (AZPN  -  Free Report) and SS&C Technologies & Holdings (SSNC  -  Free Report).

723,AKAM,"Zuckerberg was in the EU this week to answer legislators’ questions, the first GDPR cases were filed against Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and the company launched a labeling system for political ads and news in the U.S.Zuckerberg Show in Europe Looks Like a ShamZuckerberg is getting really good at skirting around relevant questions and avoiding showdowns (such as with the UK). The Facebook CEO spent an hour and a half with EU regulators wherein he first delivered an apology speech, after which parliamentarians questioned him and then there was a final session during which he made an attempt at answering the questions by mostly repeating what he had already said in his introductory statement. The meeting format, facilitated by the EU parliament's president Antonio Tajani, was an interesting choice given the way it prevented any back and forth between legislators and Facebook.The 2.7 million users, whose data was shared improperly with Cambridge Analytica just because they were using Facebook, aren’t going to get any compensation. That’s because “no bank account details, credit card information or national ID numbers were shared,” reads a Facebook statement in response to the EU’s concerns. The only things shared were relatively public information like the users’ public profile, their page likes, friends list and birthday. Zuckerberg & Co. figure that the company doesn’t owe anything for what it admits was a breach of trust.As far as information collection on non-Facebook users is concerned, Facebook says that it discloses what it collects and that it expects other websites and apps to do the same via their cookie policy. Facebook also clarifies that it doesn’t profile them although they can still find out what data was collected on them. This doesn’t make much sense because how can a user find out all that Facebook has collected on her if it hasn’t been put together by Facebook and isn’t that what profiling is about.On sharing data between Facebook and WhatsApp, it piously claimed that it was necessary to help fight abusive content or spam on its services.Meanwhile, users in Amsterdam formed what they called a 'Datavakbond' or ""data labor union,"" to negotiate directly with Facebook and Google on data usage matters and also perhaps push for the creation of a paid service that wouldn’t collect data. The group demands “reasonable compensation, or at least better working conditions” for the data supplied. Although based in the Netherlands, the union is looking to rope in users from across the world.First GDPR ComplaintsLong-time Facebook critic Max Schrems wasted no time in filing complaints under GDPR against Facebook, Facebook-owned Instagram, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Google's Android on behalf of unnamed individual users. The complaints were filed through his not for profit organization called noyb (none of your business) with data protection agencies in Austria, Belgium, France and Hamburg in Germany since these countries already have data protection agencies with a strong record of defending privacy rights.The bone of contention is forced consent, i.e. Facebook blocking users that don’t consent to data collection. Since the law requires that compulsory consent can only be obtained where it is necessary for the provision of the service, courts will now be required to clarify whether targeted advertising is a strictly necessary part of providing a social networking service. If guilty, it may be liable for a fine of up to 4% of its global revenue.The Facebook response, through chief privacy officer, Erin Egan was: ""We have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the GDPR. We have made our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find and introduced better tools for people to access, download, and delete their information. Our work to improve people's privacy doesn't stop on May 25th. For example, we're building Clear History: a way for everyone to see the websites and apps that send us information when you use them, clear this information from your account, and turn off our ability to store it associated with your account going forward.""So in a way, Facebook admitted that everything required to be GDPR compliant wasn’t completed by May 25 but it was promising compliance sometime soon. Lawmakers may consider its approach given that the scope and scale of the new law doesn’t have any precedent.This is just the beginning of a new era as promised by noyb, which was set up with the sole purpose of “strategic litigation” around the EU’s GDPR policy.Labeling Political Ads/NewsFacebook has launched an initiative in the U.S. that will see all political ads and content, including from reputed news publishers containing the “paid for by” label. Clicking on the label takes users to an archive of records about who paid for the content as well as the location, age and gender of people that saw it. Facebook is including not just political content but also around 20 “issues” that play a role in elections such as abortion, guns, immigration and foreign policy.  The News Media Alliance, representing about 2,000 publishers including the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal isn’t thrilled because its members don’t appreciate being lumped with “lesser” organizations that might however be reporting the truth.“Your plan to group quality publishers alongside political advocacy, which the ad archive will do, dangerously blurs the lines between real reporting and propaganda,” the group’s CEO David Chavern said in a letter to Zuckerberg. “This treatment of quality news as political, even in the context of marketing, is deeply problematic.” One might wonder what the problem is with labelling political news as such, but there’s a reason for this approach: the group wants the creation of an elite club that will admit them to hide their funding sources but not others’.Facebook representatives initially said that they would deal with news publishers separately and not through News Media Alliance and also that they had made good progress with them. But Bloomberg reported that within hours of its publishing the news along with the opposition from the News Media Alliance, Facebook decided to rethink the plan. Talk about politics!Facebook Home ServicesFacebook added home services to its marketplaces through partnerships with Handy, HomeAdvisor and Porch. The service lists home service professionals (along with reviews, locations and credentials) who can also be contacted through Facebook Messenger.Deb Liu, vice president of Facebook’s Marketplace says that “More people ask for recommendations related to home services on Facebook in the US than any other topic. Since the beginning of the year, millions of people have asked their friends for suggestions related to home services, such as house cleaners, plumbers and contractors.” Facebook must be listening closely.Russia to Investigate Facebook, WhatsAppThe TASS news agency reports that Russia’s telecommunications watchdog Roskomnadzor is investigating Facebook and WhatsApp to see if the companies are in compliance with a Russian law that requires the location of user data on Russian servers. The investigation is expected to be completed by December. RecommendationsFacebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

725,AKAM,"International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) recently announced its plans to create around 1,800 jobs over a span of two years on the back of new investments and initiatives it will undertake in France.New graduates and experienced technical professionals will be hired for emerging technology roles pertaining to data science, cloud computing, Internet of things (“IoT”), artificial intelligence (“AI”), cognitive business, cybersecurity and blockchain. These skills have been termed “new collar” by IBM's chairman, president and CEO Ginni Rometty.The newly announced jobs include the 400 hirings IBM had announced in AI-domain for research at the French AI for Humanity summit in March.The investment and “new collar” recruitment news comes in the wake of the Tech for Good summit in Paris, hosted by the president of France, Emmanuel Macron. At the summit, Macron met IBM’s Rometty, Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Satya Nadella, Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) Mark Zuckerberg, to mention a few.Tech Crunch revealed that Le Monde, French daily, noted that IBM had been reducing its team since 2012 in France. The new hirings roughly bring back the previous head count.Expanding Foothold in FranceBodes WellIBM’s client base in France comprises Orange Bank, Crédit Mutuel, national state-owned railway company, SNCF and Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, LVMH. A majority of these clients leverage IBM’s Watson to accelerate their respective business processes.Furthermore, IBM intends to develop more “local competitiveness hubs” with the help of domestic public and private partners. Notably, it currently operates two hubs in Lille and Strasbourg.The company also announced partnership with the French government on its P-TECH (Pathways to Technology Early College High School) education model.

726,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM  -  Free Report) joined forces with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MUFG  -  Free Report) to deliver a new hyper-scale online payment network in Japan by first half of 2020. The payment network will be designed and deployed on Akamai Intelligent Platform and leverage blockchain architecture.Primarily aimed at “processing more than one million transactions per second at latencies of less than two seconds per transaction”, the platform is envisioned to be “extensible to 10 million transactions per second.” This hyper-scale transaction process will ensure material cost efficiencies.Akamai and MUFG prioritize scalability, latency and security aspect of the new network. The comprehensive set of solutions is likely to enhance current payment processing, micropayments, pay-per-use, and other IoT-based payment transactions.Per McKinsey report, global payments industry generated 34% of total banking revenues in 2016, surging 27% in five-year time span. Per McKinsey’s Global Payments Map data, industry growth is likely to average 7% by 2020 to reach $2 trillion.Offering this network for use to the Japan’s payment network will boost Akamai’s top-line.Expanding Foothold in Blockchain Bodes WellBlockchain is a technology that allows cryptocurrencies to exist as it tracks transactions relating to digital assets. However, it can also track documents which make it especially attractive to those in the banking, finance and insurance industries.

727,AKAM,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) audiobook unit, Audible announced its collaboration with Hello Sunshine, an American media company that produces films, unscripted stories and TV shows.Per the partnership, Audible will launch Book Club x Hello Sunshine in June, which is an online community where Reese Witherspoon, the founder of Hello Sunshine selects a book on a monthly basis. It also offers space for discussion and Q&A session with author.Consequently, listeners of Audible will now be able to enjoy the audio play of the books curated by Reese, which mainly feature unique stories celebrating women. This is likely to attract more listeners to Audible platform.Further, both the companies are planning to introduce Audible Original by Hello Sunshine in the later part of the year, containing original audio productions.Audiobooks Hold PromiseAmazon is well poised to reap benefits from growing demand for audiobooks in today’s fast paced world where readers prefer listening to a book instead of reading it. We believe the latest move will help Amazon in gaining momentum in the audiobook space.Notably, Amazon stock has returned 35.2% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 19.9%.Last year, the audiobook segment gained significant traction in the digital publishing industry, particularly the United States. The segment generated $2.5 billion revenues, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18%. Additionally, there was an increase of 33.9% in the number of audiobooks published according to Audiobook Publishers Association.The recent partnership of Amazon will improve the company’s offerings by expanding the audio content and book portfolio. The readers will now have access to the best collection of Hello Sunshine audios. Currently, Audible’s strong portfolio contains more than 425,000 audio programs from renowned publishers.This is expected to bolster customer base of the company which will further drive top-line growth.Further, Amazon’s customer friendly features remain positive. Audible is based on subscription model and offers credits roll over plan that benefits the listeners who take more than a month to finish a book.According to the data from the research firm named Codex Group, Audible accounts for 41% of U.S. audiobook sales.Improving CompetitionWith the latest partnership, Amazon is trying to reinforce its position in the audiobook market where there are other major players like — Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Earlier this year, Walmart teamed up with Japan’s Rakuten to form a joint venture and sell e-books and audiobooks in order to challenge Amazon.Moreover, the ongoing battle between Amazon and Google is intensifying with their innovative products competing in many of the emerging markets.Notably, Amazon’s initiatives toward expanding content portfolio give it an edge over Google Play Audiobooks.Recently, Google has updated its audiobook by adding some useful features, which was lacking previously in comparison with Audible. However, Amazon still enjoys a first mover advantage in the audiobook space with its huge collection of books.Moreover, pricing strategies of both the companies are different and Amazon seems to be a better option for the regular book readers or the ones who have strong interest in book reading.Amazon’s subscription based model seems to be the best for the ones who read more than one book in a month. Meanwhile, the readers have to purchase the audio version of the book which they like from Google Play since there is no subscription service offered by Google in this particular sector.Even in case of one book a month, Audible’s Gold Plan is still cheaper than the cost of one book on Google Play.Amazon.com, Inc.

728,AKAM,"Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Micron (MU  -  Free Report) have announced the completion of qualification for the industry’s first 1Tb - 4bits/cell, or Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND dies on 64 layer 2nd Gen 3D NAND. This brings 33% greater density than the current generation 64 layer 3bits/cell (TLC) technology, enabling faster read-write speeds. Pricing and other details such as which products will receive the first silicon were missing.The companies also announced progress in the development of third generation 96-layer NAND that will enable them to maintain their cost/density leadership.Intel and Micron have been R&D partners for several years, but earlier this year, they announced that after the 96-layer development, they would be parting ways. This makes sense because Intel’s memory ambitions indicate that the two companies will increasingly be pitted against each other.Intel reportedly has a deal with China’s government-backed Tsinghua Unigroup that will allow the Chinese company to use Intel NAND technology from its Dalian fab to manufacture consumer flash memory products and sell them under its UNIC brand. It isn’t clear whether technology transfer is part of the deal but for the Chinese government, making China self-sufficient (or at least less dependent) in semiconductors is a stated goal (for which it needs to make good the technology gap).The government has vowed to pump $161 billion over 10 years into the industry for the purpose. For Intel, it’s a very big deal because it will get Intel silicon into more devices, since China is the manufacturing capital of the world, especially of electronic goods. It could also help it increase its memory market share.According to Research and Markets, The global NAND flash market will grow at a CAGR of 15.13% during the period 2018-2022 driven by the increasing adoption of smartphones and tablets with features such as gesture control, fingerprint scanners, image scanners, and GPS. Gaining momentum is 3D NAND, driven not only by smartphones, tablet PCs and notebooks but also enterprise adoption in data centers due to its reliability and efficiency.Intel is a late entrant in the segment, with its 3.7% share in 2017 fetching it the seventh position after SK Hynix (27.8%), Micron (25.1%), Toshiba (11.5%), Sony (10.5%) Samsung (8.4%) and Texas Instruments (6.0%).Here’s a look at how the two stocks have done over the past month- Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Micron has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other buy-ranked stocks include Delphi Technologies (DLPH  -  Free Report), Akamai Technologies (AKAM  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).

730,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this content delivery network (CDN) and cloud infrastructure-service provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, Akamai has delivered positive earnings surprises for 10 straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company came up with an average positive surprise of 5.2%.In the last reported quarter, Akamai posted non-GAAP earnings of 69 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Moreover, revenues of $663 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $647 million, and increased 8% from the year-ago tally.We expect the huge level of network traffic catered to by Akamai’s cloud-delivery platform to have acted as a key top-line booster for the company. A growing customer base, Nominum’s acquisition, improvised portfolio of solutions, and robust over-the top (OTT) content viewing segment are other positives.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Akamai is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Akamai carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.32%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings remained unchanged over the past 60 days.However, on a year-over-year basis, the company is likely to record growth for revenues as well as earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 70 cents, representing a rise of 1.5% from the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $654 million, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q1 ResultsAkamai is likely to continue witnessing high level of network traffic on its platform, which is a major tailwind for the company. Also, the company completed the Nominum acquisition in November last year. This has helped the company expand its presence among carrier and enterprise customers.We believe rising demand for cloud-infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products, and online video and adoption of cloud services on a large scale by data centers pose significant growth opportunities for Akamai.The two recently-launched products — Enterprise Threat Protector and Bot Manager Premier — are likely to attract new customers. Akamai expects revenues from the security business to exceed $1 billion within the next four to five years, driven by strong adoption of Kona Site Defender, Prolexic, Bot Manager and Web Application Protector Product offerings.Moreover, expansion of the security-product portfolio will lower Akamai’s dependence on media delivery solutions. Further, rapid growth in security is expected to offset loss of large customers in the CDN space.However, declining revenue contribution from large customers in the Internet Platform group namely Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Google, Microsoft and Netflix due to their do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives remains a concern for the company.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

731,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) recently unveiled new enhancements to improve its cloud security solutions to ensure smooth digital operations.Larger botnets and digital transformation of businesses have intensified the volume and risk posed by Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) attacks. Akamai is offering additional capacity to its scrubbing centers to effectively deal with such risks.To protect APIs and apps, and target threats associated with bots and credential abuse posed by them, the company strengthened its Akamai Bot Manager capabilities. In this regard, a new client SDK for mobile applications has also been designed.Further, enhanced security analytics will ensure secure browsing through the support for HTTPS with TLS 1.3 that improves visibility into emerging risks and threat actors.Product Enhancements to Provide More SecurityAkamai's Enterprise Application Access aids IT and security teams to shift to ‘Zero Trust’ security architecture. Consequently, this will empower the new cloud businesses with a secure single sign-on and unified access.The company’s mPulse real user monitoring solution is now updated with application delivery, perceived performance and page construction metrics. This will aid Akamai’s platform to deliver fast as well as secure mobile and web experience.According to company's Retail Performance Report, a 2 second delay in loading a web page increases bounce rate by 103%. Further, if it requires more than 3 seconds loading time, 53% of mobile browsers leave the web page. Given these factors, mobile networks will require technological advancements from content delivery networks like Akamai’s.More Security for DevOpsTo empower DevOps, company has leveraged its Kona Site Defender to add support to automate application security for API protection. Akamai API Gateway offers an integrated architecture that caters to managing and securing APIs thereby mitigating risks of abuse and misuse.In order to protect OTT service providers and other broadcasters from cyber threats, Akamai has deployed additional capabilities including Media Services Live featuring liveOrigin which will provide low latency video streaming. Further, detection service of company’s Broadcast Operations Control Center ensures real-time monitoring. Dynamic Ad Insertion capabilities will boost addressable advertising.Cloud Security Solutions Gaining TractionRobust adoption of Akamai’s security solutions has boosted its top-line. The company has returned 21.5% in the past year, outperforming  the industry's rally of 5.9%.Notably, company’s Enterprise Threat Protector that blocks access of employees to infected sites is expected to gain from the Nominum acquisition, completed in Nov, 2017. Cloud Security solutions segment revenues were up 32% year over year to $135 million comprising 20% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017.Per an Akamai report, greater than 40% online login attempts are malicious. Per the company’s Ponemon Institute report,breaches based on malicious login attempts cost $60 million per year on an average to a digital business. These reports reinforce the fact that large enterprises are expected to increase their security budgets to efficiently address security concerns.Recently, the company partnered with Duo Security to empower workers with “remote access VPN alternative”. Duo Security will verify the user trying to access any application which is offered by Enterprise Application Access of Akamai.Per a recent report by Gartner, the cloud based security services market is anticipated to reach $8.9 billion by 2020 from $5.9 billion in 2017.We believe Akamai is well poised to make the most of this growth opportunity by strengthening its solid cloud security portfolio through acquisitions and partnerships in this regard.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAkamai carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Mellanox (MLNX  -  Free Report) and Micron (MU  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

732,AKAM,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to remain on a growth trajectory. The company’s division Google in this regard recently announced that Play Audiobooks is set to get updated.The latest move will add smart resume, bookmarks, speed controls, family library to audiobooks, which will be compatible with Google Assistant routines.Smart resume, probably the most interesting feature, takes the user back to the beginning of a sentence in case the listener had lost track. Bookmark will allow listeners to mark their favorite part of the playback so that they can go through that particular part anytime they want. Speed controls will speed up or slow down the playback per the listener’s wish.Google Assistant routines will allow listeners to automate the playback according to their routine. Also, family library, which enables the users to share the audiobook with five members for free, has been extended to 13 new countries — Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Chile, Mexico, Japan and South Africa.Last year, the audiobook segment reportedly gained momentum in the digital publishing industry with the United States being the significant market. The segment generated $2.5 billion revenues, reflecting an 18% year-over-year growth. Additionally, there was a 33.9% increase in the number of audiobooks published according to Audiobook Publishers Association.Coming to the share price performance, the shares of Alphabet have returned 18.8% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 13.6%.  Features to Boost Competitive PositionThe latest features will improve the customer base of the audiobooks since in today’s fast paced world readers prefer to listen to a book instead of reading it. This is likely to generate higher revenues on the Google Play platform.Moreover, the added features are expected to improve Google’s competitive position against Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Audible.Notably, Google Play Audiobooks require no subscription and provide a preview of the book before buying it making it consumer friendly as compared with audiobooks on Audible, which require a trial subscription before buying it.Robust Product Portfolio — Key Catalyst for GoogleGoogle’s robust product portfolio is a key catalyst. Along with the latest audiobook, the company recently added GIFs to its Google image library by acquiring Tenor, a GIF search platform. This will cater to the several GIF related search requests on its platform.Last year, the company introduced Google Pay, a digital wallet and recently redesigned the Google Wallet P2P for sending and requesting money and developed it into Google Pay Send.

738,AKAM,"TiVo Corporation (TIVO  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2017, wherein its revenues declined year over year but earnings per share marked significant improvement. This upswing in bottom-line results mainly stemmed from better-than-expected cost synergies generated through the integration of Rovi-TiVo merger as well as benefits from the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.It should be noted that TiVo Corporation was formerly known as Rovi Corporation. Upon successfully completing the acquisition of TiVo Inc. in early September 2016, Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name.Quarter in DetailTiVo’s revenues slipped 15.1% year over year to $214.2 million, mainly due to the loss of four settlement deals for the company’s Legacy TiVo Time Warp IP that are going to end in mid-2018. Apart from this, the company faces the challenge of a tough year-over-year comparison as it noted that “Last year our core business benefited from significant IP catch-up revenues associated with settling the Samsung litigation.”However, quarterly revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $212.2 million.The company’s revenues from the Licensing, services and software division dropped 13.4% year over year to $206.5 million, contributing 96% to total revenues. The decline was mainly due to the aforementioned settlement of the Samsung litigation.The Hardware division’s revenues declined to $7.7 million from $13.9 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and contributed 4% to total revenues. This plunge resulted from the above-mentioned loss of four settlement deals for its Legacy TiVo Time Warp IP. The company stated that the decline was as expected and in future too revenues from this division will fall as it is moving “towards becoming hardware agnostic and solely a provider of software and solutions.”In terms of business segments, IP Licensing revenues dipped approximately 19% year over year to $113.7 million and contributed 53% to total revenues. Under the IP Licensing segment, revenues of the U.S. Pay TV Providers and New Media, International Pay TV Providers and Other decreased 4.4% to $63.3 million and 58.4% to $17.2 million, respectively. Revenues from Consumer Electronics Manufacturers, however, climbed 9.6% year over year to $12.9 million.Product revenues were down 10.2% to $100.5 million, contributing 47% to total revenues. Under this segment, all categories declined year over year. Revenues from Platform Solutions, Software and Services, and Other categories plunged 6.3% to $80.6 million, 19.7% to $19.2 million and 65.8% to $0.7 million, respectively.The company’s total cost and expenses decreased 9.1% to $211.3 million from $232.4 million incurred in the year-ago quarter. TiVo’s operating income reduced to $2.9 million from $19.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to lower revenues, partially offset by decreased cost and expenses.TiVo reported earnings of 15 cents in the quarter, registering a surge of 87.5% from the year-ago quarter earnings of 8 cents. The year-over-year jump was mainly due to a $26.6 million or approximately 22 cents per share benefit from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.TiVo exited the reported quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $269.8 million compared with $225.2 million at the end of the previous quarter.Due to the ongoing “in-depth review of business, cost structure and options to maximize shareholder value” the company did not provide any outlook for 2018. It stated that once the process gets over, it will issue its projections for the current year.TiVo Corporation Price and EPS Surprise TiVo Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | TiVo Corporation QuoteOur TakeFollowing the company’s fourth-quarter results, the company’s shares jumped more than 12% during yesterday’s after-hour trade. However, quarterly results were not the reason behind this upswing. The company’s announcement of evaluating strategic options, such as mergers and acquisitions, including the possibility of going private, made it attractive among investors in a motive to cash in later.The digital home-entertainment services and solutions provider, during its fourth-quarter earnings conference call, stated that ""TiVo's stock price is at a level that the company and its board do not believe reflects the true value of the business.""It should be noted that TiVo is currently highly undervalued considering its P/E multiple. The stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 7.1x, which is much lower than the industry average of 36.0x. Also, the company’s shares have depreciated 17% over the past year, while its industry has rallied 25% during the same time frame.Furthermore, the company’s robust fundamental post merger of Rovi-TiVo makes it more attractive now. The merger has brought together two leading players in the media entertainment industry, with complementary products and services, as well as a number of patented technologies.The new TiVo is the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. The company has a diverse product portfolio that ranges from interactive program guide to DVR. The combined entity has emerged as the world’s leading media and entertainment provider to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience.Apart from this, the new company has more than 6,000 issued and pending patents, which provide it a competitive advantage over other media and tech giants.Looking at its cheap valuation and growth fundamentals, we believe TiVo is an ideal acquisition candidate. Thus, it is wise to hold this stock at the moment.TiVo currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report), Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and The Trade Desk Inc. (TTD  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Expected long-term EPS growth rates for Akamai, Facebook and The Trade Desk are 12.8%, 26.5% and 25%, respectively.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

741,AKAM,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) is slated to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether or not this consumer transaction technology provider will be able to deliver a positive surprise.Notably, NCR has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all the occasions, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NCR has a Zacks Rank #3 and its Earnings ESP is +2.62%. Therefore, the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings is pegged at 86 cents per share. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.74 billion.Factors to ConsiderThe company enriched its product portfolio during the quarter with the launch of a mobile point-of-sale (POS) solution called Ring Up by NCR Silver, whose payment processing is powered by Worldpay. This POS solution is targeted at U.S. based micro businesses. The company also launched a new “end-to-end mobile payment solution” in the month of October.Additionally, the company, in partnership with Samsung Electronics America, launched NCR Silver Quantum, “all-in-one point-of-sale (POS) commerce station featuring an integrated payment device with mobile wallet acceptance capability.”Notably, during the quarter, the company announced that its digital transformation platform will be enriched by “an 800-store chain customer”. Moreover, a prominent supermarket chain in Israel, named Bitan Wines Group, is looking to install NCR FastLane SelfServ Checkouts. Arizona based Tucson Federal Credit has implemented NCR’s Interactive Teller software for the betterment of customer experience at different branch locations.Furthermore, the company is also looking for growth opportunities via expansion of its channel program. Also, the company completed divestment of the remaining IPS assets to Turbon Group of Companies. We believe the completion of the transaction is a testament to the fact that NCR is focusing on growth in the software and services sector.However, we remain cautious about the weakness in the ATM business as large customers across North America, India, the Middle East and Africa delayed their spending.NCR Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NCR Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NCR Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, per our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: NVIDIA Corp.

742,AKAM,"All eyes will be on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) this week as investors continue to expect an overwhelming quarterly report from the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. For the last two years, this graphic chipmaker has impressed investors with its stellar performance, wherein the company’s quarterly revenues have been advancing at a rate more than 50%, earnings have tripled and shares have displayed more than six-fold growth, consequently.Although new markets, including datacenter, autonomous vehicle and cryptocurrency will continue to record increase in revenue contribution, the company’s gaming business remains the core segment on which its overall growth depends. Notably, the segment has contributed 59% to the third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues and registered year-over-year growth of 25.5%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, this segment is likely to witness year-over-year growth of 16.5% and reach $1.57 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuotePascal GPUs Driving Segment’s GrowthThe year-over-year growth expectation is mainly driven by the strong adoption of NVIDIA’s Pascal architecture-based graphics processing units (GPUs).For a thrilling gaming experience, one needs better visualization and speed, and NVIDIA has what gamers want, with its strong portfolio of Pascal architecture-based GPUs, which is considered the best by market experts. As gaming enthusiasts always intend to play games at the best graphic settings, they usually upgrade their PCs with more advanced GPUs.NVIDIA has been able to tap this opportunity by continuously rolling out more advanced GPUs, including GTX 1080, GTX 1070 and Titan X, over the past year. This move has paid well as highlighted by the impressive year-over-year growth in the segment’s revenues over the last four-five quarters.The latest monthly report of Steam also depicts strong adoption of NVIDIA’s GPUs. Per the report, NVIDIA’s GPUs have captured a much larger market share during the period between November 2017 and January 2018, when compared with the preceding quarter.Thus, this indicates that strong adoption of the company’s graphic cards continued into the fourth quarter as well, the benefit of which will certainly reflect in its results.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.Tough Y/Y Comparison & Competition Might Impede GrowthIt should be noted that the growth rate have been slowing down since the fiscal third quarter, when compared with the previous four quarters. The company has registered approximately 50% year-over-year increase during this period, while in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the growth rate slowed down to around 25%. We believe this is so because of tough year-over-year comparisons and the to-be-reported quarter is likely to see the impact of the same too.Apart from this, increasing competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) might also hurt the fiscal fourth-quarter top-line performance. Notably, with not much remarkable presence in the high-end graphic-chip market till July 2017, Advanced Micro Devices enhanced its footprint by introducing the Vega series of GPUs — Vega 56 and Vega 64 — in August 2017. Therefore, we believe this might had hurt NVIDIA’s market share in the quarter under review, in turn impacting the segment’s top-line performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils for NVIDIA’s Overall Performance?Our proven model conclusively shows that NVIDIA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chance of beating estimates.

743,AKAM,"CDW Corporation (CDW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Feb 7, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise. Notably, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and came in line with the other two. It has an average earnings surprise of 2.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors Likely to Drive ResultsCDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Growth in customer channels and continued strategic achievements are a couple of positive factors which are likely to drive performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, CDW’s robust product portfolio and product refreshes remain positives.Furthermore, for the past few quarters, the company has been expanding its solutions suite and enhancing the services capabilities, which is likely to positively impact the quarterly results. Moreover, the company’s investment strategies to deliver integrated solutions both in and outside of the U.K., along with the international sales team and its international-branded website, will likely prove conducive to its performance.Nonetheless, the company’s high debt burden might weigh on the bottom-line results. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had total debt of approximately $3.39 billion. Such high-debt levels increase leverage risks and interest costs which may dent the company’s profitability.CDW Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CDW Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CDW Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CDW is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

744,AKAM,"FireEye Inc. (FEYE  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is if this cybersecurity company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, FireEye has delivered a positive earnings surprise for 14 straight quarters. In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered a remarkable average positive surprise of 64%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of a penny, which is narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 3 cents. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $193.6 million, up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter tally.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?FireEye is a specialized provider of a security platform against cyber-attacks to enterprises and governments. The company’s consistent efforts toward bringing in new and advanced products have been attracting a wide range of customers. Notably, FireEye’s Essentials product, which is a lower-cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management platform, targets smaller and mid-market companies. The company’s Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid offerings, a lower-cost intelligent threat-detection solution, targets large enterprises and mid-market businesses. Analysts covering the stock believe the company’s continued focus on enhancing its product capabilities will bring in new customers, in turn, driving its top-line performance further.Additionally, FireEye’s strategic acquisitions are anticipated to drive growth. It’s acquisition of iSIGHT Partners in 2016 has strengthened the company’s capabilities by offering an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size which other security providers find difficult to match. FireEye has also taken over Invotas, a firm specializing in improving response times following a cyber-attack. Its product — Security Orchestrator — is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs. These acquisitions will likely be beneficial for the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results.Furthermore, the company’s move of shifting its business model to subscription-based cloud services from selling software is praiseworthy. Though shifting the business model to subscription-based services will generate lower revenues initially, but the same will remain stable over the long run, as organizations usually renew subscriptions with the existing products or even with higher versions. Moreover, subscription-based services generate higher gross margins. We believe though a shift in business model might offset the benefit of higher revenues from product launches and acquisitions, it will support the company’s bottom-line results.FireEye, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FireEye, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FireEye, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that FireEye is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

746,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 6.The company has delivered an average positive surprise of 4.32% in the last four quarters.In the third quarter, Akamai reported earnings of 62 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents per share. The figure slumped 9% from the year-ago quarter and remained flat on a sequential basis. Moreover, revenues increased 6% year over year to $621 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $610 million.We expect the huge level of network traffic catered to by Akamai’s cloud delivery platform to be a key top-line booster for the company. A growing customer base, Nominum’s acquisition, improvised portfolio of solutions and robust over-the top (OTT) content viewing segment are other positives.Guidance & EstimatesFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Akamai expects total revenues to be in the range of $638 million to $656 million, assuming 1.5 months of Nominum revenues. Non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 60 cents to 65 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 63 cents per share. Revenues are estimated to be $647.92 million for the quarter.The integration of SOASTA and Nominum is anticipated to negatively impact EBITDA margins in the near term. In 2018, EBITDA margins are expected to be in the mid-30% range and operating margin is expected to be in the lower 20% range.Moreover, shares of Akamai have gained 40.6% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 17.6% rally of the industry it belongs to. Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsAkamai stated that it witnessed high level of network traffic on its platform during the quarter, which is anticipated to be a major tailwind for the company’s revenues.During the quarter, the company completed the previously announced acquisition of Nomium.. This will help the company in expanding its presence among carrier and enterprise customers.Moreover, the company is reported to be working with Morgan Stanley to explore strategic alternatives, possibly including a sale. This strategic review initiative was taken by the company after hedge fund Elliott Management urged the company to take initiatives to maximize shareholder value.The company released the State of the Internet/Security report in the quarter, which highlighted a risein the number of web application attacks on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the expanded security portfolio will help Akamai gain significant share in the security market.The company had launched two products — Enterprise Threat Protector and Bot Manager Premier. Akamai expects revenues from the security business to exceed $1 billion within the next four to five years driven by strong adoption of Kona Site Defender, Prolexic, Bot Manager and Web Application Protector Product offerings.Moreover, expansion of the security product portfolio will lower Akamai’s dependence on the media delivery solutions. Further, rapid growth in security is expected to offset loss of large customers in the content delivery network (CDN) space.We believe that rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video and adoption of cloud services on a large scale by data centers pose significant growth opportunity for Akamai.However, declining revenue contribution from large customers in the Internet Platform group namely, Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix due to their do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives remains a concern for the company.What Does Our Model SayAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Akamai has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.73%, which indicates a likely positive earnings surprise.

Shares have added about 8.2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsAkamai reported non-GAAP earnings of 62 cents per share for third-quarter 2017, down 9% year over year (down 5% adjusted for foreign exchange and the dilutive effect of the Soasta acquisition).

Revenues from Internet Platform Customers were $51 million, down 13% year over year but flat on a sequential basis. The year-over-year plunge was primarily attributed to declining revenue contribution from large customers, namely Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix due to their do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives.Revenue DetailsAkamai currently reports its business under three main divisions – Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier. It started this practice effective second-quarter 2016, marking a shift to a customer focused structure.Media Division – Revenues decreased 1% year over year (up 3% when the impact of large Internet platform customers was excluded) to $273 million.Web Division – Revenues increased 14% year over year (when adjusted for foreign exchange) to $328 million.

The company’s Enterprise Threat Protectorsolution that blocks access of employees to infected sites is expected to gain from the Nominum acquisition, expected to be completed in the later part of the year.Management is also optimistic about the robust over-the top (OTT) content viewing segment. With prominent names like Disney turning to direct consumer offers, the company is particularly hopeful about its friendly terms with well-known broadcasters.The company hosted a single media event during the quarter that had around 17 terabits per second of traffic. This aided in the establishment of a record 60 terabits per second of traffic on Akamai’s platform for that day.Management is positive about the increase in OTT audience. The addition of a new streamlining technology that provides an experience which is a few seconds ahead of satellite and a new media client software meant for better viewing experience will aid long term growth.MarginsAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $226 million, up $2 million from the previous quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, down 1% from the second quarter, primarily due to the SOASTA acquisition impact.Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAkamai ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company spent $129 million on share repurchases of around 3 million during the quarter.Management remains optimistic about the strong balance sheet that aided the acquisition of SOASTA in the second quarter and the anticipated closing of the acquisition of Nominum in the fourth quarter.GuidanceManagement expects fourth-quarter revenues to be in the range of $638 million to $656 million, assuming 1.5 months of Nominum revenues.The integration of SOASTA and Nominum is anticipated to negatively impact EBITDA margins in the near term. In 2018, EBITDA margins are expected to be in the mid-30% range and operating margin is expected to be in the lower 20% range.With an improving media and web business growth rate, management anticipates to return to high 30% EBITDA margin range going ahead.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

However, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers, the figure was up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Services and Support solutions came in at $57 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis.Geographically, U.S. revenues increased 1% while International revenues soared 18% (when adjusted for foreign exchange) on a year-over-year basis.Management noted that the growing adoption of Kona Site Defender, Prolexic offerings and the company’s expansion in the fields of bot management backed the impressive performance of the cloud security solutions segment.Bot Manager Premier,which uses machine learning technologies acquired from Cyberfed to distinguish between human users and machines, has also seen accelerated growth. The company’s Enterprise Threat Protectorsolution that blocks access of employees to infected sites is expected to gain from the Nominum acquisition, expected to be completed in the later part of the year.Management is also optimistic about the robust over-the top (OTT) content viewing segment. With prominent names like Disney turning to direct consumer offers, the company is particularly hopeful about its friendly terms with well-known broadcasters.The company hosted a single media event during the quarter that had around 17 terabits per second of traffic. This aided in the establishment of a record 60 terabits per second of traffic on Akamai’s platform for that day.Management is positive about the increase in OTT audience. The addition of a new streamlining technology that provides an experience which is a few seconds ahead of satellite and a new media client software meant for better viewing experience will aid long term growth.Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise |  QuoteMarginsAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $226 million, up $2 million from the previous quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, down 1% from the second quarter, primarily due to the SOASTA acquisition impact.Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAkamai ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company spent $129 million on share repurchases of around 3 million during the quarter.Management remains optimistic about the strong balance sheet that aided the acquisition of SOASTA in the second quarter and the anticipated closing of the acquisition of Nominum in the fourth quarter.GuidanceManagement expects fourth-quarter revenues to be in the range of $638 million to $656 million, assuming 1.5 months of Nominum revenues.The integration of SOASTA and Nominum is anticipated to negatively impact EBITDA margins in the near term. In 2018, EBITDA margins are expected to be in the mid-30% range and operating margin is expected to be in the lower 20% range.With an improving media and web business growth rate, management anticipates to return to high 30% EBITDA margin range going ahead.Zacks RankAkamai currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

754,AKAM,"We are in the heart of the Q3 earnings season, with more than 700 companies, including 180 S&P 500 members, expected to come up with their financial numbers by the end of this week.The Picture Thus FarWe already have Q3 results from 87 S&P 500 members that combined account for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Per the latest Earnings Trends (as of Oct 20), total earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the prior-year quarter on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% positive earnings surprises and 70.1% beating revenue estimates.Revenues for this cohort were up 4.4% sequentially.So far, the results paint a positive and reassuring picture of corporate earnings, which is expected to strengthen and get reconfirmed through the remainder of this reporting cycle.Coming to the technology sector, we expect it to benefit from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Let’s take a look at these three companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Oct 24.Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI  is likely to beat third-quarter 2017 expectations as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 0.07%.Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteWe expect TI to perform well driven by strength in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. It continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in these areas. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the past four quarters, TI’s analog business has witnessed both sequential and year-over-year growth. We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.6 billion.Given the strong product lines, we also expect Embedded Processing segment to perform well in the upcoming quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $904 million.We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have gained 30.4% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 33.8% rally. (You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Let’s take a sneak peek at Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report), the leading producer of microprocessors and chipsets in the world that is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.Notably, the company has a record of positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 35%. We note that AMD has introduced a host of new products during the quarter which is anticipated to give the top line a boost going forward. The company unveiled AMD4U comprising gaming applications and tools that are in compliance with AMD processors and graphics.The stock has an Earnings ESP of -7.90% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 7 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 8 cents. The stock’s negative ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) makes surprise prediction difficult.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD expects third-quarter 2017 revenues to increase 23% sequentially (+/- 3%). At the mid-point, this reflects 15% growth on a year-over-year basis. Further, gross margin is likely to be 34%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $400 million. (Read: What's in Store for Advanced Micro in Q3 Earnings?)We observe that shares of Advanced Micro have gained 21.8% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 27.9% rally.Lastly, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) is a global provider of content delivery network (CDN) and cloud infrastructure services.Notably, the company has a record of positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 35%. However, Akamai has an Earnings ESP of -0.12%. Also, the company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteAkamai's top-line growth continues to be affected by lower revenues from the large Internet Platform group companies. We expect the newly launched products to take some more time to generate meaningful growth.However, in the last quarter, Akamai stated that it witnessed high level of network traffic on its platform, which is anticipated to be a major tailwind for the company’s revenues.For the upcoming third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $610 million, indicating 4.5% year-over-year increase. Revenues in the second quarter came in at $609 million. Earnings are projected to be 59 cents per share, lower than 62 cents per share reported in the last quarter.Notably, effective second-quarter 2016, Akamai started reporting its business under three main divisions – Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects Media division revenues to be around $271 million. Web division revenues are expected to be close to $327 million while Enterprise and Carrier division revenues are anticipated to be about $19.93 million for the third quarter.We observe that shares of Akamai have lost 22.2% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 27.5% rally.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

755,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.We expect the huge level of network traffic catered to by Akamai’s cloud delivery platform to be a key top-line booster for the company. A growing customer base and improvised portfolio of solutions are the other positives.The Catalysts in DetailAkamai stated that it witnessed high level of network traffic on its platform during the quarter, which is anticipated to be a major tailwind for the company’s revenues.The company also added prominent names to its customer base during the third quarter with the likes of All Nippon Airways and Nintendo (NTDOY  -  Free Report).While “All Nippon Airways” adopted Akamai’s flagship product, Image Manager, Nintendo launched its new game console and mobile gaming application simultaneously around the world via Akamai’s Media Delivery Solutions.Moreover, NANA TV used technical services from MobileRider Networks LLC and Akamai for live streaming the North American total solar eclipse on Aug 21.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteEstimates The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $610 million, indicating 4.5% increase year over year. Revenues in the second quarter came in at $609 million. Earnings are projected to be 59 cents per share, lower than 62 cents per share reported in the last quarter.Notably, effective second-quarter 2016, Akamai started reporting its business under three main divisions – Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects Media division revenues to be around $271 million. Web division revenues are expected to be close to $327 million while Enterprise and Carrier division revenues are anticipated to be about $19.93 million for the third quarter.ConclusionWe believe that rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video and adoption of cloud services on a large scale by data centers pose significant growth opportunity for Akamai.However, declining revenue contribution from large customers in the Internet Platform group namely, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix due to their do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives remains a concern for the company.Zacks RankAkamai currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereWall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

758,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM  -  Free Report) is strengthening its security product portfolio. The company recently announced plans to acquire Nominum, a leading provider of DNS and enterprise security solutions for carriers.Akamai intends to integrate Nominum’s carrier-grade cybersecurity solutions with its enterprise security offerings and threat intelligence. This will help the company in expanding its presence among carrier and enterprise customers.Nominum is well-known for three of its DNS security products – Vantio CacheServer, Big Data Connector, and Vantio AuthServe. These products face competition from Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO  -  Free Report) OpenDNS Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering and Infoblox.Akamai believes that the integrated security product portfolio will be more effective in identifying, blocking and mitigating malware, ransomware, phishing as well as data exfiltration threats.However, Nominum’s acquisition will be dilutive to Akamai’s fourth-quarter earnings by almost a nickel. The acquisition is anticipated to negatively impact fiscal 2018 earnings by 11 cents. The company still expects to maintain EBITDA margin range within mid-30’s including Nominum. Moreover, management expects the buyout to be accretive in fiscal 2019.Notably, Akamai’s shares have lost 24.2% of its value year to date versus the 25.6% increase of its industry.Security: Key Catalyst for AkamaiSecurity is an area that holds a lot of promise for Akamai in our view. The cyber attacks at Equifax Inc (EFX  -  Free Report), Avast’s CCleaner and two back-to-back ransomware attacks — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — created global chaos, recently.We believe that the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises as well as governments to increase spending on cybersecurity software. According to a Markets and Markets July-2017 report, worldwide cybersecurity spending will reach $137.85 billion this year and $231.94 billion by 2022. The solid spending trend bodes well for Akamai.We believe that the expanded security portfolio will help Akamai gain significant share in the security market in the long haul. Notably, the company’s cloud security business reported revenues of $115 million that increased 34% from the year-ago quarter.In the last quarter, the company launched two products — Enterprise Threat Protector and Bot Manager Premier. Akamai expects revenues from the security business to exceed $1 billion within the next four to five years driven by strong adoption of Kona Site Defender, Prolexic, Bot Manager and Web Application Protector product offerings.Moreover, expansion of the security product portfolio will lower Akamai’s dependence on the media delivery solutions. Further, rapid growth in security is expected to offset loss of large customers in the content delivery network (CDN) space.Zacks Rank & Key PickCurrently, Akamai has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

759,AKAM,"Amazon.com,Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is in the hunt for a second headquarter (Amazon HQ2 as it calls it) in North America that can accommodate as many as 50,000 employees. It plans to spend $5 billion for it.The company said that jobs at HQ2 will mostly be in software development with average annual compensation of $100,000 over 15 years.It has launched a special website where representatives of cities and regional economic development organizations can put up their responses to the proposal. It wants to wind up the response acceptance process by October and final selection by 2018.We observe that Amazon shares have gained 31% year to date, underperforming the 50.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that several senior executives of the company wish to have HQ2 at Boston. The city itself was among the many that expressed interest immediately after the announcement.Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh gave enthusiastic comments like: “Boston could ‘absolutely’ handle an Amazon headquarters.” He added, “If Amazon wants an East Coast headquarters, I don’t see any city better in America than Boston, Massachusetts.” Moreover, Walsh finds it “an incredible opportunity -- $5 billion of investment and 50,000 new jobs.”Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteWhat Amazon Prefers?  Amazon prefers urban or suburban but metropolitan locations, home to more than 1 million people, offering a stable and business-friendly environment, real estate options and with resources to attract strong technical talent.The location need not have to offer an urban or downtown campus, a layout resembling Amazon’s Seattle campus or a development-prepped site. Notably, Amazon has stressed on “communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options.”What Boston Has to Offer?Boston is close to Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that can offer strong technical talent that Amazon plans to recruit at HQ2.Notably, MIT recently unveiled a major advance on voice-activated technology. This could be of interest to the maker of Echo smart speakers that are going great guns and helping it to sell products and services.Again, East Boston hosts the Logan International Airport with regular flights to Seattle (Amazon headquarters) and Washington, D.C. Cost of living in Boston is lower than many other big cities and this could offer affordable options to Amazon employees.Amazon already has an association with Boston. Its Robotics facility situated in Suburban Boston was founded by former Kiva Systems that Amazon acquired in 2012. The city is home to Amazon competitors like online home goods seller, Wayfair Inc. (W  -  Free Report) and cloud infrastructure services provider, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report).Infrastructure and technology giant General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is building its new corporate headquarters in the city. All these indicate that Boston can offer a stable and business-friendly environment, another of Amazon’s HQ2 criteria.To ConcludeNo matter which city Amazon picks, HQ2 will have a huge positive impact on its economy. Amazon in its press release notes that from 2010 to 2016, the company’s investments in Seattle have generated an economic impact of $38 billion in the city. That’s an additional $1.4 against each dollar invested in Seattle by Amazon.City and state heads are surely eyeing a repetition of Amazon’s economic impact on Seattle in their own areas and thus have started gearing up to grab the opportunity.Currently, cities and states are increasingly attracting technology companies as they bring in huge employment opportunities and attract other businesses, thus boosting the overall economy. They are ready to give away massive benefits mainly in the form of tax breaks in return as they know that economic development often outweighs loss in tax.Amazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

760,AKAM,"On Aug 12, Zacks Investment Research downgraded Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The downgrade can be attributed to negative estimate revisions witnessed over the last 30 days following mixed second- quarter 2017 results.In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, revenues of $609 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $604 million and increased almost 6% from the year-ago quarter (up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange) but declined 1% sequentially.The company witnessed 10 downward revisions for the current quarter as well as full year 2017 over the last 30 days, compared with just one upward revision. This trend has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and full year 2017 to decline 6.7% and 3.6% to 42 cents and $1.86, respectively.Notably, Akamai has lost 30.5% of its value year to date against 19.6% growth of its industry.Key FactorsAkamai’s underperformance can be attributed to headwinds related to do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives by large Internet companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, which are hurting its media business. Notably, revenues for media business decreased 2.1% year over year (down 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange) and 3.3% sequentially to $276.1 million.Intensifying competition continues to weaken Akamai’s market share. Loss of large customers in the content delivery network (CDN) space is expected to have a negative impact on the company’s top line in the near term.Although market research firm Gartner puts Akamai in the “Leaders” quadrant in its latest “Magic Quadrant for Web Application Firewalls” report, we believe that the company’s aggressive pricing policy, especially in case of video content, to attract more customers and traffic to its network will hurt profitability going ahead.Akamai Technologies, Inc.

761,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) reported adjusted second-quarter 2017 earnings (including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation) of 43 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation but excluding all other non-recurring items and related tax impact) of 62 cents were down 3% on a year-over-year basis (up 4% adjusted for foreign exchange and the dilutive effect of the Soasta acquisition, which was completed in Apr 2017). The figure also decreased 10.1% on a sequential basis.Revenues of $609 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $604 million and increased almost 6% from the year-ago quarter (up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange) but declined 1% from the previous quarter. Revenues matched the top end of the guided range of $597–$609 million.Excluding Internet Platform Customers, revenues increased 9% year over year (also 10% adjusted for foreign exchange). Revenues from Internet Platform Customers were $51 million, plunging 17% year over year. The revenue contribution from large customers in the Internet Platform group namely Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Google, Microsoft and Netflix has been declining for the past few quarters primarily due to their CDN do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives. Sequentially, revenues from Internet Platform Customers declined 0.4%.We note that Akamai has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock lost 20.1%, the industry has gained 20.8% over the same time frame.Quarter DetailsEffective second-quarter 2016, Akamai started reporting its business under three main divisions – Media, Web and Enterprise and Carrier. This marks a shift from the earlier product-focused structure to a customer-focused structure.Media Division – Revenues decreased 2.1% year over year (down 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange) and 3.3% sequentially to $276.1 million.Web Division – Revenues increased 15% year over year (up 16% adjusted for foreign exchange) and 3.4% sequentially to $315 million. In the second quarter, the web division, for the first time, was the biggest contributor to revenues.Enterprise and Carrier Division – Revenues of $18 million rose 9% (up 10% adjusted for foreign exchange) from the year-ago quarter but were down 6.8% sequentially.However, in order to give better perspective to its investors, the company continued to report results per its old structure (solution category-wise).Performance & security solutions revenues (almost 61.7% of total revenue) were up 15% year over year (16% adjusted for foreign exchange) to $376 million. Of this, $115 million was generated from Akamai’s cloud security solutions, which surged 32% on a year-over-year basis (34% adjusted for foreign exchange). On a sequential basis, Performance & security increased 1.8%.Service & support system revenues rose 12% year over year (13% adjusted for foreign exchange) to $54 million while Media Delivery solutions sales declined 9% year over year to $179 million. On a sequential basis, Media Delivery solutions declined 4.5%, while Service & support system increased 2.9%.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteDuring the quarter, Akamai launched two products after successful beta tests with customers, namely, phishing and malware protector, Enterprise Threat Protector and Bot Manager Premier, that features machine learning technology which Akamai acquired from Cyberfend. Management also noted that Ion 3.0 and Image Manager are also gaining accelerated adoption rate.Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 200 bps from the previous quarter to 37%. Adjusted operating margin decreased 300 bps from the previous quarter as well as the year-ago quarter to 24%.As on Jun 30, 2017, Akamai’s cash and cash equivalents were $352.5 million. The company generated cash flow from operations of $224.6 million compared with $143 million in the previous quarter.In the quarter, Akamai repurchased 2 million shares for $105 million.GuidanceFor third-quarter 2017, Akamai expects revenues in the range of $604 million to $616 million. The high-end reflects year-over-year growth of 6% in constant currency.GAAP gross margin is expected to be 64%. Adjusted operating expenses are anticipated in the range of $241–$246 million, up $5 million sequentially at the mid-point, pertaining to planned investments in the web and enterprise divisions.EBITDA margin is anticipated to be approximately 36%. Management remains confident about maintaining EBITDA margins in the mid-30s range in the long-term.Non-GAAP depreciation is expected to be in the range of $80–$82 million. Adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be 22% to 23% in the third quarter.Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of 57–60 cents per share.Our TakeAkamai is likely to benefit from rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video. With enterprise data centers adopting cloud services on a large scale, Akamai has significant growth opportunity.We think that the recent acquisition of Soasta is a positive for the company. The acquisition saw Akamai’s product portfolio being enriched with the addition of mPulse, and CloudTest. The acquisition is expected to add to its top line and help in further market penetration.Management quoted TGG stating that over-the-top (OTT) viewing will exceed traditional broadcast viewing in four years. This implies that Akamai has some scope in this segment with video accounting for the majority of the media traffic. Management also noted that the company is looking to work with leading broadcasters and video customers.Moreover, the company has a newly appointed management person, Adam Karon, to look after the media business, and the management is actively looking into the cost effective ways of delivering large volumes of traffic. However, decelerating media traffic growth remains a concern.Currently, Akamai carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

762,AKAM,"Investors in Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 28th 2017 $46.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Akamai Technologies shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Akamai Technologies is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Internet - Services industry that ranks in the Top 41% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Although over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has not seen any revision for the current quarter, it has gone down from 45 cents per share to 44 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Akamai Technologies right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

763,AKAM,"The second-quarter reporting cycle has begun with 97 S&P 500 members, representing 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, having already reported their results.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings of these companies are up 8.4% on a year-over-year basis (78.4% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue is up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis (almost 72.2% of the companies also beat top-line estimates).Earnings Expectations Soaring HighMore than 800 companies are set to report results this week (Jul 24-28), including 183 S&P 500 members. Total second-quarter earnings are now expected to increase 8.6% (up from the previous expectation of 6.6%) from the year-ago quarter on revenue growth of 4.7%.Actual second-quarter earnings growth could very well be above 10% compared with 13.3% earnings growth in the preceding quarter.Moreover, unlike the previous quarters, growth is broad-based and not dependent on one or two sectors. Contribution from Finance, Technology and Energy sectors is significant.We note that the technology sector has been performing magnificently on a year-to-date basis with innovation taking center stage. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Internet stocks, which generate revenues from web-based technology and e-commerce, are witnessing a boom owing to an increase in web-based activities.Notably, PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio ETF, one of the most-tracked internet stock ETF, has gained 34% on a year-to-date basis, which is significantly better than the S&P 500’s gain of 12.1% and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK) return of 19.8%.Here we take a look at three software companies that are set to report their second-quarter earnings on Jul 25:Akamai (AKAM  -  Free Report) is unlikely to beat expectations as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +2.27%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, as per our proven model, a company needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5  going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.However, we note that Akamai beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering in an average positive surprise of 1.49%.We believe that Akamai’s strong foothold in the web applications domain will be a key catalyst for the company’s growth. However headwinds related to do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives by large internet companies (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix) are a concern. (Read: Akamai’s Q2 Earnings: Is Disappointment in Store?)Akamai has underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 12.1%, the stock lost 21.8% over the same time frame.Similarly, Chegg Inc. (CHGG  -  Free Report) is unlikely to beat estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters. It delivered an average four-quarter positive surprise of 46.16%.We believe Chegg’s strategy of delivering high quality and low cost educational products and services coupled with the increasing popularity of online, on-demand human help for different courses at college and high school levels bode well for the company. (Read: Can Chegg Spring a Surprise this Earnings Season?)Notably, shares have gained 88.1% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s rise of 19.9%.Shutterfly Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) also does not look likely to beat estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.We believe Shutterfly’s improved offerings in the growing mobile e-commerce segment, aggressive promotions and easy-to-use products are key growth drivers. Its recently announced restructuring will also have a positive impact on the cost structure. However, unfavorable travel industry and consumer spending trends might limit revenue growth. (Read: What to Expect from Shutterfly this Earnings Season?)Notably, Shutterfly has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four preceding quarters with an average positive surprise of 13.12%. However, the company has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained 37.2%, the stock lost 5.2%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

764,AKAM,"Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 25. Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 1.49%.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.92%. Adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation) of 53 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Moreover, revenues of $609.2 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $605 million. It rose almost 7.3% from the year-ago quarter (up 8% adjusted for foreign exchange) but declined 1.1% from the previous quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAkamai shares have massively underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock lost 21.5%.The underperformance can be attributed to headwinds related to do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives by large Internet companies (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix), which are hurting its media business. Moreover, intensifying competition and pricing pressure are other concerns.Further, continuing investments are also expected to hurt EBITDA margin, which is expected to touch the lower end of 37-39% range in the second quarter. Foreign exchange fluctuations are also likely to weigh heavily on its top line.Additionally, newly launched products like Bot Manager, Image Manager, Enterprise Application Access (EAA) and the Enterprise Threat Protector (ETP) are expected to take some more time to contribute positively to top-line growth.Nevertheless, Akamai’s strong foothold in the web applications domain apart from the rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video is a key catalyst.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Akamai is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Akamai’s Earnings ESP is +2.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 45 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Akamai carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

767,AKAM,"Amid market volatility, the cyber security industry is riding high on better-than-expected earnings results, pushing many stocks to multi-year highs. This is especially true as most of the cyber security firms beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues and offered robust guidance.Let’s dig into the earnings results of some of the cyber security firms that have the largest allocation to the ETFs in this niche area of the technology sector (read: 5 Niche Tech ETFs Hitting All-Time Highs):Cyber Security Earnings in FocusAkamai Technologies (AKAM  -  Free Report) reported Q1 earnings per share of 79 cents and revenues of $669 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents and $654 million, respectively.

768,AKAM,"Recently, Baidu’s, Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report) price target was increased by more than 27% from $240 to $305 by Bernstein’s analyst Bhavtosh Vajpayee. The analyst also revised the stock’s rating from “Underperform” to “Market Perform.”The upgrade comes on the heels of iQIYI’s public listing. Further, the company’s recent plans to vend its financial services business along with the previous divestitures of its food delivery and gaming businesses in 2017 has enabled Baidu to focus on its core businesses, like search engine platform, newsfeed and cloud.The analyst predicts Baidu to generate 20% revenues from its core businesses.Baidu’s Growth ProspectsBernstein analyst remains optimistic about the increasing growth opportunities in Baidu’s search engine platform, newsfeed and cloud businesses.Baidu’s Chinese language-based internet search engine will continue to drive its top-line growth in the upcoming quarters. The company expects 19% growth in revenues from this business in the second quarter.Further, Bernstein analyst predicts search business to reflect growth in a range of mid-teens by 2019. Also, the analyst expects revenues from newsfeed business to get doubled by 2019.We believe, Baidu’s continuous efforts on improving its search and feed business will meet  analysts’ expectations. Baidu’s Bear Paw Account, which was introduced late last year, helps the brands to link their content from various websites and social platforms and display them. Also, the account allows communication between brands and Baidu app users. Hence, Bear Paw Account contributes for almost 30% to the search results.Also, the company has demolished 20.2 billion malicious webpages to improve its search results. Further, Baidu’s strong focus toward improving user experience of its twin engine Baidu app will continue to benefit its search and feed business. Additionally, app users can view Baidu Encyclopedia content in feed and this has made the information quality better.Baidu app’s daily active user came in 137 million in March which increased 18% year over year. Additionally, the company’s AI computing and big data assets will continue to improve its feed algorithms. Also AI helps in removing vulgar content.The company is likely continue to gain traction with Dual Cloud DNN callback model which is designed to aid advertising performance. In the first quarter, Baidu experienced increased number of clicks with the help of this model.Baidu, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Baidu, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Baidu, Inc.

The top-line growth was primarily driven by its strength in search and feed businesses. During the quarter, search platform reflected a year over year growth of 17%.We believe the iQIYI spin off will propel further business growth, since in first quarter content costs were $669 million, up 59% year over year, which was mainly due to iQIYI's higher content purchases.We note the share price of the company has surged almost 13% to date after its first-quarter 2018 earnings release on Apr 26. Additionally, shares of Baidu have returned 45% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 2%.Also, the company has witnessed an upward estimate revision in past 30 days.

769,AKAM,"According to the most recent annual release by the U.S. Commerce Department, e-commerce in 2017 was the strongest on record and also represented the strongest year over year growth since 2011.Consumers spent approximately $453 billion on online retail purchases in 2017, an increase of 16% over 2016, itself a record year. 13% of all retail sales are now internet transactions.As existing retailers increasingly work to move sales and advertising away from brick and mortar enterprise to more efficient online platforms and new internet-only entrants strive to gain market share online, the market for web services to support online operations has been growing at a furious pace.The World LeaderInternet sales pioneer Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) realized way back in 2002 that their massive infrastructure could be scaled and sold as a service to other companies as an economical way to run their own web businesses. Writing proprietary software and maintaining huge amount of costly and power-hungry hardware in a server farm is a daunting task for smaller retailers, but adding incremental capacity is relatively easy for Amazon.Amazon has since added thousands of non-commercial customers to its huge list of merchants.By 2015, Amazon Web Services had more than a million active customers, including 2,000 government agencies, 5,000 educational institutions and 17,500 nonprofits.Web services accounted for $17B in sales in 2017, approximately 10% of total revenue of $177B.  Sales in 2018 for Web Services are expected to be in excess of $20B.Aided by the out-performance of AWS, Amazon reported a blowout Q1 2018, earning $3.27/share versus analyst estimates of $1.22/share.  16 upward revisions since then have the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for 2018 at $12.10/share, up from $8.49/share just 30 days ago and earning AMZN a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The Cloud ChampionAkamai (AKAM  -  Free Report) operates in a slightly different sub-sector of Web services, providing a content delivery network to its customers that handles approximately 2 trillion transactions per day.  The company has seen strong demand for inline media and entertainment options over the internet, much of which passes through Akamai’s 200,000 servers in 1,400 networks around the globe.Akamai is also positioned to take advantage of the growing popularity of streaming services to mobile devices as end users increasingly expect high-quality content to be delivered over mobile data networks.  Cyber Security sales are also on the rise as companies seek to address concerns about the security of cloud computing and employ more and more sophisticated measure to combat hackers and data theft, requiring ever-growing computational capacity. In Q1, Akamai reported revenue of $669M, an 11% increase over the same quarter in 207, but revenue from Cloud Security Solutions grew at 36% year over year.  During its Analyst conference call, Akamai raised guidance for 2018 revenues to a range of $2.69B to $2.72B and earnings to between $3.15/share and $3.25/share.  Analysts are even slightly more optimistic and the Zacks Consensus Earnings estimate now stand at $3.27/share.
