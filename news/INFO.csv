19,INFO,"Russia Scandal: Former high-level Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, a key cog in the Russia-Trump investigation, didn't let his employer know that his wife was being paid by Fusion GPS, the company that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee paid to dig up dirt on Trump. Nor did he seek a waiver for a possible conflict of interest. What is wrong with this investigation?XIt's yet another indication of rot at the very core of this corrupt investigation whose only real aim has ever been to unseat Trump as president.As the Daily Caller reports, ""The (DNC) ...hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the 'dossier.' Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe media and progressives sneer at the idea of a ""deep state."" But if anything shows its nefariousness, this would be it. At minimum, it appears that Fusion GPS cynically hired Bruce Ohr's wife in order to get access to him and, by extension, to influence the U.S. justice system on behalf of its client, Hillary Clinton.The Justice Department used the tainted information to get a wiretap on a Trump adviser, Carter Page. But it failed to tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the information came from Trump's 2016 presidential campaign opponent and the Democratic Party, and that they had paid for it.He also continued to meet with former British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Trump Dossier, even after he was fired by the FBI for feeding the media with information from the investigation. The House Intelligence Committee memo released recently quoted Steele as telling Ohr he was ""was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.""These are criminal acts, and provable ones. Ohr lied about his wife's employment. And the Justice Department lied by omission in its application to spy on the Trump campaign. Moreover, Justice and the FBI used what they knew was tainted information to gain a wiretap warrant.Quite simply, these are the tactics of a police state, not a republic where citizens have due process rights.But Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie aren't the only ones. The corruption reaches far deeper, to what American Thinker writer Monica Showalter calls ""Deep State tag-teams"" of inside-the-beltway bureaucratic power couples that used their positions of power for personal gain or political advantage.""This shows the incestuousness of the Deep State, of course,"" Showalter, a former IBD staffer, wrote. ""First, FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe and his wife, then FBI counterintelligence big Peter Strzok and his mistress Lisa page, and now Bruce and Nellie Ohr. ""And what did they all have in common? ""Not a one of them was afraid of the consequences that ordinarily come of blatant conflicts of interest, and some, apparently such as Bruce Ohr, felt they could get away easily with lying.""As we said, the rot at the very center of this investigation gets worse by the week. Despite Robert Mueller's silence, his investigation is now so hopelessly compromised by its political bias and its clear anti-Trump motivation, it should not go on any longer.No American who respects due process and basic constitutional rights can view the results of the Russia-Trump investigation as anything but a thinly veiled political hit job. It's time to lay this distracting travesty aside and let our duly elected government get on with governing.You Might Also Like...Fusion GPS' 'Fake Investigation' — And Hillary Clinton's Real Russian CollusionThe Trump, Clinton Scandals Are Claiming A Lot Of Bodies — At FBI And JusticeMemo: FBI Used Tainted Steele Dossier, Paid For By Hillary Clinton, As Reason To Spy On TrumpClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

26,INFO,"General Electric (GE) could be left out in the cold while other U.S. companies, including fellow industrial conglomerates, benefit from a tax windfall, according to an analyst.X The GOP tax package that President Trump signed into law Friday cuts the current corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. But Deutsche Bank says GE could end up a ""significant net loser"" because the plan also calls for a 15.5% repatriation rate on earnings held offshore as cash, and 8% if overseas profits are invested in nonliquid assets, such as plants and equipment. The repatriation tax would be mandatory.As a result, GE could end up owing up to $9 billion in new taxes, or an average of $1.1 billion for the next eight years, on $82 billion in foreign earnings reinvested abroad, according to Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch.""GE's substantial tax bill would come at a difficult time for the company given GE's ongoing cash squeeze from weak cash generation that recently forced the company to cut its dividend in half,"" Inch wrote Dec. 20.GE's quarterly dividend is now 12 cents a share, a 50% cut, allowing the company to save about $4 billion a year.Additionally, Inch noted, $4.5 billion of GE's overseas cash hoard, as of Sept. 30, was held in countries that may restrict or limit the return of funds.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point may have the wind at their backs.GE has long enjoyed an ultralow tax rate, the result of ""aggressive"" tax planning that leverages both GE's position as a multinational and GE Capital's ability to move funds around the world for tax advantages, the Deutsche Bank note added.This year, the firm forecasts GE Industrial's tax rate to be less than 5%. By comparison, GE's multi-industry peers on average pay rates from the mid- to high 20s.Companies had held off on paying income taxes on foreign earnings until those funds are returned, or repatriated, to the U.S. The 35% domestic rate has led several companies to stockpile profits abroad, leading to charges of tax avoidance.Several profitable U.S. companies paid an effective tax rate far less than 35% between 2008 and 2015, due to the tax loopholes and special breaks they enjoy, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.In fact, 18 companies, including GE, Priceline (PCLN) and PG&E (PCG), paid no federal income taxes at all over that eight-year period despite consistently churning out profits, it added.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHere Are The Latest Stocks Joining The Bitcoin FrenzyTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info Tech

34,INFO,"Republicans got an unexpected boost of good publicity after Congress sent the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts to President Trump's desk on Wednesday. Within hours, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) both announced an increase in their minimum wages to $15 an hour, which seemed to provide immediate evidence that the tax cuts would be good for workers.Those announcements came as Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) each said they'll pay out $1,000-apiece bonuses to employees. Trump heaped praise on AT&T in his tax-cut victory speech, and the company may be looking to earn some goodwill as it faces a legal challenge over its proposed acquisition of Time Warner (TWX).The surprise is that the potential gain to workers from corporate tax cuts is supposed to materialize over time, as companies boost productivity-enhancing investment and a more attractive business climate encourages more U.S.-based production. Those supply-side increases, along with lower individual taxes that boost demand, should intensify the bidding war for labor and push wages higher. But none of that stuff has happened yet.So do tax cuts really deserve the credit for wage hikes? Probably at least a little, because they're giving companies an extra shot of confidence about the strength of the economy and a profitable future, but there are other catalysts that may be more important.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Take Wells Fargo, which is trying to turn over a new leaf after having its reputation bruised and battered by the disclosure of improper sales practices. What better publicity opportunity than immediately turning corporate tax cuts into employee wage hikes?The biggest reason Wells Fargo is hiking its minimum wage is likely the current state of the labor market, with unemployment at a 17-year-low of 4.1%, which is putting upward pressure on wages and making it harder to find and retain qualified workers. Wells Fargo previously hiked its minimum wage to a range of $12 to $16 an hour, depending on location, in March 2016. Then, after Bank of America (BAC) said it would raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour in December 2016, Wells Fargo followed the next month by lifting its base wage to a range of $13.50 to $17.It's not clear whether the latest increase to $15 an hour, which will take effect in March, will be accompanied by much of a boost to entry-level workers whose hourly pay already exceeds $15.The focus of the announcements on a $15 minimum wage suggests that part of the credit likely goes to the $15 wage movement and its success in spurring a number of states and cities, as well as private employers like Target (TGT), to hike their minimum wages. In January, California's minimum wage will rise to $11 an hour and $12 a year later, on the way to $15 by 2022. New York City's minimum wage will hit $15 at the end of 2018. Since the minimum wage applies to the lowest-skilled work, bank tellers expect to make well above the minimum wage.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The Most6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

35,INFO,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

37,INFO,"Media Bias: In the span of a few days, two major news outlets came out with huge Trump/Russia bombshells that blew up in their own faces. In both cases, the error involved getting something as simple as a date wrong.CNN was in a frenzy on Friday over an apparent scoop by reporter Manu Raju, who claimed that an email sent to President Trump, Donald Trump Jr, and others on the campaign — and dated Sept. 4, 2016 — offered Trump access to purloined WikiLeaks documents.The story, posted on CNN's website at 8 a.m. and carried the headline: ""Exclusive: Email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents,"" claimed that the email had been ""described to CNN by multiple sources and verified by Trump Jr.'s attorney.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveA later update to the story also noted that Sept. 4 was also the day that Trump Jr first tweeted about WikiLeaks and Clinton.Raju noted that the ""timeline is important here,"" because the date on the email was more than a week before WikiLeaks posted these documents on its website.It looked like a genuine smoking gun — showing how Trump was colluding with WikiLeaks to spread documents hacked by Russia — and spread like wildfire across social media and on other news outlets.Except the story was completely bogus.Unlike CNN, the Washington Post obtained an actual copy of the email, and found that it wasn't sent on the Sept. 4th. It was sent on Sept. 14th — after WikiLeaks had posted the documents online and promoted that fact to the world.In other words, there was no story here whatsoever.One week before CNN committed journalistic malpractice, ABC News's Brian Ross announced to the world that ""Michael Flynn promised 'full cooperation to the Mueller team' and is prepared to testify that as a candidate, Donald Trump 'directed him to make contact with the Russians.' ""That story, too, looked like a smoking gun. It would show that Trump was in fact working with Russians prior to the election. In fact, the news was so shocking it sent the stock market reeling.But it, too, was false. The meetings in question all took place after Trump had won the election. In other words, they had nothing whatsoever to do with collusion or election meddling.These aren't the first or by any means the only examples of reporters rushing out some ""bombshell"" story, only to later admit they got key facts wrong. We noted several in this space a few weeks ago.Reuters and Bloomberg also botched a Trump story last week, when they reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed Trump's Deutsche Bank records. He hadn't.Even the liberal-leaning Politico noted that CNN's disaster ""extends (the) run of journalistic mishaps.""This sort of blatant journalistic malpractice, which seems to be getting more egregious the longer Trump is in office, is bad enough.Worse has been the reaction of fellow journalists, who instead of demanding higher standards from their peers, are busy making excuses, downplaying the importance of the screw-ups, or using these foul-ups as a way to attack Trump.Consider that in response to Raju's reporting fiasco, CNN said the network had ""followed the editorial standards process. Multiple sources provided him with incorrect info.""X So CNN's ""editorial standards process"" allows reporters to run Trump-bashing stories based entirely on a document it didn't have in hand, but that the Washington Post was able to obtain the same day? How reassuring.After Ross' epic error, ABC News initially issued a mild ""clarification"" to the story, and rather than firing him, it suspended Ross for all of a month.Meanwhile, other reporters, rather than using these failures to take stock of the impact that their raging anti-Trump bias is having on the credibility of their profession, circled the wagons.USA Today commentary editor Jill Lawrence, for example, decided to twist the episodes into an attack on Trump for his ""hypocrisy,"" because Trump has attacked the media for false reporting even though he has said things media have labeled as ""lies.""Lawrence even laughably — and lamentably — claims that Trump's ""attacks, falsehoods and secrecy are inspiring great journalism."" She goes on to say that ""The profession I love is going to emerge from the Trump era stronger than ever.""And they say Trump is delusional?New York magazine's Benjamin Hart suggested that only real problem with CNN's ""incorrect"" report was that it ""provides fuel for pro-Trump media.""It was up to independent journalist Glenn Greenwald to offer the correct analysis of the problem. In an article headlined: ""The U.S. Media Suffered Its Most Humiliating Debacle in Ages and Now Refuses All Transparency Over What Happened,"" Greenwald says that until the mainstream press gets its act together, ""their cries and protests the next time they're attacked as 'Fake News' should fall on deaf ears, since the real author of those attacks — the reason those attacks resonate — is themselves and their own conduct.""Amen to that.RELATED:Do The Media Hate Trump?

53,INFO,"The U.S. holds an enviable lead in pushing artificial-intelligence technology out of labs and into real-world applications. Thank companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) for that.X But China's government and technology elites aim to overtake the U.S. in AI by 2030 — or so they proclaimed in July at a Beijing political gathering.Good luck with that.Yes, China has many strengths as it sets out for worldwide dominance in AI technology. Its internet giants Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) are also pouring money into AI research and hiring top scientists.China's huge population will generate massive raw data to train AI systems in how to make predictions.  So there's good reason to think China will make breakthroughs in developing computer algorithms — the software programs that aim to replicate the human ability to learn, reason and make decisions.China also has a major weakness: a semiconductor industry that still lags the U.S. in making high-end electronic processors. Chinese companies buy AI chips mainly from Nvidia (NVDA), based in Santa Clara, Calif. Intel (INTC), the dominant supplier of brainy chips for personal computers, is pushing fast into AI.""Most AI-focused chips are developed by U.S. companies, and it will be a long slog for China to catch up,"" said David Kanter, head of chip industry consultant Real World Insights.UBS forecasts that the AI chip market will boom to $35 billion by 2021, up from roughly $6 billion in 2016. But AI stakes are higher than mere chip sales.AI technology is expected to transform economies. Artificial intelligence has been called a ""winner take all"" technology, meaning that companies and countries that gain an edge will build upon that lead over time.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that whichever country leads in AI  will dominate global affairs.""Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,"" said Putin. ""It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.""IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of equities to choose from — whether AI companies, chip stocks or otherwise — how can you tell if a stock might be worth buying now? Run it through the IBD Stock Checkup to see how it rates on dozens of fundamental and technical criteria. Or for stock ideas, check out the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks currently leading the market.Putin's problem: Russia doesn't have high-end commercial chips, even though its military electronics are world-class.All AI software needs computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. The race is on to build AI chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices.""The war for AI architecture leadership is the biggest battle of our lifetime,"" said Gary Dickerson, CEO of chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT), in an interview. He says new, specialized processors for AI software are coming. Applied Materials sells to both U.S. and Chinese chipmakers.Right now, the U.S. is ahead in startup AI companies and commercial deployment. U.S. Fortune 500 companies are pushing AI analytical tools into finance, health care, energy, agriculture, cybersecurity and elsewhere.Tech giants Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft have forged ahead in applying AI software to speech recognition, internet search, and classifying images. Amazon.com's (AMZN) AI prowess spans cloud-computing services and voice-activated home digital assistants.China does plan to catch up. Just not right away.""They are in it for the long run,"" said Chirag Dekate, a high-performance-computing analyst at research firm Gartner. ""The U.S. is driving AI innovation across the spectrum, in software and hardware. Early-use cases, early adopters — it's happening more in the U.S. than any geography in the world. But China is looking at it from a marathon perspective.""China's government in July unveiled a three-step development plan to steadily build up AI capabilities through 2020 and 2025 and to lead the world by 2030.Building up AI engineering talent is key to the plan. Chinese scholars already are churning out AI research papers at a faster pace. Patents have soared in robotics and other areas. Chinese internet companies have set up AI research in Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, Baidu and other companies are paying top salaries to snatch AI scientists.And yes, high on the Chinese government's to-do list by 2030 is developing high-end AI chips.""Computing power is part of the basic infrastructure underlying AI and of significant strategic importance,"" said a report on China by Vertex Holdings in July.""Stronger control over the supply of core technologies can potentially improve China's future ability to deploy AI systems more widely,"" the report added. Vertex is part of Temasek Holdings, the Singapore state investment firm.Just a few years ago, AI research projects required hundreds of computers networked together to process complex software. One key to AI's spread in the global economy, says a CBI Insights report, is a new wave of AI chips.Nvidia has emerged as the early leader in AI chips. Nvidia's edge is that its PC gaming processors can be scaled up to handle AI software, thanks to their ""parallel processing"" circuitry that can handle complex multiple tasks.Baidu has been Nvidia's partner in self-driving cars. In September, Nvidia said e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, Tencent and others will use its AI chips in cloud-computing data centers.Intel has made several AI-related acquisitions. Intel says it's ​working with Facebook to develop an AI chip for cloud-computing services.In the U.S., it's not just traditional semiconductor firms that are developing AI chips. Google's strategy is melding AI software and chip technology. Google's TensorFlow data-center software runs on its own ""TPU"" chips.Apple's new iPhone X features its own machine-learning optimized A11 bionic chip. The AI chip supports facial recognition as a way to unlock phone screens. The ""bionic"" processor is just the start of Apple's push into AI chips, analysts say.The U.S. government, meanwhile, has been vigilant in protecting high-end chip technology.The Trump administration in September blocked the sale of Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) to a Chinese-backed investor on national-security concerns. Lattice owns programmable software technology that offers an alternative way of building AI chips.The Obama administration in 2015 barred Intel, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) from selling high-end supercomputer chips to the Chinese government over concerns they'd be channeled to military systems.China's scientists responded a year later by unveiling Sunway TaihuLight, which broke records as the world's fastest supercomputer and contained no U.S. intellectual property. Some observers view Sunway's accomplishment as a sign China could be competitive in AI chips.China is still a far way, though, from producing AI chips for the mass market. One startup, Cambricon, has attracted funding from Alibaba, Lenovo Capital and IT firm iFlytek. Singapore's Vertex is among the backers of another startup, Horizon Robotics.Huawei, one of China's top tech companies, also has AI chip projects underway.While China plans a big push into AI, it also plans to up spending on its semiconductor industry. China has put $20 billion into a new chip industry project and could spend as much as $150 billion, according to a U.S. government estimate.China still buys most high-end chips from foreign suppliers, even though it has twisted the arms of U.S. and European companies since the 1990s to share technology through joint ventures. Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and SoftBank-owned ARM dominate in microprocessor technology, where China has little intellectual property.""The progress of building an indigenous semiconductor industry has been slow in China,"" noted a Goldman Sachs report on artificial intelligence released in September. ""We expect lower foreign dependency over time.""Google reportedly has been trying to interest China's tech companies in its TensorFlow AI software tools, which make it easier to develop apps. But it's not clear if those talks have involved its AI chips as well. Google's cloud-computing service rents access to its TPU chips optimized for TensorFlow.Venture-capital investment in AI chip startups is soaring, says CBI Insights. While Nvidia's GPU chips have grabbed an early lead, startup AI companies are focused on developing chips designed from scratch to crunch artificial-intelligence software. They include U.K.-based Graphcore, KnuEdge and Cerebras Systems.RELATED:Why Artificial Intelligence Could Boost Demand For Chipmaking GearWhere Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?These Three Companies Are Tops In Artificial IntelligenceHow Artificial Intelligence May Light Up These Info Tech FirmsBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

63,INFO,"About 100 years ago, my grandmother's family left Denmark to come to the United States seeking — same as everyone — the brighter future available only in the New World.Good thing they did too. While Denmark is certainly safe and stable, it's a horrible place to do business. It has the world's highest capital gains tax rate at 42%, meaning the government takes about half of every dollar (er, krone) investors make.This kind of punitive taxation scares investors into sending their money elsewhere and chokes growth. Recognizing this problem, center-right Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen recently proposed sweeping tax cuts to make Denmark a ""more attractive place to work"" where ""it's more worthwhile to save up toward retirement.""Countries in Europe and elsewhere have learned what conservatives have known for years: Lower taxes incentivize growth and boost economies.Alas, some in the United States have somehow missed this lesson.Two gentlemen included in this alliance of the not-paying-attention are Nebraska Republican Jeff Fortenberry (who should know better) and his constituent, billionaire investor Warren Buffett (who should really know better). The two have been longtime supporters of a tax hike on so-called ""carried interest"", currently being debated as part of the broader tax reform plan, to make the tax code more ""fair.""(When you hear the word ""fair"" out of Washington, hold onto your wallets, folks.)Now carried interest is not a complicated, evil financial vehicle with its own intricate ""Big Short""-style explanation, but bear with me. The world of high finance is more complicated than a tweet or an Occupy Wall Street sign.Carried interest is the share of the profit a fund manager earns from running long-term investments in your portfolio. Any money you earn in that investment (a capital gain) held longer than a year is taxed at a lower rate than wages (15%) while gains held under a year are taxed at the same rate as income (which has a top tax rate of 35%). The goal is to provide incentives for long-term planning rather than short-term gambling.The carried interest ""reform"" favored by Fortenberry, Buffett and others is to make these tax rates equal.  Now, bringing taxes on income and investments to the same level is a great idea, to be sure: if we're lowering income taxes, though, not raising taxes on investments.Most Americans benefit from long-term assets that yield carried interest, either from a direct personal investment like a pension or indirectly from nonprofits or endowments. (For more info, see an article I wrote here. I even talk about pirates.) However, because carried interest benefits fund managers — that is to say, the people who make sure your money makes you more money — it's denounced as an evil ""loophole.""Opponents of the current carried interest tax label it a ""loophole"" because they don't like it. If they did like it, they'd call it something pleasant like a ""tax shield"" or ""tax break."" Remember, when rich people bought hybrid cars with a tax credit, it was an incentive, not a loophole.Even though Rep. Fortenberry has a lousy record of supporting tax increases,  I do feel for him. It must be daunting to have one guy in your district who has more money than everyone else in your district combined. On any even-numbered year, Buffett could finance an army of contenders to knock Fortenberry out of Congress. That has to be terrifying.Especially since ""The Oracle of Omaha"" is kind of an enormous hypocrite.MSNBC host Joe Scarborough gently said of Buffett a couple years ago: ""I think for a guy talking about the wealthy need to pay their taxes, he has some explaining to do.""Buffet has saved himself millions by dodging taxes, with years of ""tax-avoidance triumph."" He's decried hedge funds despite having invented them. Beyond just paying the taxes he should pay, if Mr. Buffett feels he should pay more taxes, he can freely get out his checkbook and give Uncle Sam a few more million dollars than he is required by law. Oh, except on that subject he said this:""I will not pay a dime more of individual taxes than I owe, and I won't pay a dime more of corporate taxes than we owe. And that's very simple.""Wow. Not exactly in the same vein as ""Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.""And more than that, as detailed in the bluntly titled New York Post editorial, ""Warren Buffett, hypocrite,"" he's had outstanding tax issues for years, including the leak in 2011 that his company owed taxes all the way back to 2002!(Cough ... ahem ...""fair"" ... cough.)Under the Obama-era media orgy where cheerleading replaced watchdogging, Buffett's brand of stylish-yet-insincere liberalism boomed. It's the same hypocritical mentality that taught, ""I drive a hybrid car because I'm better than you, but I fly a private jet because I'm … also better than you.""That attitude is why working-class people abandoned the Democratic Party for Trump, and Republicans in Washington need to remember that. The gains of the Trump stock market boom can become permanent if D.C. justifies the faith that investors have demonstrated. If not, those financial — and electoral — gains could disappear next year.I hope Republicans do the right thing, which would include removing Buffet from their speed dial.If not, maybe it's time for me to move back to Denmark.

66,INFO,"It seems Tesla (TSLA) won't take reports that it is struggling to automate its production of Model 3 vehicles lying down, but the reports keep coming in fast and furious.The company rebuked as ""fundamentally wrong and misleading"" a Wall Street Journal report late Friday that it is building by hand large parts of the Model 3, a mass-market electric vehicle. The company's statement followed a Sunday tweet from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, thumbing his nose at the Journal story with an video posted to Instagram of the automated Model 3 production line.In a statement to CNBC on Monday, Tesla spokesperson admitted that it will take time to gear up for higher volumes amid soaring demand for its Model 3 brand, which starts at $35,000. But the carmaker reaffirmed ""there are no fundamental issues with Model 3 production or its supply chain, and we are confident in addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term.""With a more affordable Model 3 brand, Tesla hopes to move beyond its image as a maker of luxury vehicles that sell for upward of $100,000.On the heels of Tesla's rebuttal, another report emerged Monday arguing the carmaker will struggle to meet its own aggressive Model 3 production goals. The report in auto info site WardsAuto gave two main reasons, citing unnamed sources:Shares of Tesla gave up 3.9% to close at 342.94 on the stock market today. They sit 7% below their Sept. 18 peak of 389.61, which followed a mid-September breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 370.10 buy point.Various Wall Street analysts, in addition to the Journal, have raised concerns over whether the Silicon Valley company can ramp up Model 3 production quickly enough to meet demand.In the third quarter, Tesla totaled 26,150 vehicle deliveries, including 220 Model 3 cars, with the latter falling well short of analyst expectations of 1,000 or more.While Morgan Stanley said the miss was not that concerning, it led Goldman Sachs to reiterate a sell rating on Tesla shares in an Oct. 3 note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 68, meaning it has outperformed 68% of stocks in key technical and fundamental metrics over the past 12 months.

70,INFO,"Could cybersecurity specialist Palo Alto Networks (PANW) join Symantec (SYMC) in making acquisitions that reshape the market? At least one analyst thinks so.XAs it laid out its vision for how the computer security market will evolve at an analysts meeting in New York on Wednesday, Palo Alto updated its product strategy but made no major changes to guidance or long-term targets. But Brad Zelnick, an analyst at Credit Suisse, says Palo Alto may look to boost growth with a big acquisition.""We expect the company to propel itself into the future via a significant acquisition, perhaps by rounding out its visibility feature set with a target such as ForeScout, Gigamon (GIMO), or even Tanium,"" Zelnick said in a note to clients.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion. Symantec also purchased LifeLock, a provider of consumer identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion. Symantec recently has been eyeing Splunk (SPLK), according to a Bloomberg report.Palo Alto competes in the corporate security firewall market vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Fortinet (FTNT). Firewalls block unauthorized traffic from entering a private network and monitor web-based applications.One view is that Palo Alto's share gains vs. those of Cisco and Juniper Networks (JNPR) have slowed.

75,INFO,"Even honest poker players yearn to know what cards other players are holding. Investors can gain a bit of the same insight into the stock market today by knowing what Fidelity Investments — whose army of stock mutual funds includes many that are actively looking for winning equities, not just passively tracking this or that index — is up to with its buys and sells.XIn the second quarter, among Fidelity's 100 top holdings, the biggest net buys by the Boston-based fund complex's stock mutual funds as a group were in Aetna (AET), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Oracle (ORCL), Marriott International (MAR) and British American Tobacco (BTI).Fidelity funds boosted their cumulative net share count in health insurer Aetna by nearly 36%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, working from the Capital IQ database and Fidelity's June 30 13-F filing with the SEC. IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group. It sports a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Marriott and Alibaba (BABA) have agreed to a joint venture that will let Alibaba users use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book Marriott rooms, as IBD recently reported. Earlier this months Marriott reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter but gave weak guidance.Marriott International's (MARS) shares are forming a flat base, while Alibaba's are extended from an optimal buy point.British American Tobacco is 16% off its June 6 high and has a weak 31 Composite Rating.Individual Fidelity funds and managers can deviate from the overall net patterns.The technology sector remained Fidelity's largest cumulative sector, with a 27% weighting, Rosenbluth reported this week. The complex's six top individual stock holdings by combined market value in Fidelity portfolios were in fact tech stocks.Consumer electronics colossus Apple led the way with a $20.3 billion portfolio value, accounting for a 2.94% weighting. Social media mammoth Facebook (FB) was next, with an $18.1 billion portfolio value, with a 2.63% weighting.Third was Amazon (AMZN), a giant in e-commerce and web services, with a $14.4 billion portfolio value and 2.09% weighting. Classes A and C of Alphabet (GOOGL) were fourth and fifth, with values of $13 billion and $10.4 billion and weightings of 1.88% and 1.51% respectively. Software titan Microsoft (MSFT) was worth $9.5 billion to Fidelity, with a 1.38% weighting.Still, several of those favorites' allure faded in Fidelity's eyes. Fidelity sold 6.6 million shares of Apple, trimming its share count by 5%. That left Fidelity's Apple exposure at its lowest level since June 2016, Rosenbluth wrote.It disposed of about 1 million shares of Facebook, or just under 1% of its total.It sold 404,426 shares of Amazon, or 2.64% of its total.Fidelity added 102,000 shares of GOOGL, raising its share count by 0.75%. But it sold nearly 50,000 shares of class-A GOOG, or 0.43%.And it got rid of 5.3 million shares of Microsoft, a 3.9% cut in shares.Other big tech names suffered big share-count cuts. Fidelity trimmed its share count in Nvidia (NVDA) by nearly 11%, in Broadcom (AVGO) by 10.5% and Cisco (CSCO) by 10.2%.Financials stayed the second-largest Fidelity sector with a 16% weighting. Fidelity added exposure to big banks Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) by boosting share counts 4.4% and 3.8% respectively.But Fidelity cut share counts in Goldman Sachs (GS) by 9.8%, in Morgan Stanley (MS) by 8.1%, in Wells Fargo (WFC) by 7.9%, and in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 7.5%.It also trimmed share count in credit card network Mastercard (MA) by 2.2%.The $39.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) and $22.7 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) both held top-10 positions in Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) as of June 30, Rosenbluth reported.TIPS & TOOLS:Is this a good time to buy Fidelity's top holdings?

Snap (SNAP) missed on everything, sending shares lower. Nvidia (NVDA) had blowout numbers, but priced-for-perfection shares fell. Top-rated China internets generally retreated amid a slew of earnings and a government crackdown on social media.The Nasdaq composite tumbled 1.5% and the S&P 500 sank 1.4%, both moving below their 50-day moving averages. The Dow industrials dipped 1.1% after setting a record high Tuesday. A number of leading stocks undercut recent buy points or key support levels. The CBOE Volatility Index, the market's fear gauge, neared a nine-month high after sinking to an all-time low in late July.

Still, the move could force Netflix to spend more on its own content, notably big-ticket films. Netflix fell 4.9%, nearly returning to its July breakout buy point before a Friday bounce.

Nvidia cited strong chip sales for video game devices, data centers and artificial intelligence applications, though some analysts said data center revenue was a little light.

Macy's crashed to its worst levels since September 2010. Dillard's (DDS) reported a surprise loss, sending its stock plunging. Nordstrom just edged higher Friday after its solid late Thursday results. JCPenney (JCP), which already fell sharply Thursday, crashed 16.8% on Friday to record lows after reporting a wider-than-expected loss and weaker-than-expected same-store sales.RELATED:Nordstrom Beats But Rival Chains Plunge As Sales Keep FallingJ.C.

TripAdvisor (TRIP) Q2 earnings also beat analyst expectations and revenue was in line.

The optical device maker reported in-line Q2 profit but revenue was light amid weakness in the company's North America business as well as China. Lumentum management said it has $200 million in orders for 3D devices in calendar 2017 and manufacturing yields have been solid. One question, though is how much Apple business Lumentum will potentially share with Germany's AMS, Finisar (FNSR) and II-VI (IIVI).

In other news, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) hit a two-year high after bumping up its timeline to file applications for two cholesterol-lowering treatments.Wendy's (WEN) second-quarter results topped Street estimates, with Stephens analysts attributing the strong showing to its value 4 for $4 meals and marketing of fresh, never-frozen beef in its hamburgers. Jack in the Box (JACK) same-store sales came in better than expected, but some analysts hope the chain can reclaim customers with a bigger push on cheap combo offerings and other deals. The company also continued to weigh whether to sell, or do something else with, Qdoba, its Mexican chain. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) beat on the top and bottom line. McDonald's (MCD) set its sights on China, forming a partnership that will aim to expand the number of locations there to 4,500 from 2,500.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) reported second-quarter EPS growth of 20% with revenue up 13% to $13.441 billion, both better than expected.

77,INFO,"If there was any doubt the technology sector is leading the stock market, just check the IBD ETF Leaders: Four technology ETFs are trying to break out to new highs.The four share many of the same stocks, and the ETF's charts have shadowed each other for years. Now, all four are quite close to buy points from flat bases they crafted over the past several weeks.On Wednesday, Fidelity MSCI Information Technology (FTEC) climbed to its 45.10 buy point, and Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) edged past its 148.36 buy point. IShares U.S. Technology (IYW) is near a 147.64 buy point. First Trust Technology AlphaDEX (FXL) is near a 46.15 buy point.All four funds own the technology titans Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). They account for big portions of three of the four funds, in some cases carrying outsized weightings. Apple, for example, accounts for 14% to 17% of all the ETFs except for the First Trust fund.First Trust Technology AlphaDEX is structured differently than the other three. It's based on an index developed by NYSE Group that seeks Russell 1000 companies with certain share performance and fundamentals. Those including three-, six- and 12-month price appreciation, one-year sales growth plus valuation measurements such as book value-to-price and return on assets.The index results in a much more evenly distributed portfolio, with no single stock accounting for more than 2.5% of its 80 holdings.By comparison, 57% of Vanguard Information Technology is stacked with just 10 of its 364 holdings, according to the fund's website. Just five stocks are responsible for about 40% of Fidelity MSCI Information Technology, and three stocks (Apple, Microsoft and Facebook) form some 37% of the iShares tech ETF, which owns about 135 stocks.No matter, the four funds have performed with remarkable similarity. First Trust Technology is up about 21% this year, while the other three are up about 22%.All four ETFs must be thankful the tech sector has outperformed this year, and investors have to be wondering how long the party will last. At least in terms of earnings outlook, there's reason for some optimism.Leaving aside energy companies, which are rebounding from depressed levels, the technology sector is expected to have the highest growth rate of all S&P sectors. Its Q2 profits are expected to climb 13% and revenue by 8%. ""All 10 industries within the sector are estimated to record positive numbers this quarter, but none more than semiconductors, which are currently anticipated to increase earnings by 50%"" year over year, Estimize Research noted.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

If you're managing a retirement account or taxable portfolio, why not tap into the Fidelity Investments' brain trust, which includes an army of analysts? Knowing cumulative stock moves in Fidelity's many mutual funds can help you choose your own buys and sells.Not all Fidelity funds make the same buys and sells, but it's instructive to see which leading stocks Fidelity overall bet more of its shareholders' money on the first quarter and where it lightened its weightings. Normally you'd have to track down and then sift through Securities and Exchange Commission filings by each of Fidelity's 358 stock and balanced funds. But CFRA, an independent research firm, has done that and crunched the numbers for you already.What CFRA found is that Fidelity's biggest sector weights were in information technology and consumer discretionary.

It had more than 15% of its shareholders cash placed in consumer discretionary stocks.""Heading into 2017, economically sensitive information technology stocks were poised to benefit from a risk-on environment,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of ETF and mutual fund research.

81,INFO,"Are you financially ready to retire? A whopping 28% of working adults don't have any retirement savings, according to a new Federal Reserve survey.Many workers who don't have any or enough retirement savings think there's little if anything they can do to improve their retirement finances. ""They don't take even small steps because they don't think it will do them any good,"" said Tom Anichini, director of research for robo-advisor financial service GuidedChoice. ""But they're wrong. Setting aside even very small amounts can be a big help.""Here are three tips that show how you can jack up the size of your retirement nest egg, in some cases by 20% or more, without having to rob a bank. Equally important, a bigger nest egg means you can afford to pull more income per month from your retirement account.Increasing the amount you save can be both painless and effective. ""If you are saving a certain percentage of your pay, say 5%, and boost it by just one percentage point, you probably won't notice the difference in your take-home pay,"" Anichini said. ""But your future stream of contributions will produce an account balance that will be 20% bigger at retirement.""Fidelity's number crunching illustrates the power of small increases in your savings rate. Suppose you are 55 years old, earning $80,000 a year. Since you're near your sixties, you might think it's too late to do anything that will help your retirement savings in a useful way.Think again. Your paychecks each month total $6,666.67. If you increase your contribution to your retirement account by 1% of your pay, that means you'd kick in an additional $67 per month.Here's how that $67 per month helps. Let's say you retire at age 67, and that your account earns 7% a year on average. That's a reasonable assumption. Large-cap stocks averaged a 10.08% yearly return between 1926 and April 30 of this year, according to Morningstar Inc. Small-cap stocks did even better, averaging a 12.09% annual gain.Let's also assume you get a 1.5% pay raise each year. By retirement, the amount of money you can pull from your retirement account each month would increase by $72. Your monthly withdrawal can now total $1,295 instead of $1,223. And you can keep pulling that extra $72 until age 93, when the account is finally depleted. That could be an extra dinner for two a month.That might not seem like much, but the value adds up. By boosting your retirement savings by $704 a year, which works out to $8,448 over the 12 years until you retire, you end with an extra $864 per year of income. That translates into $22,464 of cumulative extra income until age 93.So, the extra income you receive for 26 years is more than 2-1/2 times greater than the extra amount you invest between ages 55 and 67.The younger you are, the more dramatic the springboard benefit is. Let's say you are 25 years old, earn $40,000 and will retire at 67. You earn the same annual 7% rate of return as the hypothetical 55-year-old and enjoy the same 1.5% annual pay raise.You'll end up with enough to withdraw $1,934 each month from your account until depleting it at age 93.But if you increase your monthly contribution by $33 — 1% of your salary — then by the time you reach retirement at age 67 you'll be able to withdraw $2,257 each month. That would be a $322 monthly increase in income. That's an extra $3,864 per month of income. Now you're out of dinner territory and into cruise territory.And that's a whopping $100,464 of extra income from age 67 to 93.That's the power of kicking in a measly extra 1% of your salary to your retirement account, starting early.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeLike A Spycam Peeking Into Fidelity Stock Moves — This Info Can Pump Up Your Retirement AccountWhy Many Millennials' Retirement Savings Will Be More Than Twice Baby Boomers'

82,INFO,"X The major indexes shaved mild opening losses amid the uproar on Capitol Hill over President Trump's firing of FBI chief James Comey. Investors in general remained focused on the latest corporate results.And the results in some high-growth firms confirmed the overall bullishness of the market. Nvidia (NVDA), Coherent (COHR) and Electronic Arts (EA) all blasted higher, each gapping up well more than 10% in swelling volume.The S&P 500 was still virtually flat at around 1 p.m. in New York, as a rebound in oil and gas stocks as well as gold mining, gaming software, fabless semiconductor and shoe making firms offset declines in the travel booking, fiber optic telecom gear, steel, biotech and trucking industry groups. The Dow Jones industrial average showed a minimal loss. The Nasdaq composite edged higher. Near-term WTI crude oil futures rallied 2.8% to $47.18 a barrel. The small-cap S&P 600 inched higher while the Russell 2000 gained nearly 0.5%.Nvidia soared more than 14% to 119.91 and got as high as 120.88, coming close to surpassing the cup base's left-side high. Volume is on pace to more than triple its 50-day average turnover of 13.7 million shares, a sign of huge institutional demand in the stock.The current base does not fit the ideal model of a double bottom since the second sell-off to 95.49 did not undercut the first sell-off to a low of 95.17. Therefore, for now, the current 12-week consolidation would be a cuplike base with a buy point of 121.02, or 10 cents above the cup's left-side high.Technically the stock has formed a base next to a faulty five-week cup that formed from Dec. 28 last year to Feb. 6. A good cup base must be a minimum six weeks, with or without a handle.Given that the stock had shown signs of a climax run back in late December, one should expect a former leader to need more time to digest its grand gains following the March 2016 breakout past a 33.16 cup-with-handle entry.An aggressive investor could buy shares today, however, by this rationale: Draw a trend line on a daily chart from the base's left-side high and across the recent highs within the base. Since Nvidia burst well above the trend line, try to buy as close as possible to Wednesday's session open at 114.29.No doubt, Nvidia continues to show it has enviable fundamentals and a leadership position in the fields of data center, artificial intelligence (AI) and other hot markets.Fiscal Q1 profit surged 85% to 85 cents, crushing the Street's consensus view of 66 cents, as revenue escalated 48% to 1.94 billion. Also impressive is the fact that net margin jumped 520 basis points to 27.5%.""Our Datacenter GPU computing business nearly tripled from last year, as more of the world's computer scientists engage deep learning,"" CEO Jensen Huang said in a news release. ""One industry after another is awakening to the power of GPU deep learning and AI, the most important technology force of our time.""One could see Nvidia's approach to AI as part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm, in which N stands for something new. Nvidia, meanwhile, plans to return up to $1.25 billion to shareholders in the current fiscal year ending in January 2015 in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks.A total 386 mutual funds and hedge funds took new positions in Nvidia in the first quarter of this year, according to data provided by William O'Neil + Co. Meanwhile, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) was one among 614 funds adding to their positions while 666 funds reduced their stakes. In total, 1,937 funds own stock in Nvidia at the end of Q1, up sharply from 1,642 funds as of Q2 2016, but the total shares owned has fallen from 303.1 million to 256.7 million over the same time frame.Electronic Arts gained 13% to 108.94 in huge volume after reporting a 262% leap in fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings to $1.81 a share. Revenue rose 17% to $1.53 billion, the biggest increase in nine quarters. The big-cap member of IBD's Computer Software-Gaming group has gained more than 29% since clearing an 84.35 saucer-with-handle buy point on Feb. 10.That group has vaulted up IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups and subgroups (listed each day in the Data Tables section at ""Stock Lists"" Investors.com) to No. 13, up from No. 122 two weeks ago. Laser maker Coherent rallied more than 10% in volume running five times normal levels after it reported triple-digit earnings and revenue gains for Q1. The stock is extended more than 20% past a 200.63 flat-base buy point. Shares originally broke out on March 24 and 27, then quickly tested the buy point during a mild three-week pullback.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Snap (SNAP) edged 1.3% lower to 23. As noted in prior Stock Market Today columns, Wall Street will be very interested in seeing how the company manages expenses down the road and whether the revenue will grow fast enough to place the Snapchat social network operator on a profitable track. The Street sees the company losing 19 cents a share in the first quarter despite revenue growing 307% to $158 million a share. However, in Q2, that net loss is seen shrinking a bit to 13 cents a share.Snap recorded net losses of 8 cents a share, 9 cents, 10 cents, 11 cents and 15 cents in the prior five quarters. Last year, revenue rose 404% to $590 million.The Venice, Calif., firm has not traded a full 50 sessions yet, but its up/down volume ratio is still solid at 1.4. That partly reflects the huge volume during its big gains on the first two days of trading on the NYSE on March 2 and 3.The stock went public at 17 a share. It has 1.16 billion shares outstanding and a float of 364 million shares. In its Internet-Content industry group, currently ranked No. 11 out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance, at least 15 companies hold a Composite Rating of 95 or higher and trade at least 10 a share. They include group leaders Momo (MOMO) and Weibo (WB) of China, Grubhub (GRUB) of Chicago and real estate info expert Zillow (Z) of Seattle.Zillow, which spiked more than 9% higher on May 5 following robust Q1 results (earnings of 11 cents a share, revenue up 32% to $245.8 million), is currently at 42.97, extended past a 39.15 buy point in an eight-month saucer-type base. The 5% chase zone from 39.15 extends up to 41.11.In some cases, a great stock will make a mild pullback, ideally in lower turnover than the volume seen during the breakout, to within the proper buy zone, thus enabling traders to get a second chance to initiate a position. IBD research has found that up to four out of 10 stock market winners tested their breakout point soon after launching their big price runs.RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: Why Snap's Stock Is Acting Better LatelyHow To Sell At The Market Top: First, Count The Distribution DaysInside IBD 50: Can These 4 Consumer Leaders Add Zip To Your Portfolio?Tech News: Strong Results In The Data Center Boost Nvidia's Q1 ProfitInvestor's Corner: Why Patience Is Important To Win Big With The Saucer Base

95,INFO,"It is no secret that most active managers fail to pick stocks that beat the benchmark S&P 500, but some bright minds think investing in ETFs may do the trick. Wait, those boring old investments that ""passively"" match the returns of the stock and bond markets?Oh, yes.In the hands of select money managers, the humble exchange traded fund is a building block for sophisticated portfolio solutions that help their clients to become more successful investors. The bedrock of these ETF-based strategies is tactical trades to seize market opportunity and systematic risk management to limit losses. The hope is that these packaged portfolios of ETFs will outperform the bogey with less risk over a full market cycle.Vern Sumnicht was driven to develop an all-ETF strategy after the stock market rout of 2000, when the buy-and-hold approach failed investors.""Like many other advisors and their clients, we found that when the S&P 500 index went down, every asset class went down"" with it, said Sumnicht, the CEO of Wisconsin-based iSectors.He added: ""We developed the iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation strategy to achieve a better risk-adjusted return for our wealth management clients.""The pioneering tactical ETF investment strategy takes aim at the flaws in traditional asset allocation. It replaces the style-box method with what Sumnicht describes as nine ""clumps of sectors"" with low correlations, including stocks, bonds and gold. Managing downside risk of returns is key, hence the ""Post-Modern Portfolio Theory"" in its name.Over the past 11 years — including the stock market collapse of 2008 — the Post-MPT Growth Allocation strategy has outpaced the S&P 500, as discussed in more detail below.Sumnicht's best ETF investment ideas tap sectors poised to benefit most from President Trump's economic vision. Unsurprisingly, those sectors dominate the Post-MPT Growth Allocation strategy.He elaborated on the strategy's ""black swan rule,"" which buffers against unexpected downturns and thereby improves potential returns, in the interview that follows.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017IBD: How does the iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation strategy achieve growth and avoid drawdowns?Sumnicht: The traditional approach is to achieve growth and avoid volatility (standard deviation). However, standard deviation assumes that both upside volatility and downside volatility are bad.Although it shouldn't need to be said, upside volatility (meaning, unexpected positive return) isn't considered a negative by investors. Investors just don't want to lose money; they only consider downside volatility (unexpected losses) a risk to avoid.We use a proprietary mathematical algorithm to determine an ""efficient frontier"" from which we select an optimally allocated (risk/return optimized) portfolio. Our approach allows us to set a threshold of acceptable downside, which we define as zero.In effect, we are looking for the best return each month, allocating among nine, low-correlated sector indexes, without going below zero, that is, without losing money.IBD: How does the strategy enhance traditional Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)?Sumnicht: Our iSectors Post-MPT Allocations maintain optimal portfolio allocations by re-optimizing the portfolio's asset allocation monthly as the investment environment changes.The strategy does not reject any of the principles of MPT, but instead it catapults MPT to a new level of effectiveness. Its success and reduced drawdowns (risk) can be attributed to:IBD: Which sectors does it currently own and why are they attractive?Sumnicht: We are currently allocated among six asset classes. The four largest allocations are utilities, financials, technology and energy.We don't choose how to allocate the portfolio based on our investment committee's subjective opinions, but more importantly, we use an objective mathematical process. Optimal allocations and monthly reoptimizations are based on changes to 15 different economic and capital market factors.I can speculate that these four sectors are currently attractive because of stated policies coming from President Trump. He has clearly stated his intention to significantly improve infrastructure in the U.S., which would help U.S. utility stocks and other infrastructure equities.Economic stimulus from personal and corporate tax cuts could give the Federal Reserve more latitude in raising interest rates, and a rising interest rate environment is positive for the financial sector.President Trump has consistently committed support to the energy industry, including coal, pipelines, storage, drilling and reduced regulation, which supports boosting energy sector investments.The current administration has also proposed a tax amnesty to allow offshore cash (reported to be in excess of $3 trillion) to repatriate at a 10% tax rate. A large percentage of these offshore dollars are from the technology industry. Lower corporate taxes in general, repatriated capital and a more favorable regulatory environment should mean an increase in tech company profits.IBD: What are the big allocation changes between 2016 and now?Sumnicht: One of the most prominent differences in the allocation between 2016 and now is our allocation to Treasury bonds.Last year we were up to about 50% in 20-year Treasury bonds. By January 2017, we had zero in Treasury bonds.I don't think the election had a lot to do with this change in asset allocation. However, the prospect of higher interest rates does not bode well for long-term bonds.IBD: What exactly is the ""black swan rule"" in your strategy?Sumnicht: Great question! We designed ""black swan"" event protection into the iSectors Post-MPT Allocations. Simple but effective, we limited the allocation to any one asset sector to 30%, except for government Treasuries, which can be up to 50%.Certainly, diversification among low-correlated asset classes protects the portfolio from having everything go down at the same time as in 2008. The other type of black swan event would be an event that might cause a significant drop just in one or two industries or market sectors. Our policy of allocating only 30% to any one market sector was put in place to protect from this type of black swan event.IBD: How did the strategy perform vs. its benchmark in 2016 and since its Feb. 1, 2005, inception?Sumnicht: Our iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation gained 10.39% in 2016 vs. 11.96% for the S&P 500 benchmark index.From inception, it is up an average annualized 9.26% vs. 7.76% for the S&P 500 index.IBD: How did the strategy perform in the financial crisis of 2008?Sumnicht: In 2008, iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation was down 16.0% vs. a 37% decline in the S&P 500 index.IBD: What is key to the strategy's potential for outperformance in the long run?Sumnicht: Historically, iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation tends to outperform the S&P 500 in the long run by not losing as much in down markets and performing better in relatively flat markets.IBD: Who is the target investor?Sumnicht: We have investors of virtually every type in iSectors Post-MPT Allocations. This includes individual, IRA, 401(k), trusts, nonprofit and others.I consider iSectors Post-MPT my core portfolio, but because of low correlation to stocks and to bonds, it also adds diversification and improves risk-adjusted returns to any stock and/or bond portfolio.This strategy reoptimizes the asset allocation monthly, which can cause the accounts to realize some capital gains each year. Therefore, all things being equal, if I had a choice to own this investment in a qualified or a nonqualified account, I may be marginally better off owning it in a qualified account.IBD: What are its assets under management, investment minimums and fees?Sumnicht: Currently, iSectors has a total of $220 million in assets under management (AUM). The iSectors Post-MPT Allocations' AUM is about $123 million.Account minimums are $25,000, although various TAMP (Turnkey Asset Management Program) platforms can require different minimums. Our fees for Post-MPT are 0.50% of AUM.IBD: How can one invest in the strategy?Sumnicht: Investors can access iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation through their financial advisor as a separately managed account, and 401(k) plans can access it through several TAMP partners including Mid-Atlantic, Matrix and others.In addition, individuals, advisors and retirement plans can access the strategy through our ETF, iSectors Post-MPT Growth (PMPT).(Editor's note: The asset size, expense ratio and liquidity of this ETF warrant the additional scrutiny to which new ETFs are subject.)IBD: What key criteria determine whether you will invest in an ETF?Sumnicht: These are the three key considerations:We constantly monitor our ETF selections.Our selection analysis assesses the existing ETFs vs. potential alternatives, including their expense ratios, bid-ask spreads, index-tracking error, asset base, trading volume (liquidity) and tax implications, as well as those issues mentioned above.RELATED:Growth ETF Strategy Taps Rally That Trump Has Ignited In 7 S&P Sectors

96,INFO,"In the old days, before the iPhone, a financial advisory firms could get away without updating their technology every year, but not anymore. As consumers go mobile, they expect advisors to be up-to-the-minute with the latest technology. Almost everyone uses the web or mobile technology and expects to get info on a 24/7 basis. If an advisor isn't providing that service, they can be sure their competitors are.But with all the tech tools out there, how do advisors sift through the clutter to determine which tech products and systems help financial advisors compete and which ones don't?""When tech works it's great, but not all tech works,"" said Joel P. Bruckenstein, president of consulting firm Technology Tools for Today and founder of the T3 Technology Conference. ""Advisors need a due diligence process to go through. When you use a system without vetting it, it can be embarrassing. You never want to put anything out there without testing it.""IBD'S TAKE: There are many ways to start and improve your financial advisory practice. Check out IBD's Financial Advisor Briefing coverage, which has articles on all topics of interest to FAs.Bruckenstein said common mistakes include advisors not realizing that a review of a technology product might not apply to their situation, and that there is no ""best"" customer relationship management (CRM) software, or any ""best"" technology for that matter. It all depends on your needs, what technology you're currently using, and which custodians you're using.""Advisors need to take everything into context,"" he said.The second thing advisors need to look at is the tech company itself. What is its history? Does it have a record of innovation going back many years or has it been cheap with research and development, which means their products will soon become obsolete.When evaluating new systems, Anthony Schembri says he reads a lot of white papers put out by custodians and third-party vendors. The director of investment operations at Clarfeld Financial Advisors in Tarrytown, N.Y., said he's constantly networking at conferences with other advisors and firms to see what they're using and what they've had success with.Then he talks to the technology experts at his custodian to find out what the top firms are using. Finally, he tries out demos to see which products will integrate with his system. After narrowing it down, he finally has his staff try it out. He said, if they don't embrace it, it will fail.Mark Friedenthal has a three-point checklist he addresses before buying any new technology. The founder of Friedenthal Financial, an RIA in Voorhees, N.J., wants to know if it will do one of three things. One, does it improve operational efficiency? Second, will in assist in business development? That is, will it generate more referrals, increase conversions and increase retentions? Third, will it reduce compliance risk?""Some firms invest in reducing compliance risk,"" said Friedenthal. ""One potential time savings is with regulators, to makes it shorter and smoother, also time savings in litigation. We make investments to reduce that risk. If we are less exposed that is worth something to us.""Finally, he tries to determine the true cost in both cash outlays and time. Will this new technology be worth the anticipated revenue and be more cost effective than alternatives?""Before you buy a new technology make sure the process is sound and that you're not automating something stupid,"" said David Edwards, president of Heron Wealth, an RIA in New York City. ""If you have a bad operations set up or a bad marketing set up, bringing in technology won't make it better.""Edwards makes a commitment to replace his technology every four years, and attends Bruckenstein's conference every February to keep up to date. He also has three criteria for purchasing new technology. First, is it better, faster and cheaper than something he already has. Second, does it integrate with his current system and current custody platform and financial planning platform, which are all tied together. The final criterion is security.""We've had vendors that were not maintaining their platforms with current standards for cybersecurity, which is so important,"" said Edwards. ""All the data that a bad guy needs is neatly packaged inside our systems. We need the highest level of encryption with duel factor authentication.""Bob Thielmann, the chief information officer for Philadelphia broker dealer Janney Montgomery Scott, puts is simply: ""When I look for new tech, we try to assemble the best of breed for a certain niche.""Much like the others, Thielmann wants his new purchase to integrate with everything he already has, eliminate duplicate data, match his firm's security needs and be simple enough that everyone at the firm gets it.RELATED:Advisors Adopt Strategies To Fend Off CompetitorsWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

"
98,INFO,"ETF investors bet big on technology stocks ahead of earnings reports from marquee names in January. Powered by demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple (AAPL) delivered supersize results on Jan. 31 and saw its shares soar.Technology was the strongest S&P 500 sector in terms of flow of money as the new year got underway, according to Sector SPDRs. Investors last month poured $897.3 million into Technology Select Sector SDPR (XLK), the largest and most active exchange traded fund for exposure to this sector.This marked a significant reversal from 2016, when investors yanked nearly $900 million from XLK for the year, said Dan Dolan of Sector SPDRs. Trading activity in XLK so far this year suggests that ETF investors are ""very bullish"" on the technology sector, in his view.""In addition to the flows, the short positions declined by 27%"" in January, Dolan told IBD via email. ""Earnings have been very good,"" he pointed out, ""for most of the big names.""Those names include Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) — tech stalwarts reinventing themselves for a new cloud-driven, Internet of Things era — as well as chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Texas Instruments (TXN), Microsemi (MSCC), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Outliers included Alphabet (GOOGL) and Qualcomm (QCOM), which delivered mixed results.Tech earnings are tracking higher, at 9.6%, than the 6.6% expected at the start of the Q4 season, according to CFRA Research. And XLK's 4.3% year-to-date gain, vs. 1.8% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), reflects investors's optimism about improving industry fundamentals.While earnings season has put technology companies under a spotlight, the macro outlook is driving interest too.Technology stocks are expected to benefit from the economic strength that tends to go hand-in-hand with periods of rising interest rates.""As business spending picks up, as consumer confidence grows and consumption increases, tech companies will be the beneficiaries of those trends,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA. Other tailwinds include the promise of corporate tax reform and repatriation of foreign cash under President Trump, which disproportionately benefits the tech sector, Rosenbluth pointed out.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted at Tuesday's earnings call that 94% of his company's record $246.1 billion cash pile is stashed abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhone maker could potentially bring home foreign earnings at a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday could be one of the single biggest catalysts for the sector going forward, CFRA analysts say.Risks to the sector include the uncertainty surrounding Trump's vision for economic renewal, the crimp that a strengthening dollar could put on global IT spending, and the onslaught of low-cost rivals such as Huawei in key foreign markets.Investors who remain bullish on the sector's outlook have four dozen ETFs to choose from. Many of the new launches make extremely focused bets in extremely small industry niches — 3D printing or Big Data or wearable devices, for example.In Rosenbluth's view, most investors would do well to stick with a technology ETF offering broadly diversified exposure to the sector, and to then layer on thematic ETFs in specific tech industries.Investors have been seeking diversification. Two tech ETFs far outpaced their peers last year by gathering more than $1 billion apiece in fresh assets, and both hold a broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedly different approaches to investing in the sector.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of U.S. tech companies, including more small- and microcap stocks than most other broad tech ETFs. It invests $10.75 billion in assets across 366 stocks for an extremely low 0.10% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) follows an equal-weighted index of Nasdaq-listed U.S. technology stocks. It has virtually no exposure to small- and microcap stocks, but has a significant midcap stake. At 0.60%, its expense ratio is among the highest in the segment.Investors should be aware that ETFs may sound alike but offer very different exposures, which affects their performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearly double the gains of its Vanguard peer. It benefited in part from its extreme overweight to the semiconductor industry.Looking ahead, Rosenbluth believes VGT may benefit more than other broad-based peers from an improving U.S. economy, given its larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on the stock market on Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risk7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As Trump Takes The Wheel

99,INFO,"Snap Inc., parent of messaging app Snapchat, will publicly release financial information and other data related to its upcoming initial public offering late next week, according to multiple media reports.Snap confidentially filed its IPO with the SEC last year. So this will be the first time that the company will have to give hard data about its size and growth.Comes as Facebook (FB) has said its ad load have nearly maxed out, while Twitter (TWTR) struggles to expand beyond its power user base.Snapchat has been a huge hit with teens and young adults. Its innovative messaging options and tools have spurred Facebook and its photo-sharing unit Instagram to copy them.IBD'S TAKE: Snapchat will be the first big tech of 2017. Will it spur a stampede of tech unicorns going public?Snap reportedly will look to raise up to $4 billion in its IPO. Snaps is eyeing a market valuation of $25 billion, though that could rise, Recode reported, which broke the news of Snap's imminent public filing Friday evening.Under the rules, Snap must wait 21 days to begin its roadshow to tout its IPO to institutional investors. That suggests that Snap could go public in March.Snap may fight for media coverage with Facebook, will reports fourth-quarter earnings late Wednesday. Analysts expect EPS to rise 66% while revenue climbs 46%, which would be stellar, but it would also be Facebook's second straight quarter of decelerating growth.Facebook shares rose about 4% to 132.18 in stock market trading last week, breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 129.37 buy point. But the daily and weekly volume was below normal.Twitter shares fell 0.1% to 16.57 last week, stuck below its 50-day and 200-day moving average. Aside from a short-lived surge in late 2016 surge on media and tech giants mulling takeover bids but ultimately declining, Twitter has been in a downtrend since the end of 2013, shortly after its IPO.RELATED:Facebook Still In Early Stages Of Growth Despite Massive Size

Its move came as Jefferies reiterated a buy rating and raised its price target on the graphics chip designer, which outlined its self-driving car strategy in a keynote speech last week at CES.With Apple and Nvidia in the spotlight, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) rose for a fifth straight day to a 52-week high of 49.55 before turning lower.Volume was tracking 60% below average.This $14.57 billion ETF posted a 2.2% weekly gain Friday as big-cap techs such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) got off to a strong start in the new year.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT), with $10.58 billion in assets, also made a fresh high of 124.98 Monday.Analysts at CFRA are bullish on the technology sector with President-elect Donald Trump poised to take office on Jan. 20.""Trump's No. 1 priority is domestic growth,"" Scott Kessler, an equity analyst with CFRA said on a Dec. 15 webcast. ""He's looking at ways to reduce the burden on corporations (through tax cuts and less regulation).""Those moves should especially benefit economically sensitive sectors such as industrials and technology, which together account for roughly a third of the overall market cap of the S&P 500, according to CFRA.Under the new administration, ""the single biggest catalyst for the (tech) sector could be reducing taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings,"" which should benefit Apple and Intel (INTC) most, Kessler added.Trump has proposed a tax holiday allowing corporations to bring money stashed overseas back to the United States at a special tax rate of 10% instead of up to 35%.The heads of both Apple and Intel were present at a meeting between Trump and technology CEOs on Dec. 14, Kessler noted.IBD'S TAKE: Seminconcutor ETFs have far outpaced diversified tech ETFs in the past year, making frequent appearances on IBD's ETF Leaders screen.XLK, the largest among technology ETFs, was outperformed last year by broad-based technology peers with more exposure to small-cap and midcap stocks.In 2016, PowerShares S&P SmallCap Information Technology (PSCT) jumped 33.5% vs. a 15.0% gain for XLK. And Guggenheim S&P Equal Weight Technology (RYT), which holds the same stocks as XLK but has a smaller cap skew, climbed 19.1%.Smaller companies are inwardly focused and are likely to benefit more from the improved growth prospects for the domestic economy, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA.Rosenbluth also considers First Trust Nasdaq Technology Dividend (TDIV) to be well-positioned in the changing U.S. outlook.""TDIV can do well as expectations of tax policy changes and foreign repatriation by tech companies lead to more dividend payments,"" he said.The tech dividend ETF posted a 20.2% gain in 2016. Apple and Intel are its top two holdings out of 97 stocks.However, Rosenbluth cautions that technology ETFs with exposure to telecom stocks — including XLK, RYT and TDIV — will be negatively affected if interest rates keep rising as many market watchers expect.Income-oriented telecom stocks become less attractive to investors as rates rise and new issues start to pay more.

Early Wednesday, comments by President-elect Trump regarding drug pricing sent shares into a tailspin.After two days in the black, biotech stocks toppled 3.1% on Wednesday. But IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, down more than 2% earlier Thursday, ended the session up a fraction, trading at its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Things are looking up for Tesaro, despite the FDA's request for more information into its manufacturing process for IV drug Varubi. Varubi is the brand name for Tesaro's drug to treat delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro led the biotech industry in terms of stock gains in 2016. Get the other top names in IBD's Industry Themes.Tesaro said it was forced to find a second manufacturer for Varubi after it identified potential deficiencies at the original manufacturer. The FDA is trying to determine comparability between the products manufactured at both sites.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young called the issue ""relatively minor."" She has an outperform rating and 151 price target on Tesaro stock, and expects the company to refile with the FDA within the next two months. Approval could come as soon as mid-2017, she said.""The FDA is not questioning the comparability but looking for more info about actual assay,"" she wrote in a research report. ""Tesaro provided the in vitro release assay as requested, but apparently the FDA has further questions about the assay.""Importantly, there are no safety and efficacy concerns associated with Varubi, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in his research report. Fernandez has an outperform rating on Tesaro stock. He also expects Tesaro to refile later in the first half of 2017.Assuming a speedy approval process, Fernandez maintains his estimates on Varubi sales at $343 million worldwide in 2026. He expects Varubi to gain 35% share in the U.S. and 25% share in Europe.RELATED:Tesaro Ovarian Cancer Drug Gets Priority Review After FDA Approves Clovis Med

105,INFO,"Top U.S. intelligence officials stood firm in their conclusion that Russia's most senior officials authorized data theft and disclosures during the 2016 election campaign and pushed back against public criticism of their work by President-elect Donald Trump.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that the intelligence community's confidence in its findings is now ""very high"" and that the nation's spy agencies are ""even more resolute"" in their conclusion about Russian involvement than when they first publicly weighed in on the issue Oct. 7.Asked to respond to public questioning by Trump of the intelligence community's conclusions, Clapper said ""there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement. Public trust and confidence in the intelligence community is crucial."" Without citing Trump, Clapper added that he has heard concerns from his foreign counterparts about the perceived belittling of the U.S. intelligence community.Clapper spoke alongside Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Marcel Lettre and National Security Agency Director Admiral Michael Rogers.The hearing — called by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., — highlights a divide between Trump and some of his party's most influential foreign policy hawks in Congress.The president-elect has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, while McCain and other lawmakers have said Russia, which has repeatedly denied the hacking accusations, should be punished with stiffer sanctions.The hearing also comes one day before Clapper, along with CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey, are scheduled to brief Trump on the Russian hacks. And it follows an unprecedented public questioning of the agencies by the president-elect just weeks before he takes office Jan. 20.In a series of tweets starting Jan. 3, Trump called an alleged delay in his briefing on the Russian hacks ""very strange"" and went on to quote an interview with fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who said on a Fox News opinion show this week that ""a 14-year-old"" could be responsible for computer breaches of Democratic Party offices last year. ""Also said Russians did not give him the info!"" Trump added in his posts.Clapper and Rogers both said Assange had put U.S. lives in danger by publishing classified material on WikiLeaks in the past and shouldn't be a credible source on the hacking issue. The intelligence community doesn't have a ""whole lot of respect for him,"" Clapper said. Asked if Trump's comments are hurting morale among intelligence officers, Clapper said: ""I hardly think it helps.""Trump pushed back ahead of the hearing, saying on Twitter that ""The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people ... to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against 'Intelligence' when in fact I am a big fan!""Asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., if he's ready to be challenged by Trump at the Friday briefing, Clapper said ""absolutely,"" and that he welcomes it.At the start of the hearing, McCain, the committee's chairman, called Russia's hacking an ""unprecedented attack"" on U.S. democracy. Alluding to criticism of the hacking accusations by Trump, McCain said the goal isn't to question the outcome of the presidential election, but he said ""every American should be alarmed"" by Russia's attack.In prepared remarks, the intelligence officials said Moscow ""poses a major threat"" to U.S. government, military, diplomatic, commercial and critical infrastructure networks. They also said Russia has developed a ""highly advanced offensive cyber program.""""Looking forward, Russian cyber operations will likely target the United States to gather intelligence, support Russian decision-making, conduct influence operations to support Russian military and political objectives, and prepare the cyber environment for future contingencies,"" their statement said.Clapper told the Senate panel that intelligence officials plan to brief Congress behind closed doors and release an unclassified version of their review to the public early next week. Although there are some sensitive sources and methods, he said he intends to ""push the envelope as much as I can,"" he said.""The public should know as much as possible,"" said Clapper, who described himself as ""apolitical."" ""We'll be as forthcoming as we can.""In recent years, the intelligence officials said in their statement, the Kremlin has assumed a more ""aggressive cyber posture,"" targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure, think tanks, universities, political organizations and corporations, often using phishing campaigns that give attackers access to computer networks. In some cases, Russian intelligence actors have ""masqueraded as third parties"" with false online identities to confuse the source of the hacking, they said.Yet the officials also emphasized that Russian hacking didn't change the vote count that made Trump president.The intelligence community and U.S. Cyber Command continue ""hardening"" internal U.S. government systems, the officials said. Still, as of late 2016, more than 30 nations are developing offensive cyberattack capabilities, the officials said in the statement.Other countries they named as cyberthreats include China, Iran and North Korea. Terrorist groups are also using the internet to collect intelligence and incite action, such as Islamic State continuing to ""seek opportunities to target and release sensitive information"" about U.S. citizens.Responding to McCain's questions about how to prevent hacking by foreign governments, the intelligence chiefs said deterring cyberattacks is more complicated than traditional military deterrence, partly because the response by adversaries is less predictable. McCain said the government's current case-by-case response to hacking attacks ""isn't a strategy"" for effective deterrence.Hackers continue to break into U.S. defense industry and commercial enterprises to obtain scientific, technical and business information, Clapper and his colleagues said.""Adversaries are likely to further explore cyber-enabled psychological operations and may look to steal or manipulate data to gain strategic advantage or undermine confidence,"" they said.

106,INFO,"If President-elect Donald Trump's economic growth plan — slashing business and personal marginal tax rates and rolling back costly business regulations — is achieved next year, the economy could break out with 4% to 5% growth. And that means much higher interest rates.This rate rise will be growth-induced, a good thing. Higher real capital returns will drive up real interest rates. And inflation will likely remain minimal, around 2%, with more money chasing even more goods alongside a reliably stable dollar-exchange rate.We're already seeing some of this with the big post-election Trump stock rally occurring alongside a largely real-interest-rate increase in bonds.However, looking ahead, 4% real growth plus 2 percent inflation could imply 6% bond yields in the coming years. That's a big jump from the 2% average of most of the past ten years.And what that says is the time to act is now.The average duration of marketable Treasury bonds held by the public has been five years for quite some time. Almost incredibly, Treasury Department debt managers have not substantially lengthened the duration of bonds to take advantage of generationally low interest rates. Hard to figure.Treasuries held in public hands have moved up from 32% of GDP back in 2008 to 74% today. Interest expense for fiscal 2016 is nearly $250 billion. So if Treasury debt managers had significantly lengthened their bond maturities, they would have saved taxpayers a bundle.Now, with new economic-growth policies poised to drive up average Treasury rates to perhaps 6%, the Treasury folks better get moving fast to capture today's historically low yields. Up to now they've been sleeping at the switch.The key point? Start issuing much longer bond maturities. Much longer. If possible, the U.S. should experiment with 50-year debt issuance, and maybe go out as long as 100 years.And this better happen fast.Other countries have been smarter than us. Ireland and Belgium issued 100-year debt. Austria issued 70-year debt. Italy, France, and Spain issued 50-year debt. And Japan pushed out a 40-year maturity with rumors that it's considering 50 years.And Mexico, incredibly enough, has done three 100-year issues since 2010. The sizes were small, and the bonds were sold in foreign currencies. But it can be done.Britain is probably the best benchmark. (The Brits are a lot like us, speaking even the same language!). The U.K. Treasury has issued 40- to 50-year bonds seven times. The latest auction was October 2015, with the issuance of 50-year debt with a coupon of 2.5%. (Thanks to economist Conrad Dequadros for this great debt info.)Some more numbers. The CBO estimates that interest costs over the next ten years total $4.8 trillion, with the debt rising from the current $14 trillion to $23.1 trillion in 2026. They estimate the 10-year Treasury rate will average 3.3%. And the average rate on all debt increases to 4%.Now, with some very rough back-of-the-envelope calculations, under President-elect Trump's growth program, suppose 10-year Treasury rates rise to average 5% over the next ten years, rather than the CBO's 3.3% guess?The average interest rate for all debt would increase to 4% over that period rather than CBO's 2.6%. The total interest-rate expense would be around $7 trillion rather than the CBOs $5 trillion.However, if the U.S. issued 50-year debt, with the same rate as Britain's 2.5%, by front-loading some longer-term issuance to hold the average interest rate to 3.5%, there would be a $1 trillion savings on budget-interest expense over the ten-year horizon.That's not chump change.Skeptics will ask who exactly will buy 50-year U.S. paper. It's a good question. But remember, insurance companies and pension funds need long-dated liabilities to match long-duration assets. Foreign institutions might also be interested in ultra-long U.S. Treasuries, provided the U.S. dollar is reliably stable.This is entirely new ground for U.S. debt management. But since a lot of foreign countries have successfully sold 50-year paper, we know it can be done.And for the U.S. it must be done.And if we sell out a bunch of 50-year offerings, why not try 100-year paper? A century bond.The budget savings would be incalculable. And under new policies, if the U.S. returns to its long-term annual growth trend of 3.5%, which prevailed in the prior century, America's debt-to-GDP ratio could plunge to 30% or 40% instead of skyrocketing to 150% or more.Stronger growth and much longer bond-maturity issuance will snatch fiscal victory from the jaws of defeat.

The midpoint of the company's outlook for Q1 earnings per share of $1.68-$1.72 fell short of analyst expectations for $1.72.FactSet's fiscal Q4 EPS rose 11.9% to $1.69, matching views.

110,INFO,"Wells Fargo (WFC) disclosed Thursday that its sales scandal is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in an apparent effort to protect investors blindsided by the company's recent scandal over its operating practices.The San Francisco-based bank announced the SEC probe Thursday in a regulatory filing. The review adds to regulatory headaches for the bank, which has faced a barrage of criticism and calls for closer scrutiny since agreeing in September to pay $185 million over claims that employees opened as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts.""The company has responded, and continues to respond, to requests"" from regulators seeking information on its sales practices, the settlements and related matters, according to the filing.Lawmakers called on the SEC, the Department of Justice and others to look more deeply at Wells Fargo amid the public furor over the customer account scandal, which forced the retirements of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, the executive who was in charge of the community banking unit. The bank has fired 5,300 workers and said it would eliminate sales goals linked by regulators to its cross-selling strategy.The SEC often reviews whether public companies have failed to disclose issues that are material to shareholders, typically information that could impact their investment decisions. Still, the SEC frequently decides against bringing enforcement cases based solely on this test.""Materiality is what a reasonable investor would consider to be important as part of the overall info he or she looks at when making an investment decisions,"" according to Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor.In the Wells Fargo case, one question is whether the $185 million settlement should have been considered material for a company that reports billions of dollars in profits. The SEC also may be examining whether executives falsely touted the growth in sales numbers with many of the accounts were fake.Lawmakers from both major parties have questioned whether Wells Fargo misled investors by failing to disclose the investigation that led to the September settlement. There also have been concerns raised about whether employees who reported wrongdoing through internal channels were mistreated.Three Senate Democrats, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote to the SEC in September, asking the agency to investigate whether the bank violated whistleblower protection laws by firing employees after they tried to report misconduct.Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, including Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, have also said they've heard from whistleblowers in their districts who were pushed out after reporting misconduct.

111,INFO,"The decline in stocks steepened with an hour to go in Tuesday's session as volume continued to run higher, indicating another round of heavy selling by institutional investors.Big-cap techs paced the sell-off as the Nasdaq composite lost more than 1.1%. It was down 1.5% at the session low. The S&P 500 fell 1%. The Dow Jones industrials shed 0.9%.Small caps got roughed up more. The Russell 2000 slumped 1.4% and the S&P SmallCap 600 tumbled more than 1.5%.Apple (AAPL) dropped more than 2% and hit a session low of 110.53 — just two dimes above its recent breakout from a bottoming cup-with-handle base at 110.33. During choppy markets, the tendency for leading stocks to retreat to or near their proper entry points increases.Tesla Motors (TSLA) continued to struggle after it failed to hold on to last week's earnings-inspired rally. The large-cap auto play dropped nearly 4% to 190.27, nearly matching its June low. The stock continues to fail to find the strength to muscle back above its 50- and 200-day moving averages and will certainly need a lot more time to fashion a brand-new base.Tesla's RS Rating, as noted in IBD Stock Checkup, is now at 18 out of a maximum 99, meaning the stock is underperforming roughly four out of every five stocks in the market over the past 12 months. That 18 RS Rating is also 14th best among stocks in IBD's automakers industry group.IBD'S TAKE: On Oct. 11, the Nasdaq composite fell 1.5% in increased turnover vs. the prior day. That marked a fifth distribution day, or bout of intense professional selling, and knocked IBD's current outlook for the market down a notch to ""Uptrend under pressure"" from ""Confirmed uptrend."" The risk of losing money rises when the outlook is downgraded. To stay on the right side of the market, read The Big Picture column each day. It's the only story that highlights what the market, which moves on the real-money decisions of millions of players, is actually doing on a day-to-day basis, not what talking heads think the market will do.Tesla says it's planning to release more details on the financials of solar panel installer SolarCity (SCTY), which has plans to merge with the electric-vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk founded both companies, and his relatives are executives at the beleaguered solar energy firm. SolarCity shares sank 3% to 18.94, sliding back beneath the 50-day line and are now 67% below the 52-week high of 58.87.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Lumentum (LITE) led the upside among highly rated issues, rebounding 6% to 35.70 in heavy volume. That's only a small portion of the 19% slide it suffered in the prior five sessions. That drop not only triggered a key sell signal but also gutted nearly half of the fiber-optic network supplier's strong gains from a breakout at 27.49.Crude oil futures edged lower following harsh selling on Monday. Near-term WTI crude futures fell 0.3% to $46.70 a barrel, a day after sinking nearly 4%.British energy titan BP (BP) gapped down at the open and slid more than 4% to 33.99, crossing back below its 50-day moving average after reporting a 49% drop in Q3 profit. While oil refining margins shrank, BP also posted an operating loss of $224 million in its exploration and production unit.BP shares are in the midst of a gigantic base-building effort. The stock peaked at 53.48 in late June of 2014 and corrected as much as 49.5% in price to a low of 27.01. This means that BP has to rise nearly 100% just to revisit that high.However, BP rebounded sharply in April this year — enough to rally back above its key 40-week moving average (please see a weekly chart) and has managed to hold most of those gains. So the current sideways action has a saucerlike pattern with a potential 37.38 entry point.At 33.99, that leaves the stock just 9% below that potential breakout price.RELATED:Facebook, Alibaba, Apple Struggle, Fed Looms: Wednesday Investing Action PlanHow Was Apple's Quarterly Report And Its Fiscal Q1 Outlook?When Did Apple Break Out?Do You Know The Bottoming Base Chart Pattern?

One of the goals of ETF investing is to be properly diversified, after all.To trim dependence on Apple, an investor could consider an ETF such as Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology (RYT), which skews toward smaller companies, or First Trust Technology AlphaDex (FXL), which is fundamentally driven, according to Rosenbluth.Should you care about having too much of Apple or any one stock in your overall ETF portfolio?

As any respectable drama should, it held triumphs, surprises and disappointments.Among commodity ETFs, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) dumped 5.3% in the month ended Oct. 12 as a hawkish Federal Reserve spooked gold bugs.Among sector equity ETFs, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) charged 4.4% higher as investors uncovered growth in a weak market. Nvidia (NVDA), a top five holding in SMH, set a record high in early October after revealing a new artificial-intelligence supercomputer chip for self-driving cars.Among international equity ETFs, iShares MSCI Brazil Capped (EWZ) rumbled ahead 5.1% as the price of oil unexpectedly spiked to its best level in four months.All three exchange traded funds are among the best-performing ETFs of 2016 in their respective categories, with yearly gains ranging from 18.0% to 72.7%.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is up 6.5% so far this year through Oct. 12.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016Investors find themselves at an interesting crossroads in this stage of a long bull run. They see potential for stocks to trend up again, in the glimmer of recovery for corporate profits and in policymakers' extreme caution about making a rate move that could unsettle the markets.Yet the stock market today is rife with uncertainty. In the short term, the November presidential election could create volatility. In the longer run, the global oil glut and the health of the European financial sector remain troubling.Many ETF investors find themselves wondering whether to play it safe with low-volatility and high-dividend ETFs as they did early in this year, or to move more aggressively into riskier trades.Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, suggests the latter may be worth considering.""A brighter oil price outlook, due to an unexpected OPEC plan to cut production and a surprisingly big drop in U.S. oil stockpiles, is positive for risk assets and supports the case for some reflation,"" he wrote in an Oct. 10 note.Higher oil prices would reinforce current market trends, he added.That means so-called haven investments such as utilities and low-volatility stocks could get hurt. Cyclical assets such as emerging markets would be helped.There are lessons to be learned, too, from how the big money managers are positioning their client portfolios.So IBD reached out to two pros for their stock market outlook and their best ideas on how to make money investing in ETFs.Here's what they said.Mark Diorio is chief investment officer at Brookstone Capital Management in Wheaton, Ill. The firm has $1.5 billion in assets under management and takes a risk-managed approach toward investing.Our monetary analysis leads us to three main areas of challenges and opportunities based on the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and a reasonable path for future interest rates. First, the nominal level of interest rates is low and conventional bonds with low, fixed coupons do not protect against inflation.Second, the shape of the yield curve (a graph plotting interest rates along the maturity schedule) is flattening. Simply, the interest-rate differentials between long-term bonds and short-term bonds have narrowed, leaving investors yield-starved for current income.Third, our base-case scenario for the reasonable path for future interest rates is for a series of one-quarter point (0.25%) rate hikes annually. This low-intensity path may promote stability in the stock and bond markets.IShares Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIP): Unlike traditional bonds, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are designed to eliminate inflation risk by adjusting both the principal value and coupon payments to keep up with inflation.IShares Preferred Stock (PFF): For investors that desire current income, preferred stocks may offer an attractive alternative or complement to traditional income sources such as investment-grade or corporate bonds.Preferred stocks are income-generating securities that are somewhere in the middle of the risk spectrum between common stocks and traditional bonds. PFF had a 12-month yield of 5.74% as of Oct. 12.IShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM): In a scenario where future interest rates are on a low-intensity path, stocks may resume their uptrend and thrive.MTUM invests in well-performing stocks with the idea that stocks with higher relative performance may continue to produce strong performance in the near-term relative to stocks with weak performance. Top five holdings out of 121 include Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook, AT&T (T), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Home Depot (HD).Chris Cook is founder and CEO of Beacon Capital Management in Dayton, Ohio. With $2 billion in assets under management, the RIA firm helps investors capture stock market gains while limiting losses from market volatility.Since the market has many uncertainties today -- the presidential election in the United States, the question as to whether or not the Fed will raise the interest rates, or whether or not the Europeans will continue with negative rates -- a neutral, equal-weight sector allocation is appropriate for most investors.We prefer Vanguard's sector ETFs because they cover all 11 sectors of the S&P 500, have exposure to small- and midcap companies, and are extremely inexpensive. They generally have a 0.10% expense ratio ($10 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested) and allocate 25% of their assets to smaller stocks.No one sector is showing significant momentum, although energy and technology are showing early signs of strength. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities are showing short-term price weakness, but not enough to offset their relatively high yields.Vanguard Technology (VGT): The tech sector is experiencing a lot of activity through mergers and acquisitions right now. Top holdings in VGT include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Intel (INTC).The largest of the technology companies are cash-heavy and not subject to interest-rate sensitivity, so they are well-positioned to acquire other notable tech firms, such as Twitter (TWTR) and Netflix (NFLX).Vanguard Energy (VDE): In the energy sector, profits are directly correlated to supply levels and it looks like the supply levels of energy may taper off in the coming months.The Mideast is working to cut back on supply levels with the expectation that crude prices will go back up to $50 a barrel, the breakeven point, potentially leading to more profit. Weather may have an impact on energy production in the U.S., making it difficult for drilling to take place in areas impacted by severe weather, further limiting supply levels and resulting in increased profits.Vanguard Financial (VFH): On the assumption that interest rates will be raised in December, the financial sector will benefit through increases in profit margins across the board. Lending institutions will generate greater spreads and margin on cash or money market accounts.RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?

Going international may sound impractical, but for Brian Levin's Perky Jerky meat snacks firm, the decision to cross the Pacific brought his company invaluable lessons -- and a real growth opportunity.Explore. In June, the Greenwood Village, Colo.-based company is set to be the first American enterprise to sell beef products in Japan following the end of a 13-year ban on imported meat items. (The ban was due to the global scare in the late 1990s and early 2000s over mad cow disease.) Perky Jerky will launch two flavors in 7-Eleven convenience stores across Tokyo, and Levin hopes to eventually grow that partnership across the country's 18,768 stores.The U.S. Department of Agriculture assisted Perky Jerky in attending trade shows and learning about the Japanese market. ""Their food safety standards are far higher than anything in the U.S., even in the 7-Eleven stores,"" Levin told IBD. ""It made us step up our game.""Learn from your best fans. Customer feedback convinced Levin to place a money-back guarantee on every package if a customer did not think it's the best-tasting. After millions of packages delivered, Levin says they've gotten just 50 inquiries. He put the nutritional info -- calories, total fat, sodium, protein, sugar -- on the front of each package, not back, because consumers want to know.Have patience. Levin worked two years on the Japan project. The time helped him appreciate how serious Japan's trading companies and retailers get about succeeding, once they get behind a product. ""Resist the temptation to be overly optimistic, and then anticipate time-to-market very conservatively. It's simply impossible to predict how long it will take to build the necessary relationships and establish the right network,"" Mona Pearl, author of ""Grow Globally,"" told IBD. ""You cannot put a time frame on building trust.""Meet ""face to face."" Relying on email and meetings online can magnify differences between cultures, Pearl notes. Do your homework in understanding those differences and avoid misunderstandings.Turn failure into progress. Tucson Tamale turned heads at this year's Expo West natural products expo in Anaheim, Calif., as a top maker of premium-quality corn tamales. In 2015 alone, the company rolled 1.25 million tamales, up from 200,000 in 2009. One lesson that owner Todd Martin learned: Never sacrifice quality over an order, no matter how large. Years ago, it hired a co-manufacturer to help fill an order for 40,000 tamales; the customer rejected the entire batch because a banned ingredient was used.Martin ultimately gained by forming strong internal review processes. ""Do not hesitate to make decisions,"" he said. ""You will make some bad decisions, sure, but the freedom you get from good decisions far outweighs the problems of bad decisions.""Don't overanalyze. Levin's former boss, Grey Goose vodka creator and billionaire Sidney Frank, taught him to sometimes go with your gut on a new product rather than spend millions on a market study by an outside firm. For instance, Perky Jerky's Jammin' Jamaican flavor came from Levin's experience with Caribbean jerk chicken at roadside stands in Jamaica. Kroger (KR) and Publix chains now sell it nationwide.Don't stand still. Older products can lose favor fast. ""The next generation does not trust legacy baby boomer brands,"" said Steve Hughes, head of Sunrise Strategic Partners, an equity owner in Perky Jerky. Why? The older brands ""do not reflect their passion for pure and simple ingredients,"" as well as a ""mission-driven and authentic back story.""Related: TV And Movie Characters Teach Leadership TraitsIntegrity And Trust Are At The Heart Of Great LeadershipLearn From Self-Made Billionaires To Reach The Top.

117,INFO,"Drug giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) both face key Food and Drug Administration actions this Tuesday that will affect the future of their leading disease-treatment franchises.An advisory committee to the FDA will meet to discuss expanding the label of Jardiance, Lilly's 2-year-old drug for treating type 2 diabetes. What Lilly wants to add to the label is that the drug also reduces death by cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, and the risk of death in general.Those claims are based on a large, long-term trial called EMPA-REG, the results of which surprised the industry last year. Patients on Jardiance showed a 38% reduction in death from cardiovascular causes, a 35% reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure, and a 32% cut in deaths from all causes. If the FDA approves the label expansion, Lilly's sales reps will be able to use this in marketing the drug.The problem, according to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, is that those were not the primary endpoints of the trial; they were secondary, ""exploratory"" endpoints. The primary endpoint was a three-point measurement of major adverse cardiac events (MACE): the time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack and non-fatal stroke. On that, results were more mixed: Only on the first point did Jardiance achieve a statistically significant difference, while the non-fatal stroke incidence was actually slightly higher than in the placebo group.When the FDA released its briefing documents for the panel Friday morning, in fact, the conclusion affirmed that the study does show a reduction in CV death, but advised against including the MACE, heart-failure and all-cause death info on the label. This was nonetheless interpreted positively by analysts, and Lilly stock was up 0.5% on the stock market today despite the general Brexit sell-off.""The panel also consists of a substantial portion of cardiologists, which will help tilting the balance towards highlighting the CV benefit during the panel, in our view,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note Friday. Previewing the event on June 2, Fernandez had predicted the panel would be ""a battle of 'statistical purists' vs 'clinicians,' "" adding that ""clinically, the large and consistent CV death benefit seen in the EMPA-REG trial is viewed to be precedent-setting.""That precedent will also be of interest to Novo Nordisk (NVO), which recently reported that a similar study of its diabetes drug Victoza also brought a reduction in cardiovascular deaths, though not to the extent that Jardiance did. Novo Nordisk has said that it will also file for a label addition but hasn't yet decided on the language. The Danish diabetes specialist fell 4.4% Friday.Tuesday will also be the deadline for the FDA to decide whether to approve Gilead's latest hepatitis C pill. Gilead's last two hepatitis C launches, of Sovaldi and Harvoni, broke financial records, but those were restricted to certain genotypes of the virus. The new pill would be approved for all genotypes, not only enlarging the market, but also removing the need to test the patient's genotype before writing a prescription.Wall Street has no doubt that the FDA will approve the drug, but the interesting question is how Gilead will price it. When it launched in December 2013, Sovaldi gained notoriety for its price of $84,000 for a 12-week regimen, while Harvoni (launched in October 2014) was more than $94,000.However, when AbbVie (ABBV) launched its competing Viekira Pak in December 2014, the two companies started a rebating war that hit Gilead's income.Then this January, Merck (MRK) priced its new HCV drug Zepatier well below both, which both Gilead and AbbVie acknowledged hit their Q1 financials. It remains to be seen how Gilead values the pan-genotypic nature of the new drug.Gilead stock was down 3.5% Friday, hitting a 2-year low. AbbVie sank 2.4% and Merck 3.1%

118,INFO,"Drug giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' (TEVA) drug for Huntington's chorea hit a setback with the FDA Tuesday, sending shares of potential rival Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) soaring on the stock market.The FDA issued a complete response letter to Teva refusing its application for approval of SD-809, or deutetrabenazine, saying the agency wanted Teva to ""examine blood levels of certain metabolites,"" according to Teva's statement.SD-809 is a deuterated version of tetrabenazine, a treatment for the same condition sold by Danish drumaker Lundbeck as Xenazine. Taking Xenazine causes a surge of metabolites in the blood that inhibit the uptake of certain neurotransmitters that appear to be related to the involuntary movements, or chorea, associated with Huntington's disease.Teva says that applying its deuterium technology allows for less frequent dosing by creating more consistent blood levels of metabolites, also increasing the drug's tolerability. It would be the first deuterated drug on the market.""The metabolites on Teva's drug appear similar to Xenazine's metabolites -- although the blood levels could differ (since Teva drug is deuterated). Teva will re-file in 3Q for Huntington's and potential approval possible in 1Q 2017,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat in an email to clients.Teva also still plans to file for approval of SD-809 this year for neurological disorder tardive dyskinesia, which is where Neurocrine comes in. Neurocrine also has a tardive dyskinesia candidate, called valbenazine, for which it plans to file for approval with the FDA this year.""Neurocrine's valbenazine is a new chemical entity, (so) we do not see any direct read-through to the company's impending NDA (new drug application) filing, while the CRL for Teva represents a delay for a potential competitor,"" wrote Leerink analyst Paul Matteis in a research note. ""Although the SD-809 NDA was for the treatment of Huntington's chorea, investors expected SD-809 to also garner some off-label use in tardive dyskinesia, which would have represented a potential headwind for valbenazine.""Neurocrine finished trading up 7.5% on the stock market today, to 49.65. Teva stock was up 0.4%, to 51.87.

120,INFO,"Bristol-Myers Squibb vs. Merck, Pfizer vs. Lilly and a unique treatment from AbbVie (ABBV) will take the spotlight next week at the biggest drug conference focused on treatments for one of the biggest diseases: cancer.The annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology in Chicago on June 3-7 is a prime opportunity to check up on some potential blockbuster drugs.The abstracts for most of the presentations were released to the public on May 18, giving the gist of study results but leaving details for the conference itself. And some of the most interesting items for investors will be among the late-breaking abstracts.As in the past several ASCO meetings, the battle of the immunotherapies will be a major theme. The two marketed PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda, are already big sellers in skin and lung cancer, with Opdivo ahead in market share. But ongoing research will give an idea of their true market potential, as well as how they stack up against each other.As is often the case for cancer drugs, Opdivo and Keytruda were both approved for advanced cases of the disease first, but the largest market opportunity is for front-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Among the cancers, one of the largest market opportunities is in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which Bristol-Myers and Merck are targeting.In the first abstract release, Merck's Keynote-021 study of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy yielded improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of 10 months overall, and 14 to 15 months in patients whose tumors showed high expression of PD-L1, the ligand the PD-1 inhibitors indirectly target.""Here we continue to see solid ORR (overall response rate, or percentage of tumors that shrank) and PFS data, and look to the meeting to better understand the durability of the response over longer periods of time,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan in a May 19 research note.Bristol-Myers is also conducting first-line NSCLC studies. Its most significant might be Checkmate-012, which combines Opdivo with another Bristol-Myers immunotherapy drug, Yervoy. If that proves to be the most effective combo, then that would be huge for the company, since Bristol-Myers would wholly own the treatment and thus gain all the revenue from it.There was no new Checkmate-012 info in the early abstracts, but analysts hope it will be among the late-breaking data.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover says he also wants to see data on Tecentriq, Roche's (RHHBY) entry into a sister class of drugs that target the PD-L1 ligand directly. By coincidence, the FDA approved Tecentriq for a type of bladder cancer called urothelial carcinoma on the same day the ASCO abstracts were released.""They were first to file in bladder (cancer),"" Conover told IBD. ""Bladder's a big indication -- not as big as lung cancer, but having that niche for Roche will really help drive that drug's sale.""Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, however, notes that Tecentriq could soon have competition, as shown in other ASCO presentations.""Initial data for Bristol Myers’ Opdivo and AstraZeneca's (AZN) durvalumab show higher response rates in this indication,"" Fernandez wrote in his May 19 research note. ""Beyond the smaller patient numbers in both data sets, baseline characteristics to be presented at ASCO should be closely watched.""A newer battle seems to be shaping up in a different drug class, called the CDK 4/6 inhibitors, used to treat breast cancer. The CDK stands for cyclin-dependent kinase, an enzyme tied to cell division, encoded in genes CDK4 and CDK6. The inhibitors help stop the cancer cells from multiplying.The first of these, Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance, launched in early 2015 and took in $723 million last year. That's expected to swell into the billions eventually.Eli Lilly (LLY), however, has made some noise with its CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, which showed a much higher response rate -- 25% -- in refractory patients than did Ibrance. In the ASCO abstract on Lilly's Monarch-1 trial, after eight months of treatment that number was only 17%, still better than Ibrance but a slight disappointment to Wall Street.At Lilly's R&D day on Tuesday, though, the company said it will also be presenting 12-month data at ASCO, so there could still be an upside surprise. Nonetheless, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that Lilly executives didn't seem that enthusiastic.""Lilly seemed to not want to boost investor expectations with regards to the 12-month data, and therefore reiterated the 17% ORR results (reported at eight months) when asked,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Additionally, Lilly encouraged investors to also look at overall clinical benefit and duration of response during the presentation at ASCO.""Hovering in the background, though not at ASCO, is the Novartis (NVS) announcement May 18 that it had stopped its late-stage trial of its own CDK drug early because it had already hit its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS. The details on that will have to wait for a later medical meeting.""That's also a positive development for the space,"" analyst Divan told IBD. ""There's room for more than one winner.""Meanwhile, Pfizer scored a hit for its treatment with late-stage data showing that Ibrance in combination with estrogen blocker letrozole yielded PFS of more than 20 months, or 10 months more than letrozole alone.This prodded analyst Fernandez to raise his 2025 sales estimate for the whole CDK 4/6 class to $13 billion from $10 billion, and his 2021 estimate for Ibrance sales alone to $8.3 billion from $6 billion.Among the late-breaking data in other fields, one study that many on Wall Street are eyeing is the midstage trial of Rova-T, a drug that AbbVie is acquiring through the $5.8 billion buyout of biotech Stemcentryx. Rova-T is a treatment for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a smaller market than the enormous NSCLC population but a definite opportunity since it lacks a specifically approved treatment.Previous studies have shown a 44% response rate in relapsed patients with high expression of delta-like protein 3 (DLL3), which appears in 80% of SCLC patient tumors. The presentation at ASCO is particularly important because Stemcentryx will be reporting long-term survival data, which is the gold standard in cancer trials as far as the FDA is concerned.Analyst Schoenebaum says Rova-T will have to improve survival enough to differentiate itself.""We know that chemotherapy produces around six months' OS (overall survival) in the setting that they're testing Rova-T in,"" Schoenebaum said in a video recorded for clients on May 23. ""And we know that there was some data in the ASCO abstracts (showing) PD-1 plus Yervoy produced about eight months, but (with) a lot of toxicity.... But the punchline is we need to see OS data well in excess of six months.""AbbVie has estimated that peak annual sales of Rova-T could hit $5 billion.

121,INFO,"Financial technology firm Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) (FIS) got an upgrade Wednesday in the wake of its investor day Tuesday, sending the stock briefly to a new high.Analyst Moshe Katri of Sterne Agee CRT lifted his rating to buy from neutral and set his price target at 85, writing that FIS is shifting away from project-based IT to more stable, higher-margin business lines.""In our view, one of the major reasons for the downward rerating of FIS’s valuation which in the past was at par with peers Fiserv (FISV) and Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY) (both with sticky/high-recurring revenue models) has been the company’s lackluster performance last year, triggered by its weak IT Services business,"" Katri wrote in his upgrade note.""We believe the CEO’s message, pointing to exercising more stringent controls over (the) consulting arm, Capco, reflects management’s realization that cross-selling IT services or project-based business has been a major deviation from the company’s traditional model.""Credit Suisse analyst Paul Condra also noted that FIS had issued 2018 guidance above expectations, implying 14% EPS growth each of the next two years.

127,INFO,"An information-rich world should make us smarter. Sometimes the deluge just muddies thinking. How to be savvy with numbers:Discern. Big Data might be a business buzzword, “but it’s actually the little data that affects and influences our lives,” said John H. Johnson.He’s a Ph.D. in econometrics, which applies statistical and mathematical theory to economics.Johnson and journalist Mike Gluck wrote “Everydata: The Misinformation Hidden in the Little Data You Consume Every Day.”Consumers should pause to consider how figures are tallied before letting numbers guide an opinion or action.“Just look at it with a critical eye,” Johnson told IBD.Dig. Cherry-picking means choosing the most favorable data, and ignoring the rest, to make a point.In 1996, Gerber made the claim that 4 out of 5 pediatricians who recommend baby food recommend Gerber.Delving into the survey revealed that Gerber asked 562 pediatricians; 408 recommended baby food, 76 recommended a specific brand, and 67 recommended Gerber.The 4-out-of-5 figure came from those last two numbers.“Looking at the fine print matters a lot,” Johnson said.Assess. Does a study of 300 lawyers speak for the 1.3 million lawyers in America?That’s a small portion, called a sample. It’s used to draw conclusions about the whole.Stop to consider if the sample is representative of the group.“The people who respond (to polls) have time or an interest in the topic or a position,” Johnson said. “It could be who’s home for phone surveys. Often, that’s the elderly.”Scientists would weigh how the sample was selected and how often the result could be repeated.Weigh. Survey takers are often asked to self-report facts, such as how many hours they sleep each night.“People are notoriously bad at estimating things,” Johnson said. “That starts to degrade the quality of the information.”Differentiate. Studies sometimes tie one act to another -- such as drinking coffee and acquiring cancer.There’s a difference between correlation and causation.“We can find lots of relationships between two variables,” said Johnson. That’s correlation.“Is there a cause and effect that truly links those two things?” he asked. That’s causation.Ice cream sales and crime rates correlate because both increase during the summer.That’s different from saying that ice cream causes crime or vice versa. “Isolating causality is really hard work,” he said.Decode. Graphs provide a quick visual to indicate trends. Before drawing a conclusion, check the basics.Look at the X and Y axis. Does it run from 0 to 100 or 45 to 55? Do the numbers go up or down?Adjusting the scale or height of the axes can change the story.De-categorize. There’s a notion that celebrity deaths happen in threes. One source is the passing of Michael Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Ed McMahon over the span of three days in 2009.But a few days later, commercial pitchman Billy Mays died.That raises the question: “What is my definition of celebrity?” Johnson said.Beware the temptation to make trends out of arbitrary incidents. “The plural of anecdote is not data,” Johnson said.Scrutinize. When faced with numbers, take a moment to exercise your skeptic’s muscle.“Every statistical finding can be viewed through a lens of: 'Does it make sense or not?’ ” Johnson said. “This is when people’s intuition can really help them.”

128,INFO,"Organizations that create engaged employees have performance measurables that far surpass companies that don’t, according to Gallup.“To win Customers -- and a bigger share of the marketplace -- companies must first win the hearts and minds of their employees,” the research company says in its 2013 report, “The State of The American Workplace.”That's certainly been the experience of Tom Salonek, the CEO of technology consulting and training firm Intertech and the author of “The 100: Simple Steps for Building a Winning Business."" He and Steven Gold, author of “How We Succeed: Making Good Things Happen Through the Power of Smart Experiments,” share across-the-board tips on making your business and yourself more efficient:Get SMART. That is Salonek’s acronym for ""specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and time-focused goals"" -- for business, career and all aspects of your life. He cites studies that continue to affirm that writing your goals down -- and visualizing them -- make you much more likely to achieve those objectives.Build rapport. This ranges from ensuring that employees understand how their job fits into the company’s big picture to giving continuous feedback on their performance, Salonek says. Engaged employees are more than 20% more productive, he adds, and are absent nearly 40% less than their unengaged counterparts.“Constantly creating and strengthening relationships is another key to long-term achievement and success,” adds Gold.Hunt small monsters. By proactively looking for potential business problems daily, Salonek says, his company slays beasts before they grow up to wreak havoc. He says that the company's financial update covers leading indicators “because six data points in a direction are a trend, with sampling every workday. If there are future shifts in our business, we’ll know within a week and a half.”Utilize efficiency tools. They free up time and simplify work and home life, Salonek has found, adding that the amount of apps available today vs. just five years ago is staggering.His favorites:Streamline delegation. When working with assistants, provide enough direction so that tasks can be completed without further input, Salonek says.For instance: Instruct an assistant to set up a board meeting with everyone attending on the week of the 20th, but that if that date doesn't work, to try the week of the 27th, with some people dialing in for the meeting. Further, after the date is set, direct a meeting invite to all, with the location info and dial-in instructions.Experiment. Gold says research shows that the highest business achievers are decisive in trying new things, yet are also wrong a significant portion of the time. But that’s OK.The best strategy for innovation is “intelligent experimentation,” which he defines as “investments of resources -- time, energy, experience, know-how, skills, connections, physical assets, money and more -- that empower us to see what works, learn from what doesn’t work, and take the next step into the future to invent successful outcomes.”Minimize risk. Gold said the caveat to high achievers being wrong a lot is that “they always do meaningful experiments and never bet more than they can afford to lose.“Failure is generally not a failure of execution, which most of us are well-prepared for, but instead a failure to recover when something goes wrong. That’s what preparation is all about.”Acknowledge and reward. All of us have experienced situations in which a colleague is rewarded due to a stroke of luck, Gold said, “and others who have worked even harder get ignored.“It’s terrible for an organization because it’s condescending to everyone who has worked hard, and demoralizing when employees realize that luck trumps effort.”The leaders of the most innovative organizations “celebrate smart experiments irrespective of outcomes,” Gold said. “With the right process we achieve the right results.”Related:Customer Loyalty Requires Careful Attention To Finer Sales PointsDifferentiate To Help Your Company Stand Out From The Competition

129,INFO,"The slow-growth economy means it's harder to find stocks whose earnings growth makes them worth buying. Various macro currents muddy the market waters even more, making earnings visibility murkier. So how can investors find good stocks to buy?Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund (GEGTX), one of IBD's Best Mutual Funds of 2016, is a consistent outperformer over longer periods. Going into Tuesday, the $3.4 billion fund's average annual returns for the past three years, five years and 10 years rank in the top 20%, 21% and 24%, respectively, of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.The fund managers make buy and sell decisions based on individual stocks' merits. But sector weights indicate where they've found their best opportunities.Judging by the weights, the fund's managers think their best bets are in the information technology, consumer discretionary and health care sectors. Those were their largest sectors as of March 31, and the sectors in which they are overweight vs. their Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark.The overweights reflect where they expect to find high-quality companies with consistent earnings growth.""In an environment of lingering global economic uncertainty, particularly where the premium the market is willing to pay for stability has gone up, we have found good relative attractiveness of high-quality sustainable growers in those sectors with less reliance on making an economic cycle call,"" the managers told IBD. Consumer discretionary is a little more economically sensitive than the other two sectors, they said.No. 3 holding Amazon (AMZN) is one of the fund's consumer discretionary names.The stock is at the high end of a buy range from a 603.34 cup-with-handle buy point, but it's also near an alternate entry at 638.16, 10 cents above its Jan. 28 intraday high.Earnings per share grew 170%, 118% and 122% the past three quarters, on sales increases of 20%, 23% and 22%, respectively.The consensus of Wall Street analysts is for Amazon to post a Q1 profit of 58 cents a share. That would be a big improvement from its 12-cent-per-share loss in Q1 of 2015. Revenue is expected to climb 23% to $28 billion. Amazon will report results April 28 after the close.Among other major holdings at the fund is Broadcom (AVGO), an info tech name with a sterling three-year sales growth rate of 56%. That was third-best among IBD 50 stocks as of Friday. Its three-year earnings growth rate is 63%.Formerly known as Avago Technology, the chip designer's recent acquisition of Broadcom is expected to more than double sales. Still, the Apple (AAPL) supplier's stock slipped 2% on Friday amid a report that Apple will cut production of iPhones in April through June, due to sluggish sales.Broadcom designs chips that are used in smart phones, appliances, servers and displays. Its EPS grew a respective 151%, 78%, 26% and 15% over the past four quarters.Trading around 154, the stock is in a three-weeks-tight pattern, showing a 159.75 entry.Also in the fund is Priceline (PCLN), another consumer discretionary name. EPS grew 0%, 14% and 16% the past three quarters, respectively.Trading around 1,346, shares are within range of a 1,342.09 double-bottom entry.The online travel firm is expanding business in China and elsewhere in Asia.

130,INFO,"Sector equity ETFs exemplify the value of the middle path.These vehicles allow you to actively tilt your portfolio toward this broad sector or that industry niche for successful investing. At the same time, the exchange traded fund wrapper prevents you from loading up on single-stock risk.Technology ETFs are revving up as electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA) totes up 325,000 Model 3 reservations in the first week of preorders.In fact, the three largest diversified tech ETFs are nearing buy points. The tech sector's momentum comes in large part from the chipmakers who supply parts to companies such as Tesla and Apple (AAPL).They certainly stand to benefit from the Model 3 prebookings, which reflect $14 billion of potential sales.So do the tech hardware and software companies, and communication and electronic equipment suppliers, that make everything from Tesla cars' breakthrough electric motors to the processors that power their in-dash touchscreens.A Tesla is a computer on wheels, after all.You could, of course, invest in Tesla stock, which soared to a seven-month high after the Model 3 unveiling. But perhaps you're wary after its two failed breakouts within the past year.With these three broad-based ETFs, you can tap into the technology investment theme as well as the love that consumers are lavishing on Tesla:Nvidia is a highly rated IBD 50 stock. Many of the largest stock holdings in XLK have strong balance sheets and a durable competitive edge. It holds 73 stocks in total.XLK is trading 2% below a buy point of 44.74 from a 16-week cup base.When XLK broke out of a flat base in January 2012, it ran up 46% by July 2015.The ETF holds $13.97 billion in assets and has a 0.14% expense ratio.It's up 4.5% year to date through April 6.VGT holds 383 stocks. It has $8.58 billion in assets and a 0.10% expense ratio -- the lowest expense ratio of any large and liquid technology sector ETF, according to Morningstar.It's also a more pure-play broad tech ETF. This fund does not hold telecom services companies such as AT&T (T). AT&T and Verizon (VZ) are among XLK's top 10 holdings.VGT has gained 1.8% year to date.It holds 141 stocks, including Nvidia and other chipmakers in the connected-car space such as Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IYW is the purest-play broad technology ETF. It holds neither telecom companies nor IT services firms such as Visa (V).The ETF has advanced 2.0% year to date. It gained an annual average 8.2% over the past 10 years, virtually the same as XLK and VGT.Its 15.4% portfolio weighting in the semiconductor industry exceeds XLK's 11.9% and VGT's 13.6%.Both the fabless semiconductor and semiconductor equipment groups have sped up in the past four weeks. The former ranks No. 17 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. That's up from No. 27 a month ago.All three technology ETFs slipped on the stock market today amid a broad sell-off.

131,INFO,"Graduations and summer weddings are just around the corner. Don’t know what to get graduates and new couples? Birthdays and bar mitzvahs also stumping you? One solution is to get young people started in investing in the stock market.Opening a traditional brokerage is expensive and tedious. Stockpile.com lets you purchase and gift stock using gift cards. That’s right: You can buy stock at the market or drugstore while you pick up the greeting card. Stockpile gift cards are available at 400 locations nationwide, including retailers such as Office Max and Kmart.“Typically, required minimum account balances are high, commissions are high, and you have to buy by share and not a specific dollar amount,” said Dan Schatt, Stockpile’s chief commercial officer. “But Stockpile gift cards make the stock market accessible to everyone.”How it works. Stockpile offers stocks, American depositary receipts and exchange traded funds. Investors can buy or give the exact dollar amount they want, using fractional shares.For example, you want to buy a highflying stock like Alphabet (GOOGL), but you want to spend just $200. No problem. Buy a $200 Stockpile gift card in the Google parent's stock and get fractional shares.“Regardless of how many shares you hold, if the company declares a dividend and you own half a share, you get half a dividend; you have the same rights,” Schatt told IBD.Getting started. You don’t have to have an account with Stockpile Investments to buy a gift card; you can use a credit or debit card to make the purchase.Electronic gift cards offer the largest selection of stock -- 1,000 names. Buying an e-card worth less than $100 carries a flat fee of $1.99; e-gift cards over $100 cost an extra 3% in addition to the $1.99 fee. Physical cards come in $25, $50 and $100 denominations. Those carry a fee of $4.95 to $7.95 to cover interchange, brokerage fees and card-stocking costs. Retail stores sell cards for 20 of the more well-known companies.To redeem a gift card for a security, you must apply and be approved for a Stockpile Investments brokerage account, which takes minutes, Schatt says, because you don’t need to provide lots of financial info usually related to opening options and margin-trading accounts.“It’s a new and unique type of gift,"" said Barrington, R.I., resident Coreen Thompson. ""I love its flexibility -- the recipient can choose any stock they want.”If the stock gift card idea is a bust, recipients can exchange it for a retailer gift card at no cost.Teaching tool. Schatt says many Stockpile gift card buyers are over 30 years old and they’re purchasing for those under 30.Thompson first heard of the cards when her three young adult sons received them as Christmas gifts.“They thought it was cool to be able to invest a tiny amount independently, without any fees,” she told IBD. “It’s giving them a firsthand experience with the stock market at a relatively early age (20s).”If you’re under 18, you’ll need to open your account with an adult.Kids get a custodial account and track stocks they like. If they want to change the stock they received as a gift from, say, GM (GM) to Tesla (TSLA), they can do it at no cost.“If they ever want to purchase more stock, they can do it themselves for 99 cents, and the custodial adult gets an alert online to approve the transaction,” Schatt said.Gifts that grow. Thompson says she bought a $50 Caterpillar (CAT) card for her 2-year-old nephew, whose parents are stock market enthusiasts.“I chose Caterpillar, a company that the 2-year-old was familiar with, (as he has many Caterpillar toy trucks). I coupled the stock gift with a little Caterpillar truck, so I was able to create a theme he could relate to,” she said. “I like the idea of establishing a fund that he/his parents or any loved one can continue to build on. It will be a wonderful nest egg to have for college or whenever he chooses to cash it in later on.”

134,INFO,"Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays will replace liquid crystal display (LCD) screens as the leading smartphone display technology in 2020, research firm IHS Markit (INFO) predicted in a report issued Monday.Samsung Electronics has already adopted OLED displays in its flagship smartphones, such as the Galaxy  S7, and there is increasing demand for OLED displays from Chinese vendors Huawei, OPPO Electronics, Vivo, Meizu Technology and others.Apple (AAPL) is expected to switch to OLED displays for next year's iPhone 8.""Apple's upcoming adoption of OLED displays will be a milestone for OLED in the display industry,"" David Hsieh, senior director of IHS Markit, said in a statement.Universal Display (OLED), a supplier of materials and technology for OLED products, is expected to benefit from the rising demand. Its stock has risen more than 40% in the past 12 months. But on Tuesday, Universal Display stock closed 1.4% at 67.33 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Universal Display stock is benefiting from excitement around the adoption of OLED display technology. The stock is on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks. The IBD 50 is IBD's flagship screen of growth companies showing strong relative price strength and top fundamentals.LCD screens have dominated mobile-phone displays for more than 15 years, but OLED displays are flexible, thinner and more power efficient.AMOLED displays with a low-temperature polysilicon (LTPS) backplane will account for more than one-third (36%) of all smartphone displays shipped in 2020, becoming the most-used display technology in smartphone displays, IHS said. It will surpass a-Si (amorphous silicon) thin-film transistor (TFT) LCD and LTPS TFT LCD displays.""While OLED is currently more difficult to manufacture, uses more complicated materials and chemical processes, and requires a keen focus on yield-rate management, it is an increasingly attractive technology for smartphone brands,"" Hsieh said. ""OLED displays are not only thinner and lighter than LCD displays, but they also boast better color performance and enable flexible display form factors that can lead to more innovative design.""Samsung Display leads in OLED display production today, but rivals are ramping up their manufacturing capabilities. They include LG Display (LPL), Sharp, JDI, BOE, Tianma, GVO, Truly and CSOT, IHS said.RELATED:OLED Display Shortage Could Crimp Apple's iPhone 8 Plans

136,INFO,"Drugmaker Allergan (AGN) got a price-target cut from Canaccord Genuity Thursday after the company hit a delay in its merger with Pfizer (PFE), among other issues.Analyst Corey Davis noted that on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had asked for additional information on the Pfizer-Allergan merger, which was first announced in November. The companies also have to wait until Allergan finishes divesting its generic-drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which itself hit a delay this month that caused Teva to push the expected closing date from Q1 to June. Pfizer and Allergan still expect to close their $160 billion merger in the second half of this year.""In the meanwhile, we are lowering our Q1 estimates (EPS drops from $3.43 to $2.89) as it's always the weakest quarter for specialty pharma, and we feel the rest of the Street is also too high,"" Davis wrote in his research note lowering his price target on Allergan stock to 320 from 340. ""This has been a trend in the past several years and is partly because of the reset of Medicare Part D.""Davis added that the merger of Target (TGT) and CVS Health (CVS) should hit Allergan's distribution business to the tune of $500 million a year, and the launch of bowel-disease drug Viberzi has increased spending.Davis wrote that he is nonetheless maintaining his buy rating due to the high likelihood that the deal will close. There has been some skepticism among investors over whether the Pfizer-Allergan deal is going to close this year -- besides the signals from Allergan's falling stock price, a buy-side survey by Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum this month found that a fifth of respondents place the odds at less than 50%. Along with the FTC's backlog, there's concern that the incoming president and Congress might do something to limit tax-inversion deals like this one, as some candidates have threatened to do.Pfizer's leadership and Wall Street analysts have been more confident, however. On March 8, Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert wrote that the gap between Pfizer's offer price and Allergan's stock price -- then $47 -- presents a buying opportunity as it will likely narrow as the deal closing nears.Allergan stock was down a fraction in morning trading on the stock market today, near 274.

137,INFO,"With tax season in full swing, fraud artists are hard at work trying to get your data and money. Mike Bruemmer, vice president of consumer protection at credit reporting bureau Experian, says most folks are aware of the danger but still don’t do much about it.A recent Experian survey shows that 76% of respondents are familiar with identity theft, with 24% specifically concerned about information lost amid data transmission to the IRS or between clients and tax preparers.“But it’s not translating into better practices,” Bruemmer told IBD. “Only 8% will use a VPN (protected Internet connection). Many will use the Internet at the library. Only 6% will use updated virus protection. And only 36% of people even read notices of data breach.”Security experts advise taking these steps to safeguard your information and assets.File early. Tax ID fraud works because scammers file ahead of legitimate taxpayers and collect their refunds, says John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications and fraud at the National Consumers League.“By filing early and not waiting until Tax Day (April 15), consumers can reduce the risk of scammers filing in front of them,” he said.Do a background check. If you use a tax preparer, make sure they are in good standing with the Better Business Bureau, Bruemmer says, even if they were recommended to you.Cover the basics. Tax preparers must have a preparer tax identification numbers, an agreed-upon flat fee for service and an agreement to sign your returns.Red flags: 1. tax preparers who want to direct-deposit a refund into an account that isn’t yours; 2. those who want to be paid a percentage of your return.Beware of unsolicited email. Sometimes the preparer’s site is taken over by fraudsters, Bruemmer says. “Do not click on any link from the IRS or a tax preparer or anyone you haven’t initiated communication with,” he said. “The IRS will only communicate through U.S. mail. They won’t send you email or phone you.”Tax relief outfits typically offer to settle outstanding tax debts for a significant upfront fee, Breyault says. But consumers can often get the offered relief on their own and free of charge.“Consumers should be especially aware of letters or emails from outfits claiming to be able to settle tax debts for ‘pennies on the dollar, guaranteed,’ ” Breyault said. “Unscrupulous tax relief outfits may claim that a consumer qualifies for a government tax relief program without knowing whether the consumer actually qualifies. In any case, such tax relief programs are usually free for consumers to apply for on their own.”Audit the professionals. Under federal law, tax preparers are required to take steps to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' data, Breyault said, adding: “Consumers should ask their tax preparer whether their data practices comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Safeguards Rule.”Let your tax preparer explain how they are going to file your returns and how they will safeguard your tax information.“Do they encrypt when they store your info?” Bruemmer suggested asking. “Ask them to put (their practices) in writing and sign it, just like you sign their document.”If you're filing online, make sure the tax preparation service you’re using has implemented multifactor authentication, Breyault said. “This will give you a significantly higher degree of data security than the simple email address and password combination,” he said.Stay on top of it. The Federal Trade Commission says you should check your credit report regularly for early detection of identity theft. Experian offers ProtectMyID starting at $15.95 a month. LifeLock is another well-known identity theft protection service, starting at $9.99 a month. Coverage varies, so read the fine print.Image provided by Shutterstock.

138,INFO,"A couple of weeks after the new year began, shares of the otherwise staid WebMD Health (WBMD) suddenly shot up 6% on Jan. 13, hitting a new 52-week high.WebMD shares were starting to make an upward push, but this jump was out of character for the health information website. The reason for the jump: Reports circulated that Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH) were bidding to buy the company.It was a rumor that would be short-lived. The next day WedMD's stock fell 8% after the company squelched the merger talk, saying in a written statement that it is ""not currently in any negotiations to be acquired.""""We've been around a long time,"" WebMD Chief Executive David Schlanger told analysts recently on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""Our content is highly valued by consumers, by physicians, and also highly ranked by the search engines, and we don't believe that situation is going to change.""Although it may eventually choose to merge with a deep-pocketed company such as longtime marketing partner Walgreens, the fact that WebMD isn't seeking a merger should come as no surprise. The company's finances seem fit as a fiddle without the aid of a larger partner.When the New York-based entity reported a 67% jump in fourth-quarter earnings per share to 60 cents on Feb. 23, it kept alive a string of strong reports in which WebMD posted quarterly profit growth of at least 39% for the last three years. At times that growth has gone as high as 600%.Also in the quarter, sales grew 18% to $192.13 million from advertisements on 3.97 billion page views, up 7% year over year. Both earnings and sales topped analyst projections.WebMD's 2015 revenue of $636 million was nearly three times that of the next-largest publicly traded health site operator, Everyday Health (EVDY), which operates its namesake site and several others. Another rival is Time's (TIME) Health.com. WebMD also competes with nonprofits like the Mayo Clinic, which takes paid ads, and the American Heart Association, which doesn't.The health advertising market in general is large and growing, and there are glimmers of optimism, even in negative news. Schonfeld & Associates last year forecast that the global pharmaceutical industry will cut advertising spending by 1.7% in 2016 amid consolidation and growing emphasis on affordable health care. Still, spending will top $21 billion, the market research firm said.WebMD is taking advantage of that, as well as an uptick in new drug approvals. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved 45 new drugs in the U.S., significantly more than the 28 the agency averaged in 9 of the last 10 years, officials say.""There is a historically strong pipeline of new drugs coming to market, a 40-year high,"" Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Donald Hooker told IBD. ""The Food and Drug Administration has been accelerating drug approvals, establishing the fast-track program and speeding the process for breakthrough therapies. And all of those new drugs need ads.""Perhaps best known for its flagship consumer-oriented WebMD site, the company operates a variety of other health-related sites that have enriched its coffers. In fact, one contributes more to the top line than even WebMD, and that is Medscape.A resource for physicians and other health professionals, Medscape has accounted for 60% of the company's total ad revenue each of the last three years. It's a free one-time registration site that provides personalized medical information and education tools to doctors and other health professionals. WebMD says its Medscape Journal of Medicine is the Internet’s first primary-source medical journal.""Drugmakers want to reach both physicians and consumers. But they want to reach physicians more, and they will pay more to do so,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Steven Wardell.Wardell expects Medscape will continue to contribute more to total revenue than WebMD. In the fourth quarter, Medscape averaged 7.3 million physician sessions a month, a 9% increase over the same quarter a year earlier. Other WebMD sites include MedicineNet, eMedicine, drug info site RxList and theheart.org.Figures indicate there's room for growth as drug ad spending is skewed toward old school media such as print magazines and newspapers.Leerink's research shows that just 4% of consumers reach for print media for health news, but the print industry gets 18% of health ad revenue. Meanwhile, 48% of consumers get health info from digital media, but just 31% of ad revenue goes there.""I would call this one of the best macro trends available to investors because pharmaceutical companies will re-index spending to where the audience is -- to digital spending,"" Wardell said.WebMD also is pushing deeper into video health presentations, which could further boost ad sales. Currently, WebMD is launching more than a dozen new video series that range from short, social-friendly episodes like ""how to's"" to in-depth features hosted by well-known TV journalists.Schlanger admits there are hurdles.""Starting in the third quarter of 2015, we began to experience a decline in the rate of growth of our overall traffic, which has continued into the current quarter,"" he said on the conference call. ""We are working to understand the reasons for this change.""Leerink's Wardell said he's not concerned about the slowdown in growth of overall page views because the highly-focused Medscape site for physicians generates the bulk of the company's revenue, and it's growing at a rapid clip.Keybanc Capital's Hooker agrees.""I think the decline in page views (growth) is misleading,"" he said. ""WebMD Health is ultimately a platform for drug ads. And there is a massive flow of new products coming into the market.""

139,INFO,"Decades of research and billions of dollars have poured into developing artificial intelligence, which has crossed over from science fiction to gameshow novelty to the cusp of widespread business applications.Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science where computers are designed to think and operate much like a human brain, supported by advanced forms of computing and software. But it’s only as smart as the amount of information fed into its memory banks. The more information, the smarter it gets. The greatest advancements have been demonstrated in the area of game playing, but AI is now showing its mettle in the business world.""People are starting to kick the tires, looking to see how it can help their business and the bottom line,"" said David Schubmehl, who follows the AI field for research firm IDC. ""The return on investment evidence is not yet clear, but it's starting to happen.""Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM) and Nvidia (NVDA) are among tech leaders with big artificial intelligence ambitions.“We’re starting to see a lot of companies beginning to use different types of AI tech for various uses,” said Schubmehl. “We’re also seeing a lot of venture capital money flowing in and a lot of acquisitions taking place.”IBM, which may have the deepest AI investments and most far-reaching ability of any company, has pitched ""cognitive computing"" as a tool for businesses via its cloud-based Watson platform.Facebook is using AI to decipher the best ways to bring Internet service to remote areas of the world and to make its News Feed feature more relevant to users of the social network.Alphabet is using it to enhance Google search abilities, improve voice recognition and to derive more data from images and video.Nvidia has developed chip technology for AI platforms used in autonomous driving features, and to enhance how a driver and car communicate.Alphabet, Mobileye (MBLY) and others also are tapping AI in the race for driverless cars. It's not enough to have Google Maps loaded up: A self-driving system must identify potholes, weather conditions, traffic congestion and other drivers' behavior -- improvising and improving on the fly.Artificial intelligence, a term coined in 1955, was popularized when IBM’s “Big Blue” became the first computer to beat a reigning world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, in 1997. IBM won again in 2011, when its Watson computer on “Jeopardy!” outsmarted the game show's two top players ever.Last October, an AI computer beat a three-time European champion in the ancient Asian game of “Go.” AphaGo, built by DeepMind, part of Alphabet's Google, beat Fan Hui by 5 games to 0, the first time a computer program has ever beaten a professional Go player and a feat thought to be a decade away. On Tuesday, AlphaGo won the first game vs. Lee Sodol, who is ranked No. 5 in the world. Tuesday's match shows that AlphaGo has made big improvements since beating the No. 633 ranked Fan Hui last year.Google paid $400 million to acquire DeepMind in 2014.But despite rapid advances, artificial intelligence is still in the early stages of business deployment.“A lot of what AI is being used for today only scratches the surface of what can be done,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder and chief scientist at Sentient Technologies. “It will become so ubiquitous that we won’t even call it AI anymore.”Sentient emerged from stealth mode in late 2014 with a massively distributed AI platform that companies can use to boost performance. As shoppers at Shoeme.ca browse through photos of shoes and click on ones they like, Sentient's technology narrows the selection, so people don’t get overwhelmed by choices. There’s no need for text-based searches or drill-down navigation, said Hodjat. The AI technology deciphers what shoppers are looking for, letting them quickly dive deeper into a catalog to find the perfect item that might otherwise go undiscovered.“We’ve revolutionized the user experience on an e-commerce website,” said Hodjat. “It’s a huge change in the way users interact with products online and therefore drives conversion.”Sentient has received $143 million in venture capital funding, the most of any AI startup, according to research firm CB Insights. Since 2010, AI startups have received $967 million in funding. Intel (INTC) alone has invested in 16 AI companies, including Saffron Technology.Saffron says its platform ""mimics the fundamental principles of how humans remember and learn."" In a case study on its website, Saffron helped an insurer to identify fraudulent auto insurance claims. Over 10 weeks, Saffron examined 113,000 claims from one year in one state and found three potential fraud rings. It then detected that these rings were part of a larger ring involved with 38 claims, of which the insurance company had paid out about $400,000 in claims. Saffron was able to collect data that identified relevant and unknown relationships, including different providers, demographics and injury descriptions, creating a knowledge store that had never been done before. Saffron forecasts that the insurer can avoid a payout of tens of millions of dollars a year.AI goes by terms such as machine learning and deep learning. IBM calls it cognitive computing. In October it launched Cognitive Business Solutions, with 2,000 consultants skilled in data analytics, cloud computing and other areas.More than 500 companies have deals to use Watson, as a cloud service, to develop commercial products, apps and services. Turner Broadcasting on Feb. 29 signed a deal to use Watson in its ad sales efforts. The Time Warner (TWX), unit owns TBS, TNT and CNN. Using IBM Watson, Turner expects to parse through all manner of data to help draw in more advertisers and provide them with greater impact.Watson Health is a platform for physicians, researchers, insurers and other companies focused on health and wellness. Medtronic (MDT) is collaborating with IBM on personalized care for people with diabetes. By analyzing patient info and data from Medtronic devices, Watson can predict low blood sugar programs three hours in advance.Artificial intelligence is all about using advanced technologies to help develop brainy reasoning from disorganized information -- unstructured data -- to derive accurate decisions.“What we’ve done with all our research is to really understand how to add unstructured data to a decision,” said David Kenny, general manager of IBM Watson.Unstructured data comes from a multitude of sources that is not organized. It can be the data bits from photos, medical images or video and audio transmissions. It can be the tons of data that flows in from cameras or sensors in buildings or smartphones, from Web traffic, tweets, inside emails, government filings or business documents. The more information an artificially intelligent computer can digest the smarter it gets.Collecting data on a massive scale is among the reasons IBM acquired several Weather Co. properties, including Weather.com, Weather Underground and mobile and cloud-based assets, for a reported $2 billion in October.IBM will be able to analyze data from more than 2 billion weather reference points, over 40 million smartphones and 50,000 airplane flights per day, letting it offer a broad range of data-driven products and services to more than 5,000 clients in the media, aviation, energy, insurance and government industries. IBM said it can provide predictive weather analytics along with real-time analysis of social media chatter, detailed understanding of transportation flows and other data that will benefit retailers and distributors.The Weather Co. assets will serve as the foundation of a new Watson unit focused on the Internet of Things (IoT). Early this year, IBM announced that it would invest $3 billion to build out IoT products and services.

They’re making faster decisions and getting better outcomes.”An analysis of Facebook and Alphabet's Google by research firm Innography shows a surge in AI patent filings that began in 2010. Alphabet currently has more than 3,000 AI patents that are active or pending government approval. Facebook has about 870.Facebook last June opened an artificial intelligence lab in Paris with a goal of improving the way users interact on the world's largest social network.

141,INFO,"""It's our hope that this research will ultimately help us make services like News Feed, photos and search even better and enable an entirely new set of ways to connect and share,"" Facebook said at the time. It also has AI research teams at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in New York.Facebook in February revealed its Connectivity Lab project. It used AI to analyze 8.3 million square miles of land, using roads, schools and other structures to determine where and how many people live in a given area. That can tell Facebook's Aquila drones where to go to provide Internet access to less-developed areas, as part of the company's Internet.org initiative.“This data will give us a greater understanding of how populations are dispersed, so governments and others can prioritize investments in infrastructure, from transportation to healthcare and education,” Facebook said.

Expert advice helps bootstrappers become successful businesspeople, but many don’t know whom to ask or how to get acquainted.“I realized there wasn’t a good place -- if you had an idea -- to get help,” said Carter Wigell, founder and CEO of Ideator.com.The website provides a platform for entrepreneurs to connect with mentors and investors.Virtualize it. Wigell envisioned Ideator in 2008 as an alternative to incubators and accelerators that buy into outfits and mentor their growth.“I’m a huge fan of those programs,” Wigell told IBD.Ideator’s approach lets entrepreneurs and advisors meet virtually and consult online, rather than strictly in person or within a specific program.“I truly believe in the value of aligning yourself with the right advisor and mentors,” Wigell said.Tap talent. Advisors on the Ideator site include executives from Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), LinkedIn (LNKD), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Salesforce.com (CRM).Participants are not hindered by geography or status.“Democratizing the process -- that’s really my vision,” Wigell said.Click in. Would-be entrepreneurs create Ideator profiles describing their business concepts. The profiles can be private -- so only invited advisors have access -- or public.On the Ideator website, aspiring bootstrappers can reach out to advisors and investors to seek feedback and build teams. Conversely, participating investors and business pros can peruse public profiles for appealing ideas and newbies to help.“I wanted serial entrepreneurs to be able to collaborate on our platform,” Wigell said.Compete.

Judges from the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, Salesforce.com, Pepperdine University and startup database CrunchBase weighed more than 100 entries.First place went to TrustMesh, an app that lets companies update the status of their software’s programming instructions and standards -- called APIs.Reach out. The idea was boosted by TrustMesh co-founder Pankaj Arora’s background as a software developer. “We see this problem of mistrust between systems,” he said.Workers who depend on software APIs struggle to keep up with their status updates. TrustMesh centralizes this info.Arora looked to Ideator to turn the techy concept into a business.“It’s an ecosystem where we can get different kinds of resources,” Arora said. “Just because of Ideator, we have multiple advisors who have helped us.”What he gained was traction.“We believe ideas are easy to get. Execution is very tough,” Arora said.Test it. Preparing his pitch for Ideator’s December contest solidified TrustMesh’s business strategy.“That was a good experience. It gave us some confidence that we had a good go-to-market strategy,” Arora said.Expand reach. Wisher, a wishing and giving app where users post things and experiences they want -- reminiscent of a Christmas gift list -- was launched in the U.K. by South African entrepreneur Maz Cohen.On Ideator, she tapped expertise from business pros in the U.S.“All of a sudden, everyone was sharing their business plans with me,” she said. “They were willing to discuss things with me.

145,INFO,"Earnings from Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB,) Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) this week could move the needle for ETFs that track the technology sector. The largest of these exchange traded funds are Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Vanguard Information Technology (VGT).Each has roughly 28% of its portfolio assets tied to the iPhone maker, social networking giant and internet search leader, combined. These cap-weighted strategies give bigger companies a bigger stake in the portfolio, and will benefit most if large-cap tech earnings come in stronger than expected.Neither ETF holds the e-commerce leader that also makes tech devices such as Kindle e-readers, Echo voice-controlled speakers and Fire tablets. Within the S&P 500, Amazon is not considered a tech stock. It belongs to a different sector and is the top holding in Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY).Technology ETFs holding a diversified basket of stocks from various sub-industries have been average performers this year, merely keeping up with the broad stock market.XLK is up 8.1% since the start of 2016. That's roughly in line with a 7.7% gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) over the same period.However, for one diversified tech ETF, a dividend focus has proved a successful investing strategy. First Trust Nasdaq Technology Dividend (TDIV) has jumped 13.7% year to date.""Investors have been favoring dividend-paying stocks in 2016 in all sectors, given the low bond yields and the greater market volatility,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at S&P Global Market Intelligence. Dividend payers tend to make more sedate share price moves but offer attractive equity income.The tech sector is often associated with ""growthy"" names such as Facebook, but it has a wide array of dividend payers, Rosenbluth told Investor's Business Daily in an e-mail. According to S&P Global, roughly two-thirds of S&P 500 tech stocks offer a steady dividend stream with an average yield of 2.4%. Analysts at the firm also point out that the sector has growing hoards of cash that it has been increasingly committing to dividends. Hardware and semiconductor companies are leading the charge of dividend growth.TDIV holds close to 100 mostly large-cap tech and some telecom companies that have paid and not cut a dividend in the past year. Stocks in the portfolio must pass minimum size and liquidity screens, and are weighted by total dividends paid over the past 12 months. Dividend weighting has shown, in some cases, to produce consistently higher risk-adjusted returns over time vs. traditional cap-weighted strategies. The index rebalances quarterly to bring stock allocations back to the target.IBD'S TAKE: The Fed seems intent on keeping interest rates lower for longer, but a move in the other direction could impact dividend-focused funds. To learn more about the Fed's rate policy, check out this story by IBD's Terry Jones.That indexing and weighting method makes for a significantly different stock profile than the bellwether XLK.The top three stocks in TDIV are Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco (CSCO). Apple has a roughly 7% weighting in the portfolio vs. 12% in XLK. Facebook, the third-largest stock in XLK, is not to be found in TDIV.This First Trust technology dividend ETF yields 2.90% -- more than any other tech peer as well as SPY. Like most tech ETFs, it saw net outflow over the first half of 2016, to the tune of $27 million.TDIV has produced an 11.2% average annual gain over the past three years vs. 15.4% for XLK. It does not have a five-year history.

146,INFO,"Drugmakers on Tuesday continued to turn in solid Q2 earnings reports, with beats from Pfizer (PFE), Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) getting a mixed reaction from investors.Specialty-drug and hospital-products company Mallinckrodt made the biggest move, jumping more than 14% to 76.91 after it both beat analysts' second-quarter estimates and raised guidance. Earnings of $2.20 a share were more than 9% above a Thomson Reuters survey consensus, while revenue of $971 million was more than 5% over Wall Street's number.Growth did decelerate somewhat from the recent quarter, at 11% on the top line and 9% on the bottom line vs. the prior year. But Mallinckrodt also said it expects full-year EPS ""at the high end"" of its previously guided range of $8.15 to $8.50, which would put annual earnings growth at 15%.Acthar, the immunology drug that Mallinckrodt acquired when it bought Questcor a couple of years ago, shrugged off the critique that its business depends on sky-high pricing.""Acthar sales of $298.3 million beat consensus estimates of $282 million, and the brand grew 11% year over year (all attributed to volume, with some negative impact of price, which may hurt the bear thesis),"" wrote Mizuho Securities analyst Irina Koffler in a research note.British rare-disease company Shire climbed more than 4% to 202.24 on the stock market today after it also delivered a beat and raise. In contrast to Mallinckrodt, its growth has been accelerating, with a sales gain of 56% vs. just 4% a year ago. Much of that came from the recent acquisition of Baxalta, the hemophilia-focused company spun off of Baxter International (BAX), but Shire said its own legacy products grew 19%, while Baxalta's rose 12%.Profit jumped 29% to $3.38 a share. Both the top and bottom line beat consensus estimates.Shire's new full-year sales guidance was in line with consensus, but its EPS guide was on the upside. At the midpoint, it would represent 10% growth over last year.IBD'S TAKE: Shire and Pfizer both rank among the top 5 stocks in IBD's Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group. Shire's is No. 1 in EPS Rank, though its stock performance this year has been weaker than Pfizer's. For more info, see Shire's Stock Checkup.U.S. pharma giant Pfizer dropped 2.5% to 36.39 despite also notching a quarterly beat. The stock hit a 12-year high on Monday, suggesting that expectations were pretty bullish, and the company did not raise its guidance for the year.Investors have been waiting impatiently for Pfizer to decide whether it's going to split into two or three companies in the near future. Pfizer has promised that it will make an announcement before year-end, but that didn't happen Tuesday.New breast-cancer drug Ibrance showed its blockbuster potential by selling $514 million vs. $140 million a year earlier, beating analysts' expectations.""Prevnar vaccine, Pfizer's largest product, actually missed in this quarter due to the timing of ex-U.S. governmental purchases and the high initial capture rate of eligible patients in the U.S. after successful launch of Prevnar in elderly population in 2014,"" noted Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email. ""Recall that previously Pfizer communicated that they expect the total 2016 worldwide Prevnar revenues to be close to 2015 levels, but consensus still models some minimal year-on-year growth.""Overall sales rose 11%, while profit climbed 14%. Q2 and Q1 together were the first back-to-back quarters of both sales and profit growth Pfizer has reported since its former blockbuster Lipitor went off patent in 2011.

These potentialities construct seven circumstances, every single with a couple of measurements. In normal commerce, each of these 3 or more sizes are real along with total E-business, all proportions are computerized. All other conditions include a mix of online and specific sizing."" These are definitely real explanations on the range of computerized business as it is a rather broad topic also it can just be demystified by evaluating things separately. This essay intends to evaluate the progression and way forward for e-commerce. Amir Manzoor consistently break up E-trade by reviewing the reason for beginning. He says that, ""the period Electric powered business (E-trade) was initially produced during the early 1990's. Over the past 30 years, E-commerce has developed. E-trade programs happen to be first designed during the early 1970's e.g. Electronic Fund Move (EFT) whereby finances may just be directed electronically from one organization to the next.

The 2nd creation of E-business (From 2000 onwards) is foreign in the scope, with global enterprises operating in most international locations and lots of different languages."" Gary P. Schneider acknowledges that E-trade is very important as he declares that, ""One small business process that is very well-suited to electronic and digital business would be the selling of investment pieces. A investment solution is a service or product which is very hard to differentiate from your exact services or products available from other traders; its benefits have grown to be standard and famous.

Much of the care and questions with regards to electronic digital trade these days, yet, come in the fast developing stride of basic modern advances as well as reluctance of individuals to vary how they do stuff. These obstacles have faded for various kinds of online businesses and often will continue to go away for good as electric trade matures and becomes more generally recognized."" Amir Manzoor statements that, ""Despite numerous cons, E-trade is developing easily. Online economic climate is increasing noticeably and opening new opportunities for business and purchasers."" He proves his proclamation by expressing, ""Online businesses are persevering with to provide new website content and other capabilities to mitigate these troubles.

CNBC reports that:“China’s Economy Grew 6.9% in 2015, a 25 year LOW”  “The growth figures, still respectable by global standards, were in line with estimates for quarterly growth of 6.8 % on year, down from the 3rd qtrs. 6.9%, according to a Reuters poll, which also found economists expected full year growth at 6.9%, down from 2014’s 7.3%”So essentially — they nailed it — “This is a good number” — said Jahangir Aziz — Head of Emerging Mkt Economic Research at JPM, “We’ve known for the last 3 years that the Chinese authorities are slowing down the economy.  Notwithstanding the recent equity market turmoil, there are no signs of a more drastic slowdown.”OK — so we’ve known for the last 3 yrs that they had every intention of slowing down their economy — so what’s the issue?   The issue?  Does anyone really believe that stat?  I mean - it is China we are talking about.....and history suggests that the info is not always what it appears.......Dr. Doom & Gloom - otherwise known as Marc Faber - suggests that the latest read on China is make believe,  and that the real growth rate for China is nearer to 4%.  Now for those of you who are unaware of Marc Faber - he is a perma- bear and has been calling for the end of the world for 2 yrs now.....saying back in April 2015 - that ""for two years now, (since 2013),  I've been thinking that US stocks are due for a correction.......but I always say that a bubble is a bubble and if there's no correction, the market will go up and one day it will go down, big time""Don't you just love that.....essentially IF the mkt doesn't go down then it will go up until it doesn't and then it will go down!  Brilliant! (And people pay a lot of money to get that kind of analysis....)   So from when he told us of the imminent break - the S&P rallied 43%.... and has since given back 12% off the highs - leaving us still ahead by 31%.......!  I mean you can't make this up....who would believe it?  Now that doesn't mean that the mkt can't go lower - I just sayin.....Either way - Asian mkts surged on the news — the speculation is that the latest data will cause the gov’t to stimulate the economy to make sure that growth stays in this range….….Japan +0.55%, Hong Kong + 1.94%, China + 3.22% and ASX +0.91%. In Europe this morning — mkts are tracking the Asian action....all are in positive territory in early trading....Mining, energy - basic resources all surging.   Earnings season sending mixed messages there as well as daily reports create very stock specific action.  Thursday is the ECB governing council meeting and while no change is expected - the statement is expected to remain dovish suggesting more stimulus could be in the offing....FTSE + 2%, CAC 40 + 2.51%, DAX + 2.23% EUROSTOXX + 2.25%, SPAIN 1.96% and ITALY +1%. This morning US futures are skyrocketing higher...currently UP 31 pts at 1905...Oil is rallying and all is good in the world!   This is clearly a bit of a relief rally - and one that we should not get too excited about...... I would expect a move to 1925 before we hit any real resistance.  Today's earnings include some big names - Charles Schwab  (SCHW), Delta  (DAL),United Health  (UNH), (they beat), Comerica (CMA) (they beat), M&T Bank  (MTB) (they beat), BankAmerica  (BAC) (they beat) and Morgan Stanley  (MS)-  and as we see - we already have 4 of them 'beating the expectations' and this will surely add to the feel good mood.  ** I will be late tomorrow so next note is Thursday** Take good care.

161,INFO,"Legendary trader Jesse Livermore once said, “The only way you get a real education in the market is to invest cash, track your trade and study your mistakes.” There simply is no substitute for going back and reviewing your past trades to see what you did right — and wrong. But to do that, you need to have the game tape. You need to have good records that show what was going on — and what you were thinking — at the time you bought or sold a stock.So when you buy or sell any stock this year, first take these two simple steps. That will keep you from making impulsive decisions and create a record of your trades that you can then use to improve your stock-picking skills.Step 1: Print Charts For Each Buy & SellEvery time you buy or sell a stock, print out both the daily and weekly charts. That way you’ll have a permanent record of what the price and volume action looked like on that day.You can print the charts on paper and keep them in a binder, or create PDF files instead and store them on your computer. Either way, the key is to make sure you have the info.You can also print out or make a PDF of the IBD Stock Checkup for that company. It’s an easy way to get a quick, permanent snapshot of all the pass, neutral or fail ratings your stock had at the time. It also shows you the current industry group ranking, and lets you know what stage the overall market was in: confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure or market in correction.Step 2: Write Down Your Reasons For The TradeTake a minute to write down why you are buying or selling a stock. For example, if it’s a buy, draw the base pattern and note the ideal buy point (which may be different from your own actual purchase price).Jot down additional reasons why you decided to invest: accelerating earnings growth, heavy buying by institutional investors, a rising Relative Strength line, etc.For example, when Starbucks (SBUX) broke out of a flat base in January 2015, the pieces of stock-picking puzzle had fallen into place. The market was in an uptrend...the coffee giant had just posted  strong earnings report...and the stock cleared a flat base in heavy volume.From there, Starbucks rose over 50% in the next nine months.If you’re selling a stock, note the reasons for that trade. Maybe the stock reached the 20% - 25% profit-taking range. Maybe the overall market was weakening and you wanted to protect a smaller profit. Or perhaps you sold to cut your losses at no more than 8%.Even though your brokerage service has the basic info, also write down your buy or sell price, and the number of shares bought or sold. And if this trade is part of a larger position in the same stock, note how many shares you now own, in total, and your average purchase price.For any buy or sell, you can also write down any other thoughts you have about the company and the overall market. The more detail, the better. That way, when you do a post-analysis later, you’ll have a clear record of what you were thinking when you made the trade.Can You Justify This Trade? In addition to giving you the game tape to help you do a profitable post-analysis, here’s another reason to start keeping these kinds of records: It helps prevent you from making impulsive trades.Knowing that you have to literally write down why you bought or sold a stock will help make sure you think through the trade before you make it. That simple step can save you from making the wrong moves for the wrong reasons.Excerpt from the IBDextra Newsletter

166,INFO,"Corruption: Hillary Clinton signed an agreement under which she would suffer criminal penalties for allowing government secrets to become public. Shouldn't she be too busy staying out of prison to be running for president?Massive government is usually viewed as functioning top-down: The elected politician tries to guide the bureaucracies, directives routinely get distorted, and the end result includes horrors such as little old ladies being manhandled as potential terrorists at airports.In the case of Clinton becoming secretary of state in 2009, however, it worked bottom-up, and accomplished something quite sensible.Thanks to an open records request by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a key non-disclosure agreement the beleaguered front-runner for the Democrats' presidential nomination signed is now public. The Washington Free Beacon reports that ""a day after assuming office as secretary of state, Clinton signed a Sensitive Compartmented Information Nondisclosure Agreement that laid out criminal penalties for 'any unauthorized disclosure' of classified information.""Clinton agreed in writing that ""I have been advised that the unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized retention, or negligent handling of SCI by me could cause irreparable injury to the United States or be used to advantage by a foreign nation.""Simply receiving at least two emails containing top secret material on the nonsecure private server she set up for herself, as we know she did, and for which the Justice Department is investigating her, is an obvious violation of that contract she signed with the federal government (and, considering the national security implications, with the American people themselves).If it weren't for the steep slant of the dominant media, the revelation of Clinton's nondisclosure agreement would signal a perfect storm forming to doom her presidential candidacy.After all, it comes after the State Department in September disclosed that her private email system was not authorized for secret communications.It also crushes Hillary's excuse that the emails that we know are classified were marked as such only after she had sent or received them. You signed a contract, Madam Secretary, that it was your responsibility to make sure nothing classified was mishandled.The language she agreed to seems tailor-made to damn her subsequent actions:""I understand that it is my responsibility to consult with appropriate management authorities in the Department ... to ensure that I know whether information or material within my knowledge or control that I have reason to believe might be SCI.""What's more, in a separate contract Clinton signed regarding all other secrets, she agrees, ""I will never divulge classified information to anyone unless: (a) I have officially verified that the recipient has been properly authorized to receive it; or (b) I have been given prior written notice of authorization"" from the appropriate sources within the government.Her top two aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, also signed the nondisclosure contract, accepting the same responsibilities. Yet Mills sent secrets to the Clinton Foundation because she ""presumed"" them to be unclassified.And as the Daily Caller's Chuck Ross observed, Clinton's written agreement ""also calls into question her failure to turn over her work-related State Department emails to the agency in December, nearly two years after leaving office."" More than 600 of Clinton's emails released by the State Department contain info it says was classified.""I have been advised that any unauthorized disclosure of SCI by me may constitute violations of United State criminal laws,"" says the SCI agreement Clinton signed, and ""nothing in this agreement constitutes a waiver by the United States of the right to prosecute me for any statutory violation.""Shouldn't she be spending these days huddling with her legal defense team? Not her team of political consultants?

203,INFO,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, top-rated stocks such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are good prospects for a stock watch list.The Internet giants are among five key earnings reports slated for Thursday, along with McDonald's (MCD), Skechers (SKX) and Under Armour (UA).AmazonAmazon said on Tuesday that it will hire 100,000 for the critical holiday season. Many of those employees will ship packages to Amazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year for free shipping and video streaming. Amazon has around 47 million U.S. Prime users who spend about $1,200 a year each on its site, MarketWatch recently reported, citing Consumer Intelligence Research Partners data.Consensus is for e-commerce leader Amazon to report a 13-cent per share loss, improved from a 95 cent loss in Q3 2014. If Amazon tops estimates, it would be the third time in the last four quarters. Revenue is expected to jump 21% to $24.91 billion. That would be the best sales gain in five quarters.Under ArmourSome analysts project that athletic clothing, shoes and accessories maker Under Armour got a boost from back-to-school sales, continuing its four-year-plus streak of double-digit quarterly sales gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q3 EPS minus one-time items to rise 7% to 44 cents, reversing the prior quarter's 12% decline. Q3 sales are expected to rise 25.3% to $1.175 billion, a bit lower than the 29% pop it saw in Q2 but still a strong gain. Cowen & Co. analyst John Kernan is more bullish, forecasting 45 cents EPS on 26% sales growth, led by a 35% surge in footwear, ""in line with management's guidance,"" Kernan said in a report.AlphabetAs of early October, Google became a unit of Alphabet, an umbrella company that includes the company's future-looking projects such as research into how to improve human longevity and contact lenses that measure glucose levels to relieve diabetics from painful pinpricks.Analysts will look for info on how Google mobile search is faring. Mobile revenue is expected to top desktop search revenue next year, Evercore ISI said in a recent report. Under its new structure, the Google business — search, YouTube, Android and most of the previous company — have become the biggest segment within Alphabet.Consensus is for Alphabet to report $18.5 billion Q3 revenue, up 12% vs. the same quarter a year ago. EPS is expected to rise 13% to $7.20.Skechers USAIBD 50 stock Nike (NKE) has long dominated the athletic shoe market, but Skechers — although much smaller — is gaining acceptance as a top athletic brand, analysts say. BB&T launched coverage on Skechers last Thursday with a buy rating and a 150 price target, citing Skechers' ""appealing assortment of lower-price technical footwear.""Skechers has also become the category leader in walking shoes, with a 22% market share. Analysts expect a 67% surge in Q3 EPS to 55 cents, continuing a two-year streak of double-digit quarterly increases. Revenue is projected to climb 30% to $876.5 million.McDonald'sShares of the world's biggest restaurant chain hit an all-time intraday high at 105.20 on Thursday, Oct. 15, with shares pulling back modestly since then. McDonald's revamped its menu earlier this year, adding healthier fare catering to the consumer trend toward fresher, more natural foods. It also has started selling breakfast all day.McDonald's is reportedly near a decision on what to do with its extensive real estate holdings amid calls for a spinoff of those assets into a real estate investment trust. Wall Street is looking for a 17% hike in Q3 EPS to $1.27 but expects revenue to fall 8.3% to $6.41 billion amid contraction in China's economic growth, weakness in European markets and the impact of a strong dollar.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

235,INFO,"Corruption: State Department investigators were apparently pressured to cut parts of a report that would hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential hopes. ServerGate may be followed by InspectorGate.From 2009 to 2013, she traveled to more nations than any top U.S. diplomat in history. But U.S. foreign policy today is in a shambles, from a destabilized Middle East on the threshold of a nuclear arms race to a backfired Russian ""reset"" with ex-KGB officer Vladimir Putin becoming more aggressive to America than any time since the Cold War.Now that incompetence is compounded by more scandal. Richard Higbie, a senior criminal investigator at State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, gave the Washington Examiner early drafts of a 2013 investigation into the department's policies and effectiveness.Among the passages purged from the final version was one noting that ""Inspectors learned in conversations with Department employees . .. that in some cases superiors in (diplomatic security) and in senior levels of the State Department have prejudiced the commencement, course and outcome of (special investigations).""Another found that ""rising stars"" at State were protected ""from criminal charges or from embarrassing revelations that could harm a promising career,"" including ""allegations that a Regional Security Officer engaged in serious criminal conduct including sexual abuse of local embassy staff during a series of embassy postings.""Additionally, ""some agents on the Secretary's Detail"" were shielded ""from investigations into misbehavior while on official trips.""But that may not be the worst of it. The draft notes: ""Sources reported that a senior '7th Floor' Department official ordered (diplomatic security) to stop the investigation of an ambassador accused of pedophilia,"" the Examiner reported.Clinton, her deputy secretary and undersecretaries are all on Foggy Bottom's 7th floor.And in what may be its oddest passage, the draft reports that investigators ""pointedly carry their own firearms constantly"" within the State Department building, fearing ""a nasty elevator confrontation"" with those under investigation. The inspector general even recommended moving the special investigations division to avoid ""the threat of violent confrontations.""Calling such activities dysfunctional is an understatement. The IG slot was officially empty from January, 2008 to June, 2013, filled during Hillary's time by interim IG Higbie, whose integrity and independence are now in question.And these are not new charges. Former State IG investigator Aurelia Fedenisn in February 2013 told CBS the IG report had been heavily redacted. A few weeks later the Dallas law firm representing her was broken into and computers containing info on her case stolen.Also, not only did Clinton hide and destroy numerous work-related emails, but during her stint at State it ""lost"" $6 billion, posing a ""significant financial risk"" and demonstrating ""a lack of internal control,"" the IG said.If corruption, intimidation and financial mismanagement — or worse — characterized Hillary's years as secretary of state, what would a Hillary presidency be like?

236,INFO,"IBM introduced Watson to the world on the game show ""Jeopardy"" in 2011, when the highly intelligent computer outsmarted two of the best contestants that game show had ever seen.
"
237,INFO,"Watson was just a toddler then, but oh how it's grown.
"
238,INFO,"Rather than compete in trivia games, IBM (IBM) Watson is helping solve complex issues in the field of health care, sifting through complex data to help doctors and institutions find answers to tough questions.
"
239,INFO,"And that's just a start.
"
240,INFO,"Watson is engaged with more than 100 universities and 20 industries to advance and develop its humanlike capabilities.
"
241,INFO,"Watson is helping the oil and gas industry boost production. It's helping create better building materials. It's helping chefs create new recipes. And it's a health coach for consumers and a travel agent.
"
242,INFO,"If you have a question, Watson has an answer. It might not always be the best answer, but it's surely a step in the right direction. One thing's for sure, says IBM: Watson represents a new era of computing.
"
243,INFO,"""We are just on the initial cusp of this new era,"" said John Gordon, vice president of the IBM Watson Group. He says the cognitive computing that Watson represents will be bigger than the Internet in terms of how we communicate and process data.
"
244,INFO,"""Fundamentally, the Internet connected us to information faster than ever before and opened up new opportunities,"" Gordon said. ""Watson is taking on a new challenge, not about how to connect but how to process information in new ways. It will allow for a new era of human innovation.""
"
245,INFO,"Cognitive computing also goes by names such as artificial intelligence, augmented intelligence and machine learning. Decades of research and development have gone into a technology that's drawn the interest of the tech elite.
"
246,INFO,"Companies is this field include Google (GOOGL). Last year it paid $400 million to acquire DeepMind, which specializes in machine learning and advanced algorithms. Google has used deep learning to enhance its search results, improve Android's voice recognition and derive more data from images and video.

"
261,INFO,"By feeding Pathway's enormous collection of health and medical data into Watson, it will help users with answers to health-related questions. The Pathway app is also expected to connect with wearable health-tracking devices such as Fitbit, pulling in a person's vitals, such as blood pressure, weight and pulse. Users can log in on their smartphone and ask a health question such as ""How much exercise should I do today?"" Or ""What food should I stop eating?"" Nova expects the app to be available in the fourth quarter.

It's a huge advantage for us to be linked up with them.""Among its other investments, IBM was part of a $5 million funding round in WayBlazer, a travel search and discovery company with a goal to redefine how consumers plan, personalize and purchase travel.Health care was the first market for Watson, and it's where IBM has spent the most time and money.""We started on health intentionally, figuring if there are going to be problems to solve that would be meaningful, it was the right place to start,"" Gordon said. ""The amount of information produced in that field is exploding.""In April, IBM unveiled its Watson Health Cloud unit, which it says provides a secure and open platform for physicians, researchers, insurers and other companies focused on health and wellness.Its partners include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which will work with IBM to develop ""intelligent virtual coaching solutions"" to help prepare patients for surgery, then deal with its after effects.Johnson & Johnson will also leverage IBM's relationship with Apple (AAPL) to deliver new iPhone and iPad applications. Apple is working with IBM to integrate Watson-based apps into its HealthKit and ResearchKit tool systems for developers.Another partner is medical device giant Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with IBM around delivery of personalized care for people with diabetes, analyzing patient info and data from Medtronic devices.IBM also has Watson partnerships with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, the Mayo Clinic and the New York Genome Center.""We're bullish on what we've seen,"" said Gordon. ""Innovators are building new companies around Watson. It's a new era of computing.""

272,INFO,"It's a give-get world. How incentives earn customer attention: Offer a taste. ""Don't make someone work too hard to get their first bite of the apple.""So advises Greg Consiglio, president of Viggle. The app rewards its members for watching TV and listening to music. Users who log in to the app while consuming entertainment earn Viggle points.""You can use these points for movies, books, music,"" he told IBD. ""You are getting entertainment for consuming entertainment."" Build it. Rewards programs are common in retailing, but the model had not been applied to entertainment until Viggle founder Robert Sillerman — a longtime media entrepreneur — shared the idea with Consiglio, who says, ""I was intrigued. I thought: How come no one else has ever done that?"" Gather vital info.  Members who use the Viggle app share the kind of information that creators and advertisers crave: ZIP code, age, gender, satellite provider. ""We have data that's pretty amazing,"" Consiglio said. ""I can tell (a network executive): These people go on to watch these shows on other networks."" Make a wager. Would a friendly bet help you lose weight?The answer is yes for WayBetter, which has paid out $11 million to participants who lost a total of 3 million pounds while taking part in its weight-loss competition, dubbed DietBet.For a small fee — usually $30 — people sign up to lose a predetermined percentage of their body weight in a set amount of time. Those who succeed split the pot.""I liked the idea that if you could make something fun, people would gravitate toward it,"" said WayBetter CEO Jamie Rosen. Create safe distance. After launching the WayBetter website, Rosen asked visitors if they'd rather lose weight with friends or strangers.The response surprised him. ""Seventy percent would rather do it with a stranger,"" he said. Attract attention. Rosen tapped notable strangers — including exercise guru Jillian Michaels and Tony Horton, creator of workout regimen P90X — to host weight-loss contests.""They see it as just another channel for (fan) engagement,"" Rosen said. ""We work with social media influencers because they get that these new mediums are the best way to reach their fan base."" Expand on it. Rosen thinks smokers could similarly benefit from a quit-smoking contest. ""We think it should work with other lifestyle interventions,"" he said. Draw them in. ""Sometimes a whisper is louder than a scream,"" said Steve Berman, chief operating officer of VIPwink.His app, currently in beta, gives fans a closer tie to the celebrities they follow on Twitter (TWTR).Fans who sign up for the service might get an early listen to a new song or a private message from the luminary they follow. ""This is meant to be a little plug-in to enhance the experience,"" he said.

314,INFO,"Regulation: A public Consumer Complaint Database solicits anonymous, unverified gripes against banks from consumers at the behest of Acorn front groups — despite studies showing such complaints are mostly baseless.The administration says the government-sponsored rumor mill is designed to protect consumers. But it's really part of an ongoing campaign to demonize banks as predatory, abusive and racist.By all signs, it will be used to further shake down lenders on behalf of Democrat constituency groups.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to post full consumer complaint ""narratives"" on a government website by this fall.The first-of-its-kind public database will include one-sided, unsubstantiated versions of disputes between debtors and creditors involving mortgages, credit cards, car loans, student loans, payday loans, money transfers or remittances, and debt collections — even though the agency admits it won't verify grievances.""The complaint process does not provide for across the board verification of claims made in complaints,"" CFPB says on page 12 of its final rule issued this month.CFPB says it launched the public database at the urging of 49 consumer advocacy and civil-rights groups — including some with whom President Obama used to work as an organizer in South Side Chicago, such as the militant National People's Action — and over the strenuous objections of the banking industry, which has some legitimate beefs, including: It is impossible to tell if complaints are true or accurate because they will be stripped of personal info like account numbers and last names. But they will ID financial institutions by name, exposing their brands to untold damage while denying them due process. Lenders are powerless to respond to complaints since they are loath to reveal information to embarrass their customers, who might be re-identified in the process (complainants' ZIP codes will be published). And even if they choose to respond publicly and correct the record, the process would involve significant new costs, making the new rule yet another expensive regulation foisted on the financial sector by this regime. The vast majority of past CFPB complaints have proved unsubstantiated or have been resolved with a simple explanation; of the 163,700 consumer complaints CFPB received internally in 2013, only 7% closed with monetary relief (most complaints were leveled against Wall Street giants JPMorgan and Citibank, as well as Bank of America and Wells Fargo). The American public will view the stories as credible, however, because they will be posted on a government website and will seem to be endorsed by the federal government. Consumers risk being misinformed by the personal anecdotes, which the liberal media no doubt will showcase as evidence of Wall Street graft; and they will be misled into believing the worst about the financial industry, which could lead to even greater government regulation and control over private capital and credit. The Dodd-Frank Act, which gave CFPB its charter, does not authorize it to publish consumer complaint narratives. The powerful CFPB says it will work with consumer grievance groups to detect from the database ""destructive patterns"" in lending and financing, while assigning its ""Consumer Response investigations staff"" to review complaints for ""further investigation"" and possible prosecution.In other words, the database will help facilitate a massive fishing expedition.""We intend to make this data widely available to consumers, advocacy groups, businesses, policy makers, and journalists,"" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said.

Workers worldwide are ready to embrace wearable devices, according to a Harris Poll survey, which found that 73% of respondents see at least one workplace benefit.""I think safety and wellness are applications that you're probably going to see first,"" said Joyce Maroney, director of the Workforce Institute at workforce management firm Kronos, which commissioned the survey. Catch up. Half of U.S. adults, compared with 94% in China and 91% in India, say that such devices could benefit the workplace.The survey reported that 82% of Indian workers and 81% in China had used smart headsets, badges or bar-code scanners, compared with 20% in the U.S., 38% in Britain and 56% in Germany. Find purpose.  Fitness is a leading application for wearable tech. ""People are already using wearable tech to detect heart rate and blood pressure,"" Maroney told IBD.Such gear has found a role at Kronos, where workers can sync Fitbits with the firm's wellness portal to earn points toward health insurance premium deductions. Step lightly. Giving an employer personal health data ""requires a high level of trust between the employee and the employer,"" Maroney said. When does info collected by a wearable intrude on a worker's privacy? ""I think that's going to be a tricky path for human resources and employees to navigate."" Manage it. Solid leadership practices can smooth the process of tapping new technology. Include all stakeholders in discussions and say exactly how the employer is going to use the data. ""Be clear in the outcomes you're trying to drive,"" Maroney said. Look forward. Some potential workplace benefits include increased efficiency, safety, collaboration, customer satisfaction and training. ""I think wearable technology is definitely here to stay,"" Maroney said. ""It's becoming smaller and smarter, and it's also becoming more fashionable."" Watch the horizon.  Wearable devices dominated January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Among the highlights:A headband called Muse that detects when your mind wanders;Sensoria's socks that track speed, cadence and stride for runners;A wireless tracker from FitBark that monitors a dog. Make the leap. ""It's great to collect data, but ultimately you have to deliver outcomes,"" said Shai Gozani, CEO of NeuroMetrix (NURO) .His firm demonstrated Quell, a wearable pain relief device, at the Vegas show.The company draws on 18 years of nerve stimulation expertise to tackle peripheral neuropathy, a common and painful complication of diabetes.""We think it's time to move into the therapeutic areas and put nerve stimulation into a wearable format,"" Gozani said. ""The acid test here is: Do I have less pain?"" Bring relief. The Quell device, which straps to the user's calf, delivers electric stimulation to peripheral nerves.That stimulation causes a response in the brain, helping increase naturally occurring chemicals that reduce pain.The general approach isn't new. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) devices have been used for decades. The precise dose — or amount of electrostimulation — is the advance.NeuroMetrix's goal is to reduce patients' use of pain medications and ""get to the point where patients can manage their lives,"" Gozani said.

316,INFO,"Apple rocked the investment world with a blowout quarter, announcing on January 27 record profits of $18 billion for its latest quarterly report.1 These strong results were not just a record for Apple; it was the greatest single quarter ever reported for any public company.2 IPhone sales were very strong, including explosive growth in sales from China, up 70% over the year.3 
"
317,INFO,"Apple's strong results mean it now has $178 billion in cash and marketable securities.4 Apple has been using its cash to increase its capital return to shareholders in the form of both dividend and buybacks. Apple's dividend payment is a relatively new phenomenon—it paid its first quarterly dividend since the mid 1990s in August 2012.5 On a split-adjusted basis, Apple was paying $1.51 annualized per share in that first payment.6 
"
318,INFO,"Two and a half years later, Apple has raised its annual dividend a cumulative 25% to $1.88, paying 47 cents per quarter for each of the last four quarters. 7 With these very strong results in the latest quarter, it's reasonable to expect good news in Apple's next dividend announcement. For context, Apple raised its quarterly dividend 7.9% in the second quarter of 2014.8 And while the past never guarantees the future, I would be looking for a further acceleration in the dividend hike. The question for investors: Is your dividend exchange-traded fund (ETF) capturing Apple's strong growth? 
"
319,INFO,"It depends if your dividend ETF tracks an index that weights BY dividends or one that weights FOR dividends. For example, the NASDAQ U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index is a popular dividend growth index that requires 10 consecutive years of continual dividend growth to qualify for inclusion. However, the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth Index (WTDGI) does not have such a requirement. Why does this matter? Because we believe that dividend indexes with backward-looking growth screens may end up excluding some of the faster growing new dividend payers that may not have 10-year histories of dividend payments, much less dividend growth. 
"
320,INFO,"The first time Apple could qualify for inclusion in the NASDAQ index is in 2023—and that's if (and only if) it continues to raise its dividend every year between now and then. Apple today is the second largest dividend payer in America behind Exxon Mobile.9 And in my opinion, it's likely that Apple will be the largest dividend payer in the world by the end of the year, given the oil price headwinds Exxon is facing and the blowout numbers we just saw from Apple. A Focus on Quality, Return on Equity (ROE) Lead to Higher Dividend Growth 
"
321,INFO,"Key drivers of the stock selection in the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth Index are return on equity, return on assests and earnings growth. Return on equity, according to finance theory and the dividend discount model, is intimately related to dividend growth. The higher the return on equity, the theory goes, the higher the sustainable dividend growth of that company. Theory Meets Reality: When we look at the constituents of the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth ETF (DGRW), which tracks the performance of WTDGI—and, by design, has a stock-selection model driven by ROE—and compare it to a universe of investable dividend-paying stocks represented by the broad market WisdomTree Dividend Index, which contained more than 1,450 companies as of December 31, 2014, we see that the stocks within DGRW historically have been growing dividends faster over the last one, three and five years.

326,INFO,"Apple rocked the investment world with a blowout quarter, announcing on January 27 record profits of $18 billion for its latest quarterly report.1 These strong results were not just a record for Apple; it was the greatest single quarter ever reported for any public company.2 IPhone sales were very strong, including explosive growth in sales from China, up 70% over the year.3 Apple's strong results mean it now has $178 billion in cash and marketable securities.4 Apple has been using its cash to increase its capital return to shareholders in the form of both dividend and buybacks. Apple's dividend payment is a relatively new phenomenon—it paid its first quarterly dividend since the mid 1990s in August 2012.5 On a split-adjusted basis, Apple was paying $1.51 annualized per share in that first payment.6 Two and a half years later, Apple has raised its annual dividend a cumulative 25% to $1.88, paying 47 cents per quarter for each of the last four quarters. 7 With these very strong results in the latest quarter, it's reasonable to expect good news in Apple's next dividend announcement. For context, Apple raised its quarterly dividend 7.9% in the second quarter of 2014.8 And while the past never guarantees the future, I would be looking for a further acceleration in the dividend hike. The question for investors: Is your dividend exchange-traded fund (ETF) capturing Apple's strong growth? It depends if your dividend ETF tracks an index that weights BY dividends or one that weights FOR dividends. For example, the NASDAQ U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index is a popular dividend growth index that requires 10 consecutive years of continual dividend growth to qualify for inclusion. However, the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth Index (WTDGI) does not have such a requirement. Why does this matter? Because we believe that dividend indexes with backward-looking growth screens may end up excluding some of the faster growing new dividend payers that may not have 10-year histories of dividend payments, much less dividend growth. The first time Apple could qualify for inclusion in the NASDAQ index is in 2023—and that's if (and only if) it continues to raise its dividend every year between now and then. Apple today is the second largest dividend payer in America behind Exxon Mobile.9 And in my opinion, it's likely that Apple will be the largest dividend payer in the world by the end of the year, given the oil price headwinds Exxon is facing and the blowout numbers we just saw from Apple. A Focus on Quality, Return on Equity (ROE) Lead to Higher Dividend Growth Key drivers of the stock selection in the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth Index are return on equity, return on assests and earnings growth. Return on equity, according to finance theory and the dividend discount model, is intimately related to dividend growth. The higher the return on equity, the theory goes, the higher the sustainable dividend growth of that company. Theory Meets Reality: When we look at the constituents of the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth ETF (DGRW), which tracks the performance of WTDGI—and, by design, has a stock-selection model driven by ROE—and compare it to a universe of investable dividend-paying stocks represented by the broad market WisdomTree Dividend Index, which contained more than 1,450 companies as of December 31, 2014, we see that the stocks within DGRW historically have been growing dividends faster over the last one, three and five years. For current holdings of the WisdomTree Dividend Index, click here. Apple's strong gains and future dividend growth potential raise the question, ""Is my dividend ETF designed to capture today's (and tomorrow's) dividend payers, or are these new technology companies going to be missing for a very long time?"" We see below that Apple was the second largest exposure in DGRW as of December 31, 2014. Do you really want to wait until 2023 to hold Apple in your dividend ETF?

330,INFO,"Dish Network was among the big winners at last week's International CES. The satellite broadcaster introduced what could be the first real over-the-top Internet video competition for traditional pay-TV services.Dish Network (DISH) said it will launch Sling TV nationwide in the first quarter. For $20 a month, Sling TV will deliver live sports, lifestyle, family, news and information channels, video-on-demand entertainment and the best of online video to broadband-connected devices at home and on the go, the company said Jan. 5 at CES.At a press event, Dish CEO Joseph Clayton said Sling TV is targeted at millennials who balk at paying for higher-priced cable, telco and satellite TV packages.Sling TV will be supported by a host of Internet-connected devices, such as Amazon's (AMZN)  Google's (GOOGL) Nexus Player, as well as game consoles, smart TVs, PCs, tablets and smartphones.For $20 a month, Sling TV will offer a ""Best of Live TV"" package that includes 12 channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN.Consumers will be able to add extra channels with add-on packs costing $5 a month. A ""Kids Extra"" add-on includes Disney Junior, Disney XD, Boomerang, Baby TV and Duck TV. A ""News & Info Extra"" add-on includes HLN, Cooking Channel, DIY and Bloomberg TV. A ""Sports Extra"" package is coming soon, Dish said.Engadget awarded Sling TV its ""Best in Show"" CES award, after giving it earlier awards for best home theater product and best software app.""Many of us have been waiting, hoping and even lusting after Sling TV before we'd ever heard of it: an Internet TV service that gives you the channels you love, on any screen, anywhere, without a subscription to traditional cable or satellite TV service,"" Engadget Editor-in-Chief Michael Gorman wrote . ""Sling TV is a big deal, folks. It could very well be the beginning of the end for traditional pay TV here in the U.S.""CNet declared that Sling TV ""stole the show"" at CES.""None of the major TV networks (CBS, ABC, Fox, etc.) (is) included, but if you add Sling TV to an over-the-air antenna and/or subscriptions to Hulu Plus or CBS All Access, you're pretty close to a basic cable package for far less money,"" CNet section editor David Katzmaier wrote.GoPro, Facebook, other CES winnersA lot of consumer electronics companies came out with action cameras at CES to compete with GoPro (GPRO) . But GoPro emerged with its mindshare lead intact, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Brian Blair said in a note Monday.""While CES showcased a number of would-be GoPro competition from companies like Sony (SNE), Panasonic and Polaroid, none of them garnered much attention in our view,"" Blair said. ""A number of Chinese manufacturers were additionally showing low end knock-offs of the camera in a variety of colors. If CES is reflective of the current consumer view, there is one player that holds the mindshare in the action-camera genre and it remains unchallenged.""Third-party accessories for GoPro cameras were plentiful at the show in another indicator of GoPro's success, Blair said.Another big winner at the show was Oculus VR, owned by Facebook (FB). Several pundits noted the long lines at the Oculus booth for people wanting demonstrations of the virtual reality headsets.Digital ad company Amobee Intelligence put together a list of the most talked about products and companies at CES 2015, based on social network chatter.Samsung was the most talked-about company on social media at CES with its 4K televisions, advanced washing machines and Internet of Things initiatives, Amobee reported Sunday. Sony came in second for online chatter about CES news, followed by LG and Intel (INTC).The most buzzed-about car company at the show was Mercedes-Benz, which showed off its concept of a self-driving car. Audi came in second, followed by BMW, Amobee said.The four-day International CES in Las Vegas ended Friday. It was the largest show to date, drawing more than 170,000 industry professionals. Over 3,600 exhibitors took up more than 2.2 million square feet of exhibit space, show organizer Consumer Electronics Association said Friday.

331,INFO,"The sell-off dominated stock market news early this week. Yet China stocks — on the New York Stock Exchange, at least — posted big gains.Cheetah Mobile (CMCM) rose 10% Monday and 6% Wednesday in the U.S. stock market. Aluminum Corporation of China (ACH), IPO eHi Car Services (EHIC) and China Southern Airlines (ZNH) also scored gains.Why? Isn't China's GDP slowdown the reason why many investors looked for stock investment ideas in U.S. stocks during 2014?So to what extent, if any, should you bet on Middle Kingdom equities going forward?U.S. stocks' brief but sharp downturn ceded center stage to a segment of China stocks that has been rallying since late October. That rally involved stocks listed on Chinese stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.""Government reforms have fueled their rally,"" said Edmund Harriss, who runs four Guinness Atkinson mutual funds with total assets of $209.4 million, including the China & Hong Kong Fund .Market Vectors ChinaAMC A-Share ETF (PEK) tracks China-listed stocks known as A-class shares. It's up 6% since Dec. 30, when the S&P; 500 began its recent pullback. IShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI), which tracks only Hong Kong-traded shares, is also up, but just 1%.Location, Location, LocationWhy does the listing location matter? China's government reforms apply mainly to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which trade on domestic exchanges. Foreigners have had limited access to China-listed stocks. But the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program is loosening restrictions.Investors see the reforms as boosting efficiency and profitability, says Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of ETF operator KraneShares.One reform forces diversified energy firm China Petroleum & Chemical (SNP), known as Sinopec, to sell a 30% stake in its gas stations. In another reform, China's central bank cut interest rates and reserve cash requirements for banks.""The question is whether the reforms will give more of a boost to offshore(-listed) stocks,"" Harriss said. They include Alibaba (BABA), now 12% off its high following a successful IPO; Baidu (BIDU), 8% off its high; and BitAuto (BITA), 14% off its high.Also, some drivers for onshore-listed stocks don't help offshore-listed stocks. For example, onshore-listed stocks may have gotten a lift from retail investors who rotated out of investments in domestic property and who felt that domestic stocks are more attractive than bank accounts, Harriss says.What if the reforms don't work? ""The problem with the SOEs is that they are not efficient, not globally competitive,"" said Di Zhou, associate manager of $12.4 billion Thornburg International Value Fund .Many China tech stocks are listed offshore. Alibaba, Qihoo (QIHU) and online discount retailer Vipshop's (VIPS) American depositary receipts (ADRs) trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ADRs of telecoms like China Mobile (CHL) and China Unicom (CHU) trade on the Big Board.Online travel info aggregator Ctrip.com (CTRP) is a Nasdaq name. Mobile giant Tencent 's (TCEHY) ADRs trade over the counter.""Names affected by SOE reform are mainly financial and energy,"" Ahern said. ""China tech names are more entrepreneurial.""

440,INFO,"For Expedia, the big change came when it began to listen to what its customers wanted instead of treating them as just another sale.""Years back, we treated customers as though they were transactions, with little care of who they were or what they wanted to buy,"" David Doctorow, Expedia's (EXPE) chief marketing and strategy officer, told IBD. ""We've made the move from treating them as transactions to treating them as people. It sounds simple, but there's a combination of science and art to get that correct.""The Bellevue, Wash., company is one of the largest full-service travel sites. This one-stop shop offers customers everything in travel: hotels, airfare and rental cars. Including its namesake site, the company's portfolio contains 12 brands such as Hotels.com, Hotwire, Trivago, CarRentals.com and Expedia Cruise Ship Centers. It also runs international travel sites such as Egencia, a global full-service travel company; Venere.com, a hotel specialist in Europe; and eLong, which sells hotel rooms in China.Ryan Jacob, portfolio manager of the Jacob Internet Fund , says that a lot of the company's growth has come from its international business.""The vast majority of the profits come from hotels, which is a fragmented market that will always be fragmented, and Expedia has scale in a market that needs a middleman,"" Jacob told IBD. ""And the hotel market outside the U.S. is even more fragmented.""Smarter Is BetterWith more than 5 billion flight searches per year, Expedia has always been a Big Data company. However, to understand its customers better, Expedia became a ""smart data"" company. This means recognizing customers whether they use a personal computer, tablet or mobile phone. It also means remembering what the customer searched for previously, even on a different device.This part of the strategy is called ""test and learn."" Doctorow says that the company does thousands of tests to find out what does, and doesn't, work with customers, who let them know what they like through their behavior and feedback. The company quickly and seriously follows up on customer complaints, using technology to analyze and fix issues as they arise.Expedia's Scratchpad app came from such testing. The company said that over the past four years, the average number of flight searches a customer makes per booking has jumped from 15 to 48. Realizing that most consumers jot down handwritten notes to keep track of the info, Expedia created Scratchpad as a place to record all a person's searches instantly while simultaneously updating the pricing. To maximize efficiency, the app keeps the information even if the consumer switches devices in between searches.""Customers tend to shop in patterns, and this gives insight to help serve them better in the future,"" said Doctorow. ""We use the data to shop 24/7 in order to make offers that are relevant to them and lower in price. The customers appreciate that we recognize what they are shopping for and care about.""Actions that provide value and savings to the customer show Expedia's loyalty to the consumer, who then begins to trust the company and return its loyalty, says Doctorow. This strategy includes the Expedia Plus program, which lets customers earn points that they can trade in for automatic upgrades at 1,400 hotels around the world.Bookings Are Bookin'Expedia's way seems to work. In the third quarter, domestic bookings of hotel rooms grew 24% over the year-earlier quarter, while international hotel room bookings jumped 31%.Helping the results are two big moves that Expedia made last year. In March 2013, Expedia bought a majority stake in Trivago, one of Europe's largest and fastest-growing travel sites. Then in August 2013, Expedia agreed to run the technology platform for one of its chief competitors, Travelocity. Basically, all of Travelocity's content, inventory, customer service and technology come from Expedia, which then receives most of the revenues.A Rising Tide In 2014Travelocity accounted for 400 basis points of the growth in domestic hotel rooms, plus a large part of the 30% year-over-year increase in air tickets sold, according to financial services company Raymond James. Meanwhile, Trivago grew 50% in the third quarter.""Overall travel was healthy in 2014, a lot of companies did well, not just Expedia,"" Aaron Kessler, a senior research analyst at Raymond James, told IBD. ""Still, they are executing much better today than a few years ago.""Kessler says that Expedia has added more hotel rooms because it's allowing consumers to pay the hotels directly instead of collecting the fees and paying hotels later. By letting smaller hotels control the cash flow, it has expanded the amount of inventory that a hotel is willing to give Expedia.Still, not everyone is gung ho. Google (GOOGL) is one concern.""They have done things to improve the consumer experience,"" said Ken Sena, a research analyst at investment banking advisory firm Evercore ISI, told IBD. ""But long term, we see their position as tenuous. We see Google moving further into Expedia's line of business.""

444,INFO,"When firms merge, they pay attention to the financial benefits. Also crucial is looking at whether the companies' cultures fit.A study by the Ethics Resource Center, an Alexandria, Va.-based research group, shows that when companies go through major changes such as mergers and acquisitions, fully 60% of employees see co-workers make ethical missteps.Here's how to avoid that:• Get to the root. Times of transition cause uncertainty, which can lead people to swerve, says Patricia Harned, the Ethics Resource Center's president. They might take home confidential info that could help them get another job.""Employees are less inhibited and might take steps they wouldn't otherwise,"" Harned told IBD.Aim to remove as much uncertainty as possible by communicating with the group.• Win faith. Gain trust among your people and among those who are joining you in the deal, says Bette Price, CEO of management consultant Price Group of Dallas.Set clear expectations, be accessible and do what you say you'll do. Others will buy into your way of doing things. ""You have to establish trust throughout the organization,"" she said.• Spread the word.  There's a lot of communication among top executives. But those below them are often left in the dark. Start early and talk to people throughout the process so they know what to expect, advises Price.• Open up. Share as much information with employees as you can. Err on the side of giving too much detail. The risk is worth the reward of easing workers' concerns, and you can make it clear that your culture prizes ethical conduct, Harned said: ""Transparency is the number one rule.""• Build a base. Create a strong sense of how crucial it is for your people to do the right thing.When major upheaval comes, they'll know to lean on those principles. They'll trust your moves and what you tell them during times of change, too. ""The strength of a company's ethical culture is like money in the bank,"" Harned said.• Watch local customs. As companies expand overseas, they run into different cultures and different ethics. Bribery, for instance, might be common in another nation, but that doesn't mean you have to cave on moral standards. Get on the same page.""What we in the U.S. think is acceptable might be different in another country,"" Price said.• Be prepared. Create a solid culture based on principles and get others to buy in well before you make an acquisition. When you make a deal, you'll have a solid base of values to pass along, Price says.• Study it. When gathering facts about the company you're looking to acquire, check out the culture.Look at management's expectations and the type of people on board, Price said: ""Often tactical issues are resolved, but nobody looks at whether the cultures are aligned. It does have a financial impact, so it makes sense to take a close look.""• Share the wealth. If your firm has a stronger ethical culture than the one you're buying, don't just foist those values on the new employees, Harned says. Explain the culture, why it's in place and how important it is. ""Make it clear: 'Here are the values and we hope you share these,'"" she said.• Step away. Firms' cultures can make or break the deal's success. Call it off if you can't reach common ground.""Mergers and acquisitions are very risky,"" Harned said. ""They fail as often as they succeed, and they often fail because of culture. If they're too different, don't integrate.""

463,INFO,"At the company's annual meeting on May 22, Facebook (FB) shareholders will vote on five shareholder-submitted proposals, including one that asks the company to study young users' exposure to marketing from makers of unhealthy food.Facebook's board opposes the proposal, called ""Financial Risks of Childhood Obesity,"" which calls for Facebook to create a report about such advertising, including whether Facebook advertising dollars are at risk because of efforts to stop food marketing to younger consumers.That measure, proposal No. 6, has been brought by The Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary.Facebook's board opposes each of the shareholder proposals detailed on Monday in the company's proxy statement for its 2014 annual meeting, to be held at the Sofitel San Francisco Bay hotel in Redwood City, Calif.Proposal No. 3 calls for each Facebook share to be given equal voting power, which would affect the voting rights of CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other early shareholders. About 100 investors, including Zuckerberg, hold Class B stock that has 10 votes instead of the single vote for Class A shares. Google (GOOG) is among companies with a similar structure, designed to give founders and top executives effective voting control.""By allowing certain stock to have more voting power than other stock, our company takes our public shareholder money but does not let us have an equal voice in our company's management,"" says that proposal, which has been brought by James McRitchie and Myra K. Young, of Elk Grove, Calif.A similar shareholder proposal on voting power has been an annual refrain at Google's annual meetings. Google (GOOG) announced on Friday that it will hold its annual meeting May 14 at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Here's the proxy for that meeting, which includes a similar proposal.Facebook shareholder proposal No. 4, brought by The Benedictine Sisters of Mount S. Scholastica, of Atchison, Kan., calls for a public report on how Facebook pays lobbyists.Facebook says such a move would be cumbersome and would put the company at a competitive disadvantage.""As one of the world's largest technology companies, our continued success and long-term profitability is dependent on the legal, regulatory, and public policy decisions that affect our business,"" Facebook wrote in its statement opposing the proposal.Proposal No. 5, brought by NorthStar Asset Management, of Boston, calls for Facebook to justify in writing its reasons for donating to certain politicians who seem to have values different than Facebook's corporate culture.Facebook's political action committee has ""contributed over 41% of its contributions since its inception to politicians voting against hate crime legislation and the repeal of Don't Ask/Don't Tell, as well as for the Marriage Protection Amendment, which sought to prohibit rights across the nation,"" says the sharholder proposal.Facebook replies that its current lobbying is ""necessary and important"" for Facebook's long-term success.Proposal No. 7 calls for for Facebook to produce an annual ""sustainability report.""""Although Facebook provides some information related to (environmental, social and governance practices) on its website, its current reporting falls short of a comprehensive sustainability report that is useful to investors,"" wrote the shareholder who brought the suit, Thomas DiNapoli, New York state's comptroller.Facebook says such a report is ""unnecessary"" because it already tells shareholders about its sustainability efforts.Facebook stock rose a fraction, to 60.24, in the stock market today.Follow Kevin Shalvey on Twitter at @IBD_KShalveyRELATED: Facebook Dominates Social E-Commerce, Says StudyFacebook Enters Virtual Reality With Acquisition Of Oculus VRFacebook Drones Fly In Dogfight Vs.

475,INFO,"Extortion (Cont'd): The reported deal that the regime has inked with Bank of America to shell out a record $16 billion in subprime mortgage relief is being touted as the final shakedown. Don't bet on it.BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, who negotiated the deal in a recent nighttime call with Attorney General Eric Holder, is telling shareholders that the Justice Department deal is the last big crisis-era liability the bank has to worry about.Shareholders aren't so sure. The Charlotte-based giant's stock hasn't rallied. Shares have fallen 6% since July 3 and were down again Thursday on the news.In the first quarter, BofA shareholders were shocked to learn that the bank suffered a $276 million loss attributed in part to a $6 billion settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency over subprime loans and bonds and a legal set-aside of another $2.4 billion to cover future costs from additional Justice probes.The Holder regime has torn into BofA like a pinata. The bank already has forked over $60 billion to settle lawsuits and buy back mortgage securities — more than any other big bank. Why would Holder stop shaking down such an easy mark now?JPMorgan thought it could buy protection with a then-record $13 billion subprime payoff to Holder. But then, after Holder threatened possible criminal action and more investigations, it set aside a whopping $23 billion in legal reserves. Citibank got off relatively easy. Last month, Holder shook it down for $7 billion.None of these settlements has anything to do with compensating victims of alleged crimes. Banks weren't charged with defrauding homeowners or originating fraudulent loans.Even if you believe the securities fraud charges, which we don't, the victims would be the institutional buyers of their mortgage bonds. To make them whole, the government would have distributed the settlement proceeds to those investors. But it didn't. It's distributing billions to Democratic constituents and housing groups.In the JPMorgan deal, Holder set aside $4 million for ""consumer relief"" for homeowners never ID'd as victims. But ""low- to moderate-income borrowers"" in Detroit, Chicago and other Democratic strongholds will now get easy-term home loans.Meanwhile, Holder has ordered Citibank to earmark $2.5 billion for ""consumer relief,"" including writing down mortgage debt for deadbeat borrowers. And he'll redistribute almost half — $7 billion — of the BofA settlement to consumers.In his consent orders, Holder has failed to provide the public with key info on even investor losses. He hasn't named guilty executives who supposedly duped people into buying subprime products. He lists no specific laws broken, no systemic illegal schemes or activities.That's because he's got nothing. He couldn't make those cases stick in court. But he hasn't had to. All he's had to do is threaten and bully. As BofA said, a legal battle with the feds would have been ""extremely expensive.""Holder has collected many superlatives during his reign — most political attorney general, most race-obsessed AG. But they don't do his real skills justice. He's this nation's all-time greatest shakedown artist.

478,INFO,"There's no such thing as dumb questions. Yet there are smarter ones if you're conducting a job interview. That's when the crunch is on. A brilliant hire can shift your firm's fortunes. One toxic worker can crumple your bulletproof team. Questions mine great people, so stay sharp.Mission: Figure out the individuals behind those buttery cover letters and carefully crafted resumes.To accomplish it, the guy who teaches the Pentagon how to dig up key information during combat keeps his brain nimble. He's James Pyle, a human intelligence training instructor who works with the Army and reports that ace interviewers are agile thinkers who can drill into data to get to the essence of the person.He's co-author, with Maryann Karinch, of ""Find Out Anything From Anyone, Anytime.""""You want to make sure that what you're seeing and hearing has congruency,"" Pyle told IBD.More tricks to spear top talent:• Think like a kid. Simple questions lead to rich answers. ""As adults, our biggest downfall in questioning is that we try to get too much information,"" Pyle told IBD.• Get to the point. ""A fundamental lesson in the questioning process I teach,"" he added, ""is to find out one thing at a time.""Get greedy or spit out overly complex grills, and you'll miss out.• Rap for rapport. Drop the drill sergeant persona. A comfortable candidate will reveal more material. ""Just begin the conversation without trying to check the blocks,"" Pyle said. ""Set the paper — the resume and your notes — off to the side."" But pay attention.• Listen. Managers often find important elements of a candidate's personality during the chitchat at the beginning or end of formal talks. Don't ignore those signs.• Tune in. Turn off your phone and other gadgets so you'll be able to hear with all your senses.• Set the scene. Think about where you'll convene, recommends Karinch, a body language expert. Office? If your desk is stacked with books or piles of paper, pick up the clutter or move to a conference room. ""You don't want a barrier that blocks the connection between you and the other person,"" she said.• Leave the spotlight. You're pumped about your company, but focus on the applicant.""You don't need to respond to everything they say with your own personal experience,"" Pyle said.• Think it through. ""Organize information in a way that makes it simpler to work with,"" Pyle instructed. Try these mental checkpoints to help map out your questions: people, places, events.• Screen for gaps. How a candidate phrases the response is important. ""If you ask someone about her boss and she gives an answer about her work situation, then you've heard a problem,"" the authors noted.• Circle back. If you think you've caught a discrepancy in a potential hire's history, rewind.""Probe again,"" Karinch said. ""Sometimes they don't match up because a person exaggerates. That's pretty common.""• Get the story. The most typical querying mistake, according to Pyle and Karinch: Asking questions that prompt only a yes or no answer.Make sure you find out who, what, where, when and why.""That brings a narrative response,"" Pyle said.• Keep it coming. When an applicant has finished spilling the details, forge on.Pyle explained that a simple ""What else?"" or ""Tell me more"" will tap a flow of potent stories to reveal the person beneath the hiring history.

497,INFO,"Now we know why Barack Obama's mother-in-law left Chicago's South Side to live with her daughter in the White House:A new Gallup Poll has discovered, among numerous revealing info nuggets on American tastes, that Illinois residents think their state is the worst possible one to live in. Bar none. They are the least trustful of state government. (Gee, why would that be with so many Illinois pols in prison?) And they are the most resentful of the tax burdens their elected leaders lay on them.""Illinois,"" Gallup reports. has the unfortunate distinction of being the state with the highest percentage of residents who say it is the worst possible place to live. One in four Illinois residents (25%) say the state is the worst place to live, followed by 17% each in Rhode Island and Connecticut.""Oh, look! All three states are governed by Democrats.Now, for the good stuff. Gallup has completed a massive, six-month survey of at least 600 residents in all 57 of Obama's states. It asked everyone if their residence was ""the best possible state to live in,"" ""one of the best possible states to live in,"" ""as good a state as any to live in,"" or ""the worst possible state to live in.""Tied at the top at 77% for the best/one of the best states are Montana and Alaska. Something else Sarah Palin was right about. They're followed by Utah at 70% and Wyoming at 69%.Oh, you say, that's just because the top four are among the least-populated states. Wrong, crowded city-dweller.Texas is No. 5 with Hawaii at 68% atop New Hampshire (67%), North Dakota (66%), Colorado (65%) and Minnesota, Oregon and Vermont at 61%.Do you see the pattern there? Eighty-percent of the most popular states are West of the Mississippi River.Just as 80% of the bottom ten best/one of the best states are East or partially East of the Mississippi: Rhode Island (18%), Illinois (19%), Mississippi (26%), Louisiana (27%), Michigan, New Mexico and New Jersey at 28%, Maryland and Missouri at 29% and Connecticut at 31%.Although Texas on average ranked fifth overall, it had the highest percentage of residents who said it was the single best place to live. After 18 years of Republican governors and legislatures, it remains the country's top job-creating state and one of its fastest-growing in population. And it has a balanced budget and no state income tax. Probably just coincidences.Typical of many of the top-tier states are large landscapes (or oceans), beautiful geographies, world-class winters and in the case of Montana and Alaska, borders with Canada, which has better beer.RELATED:Obama, Holder to pardon thousands of drug dealers, addicts

502,INFO,"The scandals that have broadsided the Obama administration in recent weeks have the potential for leaving a gaping hole in the president's standing with the American people, according to a new IBD/TIPP poll.
"
503,INFO,"Overall, more Americans still approve (48%) than disapprove (44%) of the job President Obama is doing — a 3 percentage-point improvement over approval readings in the last two months.
"
504,INFO,"But the reverse is true among those who are following the administration's handling of the Benghazi crisis, the IRS' targeting of the Tea Party and other groups, and the Justice Department's seizure and pursuit of the phone logs of the Associated Press and Fox News reporter James Rosen.
"
505,INFO,"See No Scandal?
"
506,INFO,"The president's approval rating tops 60% among those who are not closely following coverage of the three scandals but is only 42% among those following Benghazi, 43% among those fol lowing IRS and 39% among those keeping an eye on AP/Rosen.
"
507,INFO,"Put another way, disapproval stands at 55%, 53% and 57% among those watching the respective scandals vs. only 21%, 22% and 28% among those who aren't.
"
508,INFO,"The results suggest Obama's ratings could erode dramatically if the scandals stay front and center in the news. There's no guarantee of that, of course, given media support of this administration. But even the decidedly pro-Obama mainstream media are stepping up scandal coverage.
"
509,INFO,"The IBD/TIPP findings jibe with those in other major polls. While Gallup has Obama's approval at 47% in its daily tracking (vs. 44% disapproval), polls including Rasmussen, Reuters, Quinnipiac and Fox now show disapproval ratings four to six percentage points ahead of approval.
"
510,INFO,"Two months ago, approval/disapproval was more mixed (but leaning toward approval). But four months ago approval easily topped disapproval in some polls by 10 to 14 points, according to a compilation by RealClearPolitics.
"
511,INFO,"Depending on the coverage, in fact, this is very much a glass half-full or half-empty story. Media that hesitate to run negative stories about the president could say the overall approval numbers, and especially those of Gallup and IBD/TIPP, show the president is holding up well considering the coverage of late.
"
512,INFO,"But those that drill a little deeper, including IBD/TIPP, turn up weakness in Obama's position.
"
513,INFO,"Who Is Paying Attention?
"
514,INFO,"There's also a political element. Republicans more opposed to Obama are following the scandals more closely.
"
515,INFO,"Specifically, 85% of them are keeping an eye on Benghazi vs. 59% of Democrats and 67% of independents. They are also more closely following the IRS scandal: 83% to 64% for Democrats and 69% for independents.

"
533,INFO,"Among the many costs of the Barack Obama presidency is an intentional corrosion for its own political gain of public faith in so many American institutions, among them Congress, the Supreme Court and the media.If numerous sectors of society are feuding or distrustful of each other, then a well-controlled central authority like a chief executive can more easily rule the pieces. It's classic Chicago politics, the way the mayor there controls the city's feuding neighborhood fiefdoms of Democrat pols and workers.We're going to examine the American media today and urge some temperance and caution in the now endemic condemnation of the much-reviled MSM for the country's own self-interest. To be honest, it has done much to earn widespread public distrust. This stems from the inherent institutional and individual arrogance of its long-time monopoly over the information flow through broadcast networks and large daily newspapers.And from its laser focus on conflict as ""news"" and its do-good social agendas that instinctively turn to government intervention instead of far more effective individual responsibility and action. The traditional media's disconnection from its audience became even more starkly visible with the Internet's welcome explosion of information sources, many of them responsible.Reporters Without Borders released its annual World Press Freedom Index the other day. Much of it was predictable. Few would be surprised that China, Syria and North Korea inhabit the bottom rungs of press freedom.What was shocking to those of us who favor a strong, independent -- and, yes, imperfect -- media as a constitutional check on government's power was the ranking of the United States, the world's largest economy and most enduring democracy.The U.S. during the fifth year of Obama's reign plummeted 13 spots to 46th in the world, right between -- are you ready? -- Rumania and Haiti. The group based that embarrassing ranking largely on the Obama administration's unusually determined efforts to curb dissent and plug and track down leaks. (For the five countries deemed most free, scroll to the bottom.**)Not all leaks are bad. With a twinkle in his eye, a knowing politician once authorized me to leak government information with the order: ""See that you suppress this widely."" Trying to gain dominance over each 24-hour news cycle, the Obama administration leaks like a sieve with the advantageous info it wants out -- a new cabinet member, EPA policy shift, some nickel-and-dime small ball gimmick Obama intends to announce to placate a segment of his base. None of this is unique to him.And no president or wannabe likes un-orchestrated leaks.But no other administration in recent memory has gone to the lengths of this one to plug leaks, catch leakers and intimidate would-be news sources.Atty. Gen. Eric Holder even signed a court document certifying that a Fox News reporter was a criminal co-conspirator, when he wasn't, in order to obtain authority to wiretap him, his emails and his parents' phone to track the reporter's source.Then, under oath, Holder told Congress he could not contemplate ever doing such a thing.Obama is notorious for dodging responsibility, professing ignorance of a problem or blaming others.In his Super Bowl interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, a jolly Obama virtually dismissed the IRS scandal of intimidating conservative groups as a bevy of ""bone-head decisions"" by confused local agents free of even a ""smidgen"" of corruption. And the president as victim implied that Fox News harps on the case to drive its own anti-administration agenda.This from the same cynical mouth that less than nine months ago denounced the same affair as an outrageous abuse of power, promising a thorough investigation to ensure it never ever reoccurred.Now that the Obama crowd has separated media from many who once trusted it, comes an even more dire threat.The Federal Communications Commission this spring will launch a nationwide ""study"" of newsroom values, priorities and processes to see if they meet a list of government ""critical information needs."" This will also involve print media over which the FCC has heretofore had no authority under the Constitution. This process, similar to ones employed by Communist regimes behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, is not designed to gather any information at all. It's designed to sow doubt, fear and intimidate traditionally independent news media into self-censorship, which can be a very powerful tool limiting critical news coverage.And -- oh, look! -- there's an important midterm election coming in nine months.Americans need not trust, respect or even like the nation's disparate news media to see this campaign for what it is: A bold political move by an omnivorous government that threatens, like a clogged human artery, to limit the flow of independent information envisioned by the Founding Fathers as so essential to the daily health of this democracy.RELATED:What Rand Paul needs to stop doingTime for a real executive as our chief executiveNot a smidgen of credibility in Obama's IRS claimObama's French state dinner: Let them eat caviar and fudge

557,INFO,"To make vital information pop out in the widening ocean of Big Data, organizations must adopt the right tools and mindset. So says Phil Simon, author of  ""The Visual Organization."" He quotes Henry David Thoreau to make his point: ""It's not what you look at that matters; it's what you see.""Tips on making key info relevant:• Embrace tech. Business leaders must use interactive applications that highlight crucial discoveries. Pie charts can still tell a story, said Simon, but the best organizations ""understand that contemporary data-visualization tools allow for a high degree of interactivity, motion and animation.""Technology can lead to unexpected statistical conclusions. ""If at all possible, try to create data visualizations with embedded interactivity,"" Simon told IBD. ""These types of tools allow end users to easily and quickly ask and answer questions. In the end, better business decisions are likely to result.""• See all numbers. Don't neglect small data such as lists of sales, customers, employees and products internally and in presentations.• Exercise patience. With more sources of information than ever and more ways to analyze it, decoding data can seem overwhelming, said Bill Franks, author of  ""Taming the Big Data Tidal Wave.""""The potential is so large that organizations must push through the initial learning curve,"" said Franks, who is also chief analytics officer for software giant Teradata (TDC) . ""It has always taken time to integrate new data and new analytics into business processes.""So begin, experiment and shape the data to your firm's needs.• Start small. Some organizations make the mistake of building huge systems to gather masses of data before they get started, says Franks .""Capture just enough to prove or disprove what you're trying to do,"" he suggested. ""Once proved, move forward with the bigger effort.""For example, Franks says, you don't need all Web browsing history for all customers for a year to test how the data can improve marketing offers. You need a solid sample of just a few months.• Understand the stakes. Franks contends that you won't find an example where more information made analytics less powerful. ""Some of the highest market-cap companies in the world today, especially in Silicon Valley, have built their business around analytics,"" he said. ""It is possible for traditional organizations to make the transition and become an analytic organization that fully leverages Big Data.""Simon points to companies such as eBay (EBAY), Netflix (NFLX), Autodesk (ADSK), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) embracing visual-data expertise. His take: ""Google in 2014 can do things that in 1998 it couldn't even imagine. In 2018, Google will do things that it can't do today. Recognize that it's a journey, not a sprint.""• Go beyond. Big Data and visualization expand the possible. ""Organizations must re-examine longstanding policies and assumptions about what can be done,"" Franks said. ""It is quite possible that analytics or actions that were not realistic to pursue even a few years ago could be very achievable today.""• Be open. Not everyone has to be a numbers scientist. ""Still,"" said Simon, ""it behooves organizations to remember this quote from Silicon Valley icon Jim Barksdale: 'If we have data, let's look at (them). If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine.'""

660,INFO,"Power Abuse: Emboldened by its shakedown of mortgage lenders, the administration is now accusing car lenders of racism. On what grounds? It refuses to say, raising suspicion of another witch hunt.
"
661,INFO,"Some of the nation's largest auto lenders, including Ally Bank, are now under federal investigation for allegedly discriminating against black and Latino borrowers — a deplorable crime, if true.
"
662,INFO,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is heading the new crusade with help from the Justice Department. It claims it has ""statistical evidence"" showing car lenders and dealers marking up loan prices for minorities vs. whites. Lenders and dealers insist they're pricing for risk, not race; and if there are differences, they're explained by neutral credit factors affecting loans.
"
663,INFO,"Still, the administration claims loan pricing policies that have a ""disparate impact"" on minorities are discriminatory — the same shaky legal ground it trod to go after home lenders. For the first time, federal civil-rights enforcers are relying on stats rather than actual acts or intent to prove racism.
"
664,INFO,"While that's bad enough, the administration won't reveal the methodology it's using to find discrimination in the numbers. CFPB, the consumer bureau, is keeping its analytical formula secret.
"
665,INFO,"Trade groups have asked what constitutes a ""statistically significant"" disparity in loan rates by race. Does a 30-basis-point gap trigger charges? Twenty? Ten? At what point is it discrimination? ""CFPB refuses to release any sort of analysis or methodology as to how they reached their conclusions,"" National Auto Dealers Association spokesman Bailey Wood told us.
"
666,INFO,"Though lawmakers largely stood by as mortgage bankers were called racists, they've defended the auto industry. Lenders and dealers weren't blamed for the crisis and were supposed to be exempt from financial reform.
"
667,INFO,"So CFPB's overreach has sparked bipartisan anger. Both Republicans and Democrats have demanded the administration explain its justification for targeting car lenders. They've put their request for more specifics in writing to CFPB chief Richard Cordray no fewer than eight times, and each time he's snubbed them.
"
668,INFO,"The agency's stonewalling raises suspicions it won't disclose its metrics because it knows that it will empirically show its racism charges to be false or at best half-cooked, and no different than the trumped-up claims they've made against mortgage defendants.
"
669,INFO,"Only, the expanding witch hunt against car lenders is worse than the one against home lenders, which so far has extorted $100 billion in payola. The assumptions Obama's diversity cops make while sifting through the limited auto loan data are even wilder than the ones they make for mortgage stats.
"
670,INFO,"National data for both auto and mortgage loans lack key borrower credit info. But unlike mortgages, the auto data don't even include the race of applicants, so investigators have to go by surnames to ID their ethnicity.
"
671,INFO,"Such ""proxies"" are notoriously unreliable.
"
672,INFO,"So not only are investigators making guesses about the credit qualifications of the applicants they're comparing, they're also making assumptions about the actual race of those applicants. While they blindly assume the whites and minorities they're grouping together have similar credit backgrounds, they can't even be sure the whites they've picked are in fact white and the minorities are in fact of color.
"
673,INFO,"That's a lot of speculation for something as serious as racism charges. It's plain they lack the data to support their conclusions of discrimination. Yet they don't seem at all concerned about the negative consequences of prosecuting in error.
"
674,INFO,"Not only are they unfairly damaging corporate brands, they're also raising credit costs for consumers. In the case of auto dealers, they're trying to eliminate dealer discretion in setting loan loan rates to meet or beat competitors, which saves car buyers money.
"
675,INFO,"So far the administration's murky disparate-impact claims have kept lenders guessing and in a perpetual state of legal jeopardy, which causes them to overlend to ""protected classes,"" regardless of risk. That's what led to the financial crisis in the first place.

726,INFO,"Blogging is one way for real estate agents to increase their presence and showcase their knowledge and personality, say experts.
"
727,INFO,"Weintraub, a big believer, has three blogs and writes ""every day."" ""Blogs help explain exactly who you are and what you do,"" she said. ""And when people read your blog they feel like they know you."" Blogs also drive traffic to your website, she says.
"
728,INFO,"Also, she uses one blog site, ActiveRain, to network with other real estate agents in other markets, which has resulted in referrals.
"
729,INFO,"Brock Harris, a property broker with Silver Lake Real Estate in Los Angeles, says his email newsletter is his best marketing tool. ""It's an excuse for me to get in front of people and remind them of me,"" he said. He also uses Twitter to build mind-share.
"
730,INFO,"Weintraub uses Twitter too: ""I tweet links to my blogs.""
"
731,INFO,"And Harris has returned to old-school marketing with mailers. He says they reach people in the neighborhoods he knows best. And he said, ""Success begets success ... the best marketing in the world is a bunch of for-sale and sold signs.""
"
732,INFO,"Harris also has appeared on HGTV. He says the shows have never generated direct business, but his participation results in ""a bit of credibility in my pre-listing package.""
"
733,INFO,"Listing Aggregators and Yelp
"
734,INFO,"What new tools have had the most profound impact on real estate marketing? Real estate agents say third-party aggregators such as Trulia and Zillow have changed the game.
"
735,INFO,"These sites offer listings and data on properties across the nation. And the sites enable real estate agents to enhance their listings with more information about their listed properties and themselves, which is free. Or they can pay for ads that pop up when visitors view listings in certain ZIP codes.
"
736,INFO,"""Consumers are searching for properties online, and agents who aren't using those tools yet are going to struggle,"" said Ginger Wilcox, director of industry marketing at Trulia.
"
737,INFO,"When real estate agents enhance a listing on a third-party aggregator site, they can add photos, videos, more data and more info about themselves.
"
738,INFO,"Some real estate agents say videos and panoramic photos sell properties; others say they're nice ""dressing"" but pricing the property right and getting the listing out to a wide audience are more important selling factors.
"
739,INFO,"""These websites came up from behind and gave clients what they wanted, easily accessible data and listings,"" Harris said. ""The housing market is like the stock market now; there's no information advantage to be held by any Realtor/broker.""
"
740,INFO,"Real estate buyers and sellers love being able to shop for property, analyze or just dream online, without pressure. And real estate agents say the pop-up ads they're buying on these sites, though pricey, are worth it.
"
741,INFO,"Bic DeCaro, a real estate agent with Westgate Realty Group in Falls Church, Va., says she's now spending $60,000 annually for ads on these sites and ""easily doubling"" her money.
"
742,INFO,"She says the key to converting leads to clients and listings is a quick response and market knowledge. Some potential clients contact real estate agents via their mobile devices while sitting in front of a listed house. ""If you don't respond to a lead within minutes you'll lose it,"" DeCaro said.
"
743,INFO,"DeCaro also has attracted listing clients via Zillow. She recently worked with a client living in Dubai. She gave him advice on repairs to his rental property, arranged for the work and then sold the house, with multiple offers a week from its listing date. He's since given her a great review online, and she's never even met him.
"
744,INFO,"Most real estate aggregators allow clients to post reviews. But Mark Choey, partner and co-founder of Climb Real Estate Group in San Francisco, says reviews on Yelp (YELP), which is a general reviews site, are also free, and ""the best"" marketing for real estate agents today.
"
745,INFO,"Choey advertises on both Trulia and Zillow and says the prices for ads on each site are ""very competitive."" He said: ""You pick the amount of advertising you want in a ZIP code and it's all done online.""
"
746,INFO,"Another plus to the new real estate market? More educated clients.
"
747,INFO,"Real estate buyers and sellers are ""more engaged than in the past,"" said Mitch Robison, Zillow's senior director of trade marketing. ""Now when (a buyer) contacts an agent through Zillow, they've already got it narrowed down to a few homes.""
"
748,INFO,"What Doesn't Work
"
749,INFO,"Canned or slow responses, overly aggressive pitches and ads in markets that a real estate agent doesn't know very well are all formulas for failure.
"
750,INFO,"And general advertising in non-real-estate publications isn't very effective, say experts. Also, real estate agents say Facebook (FB) might help a real estate agent keep up with friends and family, but they ""don't really want to see you post real estate information all the time,"" said Choey.
"
751,INFO,"Finally, keep in mind the limitations of marketing. ""No marketing will sell a house that's not priced right,"" said Harris. ""When people are looking for a real estate agent, they should look for someone who tells them the truth.""Successful real estate agents today need all the usual skills — local market expertise, trustworthiness, and negotiation and sales chops — but they must also be, well, nerdy.Whether you're buying or selling property, you'll want to evaluate your real estate agent's tech and social media know-how. To do that, you need to know what does and doesn't work in a 21st-century real estate agent's tool bag of websites, social networks, blogs, email newsletters and Twitter accounts.It's a new property market, with consumers able to instantly access listings and property data online. Some agents get it, others not so much. About 92% of residential real estate firms use the MLS or multiple listing service, but only 65% of these real estate agents are on third-party aggregator sites such as Trulia (TRLA), Redfin and Zillow (Z), according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors.And although many top real estate agents say blogging is a key skill in today's property market, NAR says just 12% of Realtors reported having a blog in 2013, up from 10% in 2012.""Clients prefer different tools ... so building a wide presence is a Realtor's best strategy,"" said Jessica Lautz, NAR's director of member and consumer survey research.Realtor Elizabeth Weintraub with Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento, Calif., echoes that thought. She says her new clients sometimes tell her that they chose her because they went to a bunch of different real estate sites and they say ""everywhere I went, there you were.""Blogging, Emails And TwitterBlogging is one way for real estate agents to increase their presence and showcase their knowledge and personality, say experts.Weintraub, a big believer, has three blogs and writes ""every day.""

782,INFO,"A slew of foreign leaders suddenly are rebounding from their 10-week lines, but volume behavior may not be up to snuff. Three of China's hottest ADRs fell fast to their 10-week lines and rebounded in the past two days. Let's take a closer look.Social-networking site YY (YY) peaked Oct. 3, reversed lower and began a 20% swoon through Tuesday's low. The stock lost ground in three of those four sessions. The worst was Tuesday's 15% crash, which saw YY slice its 10-week line as volume surged 122% above normal.Wednesday's 5% gain spurred 71% higher-than-average volume. YY closed that day virtually on the 10-week line. Thursday saw YY rise 7%, although volume was just average.Fast upside volume is key to a successful rebound, but YY's wasn't as fast as what it recorded on the decline. That's troubling.Real estate info site SouFun Holdings (SFUN) topped out Sept. 10, then retreated as much as 18% through Tuesday's low. Sept. 11 saw the start of a three-day, 16% losing streak. Each session saw ugly-high volume.Two more sessions, Oct. 3 and Oct. 9, saw losses of 8% (on 173% higher volume) and 9% (on 99% higher volume, respectively. Those losses carried more than a whiff of panic.Tuesday's rout brought SouFun to test its 10-week line. The stock on Wednesday rose 7% on 78% higher volume, then gained 8% Thursday on just average volume. Like YY, the rebound sessions aren't drawing the same level of action as the sell-offs.Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), whose 14-month-old search engine is causing some perspiration at  Baidu's (BIDU) headquarters, followed much the same pattern as that seen in YY and SouFun.Qihoo peaked Sept. 11, then corrected 21% through Wednesday's low. Qihoo's 4% rise Thursday helped it firmly regain its 10-week line.But volume was a touch below average, in line with YY and SouFun's action. At the same time, Tuesday's sell-off saw Qihoo's volume rise 47% above normal — well below the panicky surges seen in YY and SouFun.Are there other stocks that are newly buyable? Yes. Look at fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) (which could use some more upside volume), Russian search engine Yandex (YNDX) and Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX). But keep an eye on volume, which could yet prove to be a problem.

783,INFO,"Foreign stocks provided no shelter Tuesday as the U.S. market took a beating.Let's focus on the highflying issues from China that had been enjoying a special thrust from their connection with the mobile technology phenomenon.NQ Mobile (NQ) dived 6% in fast trade. The May 2011 IPO had traded up to a 2% gain early in the session, far better than many thought they'd see.After Monday's close, NQ announced a proposed offering of $150 million in convertible notes. That news crushed NQ in after-hours trade, so Tuesday morning's small gain was a surprise.But the gains didn't stick. The stock had screamed 141% from an 18-week double bottom, from which it broke out in the July 19 week. That profit is down to 97%SouFun Holdings (SFUN), which provides online real estate listings, info and marketing, sank 9% in twice its average volume.SouFun had broken out from a cup-with-handle base on July 16. It forged ahead 93% through its Sept. 10 top — without once touching its 10-week average.November 2012 IPO YY (YY) crashed 15% in more than double its usual action.The social-networking platform's most recent base was a nine-week consolidation that saw a solid breakout May 6. The stock bolted 145% to its 51.50 peak, which it hit last week. YY tested its 10-week line twice along the way. The stock's gain from its May 6 breakout was pared to 99% with Tuesday's close.Online flash-sale retailer Vipshop (VIPS) fell 9% in double-paced volume.Vipshop, which came public in March at 6.50, peaked last week at 70. Its most recent base was an ugly affair: an eight-week consolidation that held a 40% correction and lots of sloppy action.But when Vipshop took out its 38.56 buy point, it ran up 82% in 2-1/2 months.And if you didn't like the base, Vipshop tested its 10-week line at 38.54 in the Aug. 30 week.

What firms need to know:
"
785,INFO,"• Hit the bull's-eye. Understand that customers want what you promise. No more, no less. You might know of exceptional customer service: a concierge who goes out of his way to get your child's favorite stuffed toy back to you after it's been forgotten at the hotel; a waitress who offers free appetizers while you wait for your meal. That's all great, Dixon says. But his research shows it's not necessary.

"
789,INFO,"• Keep the ball rolling. When you do get a phone call, know that more than half of callers have already tried your website. So you must be even faster at finding a solution.

Balistierri says if MasterCard agents can't answer your question immediately, they'll ask for your contact info and set up a time to call you back.

You know from previous calls that one replacement might not be enough, given that the part is often broken in the process. Offer to send two parts right away, says Dixon. The fewer times a customer has to call you back, the better.
"
793,INFO,"• Steer them straight. When customers call to ask about foreign driving laws, MasterCard agents know the answer, says Balistierri. ""The question might be: Do I have rental car insurance if I travel to Germany? The answer is: Yes, but in Germany they may ask you to show proof of insurance, so be prepared to show that document.""

""When we are required to comply with a particular request, we frequently share only basic user information, such as name.""The Menlo Park, Calif.-based network handed over information to U.S. officials more often than it did for most other countries, including the U.K., where it handed over data for 68% of the 1,975 requests for information on 2,337 users.Other countries got requested info less often.

Federal regulations bar these tech firms from giving exact numbers, in part because some requests are through the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Facebook did not say whether it included FISA requests in its release, as other tech firms have done.Yahoo said in June that it received 12,000 to 13,000 requests in the six months ended in May.

On the other hand, the transaction will enable Kensho to leverage S&P Global’s deep data sets, global-scale analytics platforms, essential benchmarks and strong leadership team to better serve clients while retaining the independent brand identity.The acquisition is the second of its kind. The first was S&P Global’s buyout of a New York-based data analytics private company, Panjiva Inc. in February. Panjiva — a leader in machine learning and data analytics — provides deep, differentiated, sector-relevant insights on global supply chains, leveraging data science and technology to make sense of large, unstructured datasets. It offers customers macro data covering 95% of global trade flows and transactional data covering 35% of the same. S&P Global expects Panjiva to enhance its Global Market Intelligence's data and analytical offerings for diverse customers throughout the world, generating higher top-line growth. With such opportune acquisitions, S&P Global has outperformed the industry in the last six months with an average return of 24.2% compared with a gain of 13% for the latter.S&P Global expects the Kensho acquisition to be dilutive to its GAAP earnings for 2018 and has accordingly revised its earlier guidance. It currently expects GAAP earnings in the range of $7.95-$8.10 per share, down from earlier expectations of $8.15-$8.30. However, adjusted earnings’ guidance is reiterated at $8.45-$8.60 per share.S&P Global carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

830,INFO,"FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report) has made a remarkable run in the last six months. The stock has returned 32.3% during the said time frame, significantly outperforming the industry's gain of 14.2%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11% and a market cap of $8.2 billion seems to be a stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let’s delve deeper to look at the factors influencing the company’s performance.FactSet, a provider of global online integrated data-related products and services for the investment community regularly enhances product portfolio to address the requirements of the industry it caters to.Additionally, its strategy of expanding through acquisitions is praiseworthy. The company’s most noticeable acquisitions include the buyout of BISAM, IDMS, Portware LLC, Code Red, Revere Data LLC, StreetAccount, to name some.We believe, the enrichment of the offerings via innovations and acquisitions has assisted the company in expanding clientele as well as global footprint. The addition of 65 clients in first-quarter fiscal 2018 which took the tally to 4809 is a testament to the fact. The company’s Annual Subscription Value (“ASV”) increased to $1.32 billion as of Nov 30, 2017, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.17 billion. However, a declining client retention ratio is a major concern. The company’s client retention ratio in the first quarter was 90%, tanking 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 100 bps from the previous quarter. This remain a concern over the company’s top-line growth in near-term.Additionally, the industry being a highly competitive one with the likes of players such as Bloomberg L.P., Thomson Reuters Inc. and S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report), FactSet continues to face strong headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderFactSet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are IHS Markit Ltd. (INFO  -  Free Report) and Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report) both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks >>

Major exchange players would be the CME Group for futures, the CBOE Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) or the NASDAQ Market Site (NDAQ  -  Free Report) for stocks.

852,INFO,"The economic backdrop exhibits signs of improvement with the rise in GDP, a better employment scenario, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum gained by oil prices.  The outlook for business services sector moves in line with the broader economy. Significantly, the business-friendly orientation of the current administration is widely expected to give the U.S. economy a nudge of growth.  The business services sector includes companies that provide ancillary services to other industries in the market. Companies from this sector help other firms focus on their core competencies, helping them benefit from operating efficiencies. Many of these functions fall within otherwise ancillary areas for most companies -- for example, payroll processing, staffing, marketing/advertising and information technology, to name some of the major areas. Gradual improvement in interest rate environment points toward improving economic conditions. The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes in 2017 and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Retaining this optimism, outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterated expectations for three rate increases in 2018.The Fed also provided an optimistic employment outlook. Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to be 3.9% for both 2018 and 2019 and 4% in 2020.President Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. The tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden to 21% from 35%. This move is likely to act as an impetus. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), gross domestic product is estimated to increase in the upcoming quarters. GDP growth is now expected to accelerate 2.4% in 2018 and 2019, better than 2.3% in 2017. This favorable outlook for the U.S. economy is a net positive for the business service sector as well. No doubt the Zacks Business Services sector has been a strong performer, gaining 20.9% in a year, outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 18.2% gain. The intensely competitive business services sector must diligently work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues in order to maintain profitability. Focus on functions and activities in line with core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale, as well as improving competitive positioning. Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are quite conservatively managed, with a large number of players sharing excess cash with investors through dividends and share buybacks. Another attribute of the sector is its highly fragmented nature, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. Per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to the sector’s total revenue. Stand-Alone Zacks Sector: Favorable Given the group’s unique nature, Zacks has classified it as one of the 16 sectors (the S&P’s official GIC classification has only 11 sectors where business services are grouped within the ‘Industrials’ sector). Notably, with about 3.8% of total market capitalization, the sector generated 3.1% of the total S&P 500 income in 2017. This industry offers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about $620 billion, though many of these companies do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry. Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries at the medium (M-level) and 265 industries at the expanded (X-level). We rank all 265 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page. We rank the 265 sub-industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries into two groups — the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.) Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks – the core of our Industry Rank – has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (one to three months). We have eight X-level industries within the Business Services sector, namely Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services, Business Services, Consulting, Financial Transaction Services, Outsourcing, Staffing and Waste Removal Services. Staffing at #59, Business Information Services at #65, Auction/Valuation Services at #68, Waste Removal at #88 and Outsourcing at #108 all fall in the top half.Financial Transaction Services at #148, Business Services at #171 and Consulting at #234 are the industries that fall in the bottom half.Our top picks from the Outsourcing industries are ExlService Holdings, Inc.

(CPRT  -  Free Report) is our top pick from Auction/Valuation Services. US Ecology, Inc. (ECOL  -  Free Report) and Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) are #2 Ranked player and our favorite from the Waste Removal industry.Valuation of the SectorThe valuation of the business service sector seems attractive relative to its own history as well as the broader S&P 500 index.The Zacks Business Service sector is currently trading at a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.2X. Over the last five years, the sector has traded as low as 9.2X and as high as 11.2X with a median of 10X. In other words, the sector is currently trading at the high end of its five-year range and higher than median on a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA basis. On a forward 12-month EPS basis, the sector trades at 21.8X, comparing with the five-year range of 19.1X and 21.8X and a median of 20.3X. In other words, the sector is trading toward the high end of its five-year forward 12-month P/E range as well as its median. The sector is trading at a discount to the S&P 500 index on the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA basis. The sector modestly underperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. While the sector has gained 21.3%, the index has rallied 23.2%.  Earnings Outlook Companies have already started reporting fourth-quarter earnings. While earnings are expected to be improving 5.4%, revenues will grow 4.8%. Both compare unfavorably with the S&P 500 index. For 2017, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 9.4% on 3.7% revenue growth compared with the S&P 500 index’s earnings growth of 7.5% on back of 5.2% top-line growth.   For 2018, earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 12% on 6.4% revenue growth. This compares unfavorably with the S&P 500 index’s expected earnings increase of 13.7% but favorably with 5.1% higher revenues from 2017.The graph below shows year-over-year bottom-line growth of the Business Services sector in comparison to the S&P 500. The graph below shows year-over-year top-line growth of the Business Services sector in comparison to the S&P 500 index. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

(RSG  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $69.12 during yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $68.44 for a healthy return of 19.6% in the past year. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.5%.Growth DriversRepublic Services is currently focusing on a series of quality acquisition opportunities, primarily of recycling assets, which are likely to act as a catalyst for a healthy long-term growth within its top 25 markets. The company is also transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy return on investment.During third-quarter 2017, Republic Services acquired ReCommunity Holdings II, Inc. — the largest independent recycling-processing firm in the United States — for an undisclosed amount. The strategic acquisition is likely to offer an unrivalled competitive advantage in the recycling business that continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the waste stream. In addition, the deal will also facilitate Republic Services to gain control of multiple long-term municipal agreements of ReCommunity with processing fee-based structures. These agreements align perfectly with the company’s innovative recycling pricing model and are likely to generate incremental revenues.  Moreover, Republic Services has pledged its commitment to the Blue Planet sustainability initiative that aims at increasing its recycling capacity by an additional 150,000 tons or more per year by 2018. As part of this initiative, the company is steadily building durable practices and programs to further improve its environmental and social impacts through decreased vehicle emissions, innovative landfill technologies, more use of renewable energy and community engagements.In addition, Republic Services continues to generate significant free cash flow, which is utilized for increased dividend payment, repurchasing shares and strategic acquisitions. Over the years, the company has returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. It has always boasted a conservative balance sheet with a healthy liquidity position. The stock has performed almost in line with the industry in the last three months with an average return of 7.4% compared with 7.5% gain for the latter.Moving forward, it aims to focus on prudent investment decisions for a disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet position and cash flow enhancement to support dividend growth. Such moves, along with a robust operating platform and an efficient management team will likely help in the execution of its strategic priorities and drive net asset value in the future.All these factors probably raised investor confidence and drove the company’s shares to a fresh 52-week high.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the industry include Black Knight, Inc.

855,INFO,"On Jan 3, we issued an updated research report on business services provider, Verisk Analytics, Inc. (VRSK  -  Free Report).Verisk continues to extend its footprint in new markets through targeted international expansion. The company recently inked an agreement to acquire PowerAdvocate for $200 million to augment its presence in the energy sector. Catering primarily to the global energy firms, PowerAdvocate provides cost intelligence and supply chain solutions that mitigate risks and optimize total cost of production. It also offers key insights into customer’s cost-saving opportunities by analyzing spend and cost data obtained from millions of transactions across thousands of services, materials and equipment categories in the energy industry. With its wide range of proprietary data, it enables various companies to bring transparency in the market and ensure that capital is utilized efficiently.As Verisk draws on unique data sets to provide predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers, it is expected to benefit immensely from this acquisition. The company, with its decision support solutions, has facilitated its customers to take informed decisions with greater precision, efficiency and discipline about various risks involved in business. This buyout will bring more enterprises in the energy sector within Verisk’s reach by incorporating PowerAdvocate’s spend data and cost models.The deal will add to Verisk’s existing pool of customers, giving it greater access to the global markets. Verisk, with PowerAdvocate’s proprietary data set encompassing $2.7 trillion of spending data and machine-learned methods, will provide customers unique insight to increase profitability. Verisk’s revenues are likely to increase significantly as a result of this acquisition, providing greater market strength.In order to create long-term value for its clients, Verisk has extended its scalable data and analytic solutions by steadily putting resources into overseas markets. The scalability of its products has further led to highly cash-generative businesses characterized by high net margins and relatively low capital intensity. Verisk has outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 14.3% compared with a gain of 4.6% for the latter.Moreover, Verisk aims at creating long-term value through organic growth and better returns on invested capital. The company continuously seeks to expand its portfolio by leveraging its deep knowledge and embedded position to develop new, proprietary data sets and predictive analytics by working with its customers to understand their evolving needs. Verisk recorded an average organic revenue growth of about 8% over the past 10 years.However, Verisk is susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches in its facilities, computer networks and databases, resulting in a loss of its credibility and/or customers. Data theft and misuse by third-party contractors could also lead to loss of businesses and pose a significant threat.
