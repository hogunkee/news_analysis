3,SIVB,"Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) led four top stocks pulling back to their 50-day moving averages on Friday. A strong rebound from that key technical level can offer a chance to add shares to your position. But with the Nasdaq composite and other leading stock market averages tumbling Monday on trade war fears, Apple stock and Nvidia stock plunged below that key support level. Nvidia also sold off below its buy point. Financial stocks E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and SVB Financial (SIVB), well extended from their last buy zones, also undercut their 50-day lines.XWhile Apple stock is clearly the most popular name in the group, it lags with a Composite Rating of 84 out of 99. E-Trade leads the group with a 99, and is closely followed by SVB with a 98 and Nvidia with a 97. Top stocks typically have strong Composite Ratings when they launch big moves.When looking for stocks to buy, in addition to strong technical action, it's important to look for top fundamentals. The Composite Rating combines factors such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and price performance.Apple stock is back below a three-weeks-tight buy point of 190.47 as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. Shares are back in buy range from a double-bottom entry at 179.04, closing Friday at 184.92. Apple stock fell 1.5% to 182.17 in Monday's stock market trading, below its 50-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA 10-week-line pullback represents an add-on buying opportunity when the moving average is above a buy point. However, you want to ensure that the stock is finding support at this level, rather than losing it. You also want to buy as close as you can to a rebound off the line is sound strategy.It's key to remember that a rebound off the 10-week line represents a chance to add shares to an existing position, rather than initiate a new one.A stock falling through its 50-day line, especially in high volume, is not good action. Investors should examine their portfolios and consider sell rules.As for investors on the sidelines, look to see if these stocks rebound by the end of the week. A brief foray below the 50-day line, by itself, is OK. But you should wait for a strong rebound.Nvidia stock was 5% from a double-bottom entry at 239.35 on Friday even as it pulled back toward its 10-week line. But keep in mind that Nvidia's base is later stage whereas Apple's double-bottom is an early-stage base. Later-stage bases can work, but they have a higher chance of failing since they form after a stock has already been on a big run.Nvidia tumbled 4.7% to 239.12 on Monday, knifing below its 50-day line and the 239.35 entry in above-average volume. The stock has now roundtripped a 12% gain from the buy point, a strong sell signal.E-Trade stock is finding support at the 10-week line after trading in a relatively tight range over the past several weeks. Shares closed Friday 16% extended from a late-stage consolidation first cleared on March 9.This represents the stock's first pullback to the 10-day line above the buy point. Investors can add shares to their positions at the first two pullbacks, but after that — without the formation of a new base — the stock would be considered too extended.E-Trade stock fell 3.4% Monday, below its 50-day line.Lastly, SVB Financial stock is pulling back to its 10-week line too. After a breakout from a cup-with-handle in late April, shares ended last week 14% above the 271.89 buy point.

6,SIVB,"Have you noticed how some top growth stocks seem to make the IBD 50 week in, week out? Or, after taking a brief vacation outside the list, some of these market leaders knock on the IBD 50's door, saying ""I'm home""?One reason for that: high-quality growth in quarterly sales and earnings. Consider Adobe Systems (ADBE). What is high quality? How about the digital imaging and marketing company growing earnings per share 48%, 39%, 45%, 42%, 44%, 47%, 40% and 65% in the past eight quarters?A second reason: strong price-and-volume action. Adobe's relative strength line, a gauge of performance vs. the S&P 500, climbs higher over the long term. That RS line doesn't show a big break in its upward trend, especially on a weekly chart.Want a third reason? High relative industry group strength. Adobe helps fulfill the L in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The ""L"" stands for leader, not laggard.Stocks showing excellence across the broad industry sector or specific industry group tend to do much better than stocks that belong to an industry group that's merely bumbling along. No wonder, then, that the IBD 50 tends to have a tilt toward the strongest sectors over the past three to 12 months.So an experienced stock picker will not be surprised to find that the computer, finance, medical and consumer-oriented sectors occupy the biggest tracts of real estate within the IBD 50.As of Thursday, the computer and finance sectors held the highest number of slots in the IBD 50, with nine stocks each. The related bank sector had one member, SVB Financial (SIVB). Medical was third with seven.Grubhub (GRUB) shows how some special stocks in the current market uptrend seem to straddle two or more sectors at the same time.You don't call Chicago-based Grubhub on the phone and ask them to order pizza or sushi on your behalf. Grubhub is an internet and mobile-based platform. It brings restaurants ever closer to customers. This business model is not exactly new, but the managers are executing growth with the precision of an all-star slugger.Trade Desk (TTD) hails from the business services sector. As of Thursday, it ranked No. 4 among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables. The sector has advanced 11% since Jan. 1. Trade Desk is up 82% year to date. Why? Here again, fundamentals matter.The Ventura, Calif.-based company has created a self-service platform in which ad buyers and agencies can efficiently select when and where to place their ads. The goal: maximize return on investment. Judging by Trade Desk's sales, its ""omnichannel"" and ""programmatic"" features are attracting more advertising dollars and bigger corporate customers.Trade Desk's sales grew 61% in the first quarter to $85.7 million. In Q4 last year, the top line bulged 42% and hit the $100 million mark for the first time. Sales rose on average 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters.That kind of sales growth tends to lead to fantastic bottom-line growth. Trade Desk, which in some respects can be seen as an internet sector play, is no exception.

12,SIVB,"Five financials within striking distance of buy points are your top stocks to watch this week: Square (SQ), PayPal (PYPL), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and SVB Financial (SIVB).E-Trade and SVB Financial lead the group of financial sector names with the highest-possible IBD Composite Rating, a 99. TD Ameritrade and PayPal each earn a 96, while Square has a 94. The Composite Rating combines a variety of fundamental and technical metrics, like earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. IBD's research shows many top stocks have high Composite Ratings when they make big moves.Square is just extended from a cup buy point of 58.56. Even though a handle with a slightly earlier entry shows up on a daily chart, it isn't long enough and is not present on a weekly chart. With Square only slightly above the 5% buy range from the cup, it could pull back to a buyable level as many leaders do. If you're looking to buy, make sure that pullback is gentle. Square stock fell 0.8% to 61.29 on Monday.Payment processing peer PayPal is right at a double-bottom entry at 84.09. PayPal initially cleared that level on June 4, but lost 2.3% Thursday amid the Nasdaq's distribution day. But the decline for PayPal came in light volume. Shares reclaimed the entry on Friday, but dipped 0.5% to 83.89 Monday, back below the buy zone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOnline broker TD Ameritrade, which is a member of the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks, is hovering just below a buy point. After retaking the 50-day line June 1, shares are near a flat-base entry of 63.11. TD Ameritrade pulled back 1.25% to 61.53 on Monday.And E-Trade, another online brokerage, is well extended from a flat base first cleared in March, but it could soon provide an opportunity for existing shareholders to add to their positions. The IBD 50 stock is working on a four-weeks-tight buy point at 66.17, highlighted in aqua on a weekly chart in MarketSmith. E-Trade retreated 1.4% to 64.48 on Monday. With the three- and four-weeks-tight patterns, you want to buy as close to the buy point as possible.SVB Financial is an IBD 50 member as well. And like E-Trade, SVB is working on a four-weeks-tight pattern too. The entry point is 328.01, but SVB stock slid 1.4% to 321.11 on Monday. SVB Financial is the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, which is a lender to notable tech companies. It saw earnings surge 90% last quarter.All of these top stocks have relative strength lines that have been moving more or less sideways at or near record highs.

13,SIVB,"Through May 31, the S&P 500 was up 1.3% year to date. Not a savory number for index investors. The Nasdaq composite rose 7.8%. And the IBD 50 gained 5.1%.While the list of premier growth companies has outperformed the large-cap benchmark by nearly fourfold, have some of the individual names done even better? You bet.Use the IBD 50 as a timesaving screen for picking great stocks at the right time. You know that making the IBD 50 means a company has top-notch fundamentals and wonderful relative strength. But the IBD 50 remains a watch list, not a buy list.What does this mean? Let the chart analysis at the bottom of every mini chart in IBD Weekly be your compass. If a stock is breaking out and in the permissible buy range, the analysis will say so. If not, then stay alert for follow-on buy points.Such additional entry points may include first and second rebounds off the 10-week moving average. Or a stock may thrust out of a three-weeks-tight pattern.Let's consider Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), SVB Financial (SIVB), Trade Desk (TTD) and TAL Education (TAL). All five made the IBD 50 during the week of Feb. 26. February was a pivotal month in 2018 so far; the S&P 500 suffered its first 10%-plus correction since February of 2016. Yet these five companies flexed strength.They also help teach stock traders the importance of being nimble.Viper Energy finished the week ended Feb. 23 with a tiny gain, up 0.3%. That trailed a 0.5% rebound by the S&P 500. Then the U.S. oil and gas play fell for three weeks in a row.On the surface that sounds bad, right?Well, not necessarily. This is where careful analysis of Viper's weekly chart comes into play. While the stock did fall three weeks in a row, it limited the overall decline to 3.2% — skimpy and stingy losses.Check out the week ended March 16. Viper bounded off its lows of the week and cut the loss to just 0.4%. It was a tight weekly close. Tight weekly closes within a base matter. Viper had a lot of them. Treat them as a subtle clue that institutional investors are not that willing to dump shares.The Midland, Texas-based firm uncoiled out of its base with a breakout past 26.29 on April 5. Volume wasn't hissing quietly; 1.3 million shares exchanged hands, 219% above the 50-day average. Big price move, big volume on the breakout? Good results usually follow.Viper is now trading near 32, up 22% past the proper entry.Intuitive Surgical, noted as a ""stock of the day"" in IBD's social media coverage, hit a new high of 452 on Jan. 25, then began falling a few days before the major indexes did. Shares basically floated within a relatively tight trading range of 400 to 450.But on April 18, the stock's character changed. After reporting strong Q1 results (earnings up 43%, revenue up 25%, the biggest top-line jump in more than four years), Intuitive jammed out of an 11-week base. Both 452.10 and 445.20 are valid entry points.The robotic surgery systems pioneer has not gained a lot since then. But at 459, the medical stock leader has stretched its advance from an early breakout at 242.49 in February 2017 to 89%.SVB Financial, TAL and Trade Desk have also cleared new bases in recent weeks and are spanking the S&P 500 with year-to-date returns of 33%, 43% and 87%.You can trade the IBD 50 efficiently with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) by Innovator Capital.

After the close, the House voted to ease some post-crisis restrictions on the financial industry.XThe bill, which waters down some Dodd-Frank curbs put in place after the financial crisis a decade ago, will largely help smaller banks.

Democrats warn that lifting the restrictions could lead to a repeat of the risky behavior that got banks into trouble a decade ago.Separately, regulators are reportedly considering changes to the Volcker Rule that would remove some curbs on short-term trading.SunTrust rose 1.2% to 69.59 on the stock market today.

22,SIVB,"Blue-chip banks JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among gainers on the Dow Jones industrial average Tuesday as President Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.Overall, big banks have been lagging, but smaller regional players have outperformed lately as interest rates have hit multiyear highs and are expected to keep rising. The 10-year Treasury yield on April 25 hit 3% for the first time since 2014, reflecting expectations that the Fed may raise interest rates four times this year.Banks' profit margins tend to increase when rates rise. But concerns about the flattening Treasury yield curve, which is at its flattest levels since before the 2007 recession, have pressured the big banks' stocks.Banks ranked No. 15 Tuesday out of the 33 sectors tracked by IBD.

24,SIVB,"Shares of Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are sliding Thursday on continued interest rates concerns. The 10-year Treasury yield edged down while spread between that long-term rate and the 2-year yield remains narrow.Even as the Treasury yield recently hit a four-year high of 3.02%, most bank stocks didn't rally because short-term yields continued to gradually close the gap. A narrower yield spread weighs on net interest margins for banks, and the Treasury yield curve is now at its flattest levels since the period just before the Great Recession.On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.95%, but off intraday lows. The 2-year yield edged down to 2.48%.As expected, the Fed did not unveil any new rate hikes on Wednesday, which was not enough to lift stocks for long.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The Dow Jones industrial average had a fractional loss, but closed near session highs. The Russell 2000 ended 0.1% lower.

But Amazon earnings of $3.27 per share obliterated analyst estimates for $1.26.  Amazon Web Services, the internet giant's huge cloud-computing unit, continues to boom and account for a clear majority of operating profit. The company is upbeat about the current quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon also said it would raise the annual cost of its Prime membership program by 20% to $119, from $99. Amazon recently disclosed that it has more than 100 million Prime members, who get free two-day shipping and many other benefits.The stock leapt 7.1% to 1,626 before the open on the stock market today. That would be a new high and push Amazon above a 1,617.64 buy point from a cup base. Amazon at first glance has a handle, which would offer a lower entry. But a cup-with-handle base must be seven weeks long, and Amazon has not quite consolidated long enough.Keep in mind that Amazon is in a very late-stage base. Late-stage bases can work but are less likely to be big winners and more likely to fail.Amazon rose 4% to 1,517.96 on Thursday, back above its 50-day line.Intel EPS leapt 32% to 87 cents as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant also guided higher for the current quarter, with sales up 10%. That would be the third straight quarter of accelerating top-line growth.Intel vaulted 5.75% to 56.10 in premarket trading. That indicates Intel will easily reclaim a 53.88 flat-base buy point briefly claimed last week.Microsoft revenue rose 16% to $26.8 billion as earnings swelled 36% to 95 cents a share in its fiscal third quarter. Like Amazon, Microsoft is benefiting from cloud-computing offerings. The Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes server and Azure cloud infrastructure services, saw revenue pop 17% to $7.9 billion.Microsoft shares initially fell before turning up late Thursday. Early Friday, the stock rose 3.3% to 97.35. That would put Microsoft just above a 97.34 flat-base entry.Nasdaq-listed SVB Financial earned $3.63 a share, up 90% vs. a year earlier and 50 cents above views. Revenue swelled 34% to 575 million, also comfortably beating analyst estimates.The IBD 50 stock was not yet active early Friday but leapt 6.85% to 275 in late trade.

29,SIVB,"Amazon (AMZN) has a history of choppy profits, but late Thursday the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant delivered yet another quarter of accelerating earnings growth and revenue gains. IBD 50 stocks SVB Financial (SIVB), Twitter (TWTR), Mastercard (MA), SolarEdge Technolgies (SEDG) and Illumina (ILMN) also boast at least two quarters of faster sales and earnings growth.Amazon is not an IBD 50 stock but it already boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary IBD ratings into a single score. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their big runs. SVB Financial and SolarEdge Technologies also have 99 Composite Ratings. Twitter and Mastercard have 98 CRs while Illumina boasts a 97 CR.Accelerating earnings growth is an extremely bullish trait. Ultimately earnings drive stock gains. Faster profit gains show that a company has real momentum. The faster sales growth suggests real demand, not just cost-cutting or accounting games.Amazon reported earnings per share of $3.27, more than double analyst forecasts. Year-over-year, EPS rose 121%. That was the third straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth after 40% in Q4 2017, 0% in Q3 and -78% in Q2.

Looking to Q2, analysts see a massive 485% EPS gain.Of course, Amazon could have had solid, consistent profit growth years ago, but CEO Jeff Bezos focused on efforts to boost sales and market share. That's paying off. After recently revealing that Prime memberships have topped 100 million worldwide, Amazon said Thursday that it will hike its Prime fee $119 a year.Amazon stock shot up to a record 1,638.10 Friday morning, but faded to 1,572.62. Intraday, Amazon cleared a 1,617.64 cup base buy point but closed below that level. It did settle above an alternate entry from a 1,568.62 flawed cup-with-handle pattern. But investors probably should wait for the stock to move back above Friday's high as a buying opportunity.Keep in mind that Amazon is in a very late-stage base, after several big moves in recent years. Late-stage breakouts are less likely to be big winners and more likely to fail outright.Amazon fell 0.4% to 1,566.13 on the stock market today.The social network early Wednesday reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents a share, up 129% vs. a year earlier. Twitter's earnings growth has accelerated for 5 straight quarters, from -31% to -22% to 0% to 11% to 73% to 129%.Revenue rose 21% vs. a year earlier to $655 million. It was the best sales gain in two years, and the fourth straight quarter of improving year-over-year changes.Twitter shares shot up before Wednesday's open, but the stock quickly fell sharply in the regular session after CEO Jack Dorsey warned that growth would likely slow later in the year.The stock fell 9% last week to 29, well below its 50-day line as it works on a consolidation.Twitter rose 4.5% to 30.31 on Monday on a new content and advertising deal with Walt Disney (DIS).SVB Financial, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, late Thursday reported 90% earnings growth as revenue leapt 34% to $575 million. The $3.63 EPS was 50 cents above estimates while revenue was $39 million over views.SVB Financial's earnings and revenue growth have accelerated for five straight quarters. Silicon Valley Bank's parent also raised full-year guidance, citing faster growth in loan and deposit balances and net interest income.Unlike Amazon or Twitter, SVB Financial did not pare or reverse its initial post-earnings gains. The stock shot up 19% to 305.61 on Friday, gapping beyond a seven-week cup base entry of 271.89, MarketSmith analysis shows.Because SVB Financial opened at 300, more than 5% past the standard entry, that's a breakaway gap. A breakaway gap opening price is an alternative entry point.SVB sank 2% to 299.61 Monday.The credit and debit card giant has reported two straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth and three quarters of faster sales growth, with year-over-year gains 33% and 20%, respectively.Mastercard's streak may be coming to an end. The card giant reports May 2. Analysts expect EPS to jump 25% to $1.26 on revenue up 18% to $3.25 billion, which would be strong but decelerating growth.Shares of Mastercard are trading within a flat base with a 183.83 buy point. The stock closed Friday 175.94.Mastercard rose 1.3% to 178.14, back above its 50-day line.Mastercard rival Visa (V,) also an IBD 50 stock, reported better-than-expected earnings last week, with EPS and revenue growth accelerating from the prior quarter.Visa cleared a 125.54 flat-base buy point on Thursday, closing Friday at 126.01. Visa rose 0.7% to 126.91 on Monday.For Visa and Mastercard, recent trading history suggests that pullbacks to the 50-day or 200-day lines are better entries than traditional buy points from breakouts.Illumina has enjoyed four straight quarters of improving year-over-year earnings growth, trending from -11% to a 127% gain reported last week. Revenue growth has sped up for four quarters as well, from 5% to 31%.Shares initially fell on Illumina's earnings, but rallied to close the week at 244.47, above their 50-day line.

Start NowBank of America, Visa, Morgan Stanley, American Express and SVB Financial all are in second-stage bases. First- and second-stage bases are more likely to be big winners and less likely to fail than late-stage patterns, though it's no guarantee.All but American Express are showing strong relative strength lines, which track stocks' performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Keep in mind that bank stocks tend to track the S&P 500 index over time, as their flattish RS lines indicate. But with interest rates trending higher, rate-sensitive financials may outperform.Bank of America rose 1.6% to 32.13 in Monday's stock market trading, finding 50-day line support for a second straight session. The stock is 2% below a 32.77 buy point. The stock twice hit or topped that level last week, but reversed lower in both sessions, meaning the flat base was still valid as of Friday's close. BofA's RS line is holding at highs and has been trending gradually higher over the last six months.Bank of America has had two straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth.Visa rose 0.9% to 121.88 in Monday's trading, continuing to find 50-day-line support. Visa is working on a 127.98 buy point, though an aggressive trader could look at 125.40 as an alternative, early entry.Visa's RS line is near a record high.The Dow Jones component does not benefit from higher interest rates, unlike the other financials on this list, including fellow Dow Jones card giant American Express. That's because Visa does not carry the balances on Visa-branded cards, but makes money on transaction fees.IBD'S TAKE: Flat bases require a minimum of five weeks and typically the stock's decline is no more than 15% from the high to low of the consolidation.

58,SIVB,"Morgan Stanley rose 1.4% to 55.49 on Monday, working on a 58.15 buy point. Aggressive investors could eye 57.92 as an alternative buy point, but there's little difference in the price. Morgan Stanley also has found 50-day-line support.The RS line has made glacial gains since last April.Morgan Stanley's pure-play investment bank peer, Goldman Sachs (GS), retook its 50-day line Monday within its own flat base. But Goldman's trading woes over the past year have hurt growth, and its RS line has not made much headway over the past year.American Express climbed 1.1% to 96.66. It's working on a 102.48 buy point. American Express needs to reclaim its 50-day moving average first.The RS line rose from the end of May to early December but since then has lagged. However, if the stock does break out there's a good chance that the RS line will at least clear a short-term high.SVB Financial rallied 1.7% to 260.12, about 1% below a 263.19 buy point. The RS line is already at a new high and has generally been rising for the past six months.SVB owns Silicon Valley Bank and other subsidiaries. It offers commercial and private banking, wealth and asset management, and brokerage services.Some 27 top mutual funds bought SVB Financial shares in the last three months.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Extend Rebound, But For How Long?

61,SIVB,"The major indexes enjoyed a slow yet steady afternoon rebound but still closed mildly lower on Thursday. Some commodity stocks and cyclical plays paced the upside, including ship transport, logistics, coal and homebuilding. Preliminary volume figures were mixed as traders fret over how the U.S. and China will handle two-day talks on trade.Inside the IBD 50, small-cap energy play Warrior Met Coal (HCC) gapped up at the open. At one point the energy play rallied to an all-time high of 26.93, briefly surpassing a 26.53 buy point within a nearly nine-week cup without handle.Meanwhile, as Apple (AAPL) tiptoed closer to a potential new breakout, an emerging group of new leaders powered past their own buy points and sharply outperformed the market. They included Marathon Oil (MRO) (up 6% in double average volume) and Tableau Software (DATA) (up nearly 7% in more than four times usual turnover).The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a tiny gain of 5 points as it notched a positive reversal. Dow components Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM) were the only two out of 30 names to rise 1 point or more.Ninety minutes into Thursday's session, the blue chip index slid as much as 1.6% before slowly climbing higher the rest of the way.The Dow industrials poked below its long-term 200-day moving average for the second time since April 2. That's evidence of a new shakeout taking place.At 23,930, the Dow industrials still stands nearly 10% off its peak, despite the fact that IBD's current outlook for the market holds at ""Uptrend under pressure.""The S&P 500 also slid below the long-term 200-day moving average but turned a loss of more than 1.4% to just a 0.2% dip, another bullish sign. Still, watch to see if the large-cap benchmark tries in future trading sessions to mark another close below the 200-day line.The Nasdaq composite was off less than 0.2% after having fallen as much as 1.5%. The premier index of growth companies continues to test buying support near the 7000 level.Volume ran sharply higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday and slipped lower on the NYSE, according to early data.The Russell 2000 and the Dow transports both fell 0.5%. The Russell 1000, a popular small-cap gauge, is clinging to a tiny year-to-date gain.Marathon Oil rallied more than 6% at one point and got as high as 19.51 before cooling off some. The stock easily surpassed an 18.76 buy point in a 13-week cup with handle. The 5% buy zone extends up to 19.70.Marathon is an integrated oil and gas firm. The large-cap firm from Houston posted earnings of 18 cents a share in Q1, reversing a 13-cent net loss in the year-ago quarter. Sales boomed 62% to $1.73 billion.Marathon is not the only company with strong relative performance and good IBD ratings, as seen in IBD's stock quotes and in the Stock Checkup tool. Ecopetrol (EC), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Italy's Eni Spa (E) all hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher.While oil and gas explorers slumped, integrated firms such as Marathon Oil advanced smartly as the rally in crude oil futures show no signs of abating. U.S. WTI near-term futures bounced from a nearly 0.7% loss to finish up and well above $68 a barrel.WTI crude is now up more than 13% year to date. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2627, is down nearly 1.7% since Jan. 1. The 500 ran up 19.4% in 2017.Tableau, meanwhile, gapped out of a base-on-base pattern at 87.70, rising more than 7% to 91.30 in quadruple normal volume.Tableau is a Big Data analytics software expert. The Seattle-based firm notched its fourth quarter in a row of solid earnings per share. Revenue climbed 23% to $246.2 million, the biggest jump in five quarters.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Tableau's so-so 68 Composite Rating belies a strong 89 RS Rating, meaning the company is outperforming 89% of all publicly traded firms in IBD's database over the past 12 months. Given Thursday's strong advance, watch to see if Tableau's ratings edge higher.Going back to Apple, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan acted stingy in giving back Wednesday's strong gain, a good sign for the bulls. The stock initially fell more than 1% to 174.63 in brisk trade. Then it wiped out those modest losses to end 0.2% higher to 176.89.The megacap tech is possibly forming the right side of a shallow seven-week double-bottom base. The middle peak between the base's  two lows is 178.94. Hence, a new buy point would be 179.04, 10 cents above that middle peak. The decline within the base is very light at 12.5%.Apple is still trading near all-time highs, another bullish sign. At $897 billion, it's the largest company by market value on the U.S. financial markets. In IBD Stock Checkup, the Cupertino, Calif., firm shows decent ratings such as an 85 for EPS (Earnings Per Share) and 86 for Relative Price Strength.Earlier this week the iPhone giant reported a 30% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings to $2.73 a share, the biggest jump in 10 quarters, as revenue grew 16%, marking a sixth quarter in a row of top-line acceleration.Apple's revenue slumped 9% during the fiscal fourth quarter of FY 2016, then rose 3%, 5%, 7%, 12% and 13% in the next five quarters.The Street expects Apple's earnings turnaround to keep shining brightly. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect profit to climb 30% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter to $2.17 a share.Despite the nifty reversal by the major indexes, investors also seem to show nervousness on the outcome of two-day trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and other key players arrived in the Middle Kingdom on Thursday for talks later in the day and Friday.Bloomberg reported a senior Chinese government official as saying that China will refuse any U.S. preconditions for negotiations, such as narrowing the bilateral trade gap.On Friday, a number of top Federal Reserve officials and regional bank presidents are slated to speak, including William Dudley, John Williams, and Esther George. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank kept short-term interest rates unchanged. The fed funds rate that's charged on overnight cash infusions to major lenders currently hovers at a 1.5%-1.75% target range.CME futures see a nearly 45% probability that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate three more times to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, slightly down from recent days. Numerous money center banks, Wall Street investment giants and regional lenders have recently been hit with intense selling.Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) have either sliced below or came close to touching their 200-day moving averages. But some fast-growing banks, such as Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and SVB Financial (SIVB), have been holding up much more firmly.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on leading stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside The Big Picture?

74,SIVB,"Look out, index huggers! The stock market is shifting in a direction that favors active managers and stock pickers, says T. Rowe Price fund manager Ann Holcomb. That should boost prospects for the stock mutual funds she helps run, whose portfolio holdings include leading stocks like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Red Hat (RHT) and Mastercard (MA). Two of her funds have already done well in a variety of past markets, having outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that four-for-four feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.The market is rotating to the benefit of active managers and stock pickers because of heightened volatility, says Holcomb, one of three managers of $635 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) and its institutional clone, $654 million Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX).Holcomb's funds bear an additional distinction. While Holcomb and her co-managers Jason Polun and Tom Watson oversee the portfolios and keep their eyes on the big picture, T. Rowe Price lets a team of some 30 analysts make buy and sell decisions for the fund. Each analyst runs his or her own sleeve, or segment, of the portfolio. It's like a professional sports team. Coaches oversee the team, but it's the players who score and play defense. Delegating that much responsibility to analysts is rare in the stock mutual fund world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHolcomb, who is 46 years old, discussed the funds' investment approach with IBD from her office in Baltimore, Md.IBD: How does the market environment impact Capital Opportunity?Holcomb: We've had years of low volatility, high correlations (among stock performances) and compressed dispersion. That's challenging for stock pickers. There's no extra reward for good stock picking if all stocks move together.But now, volatility is increasing and correlations are going down. That should continue as interest rates rise. That helps active managers in addition to stock pickers. They're the ones who can take advantage of mispricing vs. underlying stock values that our analysts discover.IBD: Why do rising rates cause that dispersion?Holcomb: They're not necessarily the cause, but they help. Companies that have been supported by free or low-cost money now get (somewhat) taken out of the market. High quality companies take market share.IBD: Your two funds are the only T. Rowe Price portfolios that let analysts make buy-sell decisions. Why use that approach? Is it because 30 minds are better than three?Holcomb: It was the idea of our current CEO, Bill Stromberg, when he became director of research in the late 1990s. Our analysts are experts. Bill wanted to showcase their stock picking by having them manage a portfolio within a risk-controlled framework. We limit how much their industry and sector weights deviate from the S&P 500.IBD: What's left for you portfolio managers to do?Holcomb: We have what we call an oversight committee. It consists of the named PMs and portfolio specialist Jennifer Martin. We decide which analysts join the team. We also look at how much of the S&P each analyst covers.We monitor the overall profile of the portfolio daily. This comes in the form of risk monitoring, looking at components of active risk, any tilts that develop in terms of looking more growthy or valuey. We're also analyzing the analysts' performance.We're also ensuring that there is consistency between their positioning in this portfolio and what they advocate (for other funds). We engage with our large, institutional clients as well.Also, we manage a monthly rebalancing process in which any positions that are outside our risk limits are brought back in line.IBD: Intuitive Surgical has been volatile since November. But it's in a long uptrend. What's driving that?Holcomb: Its fundamentals continue to improve. Analysts have raised their estimates. When companies deliver like that, sometimes it takes time for the market to catch up.We've had a big position for some time. Our analyst Jon Wood has a very favorable view. It's a bet on computer assisted robotic surgery, a bet that it becomes more mainstream. It's been adopted in urology and gynecology. Our analyst sees it being used more in general surgery.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Intuitive Surgical hit a record high after reporting first-quarter results.IBD: The fund has trimmed its exposure to Red Hat. Do you still like it?Holcomb: Red Hat is the prime beneficiary of the increased use of open source software, driven by cloud computing. They have leadership in Linux. So Red Hat has a strong core, which is successfully expanding into cloud software.Analysts change their positioning for many reasons.... (In trimming the position in) Red Hat, which remains overweight in the fund relative to its weight in the S&P 500, analyst Ken Allen used it as a source of funds to reduce his underweight in Oracle (ORCL) (due to) the analyst's view that its prospects are improving.IBD: You hold Mastercard as well as Visa (V). Do you like one more than the other?Holcomb: They are largely doing the same thing. Looking at Mastercard, our analyst Jon Friar sees it as a sustainable mid- to high-teens earnings per share grower. Both companies benefit from the movement of payments from cash and checks to electronic. They have high incremental margins, pricing power and strong free cash flow conversion.With regard to Mastercard, they have a willingness to invest in next generation products, such as their acquisition (last year) of (U.K.-based payments technology company) Vocalink.Mastercard has a very attractive business model, with high barriers to entry.IBD: Why has the fund trimmed its stake in PayPal (PYPL)?Holcomb: Our analysts prioritize within their own sleeves. Our PayPal thesis has been that it can materially outperform due to monetizing their Venmo asset, or using their balance sheet to buy back shares or for some accretive M&A or if they have some core business surprises.Our trim in PayPal was because its valuation was not as attractive as some other names. We used it as a source of funds for those more attractive names. But, long-term, we see some PayPal characteristics that can still be in play, so it's still in the portfolio.IBD: Earnings per share growth in SVB Financial (SIVB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What's your thesis for this stock?Holcomb: Generally, SVB does well heading into a Federal Reserve (money) tightening cycle like the one we're in, and the market has not fully valued its deposits strength. We're looking at the potential for it paying a dividend. Usually, paying a dividend opens your investor base. So we started a position in March.IBD: Which do you prefer with S&P Global — its index business or its ratings business?Holcomb: It does have a lot of businesses. It is a compounder. It should grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace. It should improve its margins through cost cutting and price increases.Its ratings business has a market-leading share. And it is returning capital to shareholders.Also, its tax rate fell with implementation of tax reform.After the financial crisis, regulation of its space increased, but that just made it more difficult for competitors to get into their business, deepening the moat around their business.Like PayPal, Red Hat and Mastercard, S&P Global is a leader that is pulling further ahead of rivals.They're also shifting to a recurring revenue model, which makes their financials less lumpy and can lift their valuation. About 75% of their revenue is recurring vs. less than 60% five years ago.IBD: What's your thesis for Salesforce.com (CRM)?Holcomb: It pioneered SaaS (software as a service) applications. It remains by far the biggest company in that market. It benefits from a large ecosystem of software, hardware and IT services partners to make its products more valuable and make its market position even larger. And they're another company with a recurring revenues model.IBD: How does Diamondback Energy (FANG) fit into a growth portfolio?Holcomb: Well, we're a core portfolio with exposure to all S&P 500 sectors, including energy. Diamondback is one of the leading operations in the Permian Basin, where they've got a lot of low-cost acreage and can grow production faster with better results than a lot of competitors.They have low financial leverage, and their execution over the last several quarters has been excellent.IBD: Give me an example please of a play that is not part of the S&P 500.Holcomb: Worldpay (WP) is one. They're a combination of merchant acquirer and payments processor. This was Vantiv (until its takeover of Worldpay early this year). It has the best collection of assets among public merchant acquirers, and should grow earnings per share at a mid-double-digit pace for an extended time.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THESE:Want To Be A Millionaire?

That left the index down 0.3% for the week through Thursday, after diving as much as 3.3% to a mid-session low on Wednesday.The message — it's a volatile market — is reflected in IBD's current Market Pulse market status indicator.Preliminary first-quarter GDP growth estimates from the Commerce Department were positive, with growth of 2.3% coming in below the fourth-quarter's 2.9% advance, but outpacing economist projections for a slowdown to 2% growth.

Several top-rated stocks, meanwhile, continue to hold above or close to recent buy points.While Broadcom (AVGO) is receiving tons of media attention on news that President Trump ordered to block a potential megamerger with Qualcomm (QCOM), industry-mate Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has quietly broken out of a 15-week double-bottom base that features a 124.54 buy point.In a good double bottom, the second sell-off must undercut the first initial decline. Monolithic certainly did that: The base's second low of 103.14 went below the first low of 105.01.The stock found solid support at the 200-day moving average, and the base features symmetry.

For starters, the nine-week pattern has elements of a double bottom. Yet the stock has a volatile streak, so the jagged price action can generally be treated as a cup.Second, as seen only on a daily chart, it formed a tight handle, starting with a down day on Feb. 28. That produced a 20.42 entry, a dime above the handle's intraday high. Volume on the breakout from that early buy point was light.San Diego-based Halozyme specializes in recombinant human enzymes for the drug delivery, encrinology and oncology fields of medicine. It turned profitable in recent quarters. The small-cap firm posted earnings of 2 cents and 85 cents a share in Q3 and Q4 last year, respectively.The Dow Jones transportation average outperformed on Tuesday, rising 0.5%. Airlines gave the sector index a nice push up. Ryanair (RYAAY) is building a cup base that appears to have made two handles.

86,SIVB,"Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) saw a positive improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Tuesday, rising from 66 to 72. X IBD's proprietary RS Rating tracks market leadership by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the best stocks tend to have an RS Rating of over 80 in the early stages of their moves.

Also keep in mind that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. The company posted 14% EPS growth last quarter, while sales growth came in at 21%. The company earns the No. 4 rank among its peers in the Banks-Super Regional industry group.

91,SIVB,"U.S. stock indexes rushed in opposite directions midday Wednesday, as blue chips and banks showed strength while the Nasdaq staggered lower.X At 12 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average pegged a 0.2% gain, while the S & P 500 inched down 0.2%. The Nasdaq fell 1.3%, pulled down by the Philadelphia semiconductor index's more than 4% loss.Small caps surged with the Russell 2000 adding 0.5%.Volume in the stock market today was running sharply higher on both major exchanges.Blue chips were mostly up. In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, financials led. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) popped 2.5%. Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.9%. American Express (AXP) grabbed a 1.5% gain, but Visa (V) dived 3.5%.American Express is bouncing off its 10-week moving average line, while Visa is testing its 50-day line.Bank stocks were up midday Wednesday after rising Tuesday on the testimony of Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve nominee for chief. Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that  he favors easing bank regulations. Powell's confirmation hearing was smooth, disturbing neither senators nor Wall Street.Among the bank sector, stocks notching 52-week highs included JPMorgan; Morgan Stanley (MS), up 2.5%; Bank of America (BAC), up 3%; SVB Financial (SIVB), up 2.5%; Comerica (CMA), up 4%; and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), up 4%. Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) is closing in on a 76.24 buy point but cleared an alternative entry at 74.95 in strong volume this morning.Two additional bank-stock breakouts included Northern Trust (NTRS), up 2.5%; and SunTrust Banks (STI), up 4%.A convergence of factors appear to be favoring some sectors at the expense of others. Tech is suffering but other areas are rising. In Tuesday's new highs list, the building sector delivered 29 new highs; banks, 27; and finance, 22. Chips only accounted for two new highs.Factors influencing the strong side of the stock market include: Trump's choice to head the Fed, who is finding favor; the Republican tax-cut package which won tentative but positive remarks from maverick Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine; and recent economic data, including a 17-year high for consumer confidence.Before the open Wednesday, the bulls received additional good news. The second reading on Q3 GDP rolled in at 3.3%, up from the initial reading of 3%. While this only matched the consensus estimate, the growth was encouraging and signaled no trouble in the economy.Besides the gains in bank stocks, the retail sector also surged in midday action. Retail industry groups accounted for a slew of the day's top performers. Some of the retail stocks are comeback stories. Urban Outfitters (URBN), a former leading stock that has been struggling for more than two years, is on track for its 11th daily gain in a row.

92,SIVB,"The freight train that is the stock market kept on chugging ahead in October, with the S&P 500 tacking on a 2.33% gain to make it 12 straight months of growth, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds jumped on board, advancing 1.70% on average, the 14th monthly gain in the past 15 months.XThe broad market got a lift from such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), 3M (MMM) and Intel (INTC).The October gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, increased odds of corporate tax reform with a possible lowering of the corporate tax rate, and increased likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising its short-term interest rate in the near term, said Jonathan Edwards, a manager of Invesco Value Opportunities Fund (VVOAX). The $839 million fund's 1.64% gain in October topped 69% of its large-cap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.In addition, for the most part corporate earnings have been OK, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He added that a few individual companies logged disappointments, which helped mute investor sentiment. Sentiment was further dampened by infighting among Republican leadership. That reminded investors that corporate tax reform is not a sure thing, Samana said.With a 3.41% October gain, large-cap growth funds outpaced other U.S. diversified stock fund categories last month. Multi-cap growth funds averaged a 3.08% gain.Douglas Roman, manager of $92 million PNC Multi-Factor Large Cap Growth Fund (PEWAX), attributed outperformance by large-cap stock funds to strong economies in the U.S. and abroad. Large-cap companies are more likely to sell goods and services abroad as well as in the U.S. The PNC fund's 3.98% October gain outpaced 78% of its large-cap growth competitors.U.S. multinationals in particular got a tailwind from the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar vs. the euro, especially later in October, which helped U.S. exports, Roman said.Reflecting widespread global economic growth, world equity mutual funds rose 1.83% last month, topping the showing by U.S. diversified stock funds.India region funds led the way for foreign stock funds, jumping 5.89% last month.Global science and technology funds led the major sectors, rising 5.49% last month.General domestic taxable bond funds gained 0.29% on average in October. Loan participation funds' 0.56% return led all taxables in the month. Muni bond funds were about flat in October.The stock market got an additional lift from the hunt for a new chairperson of the Federal Reserve — who in November turned out to be current Fed Governor Jerome Powell. In October, investors appeared to welcome the prospect that the apparent leading contenders would keep the central bank on its current path of raising rates, said Charles Shriver, manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.3 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $295 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. Balanced beat 87% of its allocation peer group in October. Global Allocation topped 62% of its direct rivals.Going forward, T. Rowe Price's Shriver likes foreign stocks in general more than U.S. equities. ""Fundamentals are positive, but valuations give us a little pause. We are underweight in areas whose valuations are a little more rich,"" he said.Among foreign stocks, ""Japan is an area where we see the cheapest valuations among developed markets.""IBD'S TAKE: Tokyo-based bank holding company Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group was a top holding as of June 30 of $6.7 billion Matthews Asia Dividend Investor Fund (MAPIX), which is a diversified Pacific/Asia fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. The stock edged up 4.4% last month. Earnings per share rose 20%, 44% and 55% the past three months after having declined for five stanzas in a row.On the other hand, lower U.S. corporate tax rates would benefit U.S. stocks, said Invesco's Edwards. ""That favors economically sensitive stocks as well as financials,"" he said.Holdings he likes for those reasons include LPL Financial (LPLA). ""They are one of the largest independent financial advisory firms,"" Edwards said. ""One hundred percent of their profits are from the U.S., so they would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate. And a significant part of their earnings are from interest on customers' cash balances. As interest rates go up, they would earn more on those balances.""He also cites SVB Financial Group (SIVB). ""They're a regional bank (mostly) in California, focused on the technology sector,"" he said. ""A lot of their loans are floating rate. As (the Fed raises) short-term rates, it would increase their net interest margin."" And the large portion of their profit that is based on U.S. revenue would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.PNC's Roman is overweight in industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. He likes industrials because of the prospects for aerospace and defense firms. Financials should benefit from rate hikes. And he likes the diversity of consumer discretionary. ""From homebuilders to dollar stores, there's always some opportunities,"" he said.As of Sept. 30, among his top holdings were aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and defense contractors Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).He likes auto parts, travel and home furnishings. Auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH) was another holding. Smaller holdings included Wyndham Worldwide (WYN).RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Income At Your Age And Income

Boosted by that demand, the stock is now around 25% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared in September.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) and software and analytics leader Adobe (ADBE) both came in just shy of the $1 billion mark, getting investments of approximately $982 million and $932 million, respectively.The IBD 50 screen identifies the top growth stocks that are strongly displaying the key traits typically shared by the biggest stock market winners.Seven of the names on this month's list of new buys by top funds are also currently on the IBD 50, including Applied Materials, Adobe, Abiomed (ABMD), Lam Research (LRCX) and S&P Global (SPGI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn addition to BofA, seven other bank stocks made the list, joined by six financial sector companies, including Charles Schwab, which was named one of the best online stock brokers for 2018.Leading portfolio managers also continued to pick up shares in semiconductor stocks, including the aforementioned Intel, Applied Materials and Lam Research, as well as Microsemi (MSCC) and KLA Tencor (KLAC).Portfolio managers also showed a healthy interest in medical stocks, with five companies from that sector joining Abiomed and Abbot Laboratories on the list, including Express Scripts (ESRX) and Cantel Medical (CMD).Just because mutual fund managers have been buying a stock doesn't mean it's time for individual investors to pick up shares, especially given that the overall market has come under selling pressure recently. Be sure to run all your stock ideas through a buying checklist and do additional research before making any investment decisions.On Tuesday, Applied Materials cleared a 58.83 buy point in a later-stage, and therefore riskier, double bottom. Its relative strength line has been trending sharply higher and is just shy of new high ground.Lam Research is also working on a late-stage double bottom, and has now climbed within 5% of the 218.58 entry.Scanning and tracking solutions leader Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) leapt past a buy point in January, but pulled back as the stock market fell sharply in early February. But on Feb. 22, Zebra soared on its Q4 earnings report and is now 27% above the initial 112.49 entry.Adobe also launched a successful breakout in January and has now climbed 14% above the 186.37 buy point.IBD 50 member SVB Financial (SIVB), which owns Silicon Valley Bank and was just featured in the IBD Stock Analysis, broke out past a 263.19 entry on Tuesday, but is now testing support at the buy point after the resignation of Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn rattled the market.Despite being among the top new buys this month, Boeing topped the list of stocks being sold, with 42 net sellers (123 funds selling minus 81 buying).American Express (AXP) was second, with 40 net sellers (90 funds selling minus 50 buying).Managed care provider Humana (HUM) and Motorola Solutions (MSI) also saw a significant number of net sellers.You May Also Like:What Are Today's Fastest-Growing Companies?Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsVideo: How To Quickly Find Top-Performing Mutual Funds

109,SIVB,"Having a growth strategy has paid off well for American Century All Cap Growth Fund (TWGTX) since the start of the 2009 bull market. And the fund's early purchase of its largest holding Alphabet (GOOGL) in early 2009 might have something to do with it beating the S&P 500 since then.X The $1.2 billion fund is up 4.09% this year through Feb. 22, ahead of S&P 500's return of 1.41% and its large-growth Morningstar category's 4.12%. The fund also has returned a stellar 20.75% in the past year, plus average annual returns of 10.42% and 14.22% in the past three and five years, beating the S&P 500 for the one-year, but slightly lagging it for the other periods.The fund recently changed managers. Gregory Woodhams, senior vice president and co-chief investment officer of American  Century's global growth equity, and Joe Reiland, vice president and portfolio manager, took over the fund's management as of Feb. 16. Before that, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott comanaged the fund for the past nine and six years, respectively.American Century All Cap Growth strives to invest in companies that show continuous accelerating earnings growth and a strong price momentum. While it can invest in companies of all sizes, over 70% of its holdings fall into the large-cap category, 25% comprise midcap stocks, with the remaining allocation in small caps. It primarily invests in U.S. stocks, but had a less-than-5% allocation to foreign equities as of Dec. 31.Last year, the fund benefited from the risk-on rally that began shortly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2016. Growth stocks were lifted on expectations of President Trump's stimulus package for individuals and businesses, a solid earnings season and overall economic strength.Stock selection played a large role in the fund's performance in 2017, as much on the positive as the negative side. Its top-10 holdings represent 37% of the fund and include names such as Alphabet, IBD Leaderboard member Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Mastercard (MA) and FedEx (FDX). These stocks soared between 33% and 53% last year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmong the fund's largest sectors are technology at 30% of the portfolio, consumer cyclical 17%, health care 15% and financials 12%. With technology being the top performing sector, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple's positions have each grown to represent 7%, 5% and 4.4% of the fund.LogMeIn (LOGM) is a midcap internet service company that provides a cloud-based platform for online meetings, customer support, remote access and password security. Its earnings and revenue skyrocketed between 94% and 216% the past four quarters. Earnings per share jumped 110% last year and analysts estimate a 29% increase this year. The maker of GoToMeeting, OpenVoice and join.me also recently announced it will acquire cloud-based phone system provider Jive Communications and Unified Communications. Shares of LogMeIn advanced 20% last year. The stock is 13% off its Feb. 15 all-time high, having sliced through its 50-day moving average after the company reported 94% gain in earnings that beat expectations, but was light on revenue.Within the software space, creative design program maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) and customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com (CRM) also did well, each jumping 70.2% and 49.3% last year, and 15.3% and 12% year to date. Adobe, which successfully transitioned to cloud-based recurring subscription services recently announced that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring. The maker of Photoshop and Acrobat plans to grow its e-commerce business. It's also on IBD's Leaderboard.Among banks, which are expected to benefit from rising interest rates, the fund holds Zions Bancorp (ZION) and SVB Financial (SIVB)). The holding company for Zion Bank, which operates via 436 branches in 11 Western and Southwestern states reported double-digit earnings growth in the past six quarters. Its stock is up 8% so far in 2018 after advancing 19% last year.The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank SVB Financial reported accelerating earnings and sales growth in the last five quarters. In the most recent quarter, earnings per share rose 53% on revenue growth of 32%. The stock rose 36% in 2017 and 5% this year.Among key detractors to American Century All Cap's performance in 2017 were biotech stocks such as Shire (SHPG), where despite reporting good results, ""investor concerns over competitive threats to the company's hemophilia franchise weighed on the shares,"" notes the latest fund annual report. Shire's stock fell 6.3% last year.Natural gas producer Range Resources (RRC) also was a drag on performance due to unfavorable weather conditions and gas prices. The stock declined over 50% last year and has continued its slide this year.RELATED:What's Will Danoff Into These Days?What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

116,SIVB,"Leaderboard is enhancing its alerts system, giving subscribers the option to get more notifications on key steps where investors can add shares to winning positions.While many investors make a one-time purchase of a stock, often the better approach is to scale into a stock. It's a way to control risk. Investors also can scale out of a stock in pieces.X Ideally, you would buy half your intended shares to start, then buy 30% of the position in the next buy area, and spend the remaining 20% in a third entry. You can use a similar process in reverse to sell shares, provided the decline is orderly.Why would you buy piecemeal? In certain situations, an early alternative entry may exist and provide the first opportunity into the investment. Then, when it crosses a conventional buy point, the chance to add 30% of shares would appear. Another show of strength might be the final step in this ""pyramiding"" strategy.With alerts on price levels where it makes sense to buy additional shares, investors will have more information to manage their position sizes. Alerts also will go out when it's smart to reduce the amount of shares in a Leader.For example, Amazon.com (AMNZ) went on Leaderboard March 29 as it climbed from support at the 50-day moving average. Under the new alerts, the first message would go out at that time, when the stock is added.The next message would have gone out June 9, when the stock sold off but found support at the 50-day line again. This would have made a good time to increase your number of shares. Amazon started a new base in late July, but the stock remained in Leaderboard, which we  deemed to be an exceptional company. The next breakout, on Oct. 27, would have triggered the third alert to subscribers. Amazon went on a powerful run from that point on.In some cases where there is higher risk with a stock, it's better to start with a smaller exposure to the stock than normal.Atlassian (SIVB) was just above the 39.35 buy point of a breakout ahead of its earnings on Oct. 19. A poorly received earnings report can wreck a stock, so the better strategy was to buy a call option with a strike price around 40, near Atlassian's close minutes before the report came out.That purchase would have triggered an alert to subscribers to invest about half of their desired position in the stock via an option. This gave investors 50% exposure to their investment.Shares soared after Atlassian gave a bullish quarterly report. With the stock acting explosively when trading opened Oct. 20, it was time to finish the position and acquire the remaining shares. A second alert would go out to subscribers to announce this second and final step.By this time, with the mystery of the earnings report out in the open, there was no need to use a call option. Investors could just buy shares.Currently, subscribers receive alerts when a stock is added to or dropped from the Leaders list. The new alerts could be sent multiple times on a single stock as it reaches key levels beyond the buy point.If it sounds like a lot of notifications, don't worry. You won't get the additional alerts unless you sign up. To do that, click on the bell icon on any Leaderboard stock, then the Active tab, and make the appropriate notification settings near the bottom of that tab.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.The global feedback loop of investor confidence darkened abruptly this week, with last week's late losses in the U.S. reverberating through Asia and Europe on Monday, then slamming back into U.S. stocks as investors also factored in the probability of the Federal Reserve rolling out an accelerated rate hike schedule and news of strict sanctions imposed on one of the largest U.S. banks.The result sent all three major U.S. indexes below support at their 50-day moving averages, and the Dow to a record point loss for the day. The loss Monday was the Dow's  worst one-day percentage decline since August 2011.On Tuesday, Japanese investors kept up the selling as Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunged 4.7%, its worst single-day performance since November 2016. The index had cut below its 50-day moving average in heavy trade Monday. China's markets also took their licks, as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index buckled 5.1% in its deepest decline since July 2015.

TAL has held up well so far versus the volatile market, keeping above its 10-week line of support and within a three-month base pattern. Sina had pulled back more than 8% below a 119.30 cup-base buy point, tripping the automatic sell rule.Chip names were sharply mixed.

In late October, Lennar announced plans to acquire CalAtlantic (CAA) for just over $9 billion.Meanwhile, enterprise software name Workday (WDAY) surged 3% to 113.40, helped by positive comments from Morgan Stanley. On a daily chart, some might interpret Workday's latest pattern as a cup-with-handle, but that's not the case because the handle is too short. Still, Workday's price action is bullish as it cleared the 110 level.Elsewhere, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) gapped out of a cup-shaped base with a 405.15 buy point, rising nearly 7% to 423.97, after the company announced bullish Q4 preliminary results. It now sees sales of $892 million, well above the consensus estimate of $845 million.No doubt growth investors are seeing plenty of bullish chart patterns out there, but it's important to recognize if the stock is still in the early stages of a run or the later stages. Breakouts from late-stage bases can work but are generally more prone to fail. Some examples of later-stage bases out there now include TAL Education (TAL), Arista Networks (ANET) and Nvidia (NVDA).U.S. crude oil futures settled at $63.57 a barrel, up 1%, after weekly U.S. inventory data showed a larger-than-expected decline in stockpiles.RELATED:Here's What Berkshire's Warren Buffett Thinks About CryptocurrenciesOil Prices Stay Up As U.S. Crude Production, Inventories DropRobot Surgeon Breaks Out; Two Top Financials Hit New Highs

153,SIVB,"Investment bank Morgan Stanley on Thursday selected nine ""high conviction"" stocks that have near-term catalysts that could move their shares higher.Of the nine, four are technology stocks: Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Amazon.com (AMZN), IBM (IBM) and Lam Research (LRCX). And a fifth, Align Technology (ALGN), is a medical-products (teeth alignment) company.Two of the companies are currently featured on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks: Activision and Align. And one, Amazon, is on IBD's Leaderboard list.The others are wireless tower operator Crown Castle (CCI), commercial bank SVB Financial Group (SIVB), and energy services firms Helix Energy Solutions (HLX) and Parsley Energy (PE).IBD'S TAKE: Investors.com offers a host of proprietary stock lists to give investors actionable ideas about companies worth considering. The IBD 50 is IBD's flagship screen of leading growth stocks showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals. Leaderboard provides a select group of stock picks showing the most potential for big gains.""Our analysts believe that one or more imminent events will drive the share price (of the nine stocks) materially over the next 15-60 days,"" a group of Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research report.Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak expects video game publisher Activision to beat Wall Street's estimates when it reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 3. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company is benefiting from a shift to higher-margin game downloads, vs. packaged media sales, and online and mobile-game traction, he said.Potential catalysts include a faster-than-anticipated shift to full-game downloads and indications that Activision is monetizing its King Digital user base through advertising.""Currently 15% to 20% of games are downloaded digitally, and we expect this to increase to 40%-plus in the next five years,"" Nowak said.Align Technology, which makes teeth-straightening systems, is set to report its Q3 earnings on Nov. 7.Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Beuchaw is looking for San Jose, Calif.-based Align to report strong results. Catalysts for the stock include inflections in discretionary spending, the rollout of Align's G6 feature set, and collaboration with more digital scanner partners.E-commerce leader Amazon is likely to report its Q3 results in late October. Nowak is expecting Amazon to beat Wall Street's consensus expectations.""Our estimates are driven by higher gross profit per customer, which more than offsets our expectations for higher forward streaming-content (spending) and increased fulfillment deleverage from Amazon's large expected warehouse build this year,"" Nowak said. ""We also see potential for further upside due to ongoing strength in Amazon's AWS cloud-computing business.""Amazon is moving into a phase of improving profitability in its core e-commerce business, even as it takes market share, he said.Potential catalysts include Amazon's Q3 results, acceleration of e-commerce penetration in core markets, Prime membership growth, and enterprise cloud adoption hitting an inflection point, Nowak said.Tech services giant IBM could see a lift as it makes progress transitioning from mainframe and other legacy businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said. IBM is becoming more exposed to its emerging businesses in Watson, cloud, analytics, mobile and security, which have double-digit growth profiles, she said.IBM's potential catalysts include an accelerated transformation and recent acquisitions helping to achieve a faster path to revenue growth and improving profit margins, she said.Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research is set to report its September quarter results on Oct. 19 and will hold an analyst meeting on Nov. 16.""We would expect both events to be positive for the stock,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore said. Investors are likely to take a fresh look at Lam in the wake of its failed merger with inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor (KLAC).

168,SIVB,"It's not exactly a run on banks, but investors are clearly fleeing or avoiding bank stocks on multiple fears, including concerns over the economy, oil prices, low or negative interest rates and a slowdown in tech.Small and mid-cap banks are down more than 12% this year, according to investment banker Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, with some names falling much more.Amid the carnage, though, bank-focused KBW found six bank stocks in that middle sector that it believes offer investors good buying opportunities. They range from a conservatively managed bank in Michigan -- Chemical Financial (CHFC) -- to a bank in Texas that has little exposure to the energy market, Dallas-based Hilltop Holdings (HTH).""Investors seem to view the oil patch space as uninvestable and too early to get involved,"" said KBW in a report distributed Friday. And while KBW says that it is ""still staying neutral on the oil patch banks,"" it calls the Hilltop as ""our 2016 best idea.""Only 3% to 4% of Hilltop's loans are energy-related, KBW noted, adding that it trades at a significant discount to peers on earnings and has several positive catalysts, including capital deployment via mergers and acquisitions. Meanwhile, Chemical Financial is ""executing a growth and market share story in Michigan,"" KBW said, noting that it plans to acquire Troy, Mich.-based Talmer Bancorp (TLMR).""Once the deal closes, we expect both increased liquidity in the shares and analyst coverage to increase,"" KBW noted. Both factors should support higher valuation, it added. Plus, the bank has a conservative balance sheet.Midland, Mich.-based Chemical Financial is also one of the highest-rated stocks in IBD's rankings, with a Composite Rating of 98 out of a best possible 99. That means its stock outperforms 98% of all stocks in the market as measured by various fundamental and technical factors.Two other banks picked by KBW are in California, despite investors'  concerns of a tech slowdown and the related impact on commercial real estate. They are PacWest Bancorp (PACW) and SVB Financial (SIVB).Tech- and venture-capital sensitive SVB Financial sold off hard this year, down around 28%. But the KBW analysts concluded there was a disconnect between tech/commercial real estate ""headline risks"" and bank fundamentals.Santa Clara-based SVB Financial, they noted, has a more diversified, less risky loan portfolio than it did during the dot-com crash.""(This year) should be a very good year for the bank. With the current pullback, SVB's valuation seems compelling to us,"" the report says.Beverly Hills-based PacWest, parent of Pacific Western Bank, should have ""well-managed"" growth in the high single digits, with industry leading margins, KBW added. What's more, it offers an enticing 6% dividend yield.The last two banks recommended by KBW are in the Northeast: Webster Financial (WBS), based in Waterbury, Ct.; and Investors Bancorp (ISBC), in Short Hills, N.J.KBW likes Webster for its growing and diversified commercial lending and its potential for continued dividend increases, and Investors Bancorp for developing market-share gains in the New York metro region.Also, Investors Bancorp's recent sell-off enables the company to ""more aggressively repurchase shares"" at a discount.
"
169,SIVB,"WeWork, the shared-office company valued at $15 billion, has cultivated a chic vibe to attract the freelancers and startup workers that helped launch the co-working movement. That means hip interior design (some offices have wallpaper created by the Beastie Boys' Mike D) and free micro-roasted coffee and craft beer (the company gave out 90,000 glasses during a single month last year).Now that youthful ambiance is helping attract the olds. General Electric (GE) moved 20 workers from its new energy business, Current, into a WeWork space near Boston's South Station this year as GE readies its new Boston headquarters. Other recent WeWork tenants include business consultancy KPMG, pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK), and British news publication the Guardian -- companies that have been around for an average of 155 years.The moves mean traditional employers can rub shoulders with the young tech set. KPMG rents about 75 desks at a WeWork in Manhattan, which it splits between workers who provide business services to startups, and another team that advises corporate clients on technological innovation. Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), which rents space at 16 co-working offices across the country, including with Galvanize in San Francisco and Centrl Office in Portland, Ore., says the move allows its bankers to work alongside the tech startups it courts as clients. “People literally open the door and say, 'We need to open [a] bank account,'” said Mark Gallagher, who leads the bank’s Boston technology practice.It's also a useful way to manage real estate costs, according to workplace strategy experts. “Anyone doing it now is a pioneer,” said Julie Whelan, head of occupier research for CBRE. “I can’t see that it won’t become a norm, based on how companies have worked to change their footprints in recent years.”It costs the typical U.S. company upward of $12,000 a year for each worker it provides office space, according to CBRE Group (CBG). Co-working spaces can be more expensive than traditional office space on a per-square-foot basis but make it easy for companies to move in and out, letting execs focus more on expanding their businesses than managing their real estate operations. ""If I go and find a space with a five-year lease and build it out, it might take me five years to recoup my expenses,"" said Brent Harrell, president of HeritageBank Mortgage, an Atlanta-based lender who recently moved a team of four mortgage bankers into an Industrious co-working space.Employees tend to like it, too. The homebuilder Lennar (LEN) rents space from Industrious in Chicago and Minneapolis so it can hold meetings near downtown construction projects and because the stylish offices help with recruiting, said Peter Chmielewski, vice president of development for the builder's multifamily arm. In a September report published in the Harvard Business Review, workers in shared offices reported that they were ""thriving"" so much that researchers “had to look at the data again.” The results, the researchers theorize, are largely because the workers tend to have a greater sense of purpose. They’ve opted into a workspace instead of showing up at a site designated by their employer, which tends to produce a community effect that makes them feel empowered.A stylish or flexible workplace doesn't necessarily require a co-working membership. Most employers are more comfortable adopting aspects of co-working than sending employees to shared offices, said Phil Kirschner, senior vice president at JLL (JLL), who consults with employers on workplace strategy. That could mean trading assigned desks for access to a variety of shared spaces. ""(They've) given up a desk and gained a floor,"" Kirschner said.Co-working companies, however, are welcoming the corporate interest. WeWork has raised $1 billion from investors to fuel expansion around the world, and renting space to large companies that need lots of desks is a good way to expand quickly. Thirty percent of WeWork's 45,000 members work for companies that rent more than 10 desks, and large employers make up its fastest-growing market. ""You’re going to see people dip toes in,"" said WeWork Chief Operating Officer Artie Minson. ""People go back to their drab, soulless office and say, I sort of wish I could have stayed there.""Serendipity Labs, which opened its first co-working space in Rye, N.Y., in 2013, says corporate employees make up 45% of members at its two U.S. locations, including workers from PepsiCo (PEP), Microsoft (MSFT), and Heineken International. The company is seeking to open 200 shared offices in the next three years, mostly in suburban locations, to appeal to companies with national footprints, founder John Arenas said. To fuel its rapid growth, Arenas is selling franchises to hotel operators and other hospitality companies. Not every corporate employer wants the kind of hip, downtown spaces associated with co-working, Arenas said.“Instead of having a bro-out Thursday night party, we’re having a Tesla test-driving event,” Arenas said. “We have different members. They can afford a car.”Related:Creative Offices Become The Norm And Get SmarterWhy Rental Rates At Biotech Labs Are SkyrocketingFood Feeds Real Estate Development In Edgy Areas

214,SIVB,"For years, SVB Financial Group held weekly 15-minute conference calls with all staffers. When Greg Becker became the bank's CEO in 2011, he wanted to enhance internal communication.His solution? He built a television studio in Silicon Valley Bank's corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif.""The calls had become a bit disconnected,"" said Becker, president and chief executive of SVB Financial (SIVB). ""Now we use our TV studio to broadcast live every Monday to all 1,700-plus employees.""It's part of Becker's push for transparency. A believer that ""over-sharing is better than under-sharing,"" Becker, 46, invites workers in China, Israel and all other SVB locations to participate in the broadcasts.Viewers from all levels of the company — from operations to human resources to information technology — join in. Newly hired employees get to report on their local markets, increasing their exposure within the bank.Motivational VideosCEOs often try to inspire people by highlighting the purpose of their jobs. For Becker, connecting his employees to the bank's clients has its own rewards.His team produces short videos to introduce employees to clients. On camera, entrepreneurs discuss their innovative vision and, in many cases, how the bank has helped their young companies grow.""We have a role in helping incredibly unique, creative companies be successful,"" Becker said. ""In one video, we featured a company doing a certain type of cancer research. One of our employees saw that video and emailed me, 'My relative has that cancer. To know we're supporting that company makes me so proud to work here.'""Becker and his managers make decisions aligned with the company's core values. To underscore the importance of ethics, for example, the bank's asset-management unit itemizes its fees.""In some other asset-management businesses, fees can be embedded in the investment instrument,"" Becker said. ""When we built our asset-management business, we separated out our fees. We're doing the same thing with the wealth-management unit we're building now.""One of Becker's mantras, ""doing different,"" guides his leadership. He spurs his team to think differently to enhance customer service and provide speed and flexibility.In 2009, for instance, the bank sought to build upon its deep relationship with the venture-capital community by reaching out to corporate investors with an interest in promising technology companies. To strengthen the connection between corporate investors and tech firms seeking funding, SVB recently hosted an unconventional event in London.Tech entrepreneurs from about 65 European mid-stage companies made a 90-second pitch to corporate investors. But here's what set the meeting apart: Each pitch was followed by 30 seconds for the entrepreneurs to identify which corporate investors in the room they wanted to get to know better.""It was about making connections in the most frictionless way possible,"" Becker said. ""Feedback on both sides was incredibly strong.""

239,SIVB," The market sell-off showed little signs of applying the brakes in the dying minutes of Tuesday's session. Banking, biotech and select metals firms including steel production and metal ores led the decline.With minutes left in the session, the Nasdaq composite accelerated its drop in the final hour of trading, falling 1.8% as large and megacap techs retreated. It's clearly going to be the Nasdaq's biggest single-session drop since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.The S&P 500 was down nearly 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average provided no relief as it too fell more than 0.9%. Volume expanded sharply vs. Monday, meaning that it is likely to be a true distribution day, or session of intense professional selling.A spate of four or five such distribution days is enough to end a bull market, or at the minimum trigger a mild correction in the range of 5% to 10%.Small caps took bigger hits as the Russell 2000 fell more than 2.6% and dipped back into slightly negative ground for the year. In 2016, the popular small-cap equity index rallied 19.5%. Major Wall Street banks sold off on growing concern about what impact Britain's future exit from the eurozone will have on London's status as a major banking center.Goldman Sachs (GS), which announced that it will move hundreds of employees out of the United Kingdom capital in preparation for the changes, dropped 8.32 points, or more than 3%, and slumped sharply below its 50-day moving average. Volume was running about 26% above average levels.The Wall Street bank, which has thrived by recent movement in U.S. Treasury bonds, is triggering its first major sell signal since breaking out of a long first-stage base with a 172.52 buy point in late October. The gain reached as high as 48%, big enough to have justified taking profits on the way up.One could decide to sell at least half a position bought at the proper entry, then see if the Dow Jones industrials component can rebound back to its 50-day line. For now, shares are trading less than 9% below the 255.15 high.Fellow money-center banks — Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY), as well as Morgan Stanley (MS) — are also down between 0.5% and 4% and showing weak action near their respective 50-day lines. Superregional lender SVB Financial (SIVB) took out its 50-day moving average for the first time since its early October breakout from a large bottoming-style base. Shares in the Santa Clara, Calif., firm slumped more than 6% to 175.84 in more than double average trade. At its 198.83 peak, SVB rose as much as 76% from the 112.93 handle entry.Also in IBD's superregional bank industry group, Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) and SunTrust Banks (STI) of Atlanta dropped more than 5% in heavy turnover and triggered the 50-day line sell rule.Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a top-rated company in IBD's West/Southwest bank group, got slammed with a 7% drop to 47.05, also sinking below its 50-day line in volume running nearly four times usual levels.The stock also triggered the golden rule of selling by falling more than 7% below a recent new flat base entry at 50.82.IBD 50 stocks were not immune to the blanket-like sell-off.China's top internet video game firm NetEase (NTES) slid nearly 4% to 282.59. Yet for now, the stock is holding above its fast-rising 50-day moving average and keeping the air pocket created by an earnings-inspired Feb. 16 big gap up in price. The stock is also still extended more than 5% past a 257.78 cup-with-handle entry point.Cognex (CGNX) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) both fell more than 2% in heavy trading. The former has already gained more than 50% since clearing a 53.55 flat-base entry, while the latter pulled back near a 48.05 flat-base buy point. Yet Veeva has also risen significantly since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 28.05 in May 2016.Keeping gains by selling at least half the position after the rally has exceeded 20% to 25% is a smart portfolio management technique for your growth stocks.On the upside, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is staging an eighth straight up-day, rising 1% to 112.93. That pushed the gaming resort operator's advance to 8% past a 104.49 buy point, in a choppy cup-with-handle base — so shares are extended. Wynn has large operations in Macau, the island territory of China where casino gambling is legalized. Wall Street sees full-year profit rising 27% to $4.29 a share in 2017, then up another 16% to $4.99 in 2018.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Dow-30 Stocks?When To Sell A Stock: Take Profits When 2 Or More Key Rules Get TriggeredWhen To Sell A Stock II: Use The 50-Day Moving Average As A Guide

241,SIVB,"Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund's (FIGWX) recent surge since the elections and since the Federal Reserve's December rate hike has given retirement-account and other investors reason to cheer.In the trailing three months going into Thursday, the $300 million fund's 10.45% gain topped 93% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged an 8.66% advance. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, gained 8.33%.For the Nuveen fund, that's way better than the mere 34% of direct rivals it outpaced in the past 12 months with a not-so-shabby 24.20% return.The difference between now and the earlier period? Within their overall investment approach, fund managers Harold Goldstein and David Chalupnik favored stocks likely to get an extra tailwind from the elections and from rising rates. Those had to be stocks that fit their basic approach, which is the pursuit of stocks they think will have faster earnings growth than the market expects.They paid for that by cutting stable and defensive consumer staples stocks by 7% in the fourth quarter and consumer discretionary stocks by 6%, the fund's fourth-quarter commentary notes.The managers pumped up their financials by 7%, mostly the day after the elections. They boosted technology by about 3% and energy by 2%.They began positions in Signature Bank (SBNY), SVB Financial (SIVB), Raymond James (RJF) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).All of those newcomers have very strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the high 80s or 90s. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.In addition to a sterling 96 Comp Rating, SVB Financial is the No. 3-ranked bank in IBD's superregional industry group, thanks to growth metrics like four years in a row of earnings per share (EPS) growth and a 39.7% annual pretax margin.IBD'S TAKE: SVB Financial is ranked No. 3 in the No. 1-rated Banks-Super Regional group. See which superregional bank is No. 1, and how these financials stack up on easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.The bank is headquartered in Silicon Valley, a hotbed of innovation. Its nonbanking businesses include asset management, private wealth management, brokerage and investment services, funds management, and business valuation services.Raymond James is No. 2 in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank-Bankers group. It is propelled by factors like its fourth-quarter 47% EPS growth and eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds.In tech, the fund opened a position in Broadcom (AVGO), a chipmaking company whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters. On IBD's Leaderboard, the company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and broadband communications.Goldstein and Chalupnik like the semiconductor space's economic sensitivity. And they like Broadcom's role among leaders of consolidation within its industry.In energy, the fund added new positions in Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE), and added to its stake in Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).""(We) added exposure to several growth-oriented exploration and production firms as a result of the generally improved outlook for oil pricing and supply,"" the managers wrote.In health care, the fund's overall weight stayed basically unchanged in the immediate postelection period. But the fund made individual stock moves.It started a stake in Incyte (INCY), which the managers call a fast-growing young biotech firm with an exciting pipeline of cancer-fighting treatments.To pay for Incyte, the fund used proceeds from the sale of two drugmakers, Allergan (AGN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which it had owned a long time.The managers think Allergan has grown so large that it can no longer grow much faster than its industry. They sold Bristol-Meyers because test results dimmed the outlook for a lung cancer therapy it was developing.The managers summarized their approach this way: ""The portfolio continues to be reasonably balanced from a sector standpoint as well as measured by other factors. The fund's largest overweight is in the area of companies with high growth potential that we believe can perform well somewhat independent of the economic cycle. We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""RELATED:Why This Victory Munder Fund Likes Semiconductor Gear Makers And Non-ObamaCare Health StocksWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

244,SIVB,"Anyone who questions the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans might be swayed by spending a few minutes chatting with Doug Bowers.He's CEO of Durham, N.C.-based Square 1 Financial (SQBK), the holding company for Square 1 Bank, which provides loans and other financial services to entrepreneurs, startups, venture capital firms and private equity outfits.The company, which was founded in 2005 and had its initial public offering on March 27, depends on a steady stream of innovative people, companies and ideas to expand its business.In that regard, Square 1 is in good shape, Bowers says.""About $25 billion to $30 billion is invested into the innovation sector every year, and it goes to somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 companies,"" he told IBD. ""Of that, about one-third are brand-new companies. That represents the pool of opportunity we focus on.""Where The Go-Getters AreTo reach that pool of opportunity, Square 1 employs 75 client representatives — what Bowers calls ""client-facing individuals"" — in a dozen offices throughout the country.These offices are concentrated in what he calls innovation hubs — places that focus primarily on technology and life sciences.They tend to be markets rich in talent, research and venture cap firms. They include Boston, New York, Seattle, California's Silicon Valley, San Diego, Denver and North Carolina's Research Triangle, where Square 1 is headquartered.About 80% of Square 1's loan portfolio is dedicated to entrepreneurial companies backed by VC investors, Bowers says. Of that 80%, about 60% is technology-based and 20% life sciences-based.The remaining 20% of Square 1's portfolio is dedicated to venture cap investors. These are the types of borrowers who don't find a lot of financing options at traditional banks.""Given the unique nature of the borrower and investor, there are very few banks willing to make these types of loans because of the real or perceived risk of lending to startups or near startups,"" Bowers said. ""Commercial banks see a company that may not have revenue and certainly does not have income or positive cash flow, and may not have collateral — so the commercial banks tend to say, 'No, thank you.'""One result is that VC firms and entrepreneurs must go shopping for loans at banks and other financial firms that either specialize in venture banking services or offer them as part of a larger menu of services.Among publicly traded companies, the list includes Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), Comerica (CMA), First Republic Bank (FRC), City National (CYN) and Bridge Bank, owned by Bridge Capital Holdings (BBNK).There is no precise formula for making loans to VC, private equity and entrepreneurial clients, Bowers says. It takes experience, expertise, instinct and research.""We look very closely at the investor — their experience in the space, their knowledge, the amount of capital they have,"" he said. ""The investor is a very key component of how we evaluate whether we want to lend or not.""When lending to a company, Square 1 takes a hard look at property that it holds, its management team's experience and whether it fills an area that had not been filled.Delving Into The Deal BookSome funding arrangements that Square 1 has inked in recent months include credit facilities of $3 million to online marketing software provider Accelerize New Media, $4 million to digital publishing technology firm GTxcel, $12.5 million to dietary supplement maker NutraMed and $4.5 million to sitter- and nanny-search service Sittercity.Square 1 also provided a $7.5 million growth-capital facility to network-reliability tech firm Talari Networks.There is no shortage of companies in need of funding.""We believe there is plenty of runway and opportunity out there,"" Bowers said.To raise capital for that opportunity, Square 1 took its shares public last month. The company's March 27 IPO priced at 18 — above its expected range of 15 to 17 — and raised $104 million by offering 5.8 million shares. The stock closed its first day of trading at 20.60. Shares currently trade near 20.""The IPO was underwritten by arguably the top two underwriters, in Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Sandler O'Neill,"" said Scott Sweet, managing partner at IPO Boutique. ""The stock has held up pretty well through this tough sell-off.""Founder Casey's LegacySquare 1 was founded by Richard Casey, a banking veteran who previously served in a variety of positions at Comerica Bank and its predecessor. A couple of his posts were president of the emerging growth division and managing director of Comerica Ventures. He died in November 2010.Bowers joined Square 1 three years ago. Previously, he spent years at Bank of America (BAC) in a variety of positions.He also has experience at starting up businesses and working at a private equity firm.Square 1 has seen a steady rise in its fortunes the past few years. According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Square 1 had net income of $22.4 million in 2013. That was up from $14.4 million in 2012.The last year that the company reported a net loss was 2010.Square 1's average deposits grew to $1.87 billion in 2013 from $1.53 billion in 2012.The company's average loan balance increased to $918 million last year from $751 million a year earlier, while adjusted operating revenue climbed to $105.3 million from $84.2 million.

246,SIVB,"Direxion launched a new fund on Feb 15, 2018, focused on providing 1.25x exposure to the mid-cap space of the U.S. equity markets.Portfolio+ S&P Mid Cap ETF (PPMC  -  Free Report) tracks the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index (+125%) and provides leveraged access to the mid-cap space of the U.S. equity markets.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund’s index seeks to provide investment results that closely track the performance of mid-cap companies in the U.S. markets. The S&P Mid Cap 400 Index measures the performance of 400 American mid-sized companies and is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index. It has amassed AUM of $25 million within a few days of trading and has a moderate expense ratio of 40 basis points a year.From a sector look, Information Technology, Financials and Industrials are the top three allocations of the index, with 17.5%, 17.1% and 15.8% exposure, respectively. From a top holdings perspective, the index has 0.7% exposure each to Take Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO  -  Free Report), SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) and NVR Inc (NVR  -  Free Report). However, investors should note that investing in mid-cap stocks requires a steady appetite for risk, as they are more volatile than their large-cap counterparts.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?U.S. markets recently suffered a sell-off owing to fears of rising interest rates. The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January.However, mid-caps appeal to investors as they still have some growth potential and are relatively less risky than their small-cap counterparts.  U.S. economic fundamentals seem to be strong with a slew of upbeat economic data, strong corporate fundamentals and President Donald Trump's tax-reform signed into law. Mid-caps have less international exposure compared to large-caps and are expected to benefit greatly from the tax reform and provide diversification benefits to investors.CompetitionThe fund faces a lot of competition from other funds in the space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the mid-cap space of the U.S. equity markets (see all Leveraged Equity ETFs here).Direxion Daily Mid Cap Bull 3X Shares (MIDU  -  Free Report)    This fund provides 3x leveraged exposure to mid-sized U.S. equities.It has AUM of $63.7 million and charges a fee of 109 basis points a year.

247,SIVB,"SVB Financial Group’s (SIVB  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share increased 53% year over year. The reported quarter’s figure excluded one-time net costs of $37.6 million related to the tax reform.GAAP earnings including one-time tax charges were $2.19 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $2.60.Results were primarily driven by higher net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. Moreover, loan and deposit balances reflected strength. However, higher non-interest expenses acted as a headwind. Also, a rise in provision for credit losses was a negative for the company. It is probably due to these negatives that the shares of the company lost 1.3% following the release.For 2017, the company reported GAAP net income of $490.5 million or $9.20 per share, compared with $382.7 million or $7.31 per share in 2016.Increased Revenues Offset Rise in ExpensesSVB Financial’s net revenues for the quarter were $546 million, increasing 33.1% year over year.

A rise in all expense components except other expenses led to this increase.Non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio was 48.85%, decreasing from 57.87% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates higher profitability.Strong Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, SVB Financial’s net loans amounted to $22.9 billion, increasing 4.2% from the prior quarter, while total deposits declined 1.2% sequentially to $44.3 billion.Credit Quality: Mixed BagThe ratio of allowance for loan losses to total gross loans came in at 1.10%, down 3 bps year over year. Also, the ratio of net charge-offs to average gross loans came in at 0.23%, down from 0.44% registered in the year-ago quarter.However, provision for credit losses increased 34.5% year over year to $22.2 million.Capital Ratios Deteriorated, Profitability Ratios EnhancedAs of Dec 31, 2017, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio came in at 12.78% compared with 12.80% as of Dec 31, 2016. Total risk-based capital ratio came in at 13.96% compared with 14.21% as of Dec 31, 2016.Non-GAAP return on average assets on an annualized basis improved to 0.92% from 0.88% in the year-ago quarter. Also, non-GAAP return on average equity was 11.09%, increasing from 10.77% in the prior-year quarter.2018 OutlookSVB Financial provided the updated 2018 guidance based on the assumption of no further change in interest rate during the year. Average loan balance is expected to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-teens. Further, average deposit balance is projected to rise in the mid-single digits rate.Further, NII is expected to rise at a percentage rate in the high teens, while NIM is anticipated in the range of 3.35-3.45%.Moreover, the company anticipates core fee income, including foreign exchange fees, deposit service charges, credit card fees, lending related fees, client investment fees as well as letters of credit fees, to increase at a percentage rate in the high teens.Further, non-interest expense, net of non-controlling interests, is projected to increase at a percentage rate in the low double digits rate.On the credit quality front, net loan charge-offs are expected in the range of 0.30-0.50% of average total gross loans. Allowance for loan losses for total gross performing loans, as a percentage of total gross performing loans, is expected to remain flat year over year.Non-performing loans, as a percentage of total gross loans, are anticipated in the range of 0.50-0.70%.Effective tax rate is anticipated in the range of 27.0%-30.0%.Our ViewpointThe company remains well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities on the back of its sturdy capital position and consistent growth in loans and deposits. Moreover, its focus on improving non-interest income is expected to support top-line growth. Also, it remains well-positioned to benefit from an improved rate scenario.

Adjusted earnings for the quarter came in at 80 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents.

Nevertheless, net interest margin was 3.08%, down 8 basis points (bps) year over year.Non-interest income came in at $130.3 million, up 19.7% year over year. The rise was chiefly driven by higher wealth management revenues (up 30% year over year).On the other hand, non-interest expenses increased 23.7% year over year to $445.5 million.  An increase in salaries and benefits, information systems, and other costs, which came as an outcome of continued investments in the expansion of franchise, led to the spike.The efficiency ratio was 63.7% compared with 60.1% recorded in the prior-year quarter. It should be noted that a rise in the efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability.Notably, due to the Tax Reform Act, First Republic recorded a one-time revaluation adjustment of $39.7 million for reduction of deferred tax assets, increasing the provision for income taxes.Balance Sheet Still HealthyAs of Dec 31, 2017, loans climbed 20.8% year over year to $62.8 billion, while total deposits were up 17.6% to $68.9 billion. Loan originations were $7.4 billion in the reported quarter, down 6.3% year over year, marking the second strongest quarter ever.First Republic’s total wealth management assets were $107 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, indicating 28% year-over-year growth.

The non-performing assets to total assets ratio contracted 3 bps to 0.04%.However, provision for loan losses jumped 61.9% on a year-over-year basis to $17 million in the reported quarter.Capital PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.85%, indicating a decline of 52 bps from the comparable period last year.Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.22%, down 85 bps year over year.Common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.63% compared with 10.83% in the year-earlier quarter.Tangible book value per share increased 14.4% year over year to $40.43.In ConclusionFirst Republic’s performance during the fourth quarter was decent. The company’s efforts to maintain its organic growth momentum, backed by growth in loans and deposits, which aided revenue growth, highlight optimism. Moreover, lower non-performing assets are the other tailwinds. However, higher expenses, and provisions and decline in net interest margin remain concerns. FIRST REPUBLIC BANK Price and EPS Surprise FIRST REPUBLIC BANK Price and EPS Surprise | FIRST REPUBLIC BANK QuoteFirst Republic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

251,SIVB,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus in on SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for SIVB’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Longer Term Price Change for SVB Financial GroupWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of SIVB, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 30.1% to 2.5% while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 39.2%. Clearly, SIVB is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.SVB Financial Group Price SVB Financial Group Price | SVB Financial Group QuoteFiscal Year EPS Estimate Change for SIVBIn addition to price performance, it is also important to take a look at earnings estimate changes for the full year. This can show if SIVB is poised to make a run based on fundamentals, or if the company is simply moving on speculation.Over the past month, the full year earnings estimate for CFFN has risen by 3.2%. On its own this is impressive, but we need to consider that it also beats the industry average of flat growth. The trend is undeniably in SVB Financial Group’s favor right now, and it suggests that the momentum might be long lasting for this stock. SIVB Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends.

253,SIVB,"KKR & Co. L.P. (KKR  -  Free Report), The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) and PAAMCO along with their founders have been accused of violating their fiduciary duty to the Kentucky Retirement Systems pension fund by giving the fund wrong investment advice.Recently, a few Kentucky state workers filed a lawsuit against the three investment groups in Franklin Circuit Court. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages from these firms for losses incurred by KRS in investments recommended by them. The defendants also include some former or current KRS board members, and, other officials and consulting firms that gave KRS investment advice.Notably, in 2011, these groups recommended KRS to invest nearly $1.2 billion in three “black box” hedge funds. The funds were complex and high-risk hedge funds that carried high fees. KRS was not informed about the high risk involved in the investment and hence was unaware of how its money was being managed.The lawsuit claims that the hedge funds had promised high rates of returns to KRS, which they ultimately failed to deliver. As a result, KRS had to suffer huge losses.In 2001, the Kentucky pension fund, which provides health and retirement benefits to almost 360,000 state workers was fully funded.However, due to a few of these poor investment decisions, the pension fund is now regarded as one of the worst-funded in the nation. The fund’s largest pension plan now has only 13.6% of the money it needs to pay future benefits to its workers.According to a summary of the lawsuit, if the trustees of KRS had avoided such high-risk investments and instead invested the money in simpler index funds with low risk, the Kentucky pension fund would have been a lot better off.The lawsuit claims that even the board members of the pension fund breached their fiduciary duty. They were faulty while calculating the assumed rate of return on the investments that they were making.However, according to Blackstone and KKR, the accusations are “baseless”.Matt Anderson, a spokesman for Blackstone, said, ""The Blackstone fund referenced in the complaint delivered to the Kentucky Employees Retirement System positive returns outperforming relevant benchmarks.""Additionally, KKR said in a statement, ""We take our fiduciary duty very seriously and believe that the allegations about our firm are meritless, misplaced and misleading.""However, PAAMCO did not make any comments regarding the same and officials of KRS could not be reached for any comment.Currently, KKR and Blackstone carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) and SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report).Legg Mason’s earnings estimates for the current fiscal year have been revised 3.6% upward over the last 60 days.

258,SIVB,"Late on May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a bill loosening Obama-era regulations on the banking industry. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act not only eases rules for banks, it sets the stage for further deregulation by multiple agencies. President Trump is widely expected to sign the bill into law before Memorial Day. According to House Speaker Paul Ryan, the new bill is likely to significantly benefit community banks. However, apart from suburban and rural banks, the bill is also expected to benefit regional and medium-sized institutions. With additional rate hikes also around the corner, investing in select bank stocks looks like a smart option.   House Approves Bill Easing Bank RulesOn Tuesday, the House voted 258 to 159 to approve the bipartisan Senate-drafted legislation which significantly deregulates the banking industry. The bill raised the assets threshold for banks which are considered too important to fail from $50 billion to $250 billion. In doing so, it excluded all banks except the largest from stringent regulatory supervision.As a result, the likes of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) will no longer have to submit themselves to periodic stress tests or submit plans known as living wills. These plans outline how a bank proposes to be wound up in case it faces bankruptcy.The bill also cuts down mortgage loan data reporting requirements for most banks. New measures have been introduced for those taking student loans. Additionally, credit reporting agencies will now be required to offer credit monitoring services at no charge. Further Deregulation on the AnvilThe new legislation also gives regulators greater discretion to decide at what point banks holding $100 billion to $250 billion in assets would have to undergo stress tests for capital adequacy. Such a need would, of course, only arise in case another financial crisis takes place.This doesn’t exclude the largest banks from stress tests altogether. But, increasing the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion could provide the Federal Reserve with the “political cover” to further ease regulations governing such stress tests. These tests are collectively termed Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR.Further, multiple agencies, including the SEC and the Fed, have powers to amend the manner in which the Volcker Rule is implemented. Congressional approval would not be required in such an event. For instance, regulators plan to remove an assumption that defines positions held by banks for a period led than 60 days as speculative. Our ChoicesIn keeping with Trump’s electoral promises, the new bill passed by the House has greatly eased banking regulations. Further, it has set the stage for further deregulation which will likely be undertaken by multiple financial agencies.Investing in banking stocks looks like a smart option at this point. This is particularly true since rates are likely to trend higher. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

This represents a 60.54% change in EPS on a 25.93% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $19.22 per share on $2.91 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 20.94% and 17.04%, respectively.Valuation MetricsSVB Financial Group may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for SIVB? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.SVB Financial Group has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 35.8X versus its peer group's average of 15.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.84. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.SVB Financial Group Price and Consensus  SVB Financial Group Price and Consensus | SVB Financial Group QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, SVB Financial Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if SVB Financial Group passes the test. Thus, it seems as though SIVB shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does SVB Financial Group Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of SVB Financial Group have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including First Financial Northwest (FFNW  -  Free Report), Nicolet Bankshares (NCBS  -  Free Report), and Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 42% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for SIVB, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

264,SIVB,"Gutsy investors with higher risk-taking propensity could go for momentum stocks that can yield impressive returns. In this context, the Driehaus strategy could be used to select the best momentum stocks using the “buy high and sell higher"" principle. The success of this investment approach helped Richard Driehaus secure a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

268,SIVB,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the opening bell. The company is expected to report stable revenues in its Corporate Finance line, the largest revenue contributor at the Moody's Investors Service (“MIS”) division.Backdrop for bond issuance during the first quarter was not quite favorable. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances to some extent. Hence, investment grade bond, high yield bond and leveraged loan issuances volume deteriorated year over year.Nevertheless, Corporate Finance revenues are expected to remain stable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $353 million for the to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, quarterly issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities was healthy. Therefore, Moody’s will likely witness a rise in Structured Finance revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $116 million, reflecting 16% growth from the prior-year quarter.Further, MIS division’s another revenue source — Financial Institutions — is anticipated to report $117 million of revenues, up 4.5% from the prior-year quarter.  Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance unit revenues are projected to remain stable year over year at $98 million as municipal bond issuance slowed in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, the MIS division is projected to witness year-over-year growth in the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the division’s revenues is $688 million, reflecting an increase of 3%.Other Factors at PlayHigher revenues from Moody's Analytics (“MA”) division: Moody’s continues to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service. Given the rise in demand for analytics, the company’s MA division is expected to show a rise in revenues. The division’s all three business units are anticipated to witness higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. So, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its revenues of $422 million indicates a surge of 37.5% from the prior-year quarter.Strategic deals/investments to support revenues: Moody’s is likely to show revenue growth on the back of its strategic acquisitions and investments. These have increased the scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. However, strength of the U.S. dollar is likely to impact quarterly revenues to some extent.Expenses to remain high: As Moody’s continues with its inorganic growth strategy, acquisition and restructuring costs are expected to remain high. So, overall expenses are anticipated to rise during the quarter.Now, let’s see what our quantitative model predicts.According to our proven model, Moody’s has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Moody’s is +3.09%.Zacks Rank: Moody’s carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.78 reflects a year-over-year improvement of 21.1%.

271,SIVB,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after market close. The company is expected to witness an increase in total net interest income (NII) on a year-over-year basis.Driven by an improving economy, purchase volume growth and credit card loans (part of broader consumer loan portfolio) continued to increase during the first quarter. This, along with higher interest rates, is likely to support Capital One’s credit card NII.Moreover, the acquisition of Cabela's Incorporated’s credit card operations in September 2017, is expected to further aid credit card NII growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic credit card NII for the quarter is $3.29 billion, which shows 6.2% year-over-year rise. Also, international credit card NII is projected to be $296 million, increasing 17%. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for credit card NII of $3.54 billion indicates 5.7% growth on a year-over-year basis.Further, the consensus estimate for commercial banking NII of $585 million shows 3.5% year-over-year growth. Also, NII for consumer banking division is expected to be $1.61 billion, up 7.5% from the prior-year quarter.Thus, Capital One will likely report an increase in total NII for to-be-reported quarter.Other Factors at PlayModest fee income growth: Capital One is expected to witness a rise in fee income in the to-be-reported quarter. As the quarter is likely to show increased card usage, interchange fees (major part of its fee income) are expected to rise.Marginal increase in expenses: Similar to the prior quarter, operating expenses are expected to trend upward in the first quarter. Specifically, marketing expenses will likely remain elevated with rising loan growth opportunities.Asset quality to worsen: While improvement in card loans is leading to an increase in interest income, Capital One will continue witnessing a rise in credit card delinquency rates. Also, the charge-off rate in auto finance business will likely increase.Now, let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is +0.79%.Zacks Rank: Capital One has a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the predictive power of ESP.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the quarter of $2.31 reflects year-over-year jump of 32%.

272,SIVB,"SVB Financial Group’s (SIVB  -  Free Report) strong capital position and consistent growth in loans and deposits position it well for future growth. Also, shares of the company have gained 62.7% in the past 12 months, outpacing the 28.6% growth for the industry it belongs to.However, mounting expenses and lack of geographic diversification remain major concerns.Nevertheless, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings have been revised nearly 3.1% upward in the last 30 days, reflecting analyst’s optimism about its earnings growth prospects.Looking at the fundamentals, the company has been witnessing consistent growth in deposits and net interest income (NII) over the past several years. It has seen its non-interest-bearing demand deposits increasing at a CAGR of 14% over the last three years (2014–2016). This change in deposit mix is expected to drive the company’s organic growth.Also, pressure on the company’s net-interest margin (NIM) seems to be easing gradually with improvement in the rate environment. Notably, driven by a consistent growth in loans, management projects NIM to rise further in 2017.Further, the company’s efforts toward improving non-interest income, which constituted nearly 27% of net revenue in the first half of 2017, should further support top-line growth.However, SVB Financial has been witnessing a consistent rise in operating expenses for the past few years, primarily due to rise in compensation and benefit costs. Expenses increased at a CAGR of 12.4% in the last five years (2012–2016).Thus, elevated expenses are expected to hurt the company’s profitability in the near term.Also, the company has minimal international exposure and derives less than 10% of its total revenue from foreign clients. Lack of geographic diversification might hamper the company’s financials in the quarters ahead.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the finance space worth considering are Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (FFKT  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report).Zions Bancorporation has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 8.9% for the current year over the past 30 days.

274,SIVB,"TCF Financial Corporation (TCF  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 33 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents. Moreover, earnings increased 6.5% from the prior-year quarter.Shares of TCF Financial have gained 1.1% following its earnings release, owing to positive market sentiments and investors’ satisfaction with the improvement in net interest income and loans. Also, eased margin pressure supported the results. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provisions.The company reported net income of $60.4 million, up 4.7% from $57.7 million in the prior-year quarter.Revenue Growth Offset by Higher ExpensesTotal revenue came in at $341.8 million in the quarter, up 3.3% year over year. Further, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $338.1 million.Net interest income was up 6.7% year over year to $227.2 million. The rise was mainly attributable to higher interest income on loans and leases, partially offset by decline in interest income on loans held for sale.Net interest margin of 4.52% expanded 17 basis points (bps) year over year due to higher yields on variable and adjustable rate loans.Non-interest income came in at $114.7 million, down 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. The decline was mainly due to lower gains on sale of auto and real estate loans.TCF Financial reported non-interest expenses of $233 million, up 2.5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise mainly reflected significant increases in operating lease depreciation expenses, foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets and equipment-related expenses.As of Jun 30, 2017, average deposits displayed a 1.3% improvement over the previous quarter to $17.3 billion. The increase was mainly due to growth in average checking balance and certificates of deposits, partially offset by decrease in money market balances. Further, average loans and leases inched up 1.6% sequentially to $18.3 billion in the quarter. The rise was due to increase in auto finance, inventory finance and commercial portfolios.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans and leases, increased 5 bps year over year to 0.28%. The rise was primarily due to increased net charge-offs in the commercial and auto finance portfolios, partially offset by decreased net charge-offs in the consumer real estate first mortgage lien portfolio.Moreover, provisions for credit losses were $19.4 million, up 46.8% year over year. This was primarily due to increase in provisions attributable to the auto finance and commercial portfolios, partially offset by decline in provisions attributable to the inventory finance and consumer real estate portfolios.However, non-accrual loans and leases and other real estate owned fell 32% year over year to $158 million.Capital RatiosAs of Jun 30, 2017, common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.24% same as on Dec 31, 2016. Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.49% compared with 13.69% as of Dec 31, 2016. Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.76%, up from 10.73% as of Dec 31, 2016.Our ViewpointTCF Financial’s increasing loans and strong deposit mix keep us encouraged about its organic growth prospects.

Though most banks which reported second-quarter 2017 results this week managed to beat estimates, concerns over the underlying weakness shadowed the optimism.Results demonstrated an upswing in loans and improved margins. However, lower treasury yields curbed the benefits. Additionally, rise in deposit balances and lower provisions driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas loan portfolio were impressive.Investment banking fees were favorable, but fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Also, higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume were on the downside.Though the absence of exceptionally high legal expenses was a big support, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jul 14, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

277,SIVB,"Ratings of SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) have been reiterated by Moody's Investors Service, an arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). The company’s long-term issuer rating and senior debt rating of A3 has been affirmed. Also, the rating agency kept the outlook stable.Further, its main bank subsidiary — Silicon Valley Bank — has been rated Aa3/Prime-1 for deposits with an issuer rating of A3. Also, its standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA) remained at a2 and its counterparty risk assessments at A1(cr)/Prime-1(cr).Reasons for the Ratings AffirmationThe ratings are based on SVB Financial’s earnings strength and impressive asset quality. Also, the company’s robust liquidity and capital position as well as sustainability of its business model supported growth.Per Moody’s, SVB Financial has a “niche business model banking venture capital, private equity, and technology, life science companies.” These provide the company with low-cost funding sources, thus supporting its strong liquidity position.Further, per the rating agency, the company’s credit quality is better than the similarly rated peers, although “its business focus has led to an above-average growth rate, sector concentrations and appetite for sizable single credits”. Though the company witnesses asset quality volatility owing to business model, these are “near the median of similarly-rated peers.”Also, this business model is sustainable as SVB Financial continues to display “expertise and knowledge of the sectors it serves, as well as its long-standing relationships with venture capital and private equity firms.”Moreover, the bank’s strong internal capital generation and absence of shareholder payout help it maintain a solid capital position. The rating agency assesses SVB Financial’s robust liquidity and high capital ratios as buffers to credit volatility and risks related to above-average loan growth.What Could Make Moody's Change the RatingsSVB Financial’s BCA ratings could be revised upward by the rating agency if the company witnesses meaningfully slower pace of loan growth as well as “reduced sector and borrower concentrations” on assumption that other financial metrics are stable.On the flip side, in case SVB Financial’s liquidity position and underwriting standards weakens, the rating agency may downgrade its ratings.Shares of SVB Financial have jumped 58% in the past six months, outperforming 21.2% rally of the industry. SVB Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth a LookA couple of stocks in the same space worth a look are Cathay General Bancorp (CATY  -  Free Report) and Columbia Banking System, Inc.

Its earnings managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 10%.Ally Financial Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ally Financial Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ally Financial Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q1 ResultsManagement expects used vehicle prices to fall. Thus, lease revenues are projected to decline during the to-be-reported quarter owing to a smaller lease portfolio as well as lower used vehicle value. Since the company primarily deals in auto loans, this might have a marginal adverse effect on its earnings in the quarter.Further, given the higher interest rates and Ally Financial’s efforts to diversify into mortgage business, NII is expected to increase in the first quarter.Ally Financial has been making efforts to grow inorganically, introduce new products and diversify operations. Given these initiatives, the company is likely to witness an increase in operating expenses.Also, due to the rise in loan portfolio, provision for loan losses are expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:The chances of Ally Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low.

280,SIVB,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results tomorrow before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by an increase in revenues and long-term inflows, partially offset by higher expenses.Moreover, Invesco has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.4%.Invesco Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  Invesco Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | Invesco Ltd. QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 67 cents decreased 2.9% over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 9.8%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.37 billion, which reflects growth of 14.6% year over year.Invesco’s price performance does not seem very impressive. Its shares have lost 20.2% in the last three months compared with 14.8% decline of the industry.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings? Before having a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to impact the quarter’s results.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsPer the monthly metrics data published by Invesco, its preliminary assets under management (AUM) of $934.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, were marginally down from $937.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2017. The fall in AUM was mainly due to unfavorable market returns and net long-term outflows. Given the decline in AUM in the quarter, the related fee is also not expected to witness improvement.In fact, management expects performance fees for the first quarter to be around $10-$15 million, down from $43 million reported in the prior quarter. Adjusted other revenues are expected to be $16-$17 million.On the cost front, management anticipates compensation expenses to increase sequentially to nearly $410-$415 million in the to-be-reported quarter. The quarter’s results are expected to include the seasonality of payroll taxes, one-month impact from the base salary increases and the impact of higher foreign exchange.The company expects market expenses to be nearly $32 million in the first quarter. Further, property, office and technology costs are expected to be $102-$104 million, stable sequentially.The company expects G&A expenses to be $80-$83 million in first-quarter 2018.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Invesco beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low.

Its earnings and revenues are projected to decline year over year.Last quarter, though the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, results were hurt by a rise in total operating expenses and lower revenues.Santander Consumer USA has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters.Moreover, activities of the company in the third quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 36 cents per share has increased 2.9% over the last 30 days. However, the figure reflects a decline of 39.6% year over year.Notably, Santander Consumer USA’s price performance has been quite impressive. Its shares have gained 13.3% so far this year, outperforming the growth of 3.6% for the industry it belongs to.Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.

Also, other income is expected to remain flat compared with the last quarter.Thus, total revenues are likely to decline in the quarter.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $1.60 billion for the quarter, which is projected to witness a decline of 2.5% year over year and 4.2% sequentially.Management expects operating expenses to increase $5-$10 million on a sequential basis.Due to seasonality, the company expects net charge-offs to be up $220-$240 million sequentially. Thus, overall provisions are expected to be up $110-$150 million on a sequential basis. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net charge-offs of $742 million for the quarter reflects an increase of nearly 44% sequentially.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

282,SIVB,"The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before market open. Its earnings are projected to grow year over year, while revenues are expected to witness a decline.Last quarter, the company reported improved earnings. Results were driven by higher revenues along with lower expenses.However, activities of the company in the third quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 15 cents remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 50%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4.19 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, which is expected to witness a decline of 3.6%.Driven by the gradual improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop, shares of the company have gained 58.4% on the NYSE in a year’s time, outperforming the 25.1% growth of the industry it belongs to.Royal Bank Scotland PLC (The) Price and Consensus  Royal Bank Scotland PLC (The) Price and Consensus | Royal Bank Scotland PLC (The) QuoteRBS, which was bailed out with £45 billion by the British government in 2008, has been striving for growth with several restructuring initiatives. These include cost-reduction measures, reducing geographic footprint and capital build-up efforts, while remaining focused on its strategy to become a smaller and simpler bank.The bank’s ability to cope with the broader industry challenges amid its overhauling moves remains a key area to watch out for this earnings season. So, will the upcoming earnings release lead to further improvement in RBS’ share price?Before getting into a detailed discussion on the factors that are likely to affect Q3 results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if RBS will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for RBS is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 15 cents matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: RBS has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsThe Edinburgh-based banking giant has been experiencing a decline in net fees and commissions for the past few quarters and we do not expect this quarter to display substantial strength. Moreover, the company has downsized its investment banking division, which is likely to witness a decline.As the bank remains focused on expediting its ongoing overhaul, the quarterly results are likely to be marred by further significant restructuring charges. Also, given RBS’ exposure to numerous lawsuits and investigations, the company might have kept additional reserves for litigation expenses, which could dampen the bottom line to some extent.However, expense base might get some respite owing to RBS’ continued cost-control efforts. Additionally, the company might have benefited from the ongoing economic recovery (albeit at a slow pace) in the UK and Ireland — the major domestic markets.Notably, the bank plans to move majority of jobs to India in order to bring down compensation costs. This restructuring move is aimed at boosting the bank’s profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

283,SIVB,"T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on Apr 25, with its revenues and earnings projected to improve year over year. Moreover, growth in assets under management (AUM) is expected.Last quarter, T. Rowe Price outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by rise in revenues. Also, AUM growth remained strong.Further, T. Rowe Price recorded positive earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 6.28%. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.75 remained unchanged over the last seven days. Also, the figure indicates year-over-year rise of 48.31%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.3 billion for the quarter also reflects a jump of 16.36% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, we cannot conclusively predict if T. Rowe Price will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -2.18%.Zacks Rank: T. Rowe Price currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsExpenses to Escalate: The company did not point out anything related to its cost-control initiatives during the quarter. It incurs significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from existing clients. Though T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses to be down in 2018, it is likely that events not currently planned or expected might impact the expense level. Notably, the company anticipates capital expenditures in 2018 to be approximately $180 million, including two-third for technology development.Mutual Fund Products Performance: According to the Morningstar data, T. Rowe Price witnessed around $9.9 billion of net inflows on a combined basis being outflows in U.S. mutual fund products offset by net inflows excluding transfers to other portfolios in the to-be-reported quarter.Though the performance of equity markets disappointed in the first quarter, with the S&P 500 index declining 1.2% sequentially, the company is likely to record a rise in AUM on overall inflows. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for assets under management is $1.02 trillion, up 4.1% sequentially.Insignificant Fee Waivers: Management believes with the gradually improving interest-rate environment, fee waivers in its money market mutual funds and trusts will be insignificant.Revenue Growth: T. Rowe Price’s efforts to improve its operating efficiency have resulted in year-over-year top-line growth over the past few years. We believe the company is well poised to sustain this upbeat uptrend, in the near term. This comes on the back of several planned initiatives largely tied with launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client-engagement capabilities in each distribution channel, strengthening distribution channel in the United States, EMEA, and the Asia Pacific, and improving its technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) is +1.38% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

284,SIVB,"Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, before the opening bell on Apr 26. Earnings are projected to rise year over year, while revenues might decline.Last quarter, Franklin outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by rise in revenues. Also, assets under management (AUM) growth remained strong.Further, Franklin recorded positive earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.34%. Franklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Franklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Franklin Resources, Inc. QuoteNevertheless, activities of the company in the fiscal second quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 75 remained unchanged over the last seven days. However, the figure reflects year-over-year rise of 1.35%.Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, we cannot conclusively predict if Franklin will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Franklin’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsMixed Market Performance: Performance of equity markets remained mixed during the January-March quarter. The S&P 500 Index gained nearly 11.8% year over year, but declined 1.2% sequentially in the quarter. Moreover, the index measuring international equity performance — the MSCI EAFE — climbed around 2.5% year over year, however was down 5.1% sequentially. This is anticipated to likely benefit this California-based asset manager to a lesser extent.Lower AUM: Given Franklin’s AUM disclosure for March 2018 and equity markets performance, its results are predicted to display lower AUM on a sequential basis. In addition, the company is expected to record outflows mainly tied with U.S. and non-U.S. mutual funds. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is expected to edge down 1.2% to $745 million on a sequential basis.Decrease in Revenues: Investment management fees, which mark a significant portion of the company’s revenues, might decline on the back of quarterly market performance. The consensus estimate for investment management fees of $1.1 billion indicates nearly 1% growth year over year. However, sales and distribution fees are projected to be down 3.2% year over year to $417 million in the quarter to be reported.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.6 billion indicates a year-over-year fall of 0.86%.Controlled Expenses: Management remains focused on effective cost control. While potential investments in the technology front might escalate expenses in fiscal 2018, previous cost-cutting initiatives are likely to reflect optimism.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) is +1.38% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

The reported figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 26.3%.Results to a great extent benefitted from improvement in net interest income and lower provisions.

However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $666.8 million.Net interest income increased 11.3% year over year to $522 million.

Further, net interest margin improved 9 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.45%.However, non-interest income amounted to $139 million, declining 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.

286,SIVB,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26 before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Improvement in assets under management (AUM) was another positive.That said, Invesco has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.9%.Moreover, activities of the company in the third quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings increased 3.1% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 10%.Looking at Invesco’s price performance, its shares have gained 22.8% so far this year. However, it underperformed the industry’s growth of 27%.Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Invesco PLC QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q3 earnings? It depends on the company’s ability to impress the market with an earnings beat and improved financials.Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Invesco will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Invesco is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 66 cents matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Invesco has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsPer the monthly metrics data published by Invesco, its AUM as of Sep 30, 2017 of $917.5 billion was up nearly 6.8% from the Jun 30, 2017 level. The rise in AUM for the third quarter is driven by favourable market returns and net long-term inflows. Thus, given the improvement in AUM in the quarter, the related fee should also witness an increase, thereby supporting revenue growth.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.31 billion, which is projected to witness growth of 9.4%.Invesco’s expenses in the quarter are likely to witness a marginal increase. Management expects property, office and technology expenses to increase and be in the range of $92-$94 million, owing to the large technology-related projects being put into service and a rise in outsourced administration expenses.Nevertheless, market expenses are expected to stay flat in the quarter, while G&A expenses are projected to be in line or slightly elevated from the second-quarter levels.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Legg Mason, Inc.

288,SIVB,"SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, SVB Financial’s earnings improved year over year. Higher revenues and loan growth aided results. However, higher adjusted non-interest expenses and rise in provisions were the undermining factors.Also, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 12.2%. SVB Financial Group Price and EPS Surprise  SVB Financial Group Price and EPS Surprise | SVB Financial Group QuoteHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter moved 1.9% downward to $3.13 over the last 30 days. Notably, the figure represents a year-over-year surge of 63.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $535.6 million for the quarter, reflecting 25.2% year-over-year growth.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsIncrease in net interest income: Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial loans (constituting a major part of SVB Financial’s loan portfolio) recorded improvement in the first quarter while growth in real estate loans remained modest. Overall, the quarter witnessed a marginal jump in lending activities on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $49.6 billion for the quarter represents a rise of 13.4% year over year. This, along with modest loan growth and higher interest rates will likely support the bank’s net interest income in the to-be-reported quarter.Fee income to rise: SVB Financial’s first-quarter non-interest income will benefit from rise in service charge on deposits as deposit balance is expected to increase in the quarter. Also, given the increase in credit card related consumer loans during the quarter, the company’s credit card fees are expected to rise.Thus, SVB Financial’s non-interest income is expected to witness a slight increase in to-be-reported quarter.Likely rise in expenses: SVB Financial’s adjusted non-interest expenses are expected to increase due to its continued spending on technology systems overhaul and investment in franchise.Asset quality not likely to lend much support: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for allowance for loan losses of $268 million reflects an increase of 10.3% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the consensus estimate for non-performing asset of $125 million indicates a decline of 10.1%.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of SVB Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high.

289,SIVB,"Huntington Bancshares (HBAN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.The company’s first-quarter results are expected to reflect the support from robust organic growth and benefits of strategic moves.Rising interest rates might have worked in favor too. Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent, pressure on Huntington’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the rate hikes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion for revenues indicates a 5.5% year-over-year improvement.Huntington has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 2.1%. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteLast quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues, continual growth in both loan and deposit balances, and lower provisions were among the positives. However, elevated expenses were the primary headwind.Activities of Huntington during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained unchanged at 28 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year jump of 33.3%.Notably, Huntington’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 3.7% for the three-month period ended Mar 31, 2018, outperforming 2.7% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, we cannot conclusively predict if Huntington will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.77%.Zacks Rank: Huntington currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsRevenues to Grow: Revenues are expected to grow in line with the company’s long-term financial goals, including synergies from the FirstMerit acquisition.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might perk up interest income. Notably, management’s projections of 2018 NIM to remain flat year over year on a GAAP basis as expansion in NIM is anticipated to offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well.Credit Quality to Normalize: Overall, credit quality is expected to remain at the current levels. However, in the quarter to be reported, moderate volatility can be recorded given the reduction in problem assets and credit costs, and volatility in the commodities and currency market. Notably, loan loss provisions are likely to gradually normalize and net charge-offs might remain below the long-term target range of 35-55 basis points.Expenses under Control: Though management remains focused on expense management, we remain apprehensive due to the company’s continued investments in business. However, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm’s earnings unusually in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company projects non-interest expenses to be down 2-4% in 2018, the impact of which is likely to reflect in the first-quarter results.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) is +1.38% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

290,SIVB,"Legg Mason (LM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31) results on Apr 25, after the market closes. This asset management company is expected to witness a rise in other service revenues, while distribution and service fees will likely register a decline.Given the increase in assets under management (the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $775 billion shows 6.5% year-over-year rise) during the quarter, Legg Mason’s performance fees are projected to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees of $30 million reflects 15.7% growth from the prior-year quarter. Nonetheless, management expects non-pass through (NPT) performance fees of $15-$25 million in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for other service revenues of $1.13 million indicates a fall of 18.9% from the last-year quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $759.3 million indicates a rise of 5% year over year.On the cost front, management predicts compensation ratio to be up 54-56%, reflecting seasonal compensation rise and lower NPT performance fees.

291,SIVB,"Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (SC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens. While its earnings for the quarter are projected to remain stable year over year, revenues are expected to decline.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Elevated expenses, and lower net finance and other interest income hurt the results.Nonetheless, the company has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 12.8%.Notably, activities of the company in the first quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 40 cents declined 2.4% over the last 30 days.Further, Santander Consumer USA’s price performance has been disappointing. Its shares have lost 15.8% so far this year compared with a 5.6% decline for the industry it belongs to.Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.

QuoteWill the dismal price performance continue post first-quarter earnings release or will the trend reverse? It depends on the company’s ability to impress the market with improved financials.Factors to Impact Q1 ResultsManagement expects net finance and other interest income to be flat or up 2% sequentially, driven by origination volume. Total other income is projected to be up $55 million to $75 million, given the seasonality and lower Bluestem balances.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $1.61 billion for the quarter, which reflects a decline of 1.1% year over year.Management expects operating expenses to be in the range of $289-$309 million in the to-be-reported quarter. This is up from adjusted expenses of $269 million recorded in fourth-quarter 2017.Driven by improving credit performance and depending on new originations, provision expenses are expected to be down $20 million from the prior quarter. Further, the company expects hurricane benefits to reverse mostly in the first quarter.Now, let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our quantitative model shows that chances of Santander Consumer USA beating the earnings estimates this time are low.

Further, the bottom line jumped 30.3% from the year-ago figure.The results were primarily driven by higher net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. A decline in provision for credit losses was also a positive for the company. Moreover, loan and deposit balances showed strength, and overall credit quality witnessed improvement. However, higher non-interest expense remained a headwind.Net income available to stockholders was $123.2 million, up 32.5% year over year.Increased Revenue Offsets Rise in ExpensesSVB Financial’s net revenue for the quarter was $471.2 million, up 19% year over year.

A rise in all expense components led to this increase.Non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio increased to 54.32% from 50.58% in the prior-year quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates lower profitability.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, SVB Financial’s net loans amounted to $20.7 billion, up 2.5% from the prior quarter, while total deposits rose 3.4% to $41.1 billion.Enhanced Asset QualityThe ratio of allowance for loan losses to total gross loans came in at 1.12%, down 17 bps year over year.

Also, non-GAAP return on average equity was 12.75%, up from 10.83% in the prior-year quarter.2017 OutlookSVB Financial provided the updated 2017 guidance based on the assumption of no further change in interest rate during the year. Average loan balance is expected to grow at a percentage rate in the mid teens. Further, average deposit balance is projected to rise in the high single-digits rate.Further, NII is expected to rise at a percentage rate in the high teens to low twenties, while NIM is anticipated in the range of 3.00–3.10%.Moreover, the company anticipates core fee income, including foreign exchange fees, deposit service charges, credit card fees, lending related fees, client investment fees as well as letters of credit fees, to increase at a percentage rate in the mid teens.Further, non-interest expense, net of non-controlling interests, is projected to increase at a percentage rate in the low teens.On the credit quality front, net loan charge-offs are expected in the range of 0.3–0.5% of average total gross loans. Allowance for loan losses for total gross performing loans, as a percentage of total gross performing loans, is expected to remain flat year over year.Non-performing loans, as a percentage of total gross loans, are anticipated in the range of 0.60–0.80%.Our ViewpointThe company remains well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities on the back of its sturdy capital position and consistent growth in loans and deposits. Moreover, its focus on improving non-interest income is expected to support top-line growth. Also, it remains well positioned to benefit from an improved rate scenario. However, mounting operating expenses will likely weigh on the company’s performance in the near term.SVB Financial Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SVB Financial Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SVB Financial Group QuoteSVB Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
