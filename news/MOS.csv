5,MOS,"Dividend stocks come in all shapes and sizes. And seasons.The name CF Industries (CF) recently cropped up on IBD's Dividend Leaders list, just as Corn Belt farmers should be rolling into their spring planting season. This year's weather has been uncooperative, however, keeping farmers from their fields by spreading snow, rain and heavy winds from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest.Still, analyst consensus projects the equivalent of a 476% rebound in CF's EPS to 94 cents a share this year, followed by an 85% gain in 2019 to $1.74. CF lost 25 cents a share in 2017. The Deerfield, Ill., company exited nine quarters of earnings declines in the fourth quarter. Its Q1 EPS is forecast to rise 400%.The stock's chart is not pretty. Its price has slipped 9% since the start of the year. Shares are just climbing off support at their 40-week moving average. They could be building a base, but have got a ways to go. And the stock's dragging relative strength line is not what you want to see, even from dividend stocks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd yet CF may be worth putting on your radar. Some analysts project that the entire fertilizer industry is set for a cyclical upturn. Two of the industry's largest names, Potash Saskatchewan and Agrium, combined in January to form Nutrien (NTR). The merger tightened competition and provided the industry added control over manufacturing and supply. Consensus estimates expect Nutrien's earnings to soar 420% this year and 27% in 2019.Susquehanna Financial group trimmed its earnings outlook for CF Industries in late March, as bad weather pointed to delays in purchases of nitrogen fertilizer. Susquehanna also dropped the stock's 12-month price target to 50 from 54. The target is still more than 30% above where the stock traded on Monday.CF currently pays a 30-cent quarterly dividend per share, so the stock yields 3.1% annually. The company paid down $1.1 billion of high-interest debt at the end of 2017. Analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group project the company will pay down an additional $500 million in debt this year.Next to flashy tech and big defense names, fertilizers seem like a sleepy little sideline industry. But the stocks wowed investors with a collective run-up of more than 1,100% from 2002 to 2008. The group crashed along with the market, then ran up an additional 316% from 2008 to 2013.The Potash/Agrium merger left CF, Mosaic (MOS) and Nutrien as the leading publicly traded players in a vast and vitally important industry. Only CF and Nutrien are dividend stocks. But all of the stocks in the group vary according to several factors. One is the price of corn and soybeans. Two of the most widely planted North American crops, they also require the most intensive use of fertilizers.But the trade tiff between the U.S. and China have left corn prices uncertain, to say the least. Prices on Monday were up 8%. That sounds OK, but it is also 11% below corn's high from last July.Another factor: crude oil prices. The use of corn-based ethanol as an extender for U.S. gasoline supplies has kept corn and oil prices fairly closely related. It has also typically made fertilizer stocks an aggressive way to tap oil price gains.Between August 2006 and June 2008, for example, the stocks in IBD's Chemicals-Agricultural industry group staged a massive 453% rally. That corresponded precisely to a 155% run-up in U.S. oil prices during that same period.In addition, other factors amplified the 2008 fertilizer rally. For one, phosphorus rock was in comparatively short supply. Today, the links between fertilizer stocks and oil prices are somewhat weakened.As a group, fertilizer stocks on Monday traded up 24% from a June 2017 low. Crude oil prices climbed 60% during that same period.At the same time, the price of natural gas fell 10%. And nitrogen production capacity is now in relatively tight supply. Analysts project that this combination of tight supply, low raw-material costs and recovering demand is ultimately going to play in strong favor of the big fertilizer names.Susquehanna's March 28 note said the analysts remained ""positive on the nitrogen cycle."" The analysts continue to expect a multiyear up cycle ""due to lagging global capacity growth that should be outpaced by even modest demand growth.""CF's five-year dividend growth rate is 31%, although it has not raised its payout since August 2014.RELATED:Why You Want To Pay Attention To These Earnings Reports Oracle Chief Tells Trump Pentagon Cloud Plan Makes 'No Sense' Apple, Intel Lead Five Tech Titans That Just Carved This Bullish Pattern

12,MOS,"Last week, Democrats and many in the mainstream media became highly perturbed by the Trump administration's suggestion that the United States might tie continued foreign aid to support for its agenda abroad.Foreign dictators agreed. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who spent the last year arresting dissidents, announced, ""Mr. Trump, you cannot buy Turkey's democratic free will with your dollars, our decision is clear.""Herein lies the great irony of the United Nations: While it's the Mos Eisley of international politics — a hive of scum and villainy — and it votes repeatedly to condemn the United States and Israel, the tyrannies that constitute the body continue to oppress their own peoples.XAmong those who voted last week to condemn the U.S. for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving its embassy to Jerusalem were North Korea, Iran, Yemen and Venezuela. Why exactly should the United States ever take advice from those nations seriously?We shouldn't. And we should stop sending cash to an organization that operates as a front for immoral agenda items.The United Nations spends the vast majority of its time condemning Israel: According to UN Watch, the U.N. Human Rights Council issued 135 resolutions from June 2006 to June 2016, 68 of which were against Israel; the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization only passes resolutions against Israel; and the U.N. General Assembly issued 97 resolutions from 2012 through 2015, 83 of which targeted Israel.Meanwhile, the U.N. has done nearly nothing with regard to Syria. It has instead suggested that Israel turn over the Golan Heights to the Syrian regime. The U.N. can't even successfully prevent the slaughter of the Rohingya in Myanmar. But they certainly have something say about whether the United States ought to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOne of the great lies of the Obama administration was that diplomacy is a foreign policy. We often heard from it that the only two alternatives were diplomacy and war. That was the stated reason for pursuing a one-sided nuclear deal with Iran that left Iran with burgeoning regional power and legitimacy. ""What? Do you want a war or something?"" it asked.But the moment that the Trump administration uses tools of diplomacy, including financial pressure, to achieve American ends, the left complains. Would it prefer war? Diplomacy is a tool, not a foreign policy, and the use of diplomacy to pressure other nations to follow our lead is not only smart but also necessary.That is why the Trump administration was exactly right to negotiate a $285 million cut to the U.N.'s budget. Now we ought to slash our contributions to the counterproductive organization, since we pay one-fifth of the total bill.The U.N. has always been a foolish fantasy, a League of Nations knockoff that's been about as productive and twice as irritating. It's an outmoded organization that's outlived whatever small usefulness it once had. There's no reason for us to continue cutting checks to prop up regimes that condemn us publicly for exercising the most basic standards of morality.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Its lead drug is Amitiza, used to treat constipation, and Rescula, an eye drug to treat open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.Sucampo is closing in quickly on its Nov. 30 intraday high of 17.54. A heavy-volume above that price level would be bullish.RELATED:Russian Ambassador To Turkey Assassinated In Syria RetaliationFANG Stock Pullback A Buying Opportunity: Canaccord GenuityApplied Materials Downgraded; 3 Other Chip Gear Makers Rated BuyDisney's Studio Cash Cow Continues To Moo, Even As ESPN Woes SimmerLennar Tops Q4 Earnings Views; Optimistic About Trump, Cautious On Margins

17,MOS,"Tuesday's weak-volume session did little to influence the market's status, although the Nasdaq did edge to a fresh high and the Dow snugged nearer to the 20,000 mark.The Nasdaq swung up nearly 0.5% for the day, notching a new closing high after briefly topping 5500 in morning trade. The S&P 500 clocked a 0.2% advance, while the Dow industrials added 0.1%. Small caps and tech issues were largely in sync, with the Russell 200 also finishing 0.5% higher.Better-than-forecast October home price data and a gain of almost 2% in oil prices gave Tuesday's session a positive nudge across an array of industries, but energy and steel were leading beneficiaries.Canadian Solar (CSIQ) beamed up 6% in above-average trade, crossing back above its 50-day moving average in the process.Olympic Steel (ZEUS) popped more than 5%, although trading volume was weak. Coal miner Alliance Holdings (AHGP) surged 5%, CNX Coal Resources (CNXC) swung up more than 8%, rising further above its rising 50-day line.CNX Coal was spun off by Consol Energy and debuted on July 1 at 15 a share.Apple (AAPL) outpaced its Dow peers, rising 0.8% in soft action. Shares ended a shade more than 1% below a 118.42 cup base buy point.On the downside, Nike (NKE) slipped 1.2%, still unable to gain any altitude above its 50-day moving average.Rising oil prices lifted energy stocks to many of the S&P 500's best gains. But IBD 50 stock Nvidia (NVDA) topped the S&P 500 with a 6% gain in better-than double its average volume. The move put the chipmaker 98% above the stock's 200-day moving average, and violated an upper channel line in the stock's advance. Both are technical sell signals.Among other IBD 50 stocks, LogMeIn (LOGM) popped 3% in light trade, rising to test the underside of its 50-day moving average. The stock is beginning the fifth week of a flattish consolidation.Two of the S&P 500's top advances on Tuesday came from fertilizer makers. CF Industries (CF) climbed 4%. Mosaic (MOS) gained 3%. Both advances occurred in weak trade.Watch for CF and Mosaic to potentially break out of bottoming base patterns following their long declines. CF has fallen more than 70% below a 70.32 high marked in July 2015.No significant earnings releases are due out Wednesday, and the only major release on the economic calendar is pending home sales news for November from the National Association of Realtors.RELATED:Ross, Burlington Offer Retail Havens: Investing Action PlanStock Market Today: Why Nvidia Is Surging, And Why A Correction May Be DueInvesting In Big-Cap Techs: When Did Apple First Break Out This Year?

18,MOS,"Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (POT) and Agrium (AGU), Canada's largest fertilizer producers, agreed to an all-share merger to create the world's largest crop-nutrient supplier with a market value of about $27 billion.The deal will give Potash Corp. shareholders 52% of the new producer, which has yet to be named, while Agrium investors will hold the rest, the companies said Monday in a joint statement. Agrium Chief Executive Officer Chuck Magro will be CEO of the combined group while Potash Corp. leader Jochen Tilk will become executive chairman. The new company will be based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the current location of Potash Corp.'s headquarters.It's the latest in a string of mega deals in the agricultural chemicals market announced in the past year as producers of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds struggle with low commodity prices and weak demand.Negotiations between Bayer and Monsanto (MON), the world's largest seed company, are advancing after the German company's $56 billion takeover bid. China National Chemical Corp. agreed in February to acquire Swiss pesticide maker Syngenta (SYT) for about $43 billion, while DuPont (DD) and Dow Chemical (DOW) plan to merge and then carve out a new crop-science unit.IBD'S TAKE: Bayer last week sweetened its offer for Monsanto, which has rejected earlier bids. But a deal would vault Bayer to the top of crop products overnight.Putting together Agrium and Potash Corp. will create a company that not only produces commodity fertilizer but also sells it directly to farmers through a North American network of retail stores. Potash Corp. is largely a mining company, extracting potash in underground mines, while Agrium got 77% of its revenue last year from its retail arm.In Monday's deal, described by both sides as a merger of equals, Potash Corp. investors will get 0.4 of a share in the new company for each share they own now while Agrium shareholders will get 2.23 shares. Potash Corp. gained 2.8% to $17.45 at 7:54 a.m. in premarket trading in New York while Agrium had yet to trade after closing last week at $95.21.The companies expect to generate cost savings of $500 million a year through the merger. They said they're committed to marketing group Canpotex Ltd, their joint venture with U.S. fertilizer company Mosaic (MOS) that handles all three companies' potash exports outside of North America.""This is a transformational merger that creates benefits and growth opportunities that neither company could achieve alone,"" Agrium's Magro said. ""Combining our complementary assets will enable us to serve our customers more efficiently, deliver significant operating synergies and improve our cash flows to provide capital returns and invest in growth.""The deal will be implemented by a plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is expected to close in mid-2017. The merged company will employ about 20,000 people and have investments in 18 countries.

19,MOS,"Sales growth is an important gauge. But growing sales don't tell you whether a company is truly a top-shelf or bottom-rung player. And it doesn't tell you if a company might be slashing prices to move its inventory.Profit margins can add several important dimensions to your research.Sales provide capital to fuel a company's operations. Profits reveal how effectively the company achieves those sales. They also show how much muscle an outfit builds to reinvest in operations, to develop and market new products, and to offer employees incentives to innovate and excel.To gauge a company's profits, take a look at pretax margins.Pretax margins can be sliced and diced a number of ways, but they aim to show earnings, before taxes, as a percentage of overall revenue. (EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a similar measure, showing a company's profitability minus the effects of accounting and financing strategies.)Margins can vary widely from industry to industry. But the ratio provides a good gauge of peer strength in any particular industry group.Among fertilizer makers, for example, CF Industries (CF) generated a 45% pretax margin in 2011. That is well above Mosaic's (MOS) 26% margin and the 13% margin for Agrium (AGU). But it lagged Terra Nitrogen (TNH), a master limited partnership that sported a 64% pretax ratio.Part of that difference is due to the companies' differing focus on nitrogen-based fertilizers. Nitrogen products have commanded somewhat higher prices this year, while the basic raw material -- natural gas -- has been unusually cheap.Agrium is more diversified, with just over a third of its pretax earnings coming from nitrogen last year. Nitrogen was more than 90% of CF Industries' pretax take, while Mosaic, on the other hand, is focused on phosphate and potassium-based fertilizers.After-tax margins help dig a little deeper. In IBD's market columns, writers frequently point out a company's margin changes on a year-over-year basis.CF's after-tax margin was 26.4% in the first quarter of 2012. That was only slightly below the fourth-quarter peak of 27.3%. Measured on year over year, CF has increased its after-tax margins in four consecutive quarters.Agrium has increased after-tax margins in eight straight quarters. Its Q1 after-tax margin was 5.7%, down sharply from 11.9% in Q4 and well below the 21.6% high notched in Q4 2008. Again, CF is on better footing.IBD's combined Sales Growth, Profit Margins and Return on Equity grade, called the SMR Rating, also incorporates margin strength. CF Industries, Agrium and Terra Nitrogen carry SMR Ratings of A. Mosaic's SMR Rating is a B.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the July 16, 2012, edition of IBD. CF's pretax margin was 31.6% in 2015 -- by itself, a high number, yet that margin has fallen for four years in a row. In 2011, CF's pretax margin was 45.1%.

20,MOS,"The majority of ETFs in the IBD ETF Sector Rotation index at the time of the Brexit sell-off escaped without major damage -- in particular the ones with more metals exposure.Specifically, any ETF with exposure to gold prices came out better for the wear. Gold became more attractive as a store of wealth as the surprise Brexit vote sent global bond yields plunging.Global X Silver Miners (SIL) made a new high the past week. The price of silver closely tracks that of gold, and the fund's main holdings had a good week. Shares of metals miner Fresnillo, one of Global X's major holdings, surged about 30% on the London Stock Exchange following the Brexit vote. Silver Wheaton (SLW) broke out of an ascending base to a new high. Pan American Silver (PAAS) cleared a 16.59 buy point Friday.SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (XME), one of the most gold-heavy ETFs, broke out past the 25.66 buy point of a cup-with-handle pattern.The iShares MSCI All Peru (EPU) ETF has made up all its post-Brexit losses, which were minor to begin with. The ETF, profiled in this space last week, continues to work on a new base with a 31.52 buy point. Major mining holdings in the fund, Buenaventura (BVN) and the Canadian-traded shares of Fortuna Silver Mines (FSM), are near 52-week highs.First Trust Materials (FXZ) has recouped nearly all of a 6.7% two-day plunge.  First Trust Materials is largely a cyclical-stock play. Other major holdings include Steel Dynamics (STLD) and fertilizer giant Mosaic (MOS). One-third of the ETF is in chemical stocks, and about 16% is in mining.PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio (PEY) has only minor holdings in materials, yet the ETF weathered the Brexit slide quite well. Shares dipped just below the 50-day moving average, where they started to rebound and are now close to a new high.VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT) tumbled 7% Monday and Tuesday. The ETF -- which targets companies that Morningstar considers undervalued and which have a competitive advantage -- was hurt mainly by financials with European exposure, such as CBRE Group (CBG), Visa (V), American Express (AXP) and State Street (STT).But many of its holdings (40 companies that are pretty evenly divided in weighting) have already recuperated from the two-day slide.                The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

21,MOS,"Although one-third of First Trust Materials AlphaDEX ETF (FXZ) is in chemical companies, its most interesting stocks are smaller holdings in the building trades.It's in that batch that investors will find Masco (MAS), Watsco (WSO), Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and other building-supply companies that have become among the best performing in the market today.Masco broke out past a 30.71 buy point in March and is near new highs after finding support at the 50-day moving average. The cabinetry maker's earnings growth ramped up 26%, 61% and 78% the past three quarters. Sales gains have been in single digits, however.Martin Marietta, a provider of asphalt, concrete and other aggregates, has surged more than 75% from its Feb. 9 low. Vulcan, another supplier to the heavy-construction industry, is at multiyear highs after an impressive climb since January. The two are growing thanks to the rise in home construction (April new home sales were at an eight-year high) and new funding for roads and bridges.Watsco has pulled back from its April high, but is holding on to most of its 2016 advance. Valspar (VAL) is another top holding, although the paint maker is being acquired by rival Sherwin-Williams. The stock soared to record highs in March on news of the deal and has been flat since then.Fastenal (FAST), a construction supply retailer, is 3.1% of the total fund. Shares are consolidating but trading below the 50-day moving average.At its core, First Trust Materials is a cyclical-stock play. Its major holdings include Dow Chemical (DOW), Steel Dynamics (STLD), fertilizer giant Mosaic (MOS) and paper producer Domtar (UFS). Although some major holdings are well off 52-week highs, it's not that they're all dogs. Dow and Steel Dynamics made big strides earlier in the year.One-third of the ETF is in chemical stocks, about 16% in mining and 15% in packaging. Building and construction companies make up a combined 18%, according to the fund's website.First Trust Materials tracks an enhanced index developed by NYSE Group that selects stocks from the Russell 1000 based on growth factors including three-, six- and 12-month price performance.

22,MOS,"Travis Mills will sometimes begin a motivational speech by asking people to “snap your fingers and wiggle your toes.” When they do, he tells them, “Your life isn’t that bad.”The audience knows what he means. Mills, a retired Army staff sergeant, is a rare soldier to survive a quadruple amputation.In sharing his story to inspired crowds, he isn’t after sympathy. “I really say that as a joke, to show them my funny side,” he told IBD.Still, his message -- subliminal or not -- is clear: You can overcome everything. In 2012, on his third deployment to Afghanistan and leading an 82nd Airborne squad searching for weapons, he put down his rucksack in an area that supposedly was cleared of mines. It wasn’t. An  improvised explosive device went off, effectively severing all his limbs and nearly killing him.Mills writes about this and much more in his newly published memoir, “Tough as They Come.”Mills, 29, had an all-American, Norman Rockwell, small-town upbringing in Vassar, Mich. He was big -- 6 feet 3 inches, 250 pounds when he enlisted -- and athletic, having been a three-sport starter in high school.He attended local colleges but discovered that the course he really needed wasn’t offered: How Do You Pay Off Your College Debt 101. So, in early 2006, he enlisted, and though he had a choice of MOS (military occupational specialty), he decided on airborne.After extensive training, he made the cut and, along with the rest of the 82nd, deployed in January 2007 to Afghanistan's Forward Operating Base Salerno, named for the Allies’ World War II landing in Italy in 1943.Mills had a relatively cushy 15 months, during which he never fired his rifle.He returned home in April 2008. He married his sweetheart, Kelsey Buck, in June, and the pair settled in at Fort Bragg, N.C., for a year before Travis deployed again.It happened in August 2009, when his unit was sent to Camp Stone near the Afghan city of Herat. It was dusty, dirty duty. In his year there, he took only four showers. He called home to discover that his grandmother and a beloved uncle had died, so it was a time of great pain.It also provided learning experiences, including the realization that with rank -- he was a sergeant -- comes responsibility. Though one of his men had good intentions, he disobeyed an order. The soldier had been told to stay by the squad’s truck to monitor the radio. But when a wounded Taliban fighter was being carried out of a house the unit had just attacked, he rushed to help his comrades. Leaving the radio unattended was wrong.The offender had to be disciplined, but that’s easier said than done when the soldier is a friend and bunkmate. “You have to take friendship out of the equation when you are in the military,” Mills said. “We were close friends. We went through training together, but I just happened to be promoted above him. He had to be punished, either lose rank and pay, or I had to come up with something for him to do.”Mills chose the lesser of the two evils and assigned the soldier to a month of -- how to put this delicately? -- burning the platoon’s poop. At first, the guilty party ranted and didn’t want to listen. But Mills couldn’t back down: “I needed to be able to rely on my junior NCOs. We had a few heated words, but I realized I had to step up and be the leader the situation called for.”Another example of a lesson learned occurred when Mills’ truck broke a tire rod, leaving him and his squad stuck overnight in the middle of nowhere because no assistance was available. They had to hunker down out in the open for the night.“The only thing I could control in that situation was my attitude,” he said. “Getting mad wasn’t going to be helpful. I could either laugh or cry. I chose to laugh. We could be getting shot at. It could be snowing. We could be cold and wet. We could be locked away in a Taliban prison somewhere.“With that new perspective, I started to laugh right there on the side of the road. Laughing became my default because I knew things could always be worse.” Indeed, help came the next day.Mills’ deployment provided him with a new perspective, a sense of accomplishment, something that he noticed particularly when he rotated home and visited Vassar. Numerous friends were still living at home with their parents. Even many of those who had graduated from school were looking for work or an internship.“I’d had adventures and stories,” he said. “I’d been in charge of a $1.5 million piece of equipment (a Humvee), and I was in charge of two people who I told when to shoot and when not to shoot. And I was 21 years old. My friends were finishing off college and weren’t sure what they were going to do. I was grateful for the opportunity the Army gave me.”In February 2012, his unit was set to return to the front. Now the father of daughter Chloe and with two deployments behind him, Travis could have opted out. But he’d selected, trained and bonded with the men for a year.“As an NCO (noncommissioned officer), your job is to lead, protect and inspire your guys,” he said. “If they were going overseas, there was no way I’d let them go alone.”Zachary Lewis left a cushy financial planning job to enlist. After 18 months of training to be an officer and Ranger, he joined the 82nd as a second lieutenant and Mills’ platoon leader.“I think my main thoughts leading up to and certainly during deployment was constantly thinking about the guys, wondering if you’ve done everything to make sure they’re safe,” Lewis told IBD.In that regard, said Lewis, one of his best aides was Mills, whose “biggest asset was that he was singularly focused on getting his squad ready for combat. Nothing else mattered to him. He didn’t cut any corners. He wanted all training to be realistic.“His squad loved him, and not because he was easy on them. He was tough but never asked them to do what he wouldn’t.”Lewis loved Mills too: “How you do or do not get along with your NCOs is going to dictate your success” as a young officer.And the two hit it off. “He’s a big jokester,” said Lewis. “I weighed 170 pounds, and he’d come in and pick me up and bear-hug me and kind of throw me around. He helped me assimilate into the platoon.”That third deployment had Mills stationed at an outback post near Kandahar. One day, just two months after he arrived, he placed his rucksack down and ...Medics worked to stabilize him in the field, and he was evacuated to medical facilities in Afghanistan, then Germany and finally the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, D.C.It was while in the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany that he became aware of the extent of his injuries. His initial reaction was anger. He wanted to quit and didn’t want to speak to anyone, including his wife.“When my wife came in (to my room at Walter Reed), I didn’t want to talk to her,” Mills said. “I didn’t want to be a burden, for her to have to carry me. And I was afraid my little girl was going to scream when she saw me.”That didn’t happen. “She (Kelsey) assured me we were going to get through this together,” he said.Mills soon started experiencing phantom pain from his limbs. It became so bad that he was placed in a coma via ketamine, a horse tranquilizer.When he came out of it, a number of revelations arose. For one, the pain was gone. For another, he came to realize that the disaster had a plus side. His limbs had been blown off cleanly, with no burns. He didn’t require skin grafts. All he had to do was heal.Finally, he was visited by Marine Cpl. Todd Nicely, another rare quadruple amputee to survive his injuries. Nicely told Mills that his life would get better, even normal. It inspired the wounded soldier ... to get into a fight with his doctor.Mills wanted to start rehab immediately. The doctor said that it was too soon, that he had to be patient. Mills was patient -- for half an hour. Then he paged the doctor again. He paged him every half-hour for four hours until the doctor relented and let him start the arduous process.Amazingly, on June 7, 2012, less than two months after his injuries, Mills took his first steps on prostheses. By August, he was allowed to leave the hospital for several days at a time to travel home to North Carolina. The next month he participated in a five-kilometer race.In November 2013, he was so improved, his therapy ended. By then, he had decided to pay it forward. In the same way that Nicely inspired him to go on, Mills made it his mission to do the same for other wounded soldiers.“They called me the mayor of the warrior transition building at Walter Reed,” he said.Doctors asked him to see troubled patients. He understood what they were growing through and reassured them there is a future.He noted: “You ask yourself, 'Am I a bad person? Does God hate me? How am I going to go on with my life?’ I tell them, 'You’re not bad. You will get through this.’ ”Mills' mission continues. He and Kelsey have formed a nonprofit, via TravisMills.org, that runs a campground near their home in Maine for wounded vets and their families, who can come and enjoy the outdoors, go fishing, have a lobster bake and even take advantage of on-site counseling.A surviving quadruple amputee.Overcame: Desire to quit.Lesson: It’s possible to overcome the worst personal tragedies with grit.“Once I realized it could be done and I realized there was a future for me, I wouldn’t let anything or anyone stop me.”

35,MOS,"Stocks for a number of fertilizer makers, led by Calgary, Alberta-based Agrium (AGU) are climbing as companies raise dividends and see analysts ratchet up earnings projections for 2015.Agrium announced Jan. 22 it had raised its dividend payout ratio to 40% to 50% of free cash flow. That was up from its prior target of 25% to 35%. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp. (POT) cranked up its dividend to 38 cents per share from 35.The fertilizer industry is easy to underestimate. In reality, the trade has a bewildering number of moving parts. They start with operations to mine inputs including phosphate rock and potash, and others to refine ammonium nitrate. The supply/demand scenario of each of those strongly affects profit. So do fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Weather, and the balance of plantings between corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops — both in the U.S. and overseas — drive demand on an annual basis. And massive supply contracts, such as the one inked Jan. 22 by Canpotex — a consortium owned by Potash Corp., Mosaic (MOS) and Agrium — provide significant visibility into exports to China and India's massive fertilizer markets.Fertilizer stocks have been reeling since a potash price crash in 2013. A Jan. 15 Goldman Sachs note maintained ""a bearish view on potash pricing"" for 2015, partly due to oncoming Canadian production capacity and to the end of sanctions vs. potash-rich Belarus in December. U.S. nitrogen margins ""remain resilient,"" the note said, supported by ongoing weak natural gas prices.But the note upgraded Deerfield, Ill.-based CF Industries (CF) to buy from hold, noting prospects for a doubling of its dividend (currently $1.50 quarterly) within two years. The stock has been trading tightly and notching new highs after clearing a three-month consolidation in January.Agrium cleared an eight-week cup base on Jan. 22 with a 5% spike in heavy trade. The stock is ticking off new highs, trading 4% above the 104.03 buy point on Tuesday as it works to climb out of a two-year hole. Agrium reports its Q4 results Feb. 24.Mosaic has been climbing from an October low, decisively retaking 10- and 40-week support in the past four weeks.

75,MOS,"Investors should always strive to buy leading stocks at proper buy points when the market is rising.The proper buy point is when a stock takes out the left-side high or when it clears a handle by at least 10 cents. But for more aggressive traders, sometimes it's prudent to use a lower entry.One of the easiest ways to find a lower entry point is to simply draw a trend line across the highs of a base or in a handle. The idea is to buy once the stock breaks above the trend line, which represents an area of resistance.Sometimes, using this method can get you in several points lower than the traditional left-side high buy point. It can even get you in lower than that of a handle's buy point. In this case, the difference can be small.It takes time to stalk and draw a proper trend line. But another benefit of buying stocks using the trend line is that it may prevent you from being stopped out if a shakeout occurs once the stock takes out the traditional entry.Remember, this method is more art than science. Unlike standard buy points, where you add 10 cents to a high, the precise buy point using trend lines can be hard to pinpoint.Another thing: Just because a stock breaks above a trend line does not mean that everything is good from here. You can still be prone to whipsaw action.You should generally draw trend lines on a daily chart. The downward trend line should connect at least three highs. The more points connected, the better.If the base spans many months, then investors can plot trend lines on weekly charts.Thanks to the robust demand of corn-based ethanol, fertilizer maker Mosaic (MOS) went on a tear around August of 2006.In December 2006, the stock started forming what would become a nine-week consolidation. 1 The pattern was too deep for a flat base and wasn't exactly a cup with handle either.The standard buy point was 23.64. 2 Investors could have drawn a trend line from the Dec. 11 peak for an aggressive entry.Mosaic broke above the trend line Feb. 12, 2007, clearing a buy point of about 22.08 3 in nearly triple average volume. The stock rose 89% by July, then went into a highly choppy correction for two months before heading to new highs.

"
183,MOS,"Sales growth is an important gauge. But growing sales don't tell you whether a company is truly a top-shelf or bottom-rung player. And it doesn't tell you if a company might be slashing prices to move its inventory.Profit margins can add several important dimensions to your research.Sales provide capital to fuel a company's operations. Profits reveal how effectively the company achieves those sales. They also show how much muscle an outfit builds to reinvest in operations, to develop and market new products, and to offer employees incentives to innovate and excel.To gauge a company's profits, take a look at pretax margins.Pretax margins can be sliced and diced a number of ways, but aim to show earnings, before taxes, as a percentage of overall revenue. (EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a similar measure, showing a company's profitability minus the effects of accounting and financing strategies.)Margins can vary widely from industry to industry. But the ratio provides a good gauge of peer strength in any particular industry group.Among fertilizer makers, for example, CF Industries (CF) generated a 45% pretax margin last year. That is well above Mosaic's (MOS) 26% margin and the 13% margin for Agrium (AGU). But it lagged Terra Nitrogen (TNH), a master limited partnership which sports a 64% pretax ratio.Part of that difference is due to the companies' differing focus on nitrogen-based fertilizers. Nitrogen products have commanded somewhat higher prices this year, while the basic raw material, natural gas, has been unusually cheap.Agrium is more diversified, with just over a third of its pretax earnings coming from nitrogen last year. Nitrogen was more than 90% of CF Industries' pretax take. Mosaic, on the other hand, is focused on phosphate and potassium-based fertilizers.After-tax margins help dig a little deeper. In IBD's market columns, writers frequently point out a company's margin changes on a year-over-year basis.CF's after-tax margin was 26.4% in the first quarter. That was only slightly below the fourth-quarter peak of 27.3%. Measured on a year-over-year basis, CF has increased its after-tax margins in four consecutive quarters.Agrium has increased after-tax margins in eight straight quarters. Its Q1 after tax margin was 5.7%, down sharply from 11.9% in Q4 and well below the 21.6% high notched in Q4 2008. Again, CF is on better footing.IBD's combined Sales Growth, Profit Margins and Return on Equity grade, called the SMR Rating, also incorporates margin strength. CF Industries, Agrium and Terra Nitrogen carry SMR Ratings of A. Mosaic's SMR Rating is a B.

It fell 11% and dived beneath recent lows near 74. The stock had been forming a long cup base since May of last year, though it's been a laggard the past few years.New York-based Greenhill reported a Q4 profit of 6 cents a share, down from 57 cents a year ago and way below Thomson Reuters' 52-cent consensus estimate. Expenses jumped 39% despite a 7% decline in revenue. Greenhill's revenue record has indeed been spotty, rising from year-ago levels just twice in the past five quarters.

It also slashed its outlook for inventories next year by 37% amid a drought in the Midwest.It's not clear just how much production will rise, given that the department also cut its outlook for demand due to a 40% jump in corn prices this year.Fertilizer stocks have been rising with the price of corn, which is the biggest U.S. crop and usually requires the most fertilizer to grow.Canada-based Agrium (AGU) may be forming a handle after it broke out above a 90 buy point July 3 in light volume.

486,MOS,"As forecasts called for 100-degree weekend temperatures and scant rain over much of the Midwest, the drought-raked region braced for a federal crop condition report Monday that's expected to show the toll is climbing.
"
487,MOS,"Week by week since June, updates have pared what once promised to be a record harvest. Corn and soybean prices have spiked for five straight weeks, tearing through record highs Thursday and Friday.
"
488,MOS,"Concerns are rising across the agricultural sector, a $400 billion powerhouse that has boomed as much of the U.S. economy shuffled through an ersatz recovery.
"
489,MOS,"Grain growers and crop insurers face a difficult season, but generally not financial disaster. Livestock ranchers and ethanol producers may be the biggest losers.
"
490,MOS,"Grain
"
491,MOS,"Grain farmers entered 2012 on strong footing, says Chris Hurt, agricultural economist at Purdue University. Years of high prices had boosted farm incomes to record levels. Rising land values drove the sector's debt-to-asset ratios to their lowest since 1960.
"
492,MOS,"But drought damage led the Agriculture Department on July 16 to expand its lowest-tier assessment of ""poor to very poor"" corn acreage to 38% vs. 30% the prior week. Nearly a third of the soybean crop got the same sad grade. Wheat has been less affected, but prices have also spiked to record highs.
"
493,MOS,"Many experts expect Monday's report from the National Agricul tural Statistics Service to confirm even more damage. Further reductions could pit livestock farmers vs. grain processors and ethanol producers in a struggle for dwindling supplies.
"
494,MOS,"Yet most grain farmers are looking at very survivable scenarios, Hurt says. Indiana, the hardest hit of the big corn states, faced an overall 28% crop loss as of last week. But prices have shot up 50% since the start of June. A farmer could lose half of his crop and still have a good year.
"
495,MOS,"""It could be that revenues, on average, will not be as heavily affected as what the general thought is,"" Hurt said.
"
496,MOS,"Farmers who hedged portions of their crop at lower prices are more at risk. A farmer who hedged a third of his crop at $5.50 a bushel and lost another third to drought faces a tough year. Those who sold forward 50% or more of their crop may take significant losses.
"
497,MOS,"Several farm suppliers have done well. Equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE) rose 16% from June 1 and mid-July, then eased to 6% above its June 1 price. Irrigation equipment maker Lindsay (LNN) has bolted 31% since June 1. Seed producer Monsanto (MON) is up 15%.
"
498,MOS,"Insurance
"
499,MOS,"U.S. farmers paid the highest cost ever to put this year's crop in the ground, Hurt says.
"
500,MOS,"Many farmers risk their entire net worth each year. Crop insurance offers a vast safety net against disaster. It isn't cheap and doesn't cover all losses. But it generally keeps farms from failing and lets them invest in the next season's crop.
"
501,MOS,"Multiperil crop insurance represents only 1% of the property/casualty industry's net annual written premiums. The insurers tend to be top-rated, large, globally diversified operators with solid balance sheets, a July 18 report from Fitch said. They include Switzerland's Ace Ltd. (ACE), Cincinnati's American Financial Group (AFG) and Germany's Allianz (AZSEY) . Shares of all three have dipped since the start of May.
"
502,MOS,"Endurance Specialty (ENH) is most exposed, with crop insurance 25% of its net premiums written, Fitch says. Its stock is off 16% since May 1.
"
503,MOS,"Livestock
"
504,MOS,"In east Texas, ranching conditions actually improved this year, while west Texas stayed parched.
"
505,MOS,"Last year, ""in Texas, it was our driest year on record,"" said David Anderson, a livestock economist with Texas A&M's AgriLife Extension Service.
"
506,MOS,"Dairy farmers and beef ranchers had been reducing herds since grain and feed costs upshifted in 2006. Last year's drought accelerated the culling to record levels.
"
507,MOS,"This year's expanded drought is propelling feed costs and withering grassland in the Great Plains and Corn Belt regions. Those pastures had provided a market for Texas and Oklahoma ranchers selling beef and dairy cattle, Anderson says.
"
508,MOS,"Now ranchers are liquidating herds in more states. Prices for calves sold into feedlots, to be fattened for sale as beef, have sunk.
"
509,MOS,"Unlike crop farmers, no insurance backstops livestock producers. The likely outcome is an increasing number of failures, Anderson says, and an accelerated downsizing of the U.S. beef and dairy trades.
"
510,MOS,"""We've got the fewest cattle in the U.S. in 60 years,"" he said.
"
511,MOS,"Fertilizers
"
512,MOS,"U.S. fertilizer buying is done for this year, says Roger Elmore, an extension corn specialist at Iowa State University. Most drought-damaged crops will be mowed and turned back into the soil. That generally means more nutrients left in the ground, pointing to less fertilizer demand in the 2013 growing season.
"
513,MOS,"But the southern hemisphere is in its fertilizer buying season. The U.S. is the world's leading corn exporter, so the drought and soaring prices are rippling across the globe, says Oliver Hatfield, director of fertilizers with Integer Research in London. That could boost fertilizer sales. But several production facilities are set to come on line in Saudi Arabia and North Africa.
"
514,MOS,"""There is a risk that there will be oversupply,"" Hatfield said.
"
515,MOS,"But fertilizer stocks have continued to track corn prices, with stocks like Mosaic (MOS) up 25% and CF Industries (CF) up 26% since June 1.
"
516,MOS,"Ethanol
"
517,MOS,"""Ethanol producers came into 2012 on a high,"" said Brian Jennings, executive vice president with the American Coalition for Ethanol.
"
518,MOS,"Oil and gasoline prices were high. Record-setting corn plantings led to forecasts for low input costs.
"
519,MOS,"But oil prices fell abruptly in May, forcing some ethanol plant shutdowns. The corn price spike, begun in June, tightened the vise.
"
520,MOS,"Valero (VLO) in June idled two facilities in Nebraska and Indiana with annual capacity of 110 million gallons each.
"
521,MOS,"The drought may shake out some weaker players. But, in general, Jennings said, ""Ethanol producers are on better footing than they were (during the price spikes) in 2008.""As forecasts called for 100-degree weekend temperatures and scant rain over much of the Midwest, the drought-raked region braced for a federal crop condition report Monday that's expected to show the toll is climbing.Week by week since June, updates have pared what once promised to be a record harvest.

The Dow and NYSE composite edged up 0.1% each.Volume was tracking sharply lower on the Nasdaq and higher on the NYSE.Agriculture-related issues again rallied as grain prices continued higher.

Volume was 7% lower on the NYSE and down 18% on the Nasdaq.The Agriculture Department projected tight U.S. feed grain supplies and reduced corn acreage for 2011-12.

The department also reduced its forecast for harvested area by 1.9 million acres, to 83.2 million. It projected production of 13.2 billion bushels, 305 million below last month's estimate.The news sent fertilizer makers higher. CF Industries Holdings (CF) shoveled up a 4% advance in heavy trade.

The maker of filters used in industrial, pharmaceutical and research settings had pulled back in quiet volume the past three weeks to test support at its 10-week moving average. Thursday's move cut that line in heavy volume, sending the stock back below its 60.60 buy point from an April breakout.

567,MOS,"As stocks staggered lower in afternoon trade Wednesday, the Nasdaq sliced below its 50-day moving average for the first time since September.The Nasdaq was down 1.5%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.8% and the NYSE composite 0.6%.

Two were energy-related — Concho Resources (CXO) and Northern Oil & Gas (NOG) — and one was a precious metal stock, Silver Wheaton (SLW). The fourth gainer was Apple (AAPL), which bounced off its 50-day line in strong volume.Other stocks were not so fortunate.Priceline.com (PCLN), which will report quarterly results after the close, dropped 3% in fast trade. The online travel booker pierced its 50-day line, trading under the key level for the first time since July.Mosaic (MOS) also violated its 50-day line. The fertilizer maker had bounced off its 50-day line in January, but that decline also came in heavy volume.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) plunged 5% in double its usual volume. The restaurant stock broke out of a base on Feb. 11, clearing a 262.87 buy point. But Chipotle is now more than 8% below the buy point. That would represent a sell rule for investors who bought the stock at that price or above it. A stock should be sold when it drops 7% or 8% below the price at which you buy it. The rule is designed to prevent deep losses that would be difficult to recover.Crude oil was up 4% as unrest continued in Libya. Gadhafi reportedly ordered the country's oil fields sabotaged.

The Nasdaq fell 1.3% and the S&P 500 1.2%. Volume was up on both major exchanges but slowing from its early aggressive pace.Finding the day's winners was a difficult task. On the NYSE, there were five declining issues for every advancer. On the Nasdaq, the ratio was about 6-to-1. The IBD 50, a proxy for leading stocks, had more than four stocks down for every stock that was up.The ratios confirmed the reality that in a correction, three of every four stocks will go down. Opening new positions in such an atmosphere is hazardous.Two winners had a special story to back up their move. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) and  Starbucks (SBUX) were up 36% and 9%, respectively, on a deal to sell Starbucks coffee and tea in Green Mountain's single-serve packs.Cloud-computing company F5 Networks (FFIV) rose 2% in brisk trade. But the move was a bounce off the 200-day moving average, not the place a top-rated stock should be living.Rental movie provider Netflix (NFLX) popped 3% in heavy volume, but the stock remains under its 50-day line.On the dominant downside, China-based Jinko Solar (JKS) shed 5% as it dropped under its 200-day line. The stock lost its 50-day line on March 4. Trina Solar (TSL) also fell 5%. It closed below its 50-day line on March 7, but appeared to be finding support at the 200-day line.Three fertilizer stocks Mosaic (MOS), Agrium (AGU) and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (POT) fell further under their 50-day line.Some top-rated stocks were holding above their 50-day line. They included Apple (AAPL),  Priceline.com (PCLN), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), Riverbed Technology (RVBD) and OpenTable (OPEN).

The day's laggards included toys, gold miners and discount retailers.While yoga-apparel retailer Lululemon Athletica (LULU) boosted the retail apparel group with a 6% pop, there were other stocks in that niche that also were rallying. Ann Taylor Stores (ANN) was up 6%; Men's Wearhouse (MW) bobbed up 5%, recouping some of its big losses due to a Dec. 8 gap-down; and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers (JOSB) added 2% as it continued to ride along its 200-day moving average.Apparel makers also rose. Deckers Outdoor (DECK), the maker of Ugg boots, advanced 3% in heavy volume. The stock is extended after clearing a base in late October. However, it has found support on its first trip to the 10-week moving average. That puts it in a secondary buy zone.Fertilizer maker Mosaic (MOS) gained 2% in strong volume. It is 5% past a 74.35 buy point after breaking out on Dec. 29. A buy zone only extends 5% past the ideal buy point.On the downside, Interactive Intelligence (ININ), a maker of call-center software, dropped 3% in fast trade. But this came after a 24% gap-up gain Tuesday in far greater volume.The Federal Reserve's beige book report, a collection of anecdotal economic information from each Federal Reserve district, is due to be released at 2 p.m. EST.Crude oil rallied about 1%, but gold was off about 0.4%.

"
718,MOS,"Companies are in business to provide certain goods and services, but their real aim is making money for shareholders.
"
719,MOS,"If a firm isn't delivering on the bottom line and growing its business, there's just no reason for share prices to move up.
"
720,MOS,"After all, the price of a stock is a function of the company's future earnings potential.
"
721,MOS,"With that said, what should you look for in profit growth? And how much growth should you look for?
"
722,MOS,"First, you want to find companies that grew earnings per share by a minimum of 25% in the latest quarter or past two quarters. Larger percentage increases are even better.
"
723,MOS,"Just make sure you compare the current quarter's results with the same period a year earlier.
"
724,MOS,"The 25% increase is just a floor. Often the best-performing companies will deliver quarterly profit growth well above that.
"
725,MOS,"Research into the most successful stocks from 1952 to 2001 found that they averaged more than a 70% surge in the latest quarter before they began their major advances.
"
726,MOS,"Case in point, fertilizer and animal feed producer Mosaic (MOS) reported a 1,940% explosion in fiscal third-quarter income back in early April. The stock has gained about 23% since then.

728,MOS,"All of these names have been among the best-performing stocks after breaking out of bases.
"
729,MOS,"Besides the percentage increase, look at the actual earnings figure.
"
730,MOS,"If the firm posted a 400% surge in per-share profit by earning a nickel, up from a penny a year ago, you might take that with a grain of salt.
"
731,MOS,"Also, you should deduct one-time items from results to get a good apples-to-apples comparison.
"
732,MOS,"If growth is good, acceleration is even better. That's when the rate of increase improves over consecutive quarters. For example, EPS gains will be 40% one quarter, 45% the next and then 50% in the following period. Accelerating growth tells you there's an important trend under way.
"
733,MOS,"IBD's research found that in most of the the biggest stock market winners, earnings growth accelerated sometime in the 10 quarters before starting their major moves.
"
734,MOS,"On the flip side, watch out for deceleration or slowing growth. Every company can have a bad quarter now and then. But beware if you see two straight quarters of a substantial slowdown. Generally, that means a two-thirds deterioration in EPS growth.
"
735,MOS,"In addition to strong quarterly growth, you want to see evidence that the company has delivered increases on a longer-term basis.
"
736,MOS,"Annual profit growth should be up at least 25% for at least three years in a row.

1274,MOS,"The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 7.Mosaic recorded net loss of $431 million or $1.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, against net income of $12 million or 3 cents a year ago.

The company’s shares have gained around 20% over this period compared with roughly 1.9% upside recorded by the industry.  Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMosaic, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects phosphates sales volumes in the band of 1.9 million to 2.2 million tons for the first quarter of 2018. The segment gross margin is expected to be in the band of $55 to $65 per ton.Potash sales volumes have been forecast in the range of 1.7-2 million tons for the first quarter and the gross margin is anticipated to be in the band of $50 to $60.For 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1-$1.5 per share. Selling, general & administrative expenses are forecasted to be between $325 million and $350 million for the year. Capital expenditure is anticipated to be in the range of $900-$1,100 million in 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Mosaic for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1,877 million, reflecting an increase of 18.9% from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Phosphate segment is pegged at $893 million for the first quarter, reflecting an estimated 6.4% rise from the year ago quarter.

1291,MOS,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Feb 14.The fertilizer maker’s adjusted loss for the third quarter was at 39 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 55 cents.Net sales increased roughly 28% year over year to $870 million in the quarter. The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $723 million.CF Industries beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missing in the other two with an average negative surprise of 85.1%.CF Industries has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the last six months. The company’s shares have gained around 17.5% over this period, compared with roughly 14% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayIn November 2017, CF Industries noted that the third quarter witnessed a rapid increase in the global price of urea from the second quarter, which was driven by considerably lower Chinese exports, higher production and energy costs, a weaker dollar and strong global demand. The company expects lower Chinese urea export volumes to continue and volatility in nitrogen prices in global markets to continue through 2018.The company also noted that it expects improved volumes and higher nitrogen prices across all products on a year over year comparison basis for the fourth quarter of 2017. CF Industries gained from higher sales volume across all segments in the third quarter.CF Industries is likely to benefit from higher nitrogen demand. During the last reported quarter, Brazil was major purchaser of nitrogen and India issued three tenders, which resulted in purchase of 1.4 million metric tons urea.The company expects a consistent global nitrogen demand growth, which should be partly driven by rising global population and industrial growth on the back of increased adoption of emission control, recovering mining sector and synthetic nitrogen products.  CF Industries witnessed lower year over year pricing across its Ammonia, Granular Urea and Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN) units in the third quarter due to higher nitrogen supply. However, the company is expected to benefit from improved pricing in the December quarter.CF Industries should also benefit from cost efficiencies in the to-be-reported quarter. It should also gain from its efforts to boost production capacity. Volumes in the company’s Ammonia unit surged around 64% year over year in the last reported quarter owing to additional production volumes from the new capacity expansions at Donaldsonville and Port Neal complexes. Moreover, volumes increased roughly 42% in the Granular Urea segment, driven by additional volume available from the new urea capacity at the Port Neal nitrogen complex.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for CF Industries for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1,039 million, reflecting an increase of 19.9% from the year-ago quarter and a 19.4% rise from the sequentially prior quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average selling prices for the company’s Ammonia unit for the fourth quarter stands at $293 per ton, reflecting an expected increase of 5.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Granular Urea segment stands at $241 per ton, representing an expected 12.6% year over year increase.Moreover, average selling price for the UAN unit is expected to rise 6% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $158 per ton. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Ammonium Nitrate (AN) unit stands at $208 per ton, representing an expected 20.9% year over year increase.With respect to volumes, ammonia sales volumes are projected to witness a 6.8% year-over-year rise in the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at roughly 0.8 million tons. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for granular urea sales volume is pegged at 1.1 million tons, reflecting a 29.2% year over year rise. UAN sales volume is expected to dip 10.5% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 1.8 million tons. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales volume for the AN unit is 562,000 tons, reflecting a 3.9% year over year rise.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

1294,MOS,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Mosaic Company (The) (MOS  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Mosaic Company is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MOS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 26 cents per share for MOS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MOS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.69% heading into earnings season.Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MOS has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Mosaic Company, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1295,MOS,"LyondellBasell Industries (LYB  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Feb 2. The company’s adjusted earnings of $2.41 per share for the third quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43. However, revenues increased roughly 15.6% year over year to $8,516 million, beating the consensus mark of $8,090 million. LyondellBasell has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.9%. In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 33.2%, outperforming the industry’s 18.3% rally. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider LyondellBasell, in its third-quarter call, noted that Hurricane Harvey led to reduced inventories across the petrochemical industry. This has resulted in further delays in the startup of new U.S. ethylene and derivative capacity. The company expects global markets to remain tight to balanced as the industry have worked to rebuild inventories during the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for LyondellBasell for the fourth quarter stands at $8,785 million, reflecting an expected year over year growth of 13.4%. Revenues for LyondellBasell’s Intermediates and Derivatives segment for the soon-to-be reported quarter is projected to witness a 5.1% rise from the previous quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $2,182 million.  At the Olefins & Polyolefins – Americas segment, revenues are expected to rise 4.3% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $2,554 million. On the contrary, revenues from the Olefins & Polyolefins – Europe, Asia, International division is expected to witness a 4.5% fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is projected at $3,011 million for the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Refining segment is pegged at $1,700 million for the fourth quarter. This reflects an estimated 1.8% increase on a sequential basis. The Technology segment sales are expected to rise 18.4% sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $116 million. The company is benefiting from the favorable North American natural gas environment. It is also executing its expansion projects to leverage the U.S. natural gas liquids advantage. The company’s expansion initiatives are likely to boost the capacity and add to its earnings. LyondellBasell is constructing a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast that will employ its proprietary Hyperzone PE technology. The facility is expected to have an annual capacity of 1.1 billion pounds.  Furthermore, the company has started production at its polypropylene (PP) compounding plant in Dalian, China. The 20 kiloton per year plant is the company’s third facility in China. It is strategically located to cater the country’s growing automotive market. In November, LyondellBasell entered into a definitive agreement to buy 50% interest in Quality Circular Polymers (QCP) — a high standard plastics recycling company located in Sittard-Geleen, Netherlands. Per the agreement, the company will be a 50/50 partner in QCP along with SUEZ — a French company specializing in waste and water management. The deal combines LyondellBasell's technical capabilities and European market presence with SUEZ's ability to collect and recover waste into new materials. It is likely to provide a strategic platform for sustainable growth. However, LyondellBasell faces headwind from Hurricane Harvey, which is expected to impact its fourth-quarter results. Hurricane Harvey adversely impacted the company’s nine major U.S. Gulf Coast sites during the previous quarter, which led to the shutdown of an ethylene cracker. The company’s La Porte ethylene cracker had an unplanned shutdown in the third quarter due to Hurricane Harvey, affecting production and sales volumes in the quarter. LyondellBasell sees lost sales and expenses from Harvey to impact its fourth-quarter 2017 results by roughly $100 million. The company also expects lost production due to an unplanned maintenance at its ethylene cracker to affect its fourth-quarter results by roughly $40 million. LyondellBasell Industries NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise LyondellBasell Industries NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | LyondellBasell Industries NV QuoteEarnings WhisperOur proven model conclusively shows that LyondellBasell is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Zacks ESP: LyondellBasell has an Earnings ESP of +0.55%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.52 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.50. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LyondellBasell carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat. Note that the stocks with — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) — have significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.  Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.27% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1296,MOS,"The fertilizer industry is not out of the woods yet and remains buffeted by certain headwinds that continue to weigh on stocks in the space this year. Sustained pressure on crop commodity prices is scuppering a meaningful recovery.The overall weak fertilizer industry fundamentals have kept investors away this year. Does that mean you should pluck the entire industry out of your portfolio?If you look beyond the negatives, there are a few bright spots such as improving pricing and demand dynamics for potash, a major crop nutrient, and signs of stability in the farm economy.     The Zacks Fertilizers industry has underperformed the broader market year to date. While the industry has gained roughly 8.2%, the S&P 500 has returned around 11.9%.     Let’s do a quick health check of the fertilizer industry by delving deeper into certain key factors.Crop Commodity Pricing Still a DragThe prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies as it is hindering fertilizer usage by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on growers’ income.Prices of major crops (such as corn and soybeans) remain at their multi-year lows as markets remain awash with grains. An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) harvest outlook indicates another bumper year of production. The USDA, in its September report, raised its corn and soybean harvest forecasts for the 2017/18 crop year. It now sees corn production to be 14.184 billion bushels, up 32 million from its August forecast.The USDA also predicts record soybean production of 4.431 billion bushels compared with its August view of 4.381 billion bushels. This is expected to aggravate the grain glut and restrict crop prices.Has the Farm Economy Hit Bottom?U.S. farm income is expected to tick up this year after three straight years of decline due to low commodity prices. Per the USDA’s August 2017 forecast, net U.S. farm income is expected to go up 3.1% to $63.4 billion in 2017. This compares to the USDA’s February 2017 forecast of an 8.7% decline to $62.3 billion. The upturn in profits will likely be driven by higher cash receipts from the sale of crop inventories.However, despite the projected rise, net farm income would still be lower in 2017 than all the other years since 2010 and a far cry from the record $123.8 billion achieved in 2013.Nevertheless, the USDA’s profit forecast for this year gives signs of stability in the farm economy and suggests that the sector may have finally hit the bottom. Higher anticipated farm income is expected to positively influence farmers’ nutrient-purchasing decisions.Potash Prices on Recovery ModeThe potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows. Potash prices have recovered after feeling gravity’s pull last year due to subdued demand for the nutrient. Most producers of the nutrient, including Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. , Agrium Inc.  and The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report) witnessed a spike in prices in the second quarter that drove their potash margins.Potash Corp., a major producer of the nutrient, saw healthy demand for potash in the second quarter and expects consistent customer engagement through the balance of 2017, supported by healthy consumption trends.With Canpotex contracts for the second half in place, the company sees strong consumption in China driven by higher crop acreage and nutrient affordability. The demand environment also remains healthy in Brazil, another important market.Moreover, the government of India’s move to cut the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on fertilizers from 12% to 5% is a welcome news for famers in that country. It also augurs well for potash demand in India, one of the world’s top buyers of the nutrient. As such, higher demand from major consumers should drive up potash prices in the second half.Picture Not So Good for Nitrogen & PhosphateHigher supply has contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment. Abundant nitrogen supply driven by new production capacity is expected to weigh on global prices in 2017. Additional nitrogen capacity including a significant increase in North America is expected to come online globally in the back half of the year.Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices. Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is hurting prices, causing farmers to delay buying activities. As such, nitrogen margins of fertilizer producers remain thwarted by a weak pricing environment.Excess capacity (outpacing demand) also continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed in the first two quarters of 2017. Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied in the second half (with incremental capacity from Saudi Arabia and Morocco, as noted by Agrium and Mosaic in their second-quarter earnings calls), thereby putting pressure on prices. Weak prices are expected to continue to affect phosphates margins in third-quarter 2017.2 Fertilizer Stocks Worth Betting OnDespite some positives, the fertilizer market is yet to rebound and there is continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term.Nevertheless, the constant need of farmers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing world support the bullish case for fertilizers.Below we highlight two fertilizer stocks, armed with a solid Zacks Rank, that are worth considering for investment in the prevailing operating environment.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM  -  Free Report)Santiago, Chile-based Sociedad Quimica is a solid choice armed with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company has an expected earnings growth of 52.2% for 2017. It also has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 32.5%. The stock has also gained a whopping 100.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks Fertilizers industry’s gain of 8.2% over the same period.Annual estimates for Sociedad Quimica have also moved north over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. Over this period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 for the company’s earnings has increased by around 11.8% and 24%, respectively.Intrepid Potash, Inc. (IPI  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Denver, CO, Intrepid Potash is another attractive pick with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company has an expected earnings growth of 73.8% for 2017. It also delivered positive earnings surprise of 50% in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the stock has also gained a solid 96.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks Fertilizers industry’s gain of 8.2%. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>
"
1297,MOS,"Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report) did not disappoint when it reported its fiscal second quarter 2011 results on Jan 4. The agriculture sector has been hot as crop prices have been at multi-year, or in some cases multi-decades, highs in the last few months.
"
1298,MOS,"The fertilizer company surprised on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.1%. Earnings per share were $1.02 compared to the Zacks Consensus of 91 cents. 
"
1299,MOS,"Revenue rose 59% to $2.7 billion from $1.7 billion in the year ago quarter.
"
1300,MOS,"Gross margin jumped to 29% from 18% a year ago due to significantly higher phosphate selling prices and potash sales volumes.It's All About the Phosphates
"
1301,MOS,"The company had a solid quarter in its phosphate division as both prices and volumes were higher than expected. Sales rose 54% to $2 billion from $1.3 billion last year.
"
1302,MOS,"It saw record sales volumes of 3.7 million tonnes, higher than the company's prior range and much higher average selling prices of $461 per tonne compared to just $287 per tonne a year ago. With that kind of price increase, it's not surprising that sales are surging.Potash Less Robust
"
1303,MOS,"The price increases were not as pronounced on the potash side of the business. This was a disappointment to several of the analysts. Sales, however, rose 69% to $699 million from $414.3 million last year.
"
1304,MOS,"Its average selling price was just $331 per tonne compared to $370 a year ago. Total sales volume, however, did rise to 1.8 million tonnes from 1 million tonnes last year.
"
1305,MOS,"Still, potash prices in North America were up 35% from the summer industry wide so price increases are happening, just not as quickly as some hoped.Global Market Outlook Raised
"
1306,MOS,"Demand for phosphates and potash continue to be strong but greater supply is limited in the near term. Mosaic raised its full year shipments for phosphates to a range of 59 to 61 million tonnes from its prior guidance of 57 to 59 million tonnes. The prior global record had been 57 million tonnes.
"
1307,MOS,"It also sees a more robust market for potash and raised that range as well. It now expects 53 to 56 million tonnes, up from its prior guidance of 52 to 55 million tonnes.What About the Estimates?
"
1308,MOS,"The analysts are still evaluating the quarter so estimate revisions have yet to really come in. However, 1 has moved higher in the last 7 days for fiscal 2011, pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $3.83 from $3.82 per share. 
"
1309,MOS,"But there are currently 19 estimates for 2011 so we'll have to see what the other revisions do.Still Solid Fundamentals
"
1310,MOS,"Shares got a boost from the earnings report but they were already near 52-week highs. It is trading with a forward P/E of 19.6 now which isn't cheap.

1312,MOS,"The five best performing stocks on the Zacks #1 Rank List last week were: DryShips, Inc. , TBS International Ltd. (TBSI), Excel Maritime Carriers Ltd. (EXM), The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report)  and Terra Industries Inc. (TRA).DryShips, Inc.  is once again a top-performing Zacks #1 Rank company, as its sector continues to perform extraordinarily well in the market and on this list. Shares gained 23.1% for the week ended Oct 12. In September, DryShips made the weekly list twice and was a top performer for the whole month. Given the strong momentum in its industry, earnings estimates have been trending higher for several months. Expectations for this year are up approximately 26% in the past two months and 8% in the past 30 days. 
"
1313,MOS,"DryShips will announce its third-quarter performance soon, and analysts are expecting results that underscore the strong conditions in its space and its impressive numbers in the past several periods. For the second quarter, earnings per share reached $1.59, excluding items, which topped the consensus by more than 16%. Voyage revenue advanced to $112.5 million from $54.5 million. Analysts have boosted earnings estimates for the third quarter by 30% and 11.4% in the past two months and 30 days, respectively.
"
1314,MOS,"TBS International Ltd. (TBSI) is an ocean transportation services company that offers worldwide shipping solutions through liner, parcel and bulk services and vessel chartering. That puts TBSI in one of the hottest sectors of the market right now, benefiting from strong demand for commodities such as iron ore and coal. Over the past three months, earnings estimates for this year are up about 15%, including a rise of 2.3% in the past two months. Expectations for its yet-to-be-released third quarter are also up in those timeframes.  
"
1315,MOS,"Shares of TBS International advanced more than 22% last week. This was the first time that the company made the top performers list since August when it reported second-quarter results. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share of 56 cents significantly advanced year-over-year, and also edged past the consensus by almost 2%. Total revenues jumped 31% to $77.2 million from $59 million. More recently, TBS International took delivery of the M.V. Yakima Princess, putting its fleet at 34 multipurpose handymax and handysize vessels. The company expects the delivery of three more bulk carriers in the next three months.  Excel Maritime Carriers Ltd. (EXM) was a top-performing Zacks #1 Rank company for September, and made its first appearance on the list for this month in the week ended Oct 12. Shares gained 19.6% during the week for the drybulk carrier company. As with many companies in this industry, earnings estimates are on the rise for Excel Maritime. Expectations for the year are up approximately 21% in the past two months, including a rise of 4.9% in the past 30 trading days.  
"
1316,MOS,"For its second quarter, Excel Maritime Carriers announced earnings per share of 71 cents, excluding items, eclipsing the consensus by almost 25%. Total revenues advanced to $37.3 million from $26.7 million.

Earnings per share in the quarter soared year-over-year, and also bettered the consensus by approximately 6.7%. Sales jumped by 55% to $2 billion. With prices for phosphates remaining strong and prices for potash increasing, Mosaic expects strong earnings and cash flow for the rest of fiscal 2008. 
"
1318,MOS,"Shares of the company advanced about 17.7% last week. Earnings estimates for this fiscal year are up 16.5% in the past month, including an increase of about 8.7% in just the past seven trading days.
"
1319,MOS,"Terra Industries Inc. (TRA), a leading international producer of nitrogen products, is part of an industry that has a lot of momentum at the moment. There is good demand in the agricultural and industrial markets right now, especially in emerging economies. Shares of the company gained 16.3% for the week ended Oct 12. Over the past month, earnings estimates for this year are up 19%.  
"
1320,MOS,"Terra Industries will report its third-quarter results on Oct 25. Solid demand led to a strong second-quarter report. Earnings per share of 66 cents advanced year-over-year from five cents, while revenues increased more than 30% to $693.8 million from $523.5 million. Nitrogen products revenues were up approximately 32%. The company said its outlook for the rest of the year and beyond remains positive, thanks in part to good demand for fall fertilizer fill and seasonally firm nitrogen prices.
"
1321,MOS,"The credit crunch has yet to have a meaningful impact on overall expectations for growth. Ahead of the ""official"" start of third-quarter earnings season, the Zacks Revisions Ratio, which measures the proportion of full-year earnings estimates being revised upwards relative to those being revised downwards over the preceding four weeks, is right about average at 0.82.
"
1322,MOS,"To put this number in perspective, I've compiled pre-earnings season trends in earnings estimate revisions for the past two years. These numbers represent the cumulative number of earnings forecasts that have been revised during the preceding four weeks for companies within the Zacks Rank universe1.
"
1323,MOS,"Cumulative Earnings Estimate Revisions Made During Preceding Four Weeks Date PositiveRevisions NegativeRevisions TotalRevisions ZacksRevisionsRatio12/27/2005 1,604 1,933 3,537 0.833/27/2006 2,490 3,078 5,568 0.816/26/2006 1,690 1,680 3,370 1.019/28/2006 1,379 1,815 3,194 0.7612/27/2006 1,614 2,141 3,755 0.753/27/2007 2,245 3,153 5,398 0.716/26/2007 2,138 1,994 4,132 1.079/25/2007 1,620 1,976 3,596 0.82Average 1,848 2,221 4,069 0.85
"
1324,MOS,"As you can see, brokerage analysts have not been more cautious (or less cautious) then they have at similar points over the past two years. A big reason is that in the face of a sinking greenback, record highs for crude and tightened lending standards, the economy and corporate profits are continuing to grow. As I stated last week, the median company within the within the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) is projected to have generated an 8.5% increase in profits during the third-quarter.
"
1325,MOS,"These numbers do conflict with some of the recent economic data that has been released. August durable goods orders declined 4.9%, the first decline since May. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index sank to a two-year low this month. The National Federation of Retailers predicted that this year's holiday shopping season will be the worse it has been in five years. Even Target (TGT  -  Free Report), whose sales had been holding up, recently slashed its September sales forecast. And I'm not even mentioning the housing numbers which just stunk.
"
1326,MOS,"So how does one reconcile this difference between the trend in earnings estimate revisions and the recent economic data? Durable goods orders are volatile and a single month's change really does not tell much. The trend over the next few months will be more important, especially if there is a notable, sustained drop because it will suggest that the credit crunch is widening. At this point, I don't believe that such a scenario will develop, but I do acknowledge that it is within the realm of possibilities. Consumer confidence surveys are interesting, but they do not necessarily reflect actual spending habits. A person can say he is more worried about the economy, but continue to visit Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) everyday. Retail sales were not strong over the summer, something that has already been factored into earnings forecasts. It is possible that profit projections for many retailers will have to be cut further.
"
1327,MOS,"On the other hand, there is evidence that Chicken Little is wrong about the outlook for stocks. There are many countries experiencing stronger growth than the U.S. and this adds to demand for exports. (The weak dollar makes U.S. exports more price competitive, an added plus.) Corporate balance sheets are strong overall. Demand for machinery, parts and technology (e.g. laptop computers), despite today's durable goods report, has been good. There are many companies that are enjoying pricing power. Even in retail, there are several companies that are doing just fine (e.g. Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) and Zumiez ). Plus, the U.S. economy is still growing, even if the pace of growth has slowed recently. Simply put, at the aggregate level, conditions for profit growth continue to exist.
"
1328,MOS,"Last week, brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts on five of the six stocks within Fertilizers. Those stocks were Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report), Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT) and Terra Industries (TRA). All five are Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks.
"
1329,MOS,"The upgrades reflected optimism that these companies will continue to enjoy pricing power for the foreseeable future. Demand for potash and fertilizer have been strong and are expected to remain so. It's also worth noting that the upward revisions to estimates occurred as grain prices and other agriculture-related commodities are setting either record or 52-week highs.
"
1330,MOS,"The reaction to the fiscal third-quarter earnings reports from four of the major investment banking firms has been somewhat predictable given the numbers. Profit forecasts for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 were cut on Bear Stearns (BSC) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Both firms missed the consensus estimate by sizeable margins because of the turmoil in the credit markets. Lehman Brothers (LEH) missed by a penny as it too was hit by the problems in the fixed-income markets. Brokerage analysts are split on the outlook, however, with two raising fiscal 2007 profit forecasts and three cutting fiscal 2007 forecasts. Notably, no analysts raised their forecasts for fiscal 2008, whereas four cut their forecasts. Forecasts for fiscal 2008 are down ten cents from a week ago to $7.66 per share.
"
1331,MOS,"Brokerage analysts raised their fiscal 2007 and 2008 forecasts on Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) after the firm topped expectations by nearly 40% with profits of $6.13 per share. GS was able to employ trading strategies to take advantage of the turmoil, though not all of its hedge funds followed the same practice. Forecasts for fiscal 2007 are at a new high with brokerage analysts now expecting profits of $23.67 per share versus $21.83 a week ago. Prior to the recent surprise, the consensus forecast had been falling. For fiscal 2008, the consensus estimate calls for profits of $22.45 per share versus $21.82 a week ago. Two months ago, the consensus estimate had stood at $22.80, however.
"
1332,MOS,"The big question going forward is how much merger and acquisition activity is going to occur over the next few quarters. The answer at this point is unknown. Higher raw material costs provide an incentive for companies to seek synergies through mergers as well as to grab additional market share. Investors are demanding better terms for companies that are not exhibiting financial strength, however, which is a headwind. In addition, the psychological impact of the credit crunch could make it harder for private equity firms to get favorable financing terms. This said, financing remains available for companies (and individuals) in strong financial shape.

"
1335,MOS,"A significant drop in the number of earnings estimate revisions has started to occur. Based on a four week rolling period, 9,587 estimates were revised as of last night versus 13,079 a week ago. To put these numbers in perspective, the peak was reached two weeks ago at 13,748. The last lull was set just before the start of third-quarter earnings season at about 3,500.
"
1336,MOS,"The number of estimate revisions tends to rise and fall with the number of earnings reports being released. As more companies provide up-to-date earnings information, brokerage analysts are more likely to revise their forecasts. Likewise, during periods when companies are relatively quiet, brokerage analysts are less likely to revise their forecasts. 
"
1337,MOS,"During the past few quarters, the number of mid-quarter estimate revisions has dropped. This occurrence may be partially to blame on the uncertain pace of economic growth. CFOs may feel less confident about raising their guidance and brokerage analysts may be less likely to adjust their forecasts in the absence of company news or other data that would suggest profits could be better than anticipated. 
"
1338,MOS,"Along with the drop in the number of estimates, the Zacks Revisions Ratio is likely to fall below 1.0. The revisions ratio divides the number of positive revisions (estimates being revised upwards) by the number of negative revisions (estimates being revised downward). Over the past four weeks, there have been 4,792 positive revisions and 4,795 negative revisions for the current fiscal year, which equates to a Zacks Revisions Ratio of 1.0. Obviously, numbers above 1.0 are preferred, but a slippage to .90 (or slightly lower) in September would not be cause for alarm.
"
1339,MOS,"While the revisions ratio is stable for the overall Zacks Rank universe, there are pockets of weakness. Many pockets are in areas that are not unexpected, such as Building-Residential/Commercial. This group has a Zacks Revisions Ratio of just 0.14, a reflection of the ongoing slump within the industry. What is notable that is despite last months improvement in new home sales, brokerage analysts are not only cutting their forecasts for this year but are also cutting their fiscal 2008 profit projections for several homebuilders including Hovnanian , Pulte Homes (PHM  -  Free Report) and Ryland Group (RYL).
"
1340,MOS,"The extent to which the problems with the housing market and the related issues with mortgages are curtailing consumer spending is not fully known. The summer has not been kind to clothing retailers, with Retail-Apparel/Shoe possessing a Zacks Revision ratio of just 0.28. As I stated last week, economic factors, the shifting of tax-free days in Texas and Florida to August, a later start to the school year in certain districts and merchandising mistakes all played a role. Just within the past seven days, brokerage analysts have lowered their full-year earnings forecasts on Bebe Stores , Casual Male (CMRG), Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and Tween Brands (TWB).
"
1341,MOS,"So where is the strength? Where it has been throughout the calendar year: down on the farm. Fertilizers has a Zacks Revision Ratio of 14.0 with full-year estimates recently raised on Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report) and Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report). Agricultural Operations has a Zacks Revisions Ratio of 7.0 with full-year estimates being raised on Bunge (BG  -  Free Report) and Fresh Del Monte .

1346,MOS,"The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 31. Mosaic reported net earnings of 28 cents in second-quarter 2017 against net loss of 3 cents per share recorded a year ago. Adjusted earnings were 29 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. The company’s revenues rose roughly 4.8% year over year to $1,754.6 million in the reported quarter, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,649.4 million. Mosaic topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, with an average beat of 63.4%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Factors to Consider Mosaic expects phosphates sales volumes in the band of 2.2-2.5 million tons for the third quarter compared with 2.5 million tons for the same quarter in 2016. Average selling price, FOB plant, is expected to be in the range of $310-$330 per ton. The segment gross margin rate is expected to be in the band of 7-9%. Potash sales volumes have been forecast in the range of 1.9-2.2 million tons for the third quarter, compared with 2.2 million tons in the prior-year quarter. Average selling price, FOB plant, is expected in the band of $165-$180 per ton and the gross margin rate is anticipated to be in the band of 15-18%. Total sales volumes for the International Distribution segment are expected to range from 2.3-2.6 million tons for the third quarter, compared with 2.2 million tons in the prior-year quarter. The segment gross margin is estimated to be in the low-$20 per ton range. Mosaic, last month, issued an update on its third-quarter business performance post Hurricane Irma. The company witnessed good demand and strong operational performance prior to the hurricane with profitability metrics tracking ahead of the third quarter guidance. Post the mayhem of Irma, Mosaic now expects roughly 250,000 to 350,000 tons of lower production in September. In addition to this, the damage to Mosaic's Bartow warehouse is anticipated to result in a loss of up to 400,000 tons of finished phosphate product. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Phosphate segment is is pegged at $878 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 9.9% decline from the second quarter. Segment sales volume is also expected to decline 7.7% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2.4 million tons for the third quarter.  Potash segment’s net sales are expected to fall 5.3% sequentially in the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $443 million. A 3.3% decrease in sales volume is anticipated as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2.1 million tons for the third quarter.  Net sales for Mosaic’s International Distribution segment for the third quarter is projected to witness a surge of 45.8% from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $850 million. Segment sales volume is also expected to jump around 50% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2.4 million tons for the third quarter. Mosaic is expected to benefit from its efforts to boost production capacity. The company is also anticipated to gain from improving global demand for fertilizers and cost-reduction measures.  However, the company is exposed to a difficult pricing environment. Lower pricing is hurting sales and margins in its phosphate business and is expected to remain a headwind in the third quarter. Mosaic also faces a challenging operating environment in the agriculture space. Mosaic has underperformed the industry over the past three months. The company’s shares have declined around 12.5% over this period as against roughly 14.7% gain recorded by the industry.  Earnings Whispers Our proven model shows that Mosaic is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below: Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Mosaic is currently +2.69%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 26 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 25 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Mosaic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. Stocks With Favorable Combination Here are some companies in the basic material space you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.14% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Intrepid Potash, Inc (IPI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +14.3% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

1361,MOS,"We added The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report) to the Focus List back in October, despite the fertilizer company missing fiscal first-quarter EPS expectations. So imagine how happy we were when MOS announced a more than 12% surprise for its fiscal second-quarter in early January.   
"
1362,MOS,"Bolstered by favorable U.S. crop prices, the company earned $1.02 per share, excluding items, compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of only 91 cents. The result also surpassed last year's result of 32 cents many times over. Sales jumped 56% to $2.67 billion from $1.71 billion.   
"
1363,MOS,"We added Mosaic to the portfolio because phosphate products are expected to break records, which was underscored in its report. Net sales for the Phosphates segment in the fiscal second quarter was $2 billion, compared to $1.3 billion last year. Meanwhile, net sales in the Potash segment jumped to $699 million from $414.3 million. 
"
1364,MOS,"The report had a solid and positive impact on earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year, ending May 2011, is $4.12 per share, which is up 7.9% in the past 30 days as 16 of 17 estimates were revised higher.  
"
1365,MOS,"Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year ending May 2012 is $5.23 per share, marking an advance of 11% in the past month as 15 of 19 estimates advanced. There has also been a 3-cent improvement in the last 7 days thanks to another upward revision. At present, analysts are expecting EPS growth of 27% for fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011.  
"
1366,MOS,"That year-over-year advance suggests that analysts are on the same page as the company. According to Mosaic, the market environment remains robust due to strong demand prospects, which are being supported by profitable farm economics worldwide, record low producer inventories, a lean global distribution pipeline and strong farmer economics.  
"
1367,MOS,"In other news, agribusiness bigwig Cargill will split off its 64% stake in Mosaic, according to a joint announcement in mid January. The move is expected to make MOS a takeover target. ROFIN-SINAR Technologies Inc. (RSTI) will report its fiscal first quarter results tomorrow. It will be going for a sixth straight quarter with a positive EPS surprise. Such a foundation shows why this industrial lasers company is a Zacks #1 Rank ('Strong Buy').

1368,MOS,"The company hasn't even been on the Focus List for 2 months yet (having been added on Dec 8, 2010), but shares are already up more than 27% since joining. We currently have a longer-term ""Outperform"" rating on the company.  
"
1369,MOS,"One of the great things about RSTI is that its earnings estimates have been consistently moving higher for several weeks now. For example, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year ending September 2011 is $1.93 per share, which is up 1% in 7 days and 5.5% in 30 days. Going back 2 months, the guidance is up 15%.  
"
1370,MOS,"Likewise for the fiscal year ending September 2012. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29 per share is up 2.7% in a week, 9.6% in a month and 15% in 2 months. Analysts currently expect earnings growth of nearly 19% for next fiscal year over this fiscal year.  
"
1371,MOS,"As for the upcoming fiscal first quarter, we are expecting 45 cents per share, which is up a penny in 7 days and 4 cents in a month. 
"
1372,MOS,"For its fiscal fourth-quarter, earnings per share of 42 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20% and marked a substantial improvement over last year's 18 cents. Net sales jumped by 37% to $124.4 million.

Schulman, Inc. (SHLM  -  Free Report) have contributed to the rally in LyondellBasell's shares.LyondellBasell’s profits surged more than two-fold year over year to $1.9 billion or $4.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017.

1392,MOS,"The fertilizer industry is showing signs of stability of late, taking succour from improved pricing and demand dynamics for certain major crop nutrients and a firming farm economy.While still-weak agricultural commodity prices remain a roadblock, strong usage in major consumer markets is driving demand for primary crop nutrients. Needless to say, the ever-growing world population and the concomitant need to beef up food supply to feed more mouths remains a prime catalyst for fertilizer demand growth.The Zacks Fertilizers industry has outperformed the broader market over the past three months. While the industry has gained roughly 12.1%, the S&P 500 has returned around 6.3%. Let’s do a quick health check of the fertilizer industry by delving deeper into certain key factors.Potash Market Showing StrengthThe potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows. Potash prices have recovered this year after feeling gravity’s pull in 2016, supported by improving demand and tighter supply conditions. Most producers of this major nutrient, including Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  and Agrium Inc.  witnessed a spike in prices in the third quarter that drove their potash margins.Demand for potash also has been strong in key markets. Potash Corp., a major producer of the nutrient, saw healthy demand for potash in the third quarter and expects consistent customer engagement through the balance of 2017, supported by healthy consumption trends with contracts with both China and India in place. The company envisions 2017 to be a record year for potash demand and expects global demand in the band of 62 million to 65 million tons.Potash Corp. sees strong consumption in China driven by a shift to more potassium-intensive crops like vegetables and fruits. The demand environment also remains healthy in Brazil, another important market, driven by higher crop acreage and application rates. Strong affordability and the need to replenish nutrients are also expected to support fertilizer demand in North America.Moreover, the government of India’s move to cut the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on fertilizers from 12% to 5% is a welcome news for famers in that country. It also augurs well for potash demand in India, one of the world’s top buyers of the nutrient.According to Agrium, potash market is expected to remain tight through the rest of 2017. As such, higher demand from major consumers coupled with tight supply should further drive up potash prices.A Rebound in NitrogenAnother positive is the recent rebound in the nitrogen space. The nitrogen market is seeing improving demand and pricing fundamentals. According to CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report), a major producer, the third quarter witnessed a rapid increase in the global price of urea from second quarter, which was driven by considerably lower Chinese exports and strong global demand (especially in India and Brazil). The company expects consistent global nitrogen demand growth moving ahead.Moreover, Agrium, in its third-quarter call, said that nitrogen prices have witnessed sharp increase (of more than 50%) since the lows seen in July, buoyed by low level of Chinese urea production and solid import demand from India. Higher domestic coal prices coupled with increased focus on reducing pollution has led to a reduction in Chinese urea production.Agrium also sees positive supply-demand fundamentals for nitrogen in the medium term. Continued strong demand and tighter market conditions augur well for nitrogen prices in the fourth quarter.Phosphate Market a Mixed BagExcess capacity continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed in the first three quarters of 2017. Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied through this year (with new capacity reportedly coming from Morocco and Saudi Arabia), thereby putting pressure on prices.However, demand environment for the nutrient remains favorable. The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report), one of the biggest producers of phosphate, noted in its September quarter earnings call that demand remains strong as farmers are looking to replace nutrients from the soil in most of the major regions globally. The company also envisions demand growth to absorb new supply additions.A Stabilizing Farm EconomyU.S. farm income is expected to tick up this year after three straight years of decline due to low commodity prices. Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) recently released November 2017 forecast, net U.S. farm income is expected to go up 2.7% to $63.2 billion in 2017.The upturn in profits is likely be driven by higher cash receipts from the sale of crop inventories. The USDA expects cash receipts to go up 2.4% to $365.1 billion in 2017.While the USDA’s profit forecast for this year is still a far cry from the record $123.8 billion achieved in 2013, it gives signs of stability in the farm economy and suggests that the sector may have finally hit the bottom. Higher anticipated farm income is expected to positively influence farmers’ nutrient-purchasing decisions.Crop Pricing Remains a ConcernThe prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies. Prices of major crops (such as corn and soybeans) remain at their multi-year lows as markets remain awash with grains. An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017. The USDA’s harvest outlook indicates another bumper year of production.

1397,MOS,"The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 1. Mosaic reported break-even results on a per share basis in first-quarter 2017 against net earnings of 73 cents per share recorded a year ago. Earnings, barring one-time items, were 4 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. The company’s revenues fell roughly 5.7% year over year to $1,578 million in the reported quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,672 million. Mosaic beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, with an average beat of 42.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Mosaic Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Mosaic Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Mosaic Company (The) QuoteFactors to ConsiderMosaic expects higher realized prices of phosphate and potash in the second quarter, which are likely to improve the company’s earnings. The company anticipates phosphates sales volumes in the band of 2–2.3 million tons for second-quarter 2017 compared with 2.4 million tons for the same quarter in 2016. Average selling price, FOB plant, is expected to be in the range of $320–$340 per ton. The segment gross margin rate is expected to be around 10%. Potash sales volumes have been forecast in the range of 2–2.3 million tons for the second quarter, compared with 2 million tons in the prior-year quarter. Average selling price, FOB plant, is expected in the band of $170 to $185 per ton and the gross margin rate is anticipated to be roughly in the low 20% range. Total sales volumes for the International Distribution segment are expected to range from 1.4 million–1.7 million tons for second-quarter 2017, compared with 1.4 million tons in the prior-year quarter. The segment gross margin is estimated to be around $20 per ton. Mosaic is gaining from its cost-reduction measures. The company is also likely to benefit from its efforts to boost production capacity and acquisitions. Moreover, the company is expected to gain from improving global demand for fertilizers. Mosaic sees a more stable operating environment in 2017 and envisions higher demand for both phosphate and potash.  However, Mosaic faces a challenging operating environment in the agriculture space. The company is also exposed to a difficult pricing environment which may continue to weigh on its margins. Mosaic has underperformed the industry over the last three months. The company’s shares have declined around 11.1% over this period, compared with roughly 2.8% gain recorded by the industry. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mosaic is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Mosaic is currently -4.00% This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 24 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 25 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Although Mosaic’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions. Stocks to Consider Here are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.44% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #2. Endeavour Silver Corp. (EXK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +100% and a Zacks Rank #3. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.                                                                       See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1404,MOS,"Kinross Gold Corporation’s (KGC  -  Free Report) fully-owned subsidiary, Kinross Brasil Mineracao, has announced the acquisition of two hydroelectric power plants located in Brazil from a subsidiary of Gerdau SA for $257 million. The two plants — Barra dos Coqueiros and Cacu — are expected to secure a long-term power supply for Kinross’ Paracatu mine, which will lower production costs over the life of mine.Per the company, the deal is expected to be partly funded with debt financing of roughly $200 million and the balance from its existing liquidity. Kinross had total liquidity of roughly $2.6 billion at the end of 2017.Kinross expects the acquisition to lower its production cost of sales by roughly $80 per ounce over the mine life. It will generate a levered internal rate of return in the band of 15-30%, depending on the final terms of a planned debt financing.The deal will also considerably de-risk supply chain as it is expected to secure just about 70% of Paracatu’s anticipated power requirements at a low, fixed cost, while the remaining 30% power demand is expected to be fulfilled by third-party suppliers under fixed-term power purchase agreements. This will lower market exposure for a key input in an environment where Kinross expects input costs to rise. Installed capacity of Barra dos and Cacu are 90 MW and 65 MW, respectively. Moreover, strategic investment in core asset will further enhance and strengthen Paracatu, which is a cornerstone asset in the company’s portfolio.Notably, the Brazilian legislation allows companies to enjoy reduced power tariffs if they generate their own power supply. Due to reduced tariffs, Kinross expects to save roughly $15 per ounce, which is part of the total expected savings of around $80 per ounce of production costs over the mine life.Subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other precedent conditions, the deal is expected to close in about three-to-six months.Price PerformanceShares of Kinross have moved up 2.6% over a year, outperforming the 9.9% decline recorded by its industry. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderKinross currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Steel Dynamics, Inc.

1406,MOS,"The Mosaic Company (MOS  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 19.Mosaic reported net income of $227.5 million or 65 cents per share in third-quarter 2017 as against a profit of $39.2 million or 11 cents recorded a year ago. Adjusted earnings were 43 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents.The company’s revenues rose roughly 1.7% year over year to $1,984.8 million in the quarter. It also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,961 million.Mosaic beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, with an average beat of 31.4%.Mosaic has outperformed the industry over the past three months. The company’s shares have gained around 12.7% over this period compared with roughly 0.9% upside recorded by the industry. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMosaic, in October 2017, said that it expects phosphates sales volumes in the range of 2.3-2.6 million tons for fourth-quarter 2017 compared with 2.5 million tons for the year-ago period. Average selling price, FOB plant, is expected to be in the range of $320-$350 per ton. The segment gross margin rate is expected to be in the upper single digit including an expected $9-million carry-over impact from Hurricane Irma.Potash sales volumes have been forecasted in the range of 1.9-2.2 million tons for the fourth quarter, compared with 2 million tons in the prior-year quarter. Average selling price, FOB plant, is expected in the band of $175 to $195 per ton and the gross margin rate is anticipated to be in the upper teens, reflecting an unfavorable impact of production mix and scheduled turnarounds during the quarter.Total sales volumes for the International Distribution segment are expected to range from 1.5-1.8 million tons for fourth-quarter 2017, compared with 1.9 million tons in the prior-year quarter. The segment gross margin is estimated to be around $20 per ton.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Mosaic for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1,886 million, reflecting an increase of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Phosphate segment is pegged at $940 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an estimated 20.7% rise from the third quarter. Segment sales volume is also expected to increase 15.8% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2.4 million tons for the fourth quarter. Potash segment’s net sales are expected to fall 5.5% sequentially in the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $448 million. A 7.1% decrease in sales volume is anticipated as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2.1 million tons for the fourth quarter. Net sales for Mosaic’s International Distribution segment for the fourth quarter is projected to witness a fall of 34.4% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $610 million. Segment sales volume is also expected to decline around 32.7% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 1.7 million tons for the fourth quarter.The company is well placed to gain from rising global demand for fertilizers. Moreover, the acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes will help the company to capitalize on the rapidly growing Brazilian agricultural market. The buyout is also expected to deliver significant synergies. Mosaic should also benefit from its cost-reduction measures and efforts to boost production capacity. Mosaic Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Mosaic Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Mosaic Company (The) Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mosaic is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Mosaic has an Earnings ESP of -3.77%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 26 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 27 cents.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Mosaic sports a Zacks Rank #1. Though a favorable rank increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Nexa Resources S.A. (NEXA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +17.5% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.

Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk.

1413,MOS,"Markets have enjoyed a strong and enduring rally for nearly all of 2017. Benchmarks have broken several milestones on multiple occasions and are on course to create new annual records. Year to date, the S&P 500 is up more than 20% and is on course to registering its highest gains in four years. Successively strong earnings numbers and robust economic growth have been the primary factors powering these gains.However, this extended market rally was not without its occasional losses. Lingering fears about inflated valuations have dogged stocks for some time now. Geopolitical concerns, particularly those related to North Korea also threatened to spoil the party on more than one occasion. Also, there was much hand wringing over the likelihood of tax cuts receiving legislative approval before they were finally signed into law last week.However, it is increasingly likely that the actions of the new administration will boost stocks further in the days ahead. In such a scenario, S&P 500 stocks which have failed to chalk up gains this year should also stand a chance. This is particularly true for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank, which are well placed to ride the continuing market rally in 2018.Factors which Acted as a Drag on 2017’s RallyEven though benchmarks are now close to notching up annual records, a variety of factors have threatened to end their long running rally. Concerns about inflated valuations, particularly relating to tech stocks, have had investors worried on more than one occasion. Even though such fears have yet to come true, they continue to persist to this day. Further, geopolitical concerns have also clouded market sentiment at times. Such worries were especially heightened during North Korea’s recent nuclear tests. Both South Korea and the U.S. government warned of a strong response during these events, leading to losses for stocks.Coming to specific sectors, energy stocks remained depressed over the year with the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) down 3.6% year to date. During the year, the OPEC and other major oil producers successfully adhered to an output control agreement which lent some support to oil prices. However, a step up in production by U.S. shale producers has led to the persistence of oversupply conditions.Further, traditional safe haven sectors have been largely ignored during the year, with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) up only 7.4% year to date. Instead, investors have favored high growth sectors such as technology in the quest for superlative gains. Industrywide changes have also acted as drags for specific stocks. For instance, the tendency to shop online has caused numerous store closures and created a near brick and mortar apocalypse.Can Tax Cuts, Infrastructure Spending Boost Gains in 2018?On last Friday, President Trump finally signed the much anticipated tax Bill into law.  The exact earnings impact of the tax legislation is yet to become clear, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11.8%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation. (Read: What Will the Q4 Earnings Season Bring?)And now that President Trump has scored his first major legislative victory, it is likely that he will press forward with another major issue on his agenda, infrastructure reforms. It is now widely expected that the Trump administration will announce a new infrastructure package in 2018.During his presidential campaign, Trump had promised to implement a $1 trillion infrastructure package. This plan was intended to improve the state of roads, airports and bridges as well as other public works across the country.Recently Trump has commented that his attempt to improve the country’s infrastructure will easily garner bipartisan support. The major obstacle to be overcome is related to funding and if that does happen, markets could receive yet another boost in the year ahead.5 Losers Set to Gain in 2018Even though stocks have notched up strong gains this year, some factors have acted as impediments to gains on several occasions. However, the projected impact of tax cuts and heightened prospects of a new infrastructure package are likely to sustain markets’ rally well into next year.This is why it makes good sense to bet on those S&P 500 stocks which have taken a beating this year but stand a good chance of notching up gains in 2018. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark. This led the stock to take a huge leap and outpace the industry in a month. Clearly, third-quarter results have given a fresh breath of life to the stock, which in the recent past had struggled on account of dismal performance in the preceding two quarters.Foot Locker has lost 33.3% year to date.

However, it has a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, expected earnings growth for the current year is more than 100%. PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) is poised to gain from its capital investment plan, which primarily focuses on infrastructure construction projects for generation, transmission and distribution.
