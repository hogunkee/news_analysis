"
25,PKG,"After staying on the sidelines of the megamerger game sweeping the paper and packaging industry the past few years, Packaging Corp. of America moved to center field with a major acquisition last October.
"
26,PKG,"By accounts since the deal, Packaging Corp. of America (PKG) — which is now on the IBD 50 list of top-rated growth stocks — hit a home run. And it's seeing more synergies than originally expected.
"
27,PKG,"PCA, as it's called for short, is the fourth-largest producer of containerboard and corrugated packaging product in the U.S. It paid $2.1 billion, including the fair value of assumed debt, for paper and packaging products maker Boise.
"
28,PKG,"The Boise buyout represents a departure for PCA, which historically had grown mainly organically and when it did buys they typically were only small, tuck-in acquisitions.
"
29,PKG,"PCA had not been a player in the multibillion dollar M&A wave that has consolidated its industry in recent years. Those deals included Rock-Tenn Co.'s (RKT) $3.5 billion takeover of Smurfit-Stone Container in 2011 and International Paper Co.'s (IP) acquisition of Temple-Inland in 2012 in a buy valued at $4.5 billion.
"
30,PKG,"The Boise buyout expands PCA's corrugated products' geographic reach and offerings, provides additional containerboard capacity for continued growth in the packaging business and offers opportunities in the white paper business, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The acquisition also gives a nice lift to revenue and profit as well as generating cost synergies.
"
31,PKG,"What The Business Contains
"
32,PKG,"PCA makes corrugated boxes used in everything from the basic boxes for moving and shipping to custom-printed containers and retail displays. It's also a big producer of packaging for meats, processed foods, and other industrial and consumer products.
"
33,PKG,"Boise's packaging products include linerboard, corrugated containers and sheets, and protective packaging. Its paper products include imaging papers, printing and converting papers, and papers used in packaging.
"
34,PKG,"On a September conference call announcing the deal, PCA Executive Chairman Paul Stecko called the buy a ""transformational opportunity with excellent fit and unique and substantial synergies.""
"
35,PKG,"The synergies, he said, would come primarily from: ""containerboard grade optimization and sales mix, manufacturing cost reduction, lower transportation cost, corrugated products optimization, and SG&A (selling, general and administrative) cost reductions.""
"
36,PKG,"At the time, PCA expected synergies from the deal of $105 million over the next three years, to be achieved at about $35 million per year. But on its Feb. 11 fourth-quarter conference call, PCA upped the synergy estimate to $175 million, at a run rate of $75 million to $80 million by the end of the first year.
"
37,PKG,"Actions taken immediately after the October 25 acquisition and completed by the end of the year included the elimination of about $25 million in overhead cost, primarily from reduced head count and lower corporate governance cost, the company said.
"
38,PKG,"PCA also paid down $150 million in debt since the acquisition by the end of the quarter.
"
39,PKG,"Vertical Research Partners analyst Chip Dillon calls the buyout a ""game changer.""
"
40,PKG,"""It shows that their disciplined approach toward acquisitions has proved to be a benefit to shareholders,"" he said. ""They waited for a great deal, not just an OK deal. They were able to hit the ball out of the park and buy something that will add 25% per year to their underlying EPS and free cash flow per share.""
"
41,PKG,"Savings From Synergies
"
42,PKG,"Morningstar analyst Todd Wenning says initially he had some concerns about PCA management having enough experience managing a paper business, because its focus has been on containerboard and the fact that North American office paper demand is in secular decline.
"
43,PKG,"""We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of cost synergies,"" he said. ""Once they got into the white paper mills they found they could apply some of the knowledge from their containerboard mills to Boise's paper mills. They believe they can achieve higher synergies than they initially expected from the deal.""
"
44,PKG,"The Boise acquisition, he adds, has also enabled PCA's stock price gains to outpace those of peers Rock-Tenn and International Paper.
"
45,PKG,"""Over the past year, the share price has been primarily driven by the effects of the Boise acquisition,"" he said. ""It's when the announcement happened that the share price really took off relative to International Paper and Rock-Tenn,"" Wenning said.
"
46,PKG,"In the fourth quarter Boise generated a partial quarter's contribution of 20 cents a share.
"
47,PKG,"Overall PCA posted a standout quarter, with earnings, excluding special items, up 70% to $1.04 a share where analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected just 89 cents. Net sales rose 72% to $1.264 billion, ahead of analyst estimates.
"
48,PKG,"PCA's corrugated products shipments were up 4.4% from a year earlier and increased 24% including Boise's partial quarter shipments. Containerboard production, including Boise, was 803,000 tons, up 151,000 tons from a year earlier.
"
49,PKG,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to post a 65% increase in earnings to $1.02 a share when it reports first-quarter results on April 23.
"
50,PKG,"They expect full-year 2014 earnings to rise 43% to $4.68 a share. They see a 16% gain in 2015.
"
51,PKG,"In a note following PCA's fourth-quarter results, Dillon wrote: ""We see Packaging Corp. of America as a strong story in 2014 and beyond based on the increasing contributions from the October 2013 acquisition of Boise Inc. One could argue that this deal is adding well over $1 a share in annualized accretion based simply on the first two months' results.
"
52,PKG,"""Ultimately, with management increasing the three-year synergy target to $175 million, we see Boise eventually adding more than $1.50 to PKG's per share earnings potential,"" he wrote.
"
53,PKG,"Combined with Boise, PCA maintains its position as the fourth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the U.S., and also becomes the third-largest maker of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. It operates eight paper mills and 98 corrugated products plants and related facilities.
"
54,PKG,"At the time the deal was announced, management said when combined with Boise, PCA's containerboard capacity would increase to 3.7 million tons from its then-current level of 2.6 million tons, or by 42%. PCA's corrugated products volume would increase by about 30% as a result of the acquisition, and PCA's market presence would expand into the Pacific Northwest, an area where it did not previously have a presence.
"
55,PKG,"The Paper Sector
"
56,PKG,"PCA has been ""outpacing the broader market, and incremental capacity from Boise will allow it to sustain that growth trajectory,"" Jefferies analyst Philip Ng said.
"
57,PKG,"""Things are moving sideways for the industry, and this acquisition has significant cost takeout opportunities,"" he adds. ""PKG is a good operator in terms of creating value and driving margins and improving profits.""
"
58,PKG,"Ng cites the fact that with the consolidation in the industry, a lot of customers are looking to diversify their supply base. PCA has been able to win new business because some of the bigger players have had to walk away from some of the smaller customers to get synergies, says Ng, while PCA has realized synergies from the acquisition.
"
59,PKG,"PCA is the third largest company by market cap in IBD's Paper & Paper Products industry group, after International Paper and Rock-Tenn. On a national level PCA's primary rivals are International Paper, Rock-Tenn and Georgia-Pacific.

"
223,PKG,"While other companies in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry have fattened up on buyouts over the last couple of years, Packaging Corp. of America has kept its focus on internal growth.Packaging Corp. (PKG), or PCA, is North America's fifth-largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products. It mainly serves the food, beverage, paper and agricultural markets.The company's products include protective packaging, multicolor boxes and retail merchandising displays. It has four containerboard mills and 69 box plants in 26 states and operates one business segment under the name Containerboard & Corrugated Containers.PCA has enjoyed steady if modest growth over the past few years. It logged 2012 revenue of $2.8 billion, which is 23% more than it delivered five years earlier.In contrast, Rock-Tenn (RKT), the second largest publicly traded company in the paper and paper products space, saw its annual revenue nearly quadruple to $9.2 billion from 2007 to 2012. Rock-Tenn's top line got a big boost from its 2011 acquisition of Smurfit-Stone Container for $3.5 billion.Another DealThat buyout was followed by another major deal last year involving International Paper (IP), the industry's biggest player with $27.8 billion in 2012 revenue.International Paper spent $4.5 billion to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple-Inland in a transaction that gave the combined firm more than one-third of the North American corrugated-packaging market.While those deals were going on, PCA put its focus where it usually does: on improving its own operations. That strategy has served the company well, analysts say.""Packaging Corp. of America benefits from a lean operational model and highly focused management,"" Citigroup analyst Anthony Pettinari noted. ""In an industry marked by value-destroying acquisitions, (PAC) management has been extremely judicious in capital deployment.""The question is how long PCA can sit on the sidelines as the industry's biggest players gain more size and leverage.PCA had a chance to add production capacity last summer when International Paper was forced to sell three U.S. containerboard mills to meet a Department of Justice settlement related to the Temple-Inland purchase. But PCA stayed out of the bidding.In a note, Morningstar said it was ""surprised"" PCA did not acquire one of those mills, but added the decision not to ""underscores PCA's desire to remain a small and efficient operator.""""For more than a decade, (PCA) has maintained only a single-digit share of the U.S. containerboard market, but has exploited its small size by being nimble and focused solely on containerboard,"" Morningstar said.One benefit of the strategy is that PCA has produced more consistent profit growth than its larger rivals in recent years.PCA has posted earnings gains in nine of the last 12 quarters. That compares to six times each for International Paper and Rock-Tenn over the same time frame.All containerboard and corrugated product companies face a multitude of potential head winds.They operate in a highly cyclical industry and can be negatively impacted by economic slumps, bad weather and rising raw materials prices.Lately, the industry has dealt with rising costs by trying to pass along higher prices to customers.On Feb. 21, it was reported that Georgia-Pacific, a containerboard supplier owned by Koch Industries, plans to raise its price for containerboard by $50 a ton this Spring.The increase would move the benchmark price for containerboard to around $740 a ton.Not coincidentally, the day that news was announced the 25 stocks in IBD's paper and paper products group rose 1.7%. PCA's stock price climbed more than 4%. The company's shares have been on a steady rise since early June and touched a record high of 42.46 on Feb. 25.A similar industrywide price hike was instituted last summer. Although there's always a risk that customers will cut down on their orders when faced with higher prices, Packaging Corp. seems to have weathered last year's hike well enough.Higher prices helped PCA grow Q4 sales 13% from the prior year to $736.6 million. It was the company's first double-digit revenue gain in nearly two years.Mill UpgradesMeanwhile, PCA's bottom line has gotten a lift from efforts to upgrade two of its mills so they are more energy and cost-efficient.In a note, D.A. Davidson analyst Steven Chercover said PCA's 2012 EBITDA margin of 21.9% ""is believed to be a record and should compete for best in class in the industry.""PCA reported fourth-quarter earnings of 61 cents a share, up 53% from the prior year but a penny shy of consensus views. However, the company's quarterly revenue easily surpassed views.Corrugated product shipments during Q4 climbed 5.8% per workday, while total shipments increased 7.6%. Containerboard production rose by 12,000 tons to 652,500.On Jan. 14, PCA raised its annual dividend by 25% to $1.25 per share.""In addition to being best in class from an operational standpoint, the company is rock solid from a financial standpoint, with a conservative balance sheet and track record of returning excess capital to shareholders,"" Chercover said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect PCA to grow earnings 34% this year and 15% in 2014.

487,PKG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Packaging Corporation of America (PKG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE Ratio    A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Packaging Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.7. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Packaging Corporation’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Packaging Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Packaging Corporation stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Packaging Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.PKG is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Packaging Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Packaging Corporation a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Packaging Corporation is just 1.8, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.1. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, PKG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Packaging Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A. This gives PKG a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen six upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 5.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Packaging Corporation of America Price and Consensus  Packaging Corporation of America Price and Consensus | Packaging Corporation of America QuoteEven though Packaging Corporation has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePackaging Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. With a formidable industry rank (among the Top 25%), Packaging Corporation looks like a strong value contender. In fact, over the past three years, the industry has marginally outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

488,PKG,"Sonoco Products Company (SON  -  Free Report) has entered into an agreement to acquire Highland Packaging Solutions for approximately $150 million in cash. The deal will further strengthen its thermoforming business and increase presence in the fast-growing fresh perimeter of grocery stores. Plant City, FL-based, privately owned Highland Packaging is a producer of thermoformed plastic packaging for fresh produce and dairy products. It has a global reach and generated net sales of approximately $90 million in 2017. The company from its world-class production facility in Plant City produces total packaging solutions for customers which includes sophisticated engineered containers, flexographic printed labels and inventory management through distribution warehouses in the Southeast and West Coast of the United States. Its products include clear, thermoformed hinged/lidded containers made from PET (Polyethylene terephthalate). A Brief History of the Deal The acquisition will be accretive to earnings in 2018. The purchase price represents an EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.5 times post-synergies and tax benefits from the write-up of intangibles. The deal, pursuant to normal regulatory review, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. On completion, Highland Packaging’s financial results will be reported within Sonoco’s Consumer Packaging segment and the business will be operated as part of Sonoco’s global plastics operations. Multiple Benefits for Sonoco The acquisition will expand Sonoco’s thermoforming capabilities and capacity. Highland Packaging caters to the fresh produce primarily strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, tomatoes, grapes and eggs. Demand for thermoformed packaging used for berries, fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, salad, whole fruit and bakery/confectionary products is estimated to be around $1.3 billion. Sonoco will foray into egg packaging through this deal. It is a growing market as egg is gaining importance as protein source in North America. In 2014, eggs consumption per person was at around 170 which is expected to grow up to more than 200 eggs in 2021. Notably, the global egg packaging market was valued at $4.2 billion in 2016 and is expected to reach $5.35 billion in 2021 — a CAGR of 4.96%. The acquisition is also in sync with Sonoco’s Perimeter of the Store strategy, which capitalizes on the consumers’ growing demand for fresh and natural foods. Te perimeter of grocery stores, where fresh food is typically displayed is gaining consumer popularity. Fresh fruit and fresh vegetables dominate their respective categories outselling their shelf-stable and frozen center-store alternatives by a wide margin and also generate around 38% of store sales. Sonoco’s focus on this market is a wise move as perimeter store sales of fresh foods are anticipated to grow 15% in the 2012-2017 period. Previous Acquisitions of Similar Space In March 2017, Sonoco acquired another thermoformer Peninsula Packaging Company for $230 million. Peninsula Packaging manufactures thermoformed packaging for a wide range of whole fresh fruits, pre-cut fruits and produce, prepared salad mixes, as well as baked goods in retail supermarkets from five manufacturing facilities, including four in the United States and one in Mexico. This deal nearly doubled Sonoco’s thermoforming business. The company continues to make strategic acquisitions primarily aimed at its targeted growth areas of thermoforming, flexibles and protective packaging, along with select consolidating industrial opportunities primarily in emerging markets.   In the past year, Sonoco has underperformed the industry it belongs to. Sonoco has dipped 13% while the industry witnessed growth of 6%. In the past few years, consumer packaging volumes have been flat to down as consumers' preference for packaged food is clearly being impacted by changing taste for more fresh and natural products. Focused growth on packaging for fresh and natural products will subsequently provide a lift to its share price. Zacks Rank & Other Key Picks Sonoco currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR  -  Free Report), Berry Global Group, Inc. (BERY  -  Free Report) and Packaging Corporation of America (PKG  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2.

491,PKG,"On Mar 15, we issued an updated research report on Greif, Inc. (GEF  -  Free Report). The company is poised to benefit from rising demand, favorable price-cost relationship and favorable impact of the U.S. tax reform. However, escalating raw material costs and elevated expenses are expected to dampen results.Let’s illustrate these growth factors in detail.Greif to Gain From Rising DemandGreif maintained its adjusted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2018 at $3.25-$3.55. The company is expected to benefit in the fiscal from strong demand as a result of improving global macroeconomic conditions and favorable access to credit. In addition, the company’s proposed infrastructure and planned chemical expansion projects will drive growth.Benefits of Tax ReformGreif currently anticipates additional financial flexibility as a result of the tax reform changes regarding cash repatriation. The company expects the tax rate will be between 28% and 32% for fiscal 2018, lower than the 33.5% recorded in fiscal 2017. It expects that the legislation will be beneficial for Greif over the long term.Favorable Price-Cost Relationship a CatalystGreif anticipates that its Paper Packaging & Services segment will benefit from a more favorable price-cost relationship. In fiscal 2018, the segment will likely benefit from realized containerboard price increases, implemented over the course of fiscal 2017, and elevated anticipated specialty sales. High customer demand and exceptional mill production rates also remain tailwinds for this segment’s growth.Adverse Impact of Rising Raw Material CostsGreif witnessed a 24% increase in raw material cost per steel drum and 11% rise in raw material cost per large plastic drum in first-quarter fiscal 2018, both compared with the prior-year quarter. Moreover, the company will be affected by the persistent raw-material cost inflation in the rest of fiscal 2018.Elevated Expenses to Mar ProfitGreif has increased its other expense outlook for fiscal 2018 to $15-$20 million from the previously projected $10 million due to increased pension cost related to a change in investment return assumptions. This increase will impact earnings by 8 cents per share in this fiscal.Share Price PerformanceGreif’s shares have underperformed the industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has depreciated 5.6%, as against 8.7% growth registered by the industry.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderGreif currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are AptarGroup, Inc.

493,PKG,"On Mar 7, we issued an updated research report on Crown Holdings Inc. (CCK  -  Free Report). The company is expected to benefit from geographic expansion of its beverage can lines which will aid it to capitalize on the rise in global beverage can demand. However, raw material inflation and competition from producers of alternative packaging remain headwinds. Q4 Results Rise Y/Y The leading global manufacturer of packaging products for consumer goods delivered fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 79 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and recorded an improvement of 11.3% on a year-over-year basis. Net sales in the quarter rose 12.7% year over year to $2,168 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,034 million. Sales growth was driven by improved global beverage can volumes, food and aerosol can volumes, as well as the pass through of higher material costs to customers and favorable impact of currency translation. Upbeat Guidance Crown Holdings initiated adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range of $4.30-$4.50 for full-year 2018, reflecting 9% year-over-year growth at the mid-point. It also projects first-quarter 2018 earnings per share in the range of 75-85 cents, flat year over year at the mid-point. Investment in Capacity Will Help Meet Growing Demand Crown Holdings is anticipated to gain from a rise in global beverage can demand. Beverage can volume has continued to grow in emerging markets driven by increased per capita incomes and consumption. Mature economies in Europe and North America have also witnessed market expansion led by growth of beverages such as energy drinks, teas, juices, sparkling waters and craft beer. With its many inherent benefits, including being infinitely recyclable, the beverage can continues to become the increasingly preferred package for marketers and consumers globally. To meet growing demand, the company intends to build new facilities and is positioned to gain from the geographic expansion of its beverage can lines. In 2017, it started operating a two-line beverage can plant in Nichols, NY, converted a second beverage can line in Custines, France from steel to aluminum and completed the expansion of the beverage can capacity in Columbia. The company also commenced a one-line beverage can facility in Jakarta, Indonesia and added a second production line to its Danang, Vietnam beverage can plant. In January 2018, the new glass facility in Chihuahua, Mexico started operations, ahead of schedule, to cater to the expanding beer market in the northern part of the country. With this investment, Crown Holdings is foraying into glass operations in Mexico. A new beverage can plant is being built in Yangon, Myanmar, which is anticipated to commence production in the second quarter of 2018. A new two-line beverage can facility in Valencia, Spain is slated to start operation during the fourth quarter. Crown Holdings will construct a third beverage can line at its existing plant in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Pending Signode Acquisition to Fuel Growth In December 2017, Crown Holdings agreed to acquire Signode Industrial Group Holdings — a unit of The Carlyle Group for $3.91 billion. This acquisition will add a portfolio of premier transit and protective packaging franchises to Crown Holdings’ metal packaging business and significantly boost free cash flow. Signode's products supply critical in-transit protection to high value, high volume goods across a number of end-markets, including metals, food and beverage, corrugated, construction and agriculture, among others. High Debt Levels a Concern Crown Holdings’ debt-to-capitalization ratio remains high at 85%. This is a concerning factor as it could restrict the company from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities, including any planned expansion in emerging markets. Further, higher interest expenses will continue to thwart margins. Raw Material Inflation to Dent Margins The prices of certain raw materials utilized by the company, such as steel, aluminum and processed energy, have historically been subject to volatility. In 2017, consumption of steel and aluminum represented 21% and 42% of its consolidated cost of products sold, respectively. Signode, which will become its subsidiary following the completion of the acquisition, also uses steel and materials derived from crude oil and natural gas, such as polyethylene and polypropylene resins. The company may not be able to pass through the increase in raw materials costs to its customers, without suffering loss in unit volume, revenues and operating income. Constant Threat from Alternate Packaging Manufacturers Crown Holdings faces substantial competition from producers of alternative packaging made from glass, paper, flexible materials and plastic. Further, Signode which will become a subsidiary after the acquisition faces substantial competition from many regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products. Signode products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including other products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal.  Crown Holdings has underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year. Its shares have dipped 5% while the industry gained 6%. Crown Holdings currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Mobile Mini, Inc. (MINI  -  Free Report), AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR  -  Free Report) and Packaging Corporation of America (PKG  -  Free Report). While Mobile Mini flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), AptarGroup and Packaging Corporation of America carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Net sales increased primarily due to a 7.5% increase in selling prices on its primary products as a result of strategic pricing decisions and increases in index prices. Adjusted operating profit dropped 20% year over year to $34.7 million from $43.4 million due to raw material cost inflation, the timing of contractual pass through arrangements, a temporary winter slowdown and an increase in transportation costs. Paper Packaging: Sales for the segment were up 11% year over year to $204 million, driven by increase in selling prices owing to improvement in published containerboard pricing and increased sales of specialty products. The segment reported operating profit of $27.9 million, up 40% year over year aided by higher containerboard prices and lower old corrugated container input costs, partially offset by an increase in transportation costs. Flexible Products & Services: Sales from this segment rose 15% year over year to $80 million primarily due to strategic pricing decisions, product mix and higher volumes.

501,PKG,"Packaging Corporation of America (PKG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jan 30.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Notably, Packaging Corporation’s earnings have surpassed estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Packaging Corporation’s fourth-quarter results are anticipated to benefit from strong demand, price increases and the DeRidder mill improvement despite seasonally lower volumes and hurricane-related impacts.

Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the company’s EPS is pegged at $1.51 for fourth-quarter 2017, marking 22.8% improvement year over year.In the Paper segment, the company has started implementing the recently-announced price increases, which will aid margin performance in the quarter to be reported. Our consensus estimates indicate that sales of Packaging Corporation’s Paper segment will reach $253 million in the to-be-reported quarter, flat year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for segment operating income is pegged at $15.8 million for the quarter, representing an year over year decline of 56%.The Packaging segment, which generates around 82% of the company’s revenues, recorded sales growth of around 15% and segment EBITDA increment of roughly 33% in the third quarter.

506,PKG,"Will the U.S. economy be able to safeguard its position as the largest in the world? Maybe not, as a few studies show that China might overtake the United States before 2030. While one cannot be definite about the time frame, China is already at war with the leading economy in the energy space.Reportedly, China and Russia are no longer willing to engage in oil trading denominated in the petrodollar. Instead, China intends to trade crude in the yuan and wants to open up a platform for trading oil futures in the currency.Now, the question that looms large is whether major crude exporters will choose to accept payments in the yuan, no doubt irking the United States in the process.China's Stance Against the PetrodollarChina has displaced the United States as the largest oil importer in the world, according to Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. Beijing is now in a position to control global demand for oil, which is arguably the largest traded commodity on the planet.Weinberg added that Beijing will force major oil exporters to accept the yuan in place of the dollar for oil trading. Per data provided by global research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie, China imports 26.5% of crude from Saudi Arabia – the largest exporter of the commodity.Thus, it is almost impossible for the Saudis to turn down China’s offer of accepting payments in the yuan. Weinberg believes that if Saudi Arabia agrees on the same, exporters will also dump the dollar as the reserve currency of the world.Reportedly, China is planning to unveil an Asian crude yardstick by creating a yuan-denominated oil futures contract that will be backed by gold. This might compel leading crude producers to accept payments in the yuan.Dollar Decline Could Boost U.S. JobsMore yuan transactions may end up lowering the demand for the dollar, eventually leading to the dollar's lower overall value. Ultimately, imports will be pricier for the United States, but exports will be cheaper.With a weaker dollar, activity in manufacturing and production plants in the United States will increase as the cost of production abroad will be relatively expensive. Also, there will be more jobs in the U.S. markets which will directly boost the economy.Major multinational U.S. firms with extensive global presence stand to gain from the conversion of other currencies into the weaker dollar as well.Manufacturing Stocks to BenefitGrowth in manufacturing sector employment will indirectly support President Trump’s electoral promises. During his campaign, the president had promised to create jobs in the manufacturing industry.Thus, picking manufacturing stocks seems to be a smart option now, but choosing the right stocks is quite a daunting task.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy.

The improvement in sales was driven by higher selling prices, largely stemming from rising raw material prices, sales added from acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign exchange.Sonoco Products Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sonoco Products Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sonoco Products Company QuoteCost of sales came in at $1.07 billion, up 10.3% year on year. Gross profit during the quarter totaled $250.9 million, up 6.6% year over year. Gross margin contracted 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.9%, hurt by higher raw material and other operating costs.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $130.3 million, up 7.2% year over year, chiefly due to acquisition-related costs and wage inflation. Sonoco’s adjusted operating income was $120.6 million in the quarter, up 6% from $113.8 million in the prior-year quarter.

For the nine-month period ended Oct 1, 2017, the company’s cash flow from operations dropped to $282 million from $348.7 million in the prior-year comparable period. At third-quarter end, long-term debt was approximately $1.3 billion, up from $1.02 billion at the end of 2016.At the end of the reported quarter, the company had a total debt-to-capital ratio of 44.8% compared with 40.4% at Dec 31, 2016. The increase in the debt and debt ratio are primarily due to the $230-million acquisition of Peninsula Packaging in March 2017 and the $170-million acquisition of Clear Lam Packaging in July 2017.GuidanceFor 2017, Sonoco raised its earnings per share guidance to the range of $2.75-$2.81 from the prior range of $2.73-$2.80. Compared with the earnings of $2.72 per share in 2016, the mid-point of the guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 2.2%.For fourth-quarter 2017, the company projects earnings per share in the range of 68-74 cents. This guidance takes into consideration the impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and higher recovered paper prices during the fourth quarter. Compared with the prior-year quarter’s earnings per share of 62 cents, the mid-point of the guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 14.5%.Sonoco remains aligned on implementing its Grow and Optimize strategy. The company remains focused on targeted acquisitions and development of new products, particularly focused on serving consumer demand for more fresh and healthy foods in the faster-growing perimeter of the store. It also sees opportunities to consolidate industrial-related markets and further optimize portfolio. Sonoco is trying to improve its operating structure to drive margin expansion.Sonoco expects higher resin prices during the quarter which will likely be a headwind for the polymer-based packaging businesses. Thus, the company is implementing price hikes and projects contractual cost-recovery mechanisms to ultimately offset current cost increases.On the other hand, recovered paper prices have dropped entering into the fourth quarter, which will likely help its paper-based businesses to recover from the previous raw material inflation. Also the recent storms’ impact remains a concern for the fourth-quarter performance as well. The storms could impact consumers’ buying habits. Sonoco remains cautiously optimistic regarding demand for its diverse mix of packaging products through the rest of the year.In the last year, Sonoco has underperformed the industry it belongs to.

508,PKG,"In the latest sign that U.S. manufacturing is in fine fettle, the New York Federal Reserve’s Empire State manufacturing index hit its highest level in three years during the month of October. A raft of recently released data also serves to indicate that the manufacturing sector has performed particularly well this year.The reasons for the boom in the sector are not hard to seek.
